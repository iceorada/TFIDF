<DH>STUPID WHITE MEN ... and Other Sorry Excuses for the State
of the Nation!, By Michael Moore, Regan Books/HarperCollins: 304 pp.,
$24.95</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his less hyperventilated moments, Michael Moore knows that "stupid
white men" are not responsible for what disgusts him. They--the "gang
of geezers" who Moore believes run the country--are far from stupid,
increasingly go well beyond what is generally considered to be
"white" and are even superficially redressing the superficialities of
gender imbalance.</LD>
<LD>   You will quickly see, if you graze very deeply into "Stupid White
Men," that what really gets Moore's ample undies hysterically
bunched, page after page, is not intelligence, ethnicity or genital
structure, but power.</LD>
<LD>   Moore is not without a certain power himself. Mostly it's the
power to be in the right place at the right time and publicize the
result. This is the guy whose version of how and why he was rapidly
dismissed as editor of Mother Jones took on a not-necessarily-true
life of its own. The guy whose breakthrough film "Roger &amp; Me" rested
on a conceit (the alleged unwillingness of the then-head of General
Motors to be interviewed) that may or may not have been true. The guy
who bravely tells tales to get access to people and areas where
access would normally be denied to enliven (or even make possible)
his very uncommercial TV product, yet keep it full of yuks enough to
get it, however marginally, on commercial TV.</LD>
<TE>   And now, behind "Stupid White Men" comes a tale (not included in
the book, because it was printed and temporarily mothballed in the
wake of Sept. 11) of how its publication was delayed by political
timidity on the part of the Rupert Murdoch-owned publisher now making
money from it as it heads just about every bestseller list. The
problem with giving the book a straight reading now is that the same
powers Moore decries for their policies of personal and planetary
devastation have now raised the post-Sept. 11 ante.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to find very many folks, for example, still feeling
daily outrage at the way George W. Bush became president, one of
Moore's obsessions. Equally difficult would be a search among our
fellow citizens for people whose world view is not at least partially
defined by a lingering image of the World Trade Center imploding on
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything" did not change after Sept. 11, as some wags would
have it, but enough did so that trenchant, even satirical, social
criticism has to keep that ghastly date and its continuing fallout in
mind. And Moore, whose book was completed before then, of necessity,
cannot.</TE>
<TE>   But inevitably, irreverence will come to have an audience again.
And perhaps the large audiences at Moore's book tour appearances and
the fact that he's ahead of the now usual gaggle of right-wing
polemicists in sales is a milestone in that process.</TE>
<TE>   There has been an unnatural imbalance in bestsellerdom for many
months now, with Bill O'Reilly, Pat Buchanan, Peggy Noonan, Bernard
Goldberg and their ilk taking over where once more liberal (although
rarely progressive) authors prospered.</TE>
<TE>   And after all, what could be more popular than one-liner studded
populism from a top-down guy like Moore, who "loves this big lug of a
country, and all the people in it"? What he emphatically doesn't love
is economic inequality, racism, environmental pollution, unjust
incarceration and the rest of a laundry list that might have been
taken from the Green Party's 2000 platform.</TE>
<TE>   If you're on his side, you already know most, if not all, of this.
Although even then "Stupid White Men" may cheer you up, as it
contains abundant documentation to back up Moore's predilections. If
you're not on his side, or know someone who isn't, you may well find
"Stupid White Men" a useful tool to change minds, though hardly a
fulcrum strong enough to change the system in which Moore believes so
many minds are trapped. After all, his publisher, the Murdoch
tentacle known as Regan Books, also offers Robert Bork, Howard Stern
and Bo Derek. And, if "Stupid White Men" sells enough copies, we can
look forward to an inevitable sequel ("Cowboys in Camo")? There will
surely be no end of raw material. Just look at the other sections of
this newspaper if you need proof.</TE>

<HD>Three Questions for Michael Moore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Your book is selling better than Stephen King and John
Grisham, and there are now more than 400,000 copies in print without
benefit of any robust publicity campaign. How do you explain the
book's success?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: After six months of being told that dissent at this time
is "unpatriotic," that questioning the leader is "inappropriate" and
that they had better "watch what you say, watch what you do," I think
people are tired of being told that they can't be Americans. Because,
what is more American than the right to freely dissent? Many have
found that by remaining silent, the guy in the Oval Office has been
given carte blanche to get away with whatever (tax cuts for the rich,
ducking Enron) he wants.</LD>
<LD>   Q: America's political culture since 9/11 is said by some to be
conservative, jingoistic and hunkered-down. If this is the case, why
is your book selling so well?</LD>
<TE>   A: Because, contrary to the mantra in the media, this is not a
conservative country. Fifty-eight percent say they support labor
unions; 63% consider themselves pro-choice on some level. More than
80% support equal pay for women and nearly 90% favor laws that
protect the environment. The truth is that the majority of Americans
are very liberal when it comes to the "issues." The disconnect occurs
when they realize there are no real liberal leaders with the guts and
the courage of their convictions to stand up for what the people
want. So the majority of Americans end up either not voting or stuck
in a voting booth with incredibly rancid choices. I'm encouraging
everyone who reads my book to, when they're done, send it to their
congressmen with a note saying, "Just thought you'd like to see what
Americans are reading this week."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been an angry white guy for a while now. Isn't it hard
to keep it up?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, it is. And I would like another job. Here's an idea--how
'bout yous guys in the media showing a little righteous anger at what
is happening, quit regurgitating the spin you are being fed by
corporate and political hacks, and I'll stop all this ranting and go
to work as a greeter at Sizzler. Seems like a fair trade!</TE>

<LD>RHAPSODY IN PLAIN YELLOW</LD>
<LD>   By Marilyn Chin</LD>
<LD>   W.W. Norton: 128 pp., $22</LD>
<TE>   Like a whirling acrobat-musician from the Peking Opera--sounding
brass gongs and blue ululations of joy and melancholy--Marilyn Chin
lands blazing before us with "Rhapsody in Plain Yellow." It's
difficult to describe a book this ambitious in style and syncopation.
"Rhapsody" casts its irreverent gaze on shifting landscapes of love
and lamentation. The title poem (which mocks, we are told, the
ancient "fu" form, characterized by long poetic exposition) holds
nothing back:</TE>
<TE>   And you, relentless Sinophile,</TE>
<TE>   holding my long hair, my frayed dreams,</TE>
<TE>   My turn to objectify you</TE>
<TE>   the lunatic, the lover, the poet....</TE>
<TE>   We hear a much quieter voice in the quasi-elegiac "That Half Is
Almost One":</TE>
<TE>   In my thirtieth year</TE>
<TE>   I wrote a letter to my mother</TE>
<TE>   I had forgotten the character for "love." I remember vaguely</TE>
<TE>   the radical "heart."</TE>
<TE>   This radical heart beats in polyphony in the poems, addressing Li
Po, Emily Dickinson and others in "talking blues," dirge, psalm and
dance beat. A mother and grandmother are mourned, destiny questioned,
nostalgia courted and exiled, as the cumulative effect of Chin's
dazzling longing creates a past that becomes essential to our
understanding of her elliptical and passionately insistent poetic
statement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SLEEPING WITH THE DICTIONARY</TE>
<TE>   By Harryette Mullen</TE>
<TE>   University of California Press:</TE>
<TE>   98 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping With the Dictionary" is another exuberant book, though
its high spirits are more avant-garde. Mullen's voice is insouciant,
parodic and, at times (in contrast to its general clever jocularity),
a little uncarbonated.</TE>
<TE>   Poetic expression here springs from a formal device, a game, a
premeditated romp: a little like the Muse playing Scrabble. Mullen
employs acrostics, anagrams, parodies, homophones, echolalia and
puns. The politics of language and dialect provide Mullen's major
themes, though this sounds deadly (as does her announced manipulation
of Roget's Thesaurus and the American Heritage Dictionary). Yet she
gets the whole contraption, (note the fast anagrams here, for
example, "Tokyo," "OK toy") to shimmy and fizz:</TE>
<TE>   El Nino brought a typhoon of tom-tom's from Tokyo, where</TE>
<TE>   a thrilling instrument makes an OK toy. Tiny violins are</TE>
<TE>   shrill.</TE>
<TE>   And in slo-mo, emotional but punning detail:</TE>
<TE>   This dream is not a map.</TE>
<TE>   A poem is not the territory.</TE>
<TE>   The dreamer reclines in a barber shop</TE>
<TE>   carpeted with Afro turf.</TE>
<TE>   In the dark some soul yells.</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping With the Dictionary" may be lexicon lust, but it's no
one-night stand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUBTERRANEAN</TE>
<TE>   By Jill Bialosky</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 96 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   Jill Bialosky's "Subterranean" (though filled with plangent
importunings directed to the god of sudden change, requesting
amnesty) offers a solid presence. The poems have a stately bearing.
Love and death are given their usual enshrinement, but not in the
abstract. A child crunches Cheerios in these poems; Quaaludes and
Barbies co-habit comfortably. In the poems' architecture, long and
short lines also cohabit. An example of the latter:</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, desire gone,</TE>
<TE>   no longer essential.</TE>
<TE>   Not touch, perhaps one luxury--</TE>
<TE>   memory to sustain her.</TE>
<TE>   As the title suggests, the world examined by these poems lies just
below the surface of the quotidian and that world (always sensed,
rarely acknowledged) is full of peril and passion. Everything here is
seen as though under a magnifying glass in harrowing, gorgeous
detail.</TE>

<HD>A Man in Full</HD>
<DH>A Biographer's Encounter With the Radical Legacy of Martin
Luther King Jr.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARSHALL FRADY</AU>
<BD>Marshall Frady is the author of, most recently, "Martin
Luther King, Jr."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what has become an annual rite by now marking the anniversary of
his birth, once again last January the nation passed through myriad
ceremonies of remembrance of Martin Luther King Jr. But the
anniversary this week of his slaying, on that April twilight in
Memphis 34 years ago, prompts a certain additional melancholy: In all
the public commemorations now of King's life and ministry, so little
is remembered of the personal reality of the man himself and what he
had more largely begun to undertake when he was struck down. It's
almost as if, after Memphis, he came to undergo a second kind of
death, one of a circumspect forgetting.</LD>
<LD>   It's not as if there hasn't since gathered a voluminous billowing
of memoirs, commentary, biographies about King, which do hold,
implicit in their compendious accumulations of circumstance, the
elemental arc and motif of his life. Yet in a peculiar, perversely
persistent disconnect between the word and the world, the public
sense of King has remained reverently oblivious to the true thematic
and dramatic heartbeats of his story.</LD>
<TE>   To begin with, King was always a far more complexly dimensioned
being, harrowed by self doubts and woes over what he felt were
personal betrayals of the high morality of his mass struggle--more
welteringly human and thus more heroic--than the weightless and
gilded effigy his pop-sanctification has turned him into. In that
beatification, we have lost an immensely important understanding:
What the full-bodied reality of King should tell us is how in fact
mysteriously mixed, in what excruciatingly convoluted and sometimes
shockingly flawed forms, our great moral protagonists often come to
us.</TE>
<TE>   But another sort of selective amnesia has set into the
celebrations of King's ministry. The acclaim, the national tributes,
have had the effect of ghettoizing him to only his importance to the
black experience in this country. In fact, King became not simply a
momentous figure in the history of African Americans, but ranged on
in his last years to become, more sweepingly, a tragic-heroic prophet
to the whole of the American community. That King, a strikingly more
radical figure whose message and mission would be no less unsettling
in this time than it was then to the prevailing social order, has
been mostly edited out of general memory by comfortably consigning
him, in the homages to him, to only his racial significance.</TE>
<TE>   That realization, I must allow, did not fully emerge for me until
somewhat recently, even though, having first encountered King in 1964
while a raw young apprentice correspondent in Newsweek's Atlanta
bureau, I have in a way been writing about him ever since, in writing
about his effects on the South, on figures such as George Wallace,
Jimmy Carter and Jesse Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   But three years ago, I turned to face him directly and frontally
for a concentrated biography (one in the series of short lives of
cultural and historic figures published since 1999 by Lipper/Viking
Penguin). And it wasn't until undertaking that compacted narrative,
while mining deeply from the vast lode of other writing about
King--particularly Taylor Branch's masterwork "Parting the
Waters"--that the fundamental dramatic pattern to his life, somewhat
submerged in the more profusely detailed biographies, leapt into
compelling clarity.</TE>
<TE>   There were in fact two great halves to King's story. In the first,
King emerged as the galvanizing Moses-like figure of the moral
pageantry of the civil rights movement in the South during the '50s
and '60s. And it's of course for his heroic apostleship in that
struggle from Montgomery to Selma that he is now quite fittingly
honored--its emancipation of a long-subjugated people not only
legally but psychically, and its astonishing transfiguration of the
everyday life of the South that ensued, all likely impossible without
King's transcendent nonviolent gospel.</TE>
<TE>   But King did not proceed directly from Selma to that motel balcony
in Memphis on that spring dusk in 1968. In the second half of his
ministry, he moved out beyond the South in a magnifying, yet more
revolutionary mission to re-create the conscience of the whole
nation. Through the same nonviolent mass protests that had remade the
South, he meant now to confront America's custodial complex of power,
both corporate and governmental, in a grand Gandhian campaign to
compel a "moral reconstruction" of the country's entire social estate
that would deliver not only its black citizens but the poor and
discarded of all American society. It became a movement to humanize
the nation's policies, both at home and abroad, through nothing less
than "a revolution of values," as he proclaimed, declaring that, "a
radical redistribution of power must take place." Indeed, his old,
pathological, carbuncular antagonist J. Edgar Hoover was not far
wrong when he fumed that King had become "the most dangerous man in
America."</TE>
<TE>   This new mission was an altogether different proposition from
simply according constitutional rights to Southern blacks. His close
confidant Stanley Levison warned him that such an amplification of
his gospel militancy was almost certain to affront even his coalition
of supporters outside the South, most of whom were still only "for
moderate change ... without excessive upheavals" and that King could
well wind up only "the leader of a fringe group." King threw himself
against all those forbidding prospects anyway.</TE>
<TE>   What he wanted to bring about, to start with, was a
multibillion-dollar federal initiative to completely erase poverty
from the land. It would include a national program to assure full
employment, a guaranteed minimum income for all households. A
comprehensive Marshall Plan to salvage America's inner cities. He
pondered, as well, calling for the nationalization of the country's
essential public services and industries: power, transportation, its
communications systems. Privately, he notified one assembly of aides
that they must begin "making demands that will cost the nation
something," demands addressing not just racial but "class issues"
because "something is wrong with the economic system of our country
... wrong with capitalism." Having always mistrusted the conscience
of capitalism anyway, he proposed, "Call it what you may, call it
democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a
better distribution of wealth within this country for all God's
children."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he had come to feel caught in a race against a
progressive deadening of America's heart, a dulling of conscience
being worked, as he saw it, by the advance of a new sort of bland,
technotronic, corporate totalitarianism, acting in conjunction with
the huge machineries of government, that was indifferently visiting a
measureless vandalism on the lives of individuals not only in America
but elsewhere in the world. In a sense, King wound up pitting himself
against his very age.</TE>
<TE>   But in this, King had pitched himself against a vast power field
of interests that lacked the simple, guttural palpability of a Bull
Connor or George Wallace, in a struggle without the passionate moral
clarity of the Southern movement. It became like trying to grapple
with a vaguely malign smog. Its first major engagement in Chicago,
where he launched a campaign against the city's labyrinthine patterns
of housing apartheid, turned out a woeful misfire. In truth, from
Chicago on throughout the rest of this second half of his ministry,
he had not one real success. Soon turning his evangelism against the
Vietnam War--at a time when there was still considerable support in
the country for that military exploit--he received a wholesale
scourging from a once-sympathetic press, and many of his backers in
the nation's liberal establishment, and even within the movement
itself, began to fall away from him. It's hard to remember at this
remove of time how his moral pentacostalisms after Selma appalled,
scandalized, outraged the conventional political sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   But he had now passed into that far and solitary country of all
true prophets ultimately, reaching beyond the nominally enlightened,
the standard civic respectability. Even so, he shortly set about
mobilizing the most expansively radical adventure of his life, the
Poor People's Campaign. It was to have masses of America's
marginalized citizens converge on Washington, with an encampment on
the Washington Mall, from which "major dislocations" would be mounted
to "cripple the organization of an oppressive government" to force
"unwilling authorities to yield to the mandates of justice." Even as
the Poor People's Campaign began hopelessly floundering, though, and
despite all the other confoundments in this national expansion of his
ministry, King's messianic vision only seemed to reel out ever wider
to embrace, finally, the world, all the Earth's cruelty and grief.
What he really seemed to want in the end was to actually re-create
the moral nature of the human community everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   But since the rifle crack in that April dusk, it has become the
King of the first half of his apostleship, those years from
Montgomery to Selma, who is revered and commemorated with parades,
memorial concerts, parks and schools and freeways named for him, his
birthday a national holiday. In the process, the King of that last
climactic half of his story has largely been etherized from memory.
But that second, audaciously wider campaign was as profoundly in the
prophetic tradition of quickening the conscience of a people,
troubling the comfortable moral sleep of the land--and with it, King
entered full into a tragic-heroic magnitude in almost the classic
literary Promethean sense.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years since then, though, it's as if the society at
large, which would be no less discomfited by the passions and
preachments of that second King, has managed, by consenting to allot
African Americans an officially celebrated national figure of their
own, to safely relegate King to merely his relevance as a black
figure. The result is that we have wound up honoring King by halving
him. But the man in full is an even more formidably proportioned,
enthrallingly dimensioned figure than most of this nation has yet
allowed itself to realize.</TE>

<DH>MIRRORING EVIL: Nazi Imagery / Recent Art, Edited by Norman

<LD>Is it possible for an exhibition of fundamentally banal artwork to
refine our understanding of the Holocaust? This is the only truly
provocative question posed by "Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent
Art," the show that opened on March 17 at the Jewish Museum in New
York. Accompanied by a catalog of the same title (it contains a dozen
essays and illustrates most of the art), the works in "Mirroring
Evil" depart from usual exhibitions of art related to the Holocaust
by aspiring to take the point of view of the perpetrator rather than
the victim.</LD>
<LD>   And they endeavor to go further still. As Norman L. Kleeblatt, the
exhibition's curator, explains in the catalog, published by Rutgers
University Press, these 13 artists, all of whom are in their 30s or
40s and thus one or two generations removed from the Holocaust, "use
Nazi imagery--the ultimate signifier of evil--to mirror moral and
ethical issues that resonate in contemporary society." Not content to
seek the perpetrator alone, these artists endeavor to seek the
perpetrator within us all.</LD>
<TE>   Nervy? Temerarious? Ambitious? Sure. Offensive, as protesters have
maintained? Only if you are offended by the shallow, the slick and
the sensation-seeking or by the one-line joke or gesture that has a
good deal more to do with the history of contemporary art than the
history of the Holocaust. Revelatory of shifts in thinking about how
the Holocaust might be studied, taught and addressed artistically?
Yes--but only to a point.</TE>
<TE>   Ways of thinking about the Holocaust change with every generation
and will go on changing, no doubt, as long as we wrestle with its
difficult and essential history, and with every new "we" that comes
along to do the wrestling ("wrestling" means, essentially, teaching,
because art that responds to the Holocaust is fundamentally didactic;
this is true even for a broad parodist such as Mel Brooks, whose "The
Producers," still ruling Broadway, now inadvertently mocks "Mirroring
Evil" and Nazis).</TE>
<TE>   In the decades following the war, the Holocaust came to be
considered a singular experience, "a special case and kingdom of its
own, above or below or apart from history," as Terrence Des Pres
wrote in "The Survivor" in 1976, a work cited in one of the catalog's
stronger essays, Ernst van Alphen's "Playing the Holocaust." Des Pres
further enjoined that representations of the Holocaust be accurate,
faithful and factual ("without change or manipulation for any
reason--artistic reasons included") and that it be approached as a
"solemn or sacred event."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 25 years later, Peter Novick offered a bracing corrective,
taking offense in "The Holocaust in American Life" at the "perverse
sacralization" that had developed around the Holocaust and at the
idea of it as a uniquely Jewish experience. He found deeply suspect
the way the Holocaust has emerged as one of the strongest connective
themes in assimilated American Jewish life and questioned many of its
pedagogic applications, in particular the notion that it is "morally
therapeutic" to visit a Holocaust museum or watch a Holocaust movie.
Interestingly in view of the goals of "Mirroring Evil," Novick
observed that "the behavior of normal Americans in normal times" can
teach us more about how people become vicitmizers than "the behavior
of the SS in wartime."</TE>
<TE>   As Van Alphen points out, it has been an "unassailable axiom" that
documentaries, memoirs, testimonies and monuments are better teachers
of history than works of art; if the past is concretely known, the
prevailing thinking goes, the future can be controlled ("Never
again"). But overexposure to brutal documentary images and attempts
to master the Holocaust through study or memorization of facts, Van
Alphen argues, risk turning the Holocaust into "just another school
subject"; victimhood, he writes, echoing Novick, cannot control the
future, whereas finding some way to identify with the perpetrators
makes "one aware of the ease with which one can slide into a measure
of complicity."</TE>
<TE>   This is a notion with merit: We might learn something (preventive)
about the Holocaust, and possibly ourselves, by exposing,
investigating and apprehending the mentality of the
perpetrators--providing we can get to them, or even a piece of them,
through a contemporary sensibility and from a vastly different world
view.</TE>
<TE>   Kleeblatt's artists are scarcely the first to happen onto the
idea. More senior--and in some ways subtler--artists have for years
been appropriating Nazi themes and iconography, among them Gerhard
Richter (who has painted blurred portraits of his German relatives in
Wehrmacht uniforms), Anselm Kiefer (who has made photographs of
himself performing Hitler's sieg heil salute in front of German
monuments), Christian Boltanski (who rephotographed family albums of
Nazi officers at play for his book, "Sans Souci") and Art Spiegelman
(whose graphic novel, "Maus," dared to draw a portrait of a victim of
the Holocaust who was highly unsympathetic).</TE>
<TE>   If the work of these artists succeeds, it may be because
(Spiegelman aside) they were content with the small, suggestive,
elegantly embodied visual gesture. By contrast Kleeblatt's
artists--or rather the worst of their justifiers in the exhibition's
wall labels and catalog--make extravagant claims for the objects they
have produced. "Each artist puts the viewer in the uncomfortable
terrain between good and evil, seduction and repulsion," Kleeblatt
contends; Ellen Handler Spitz, another of the catalog's contributors,
reports that the works leave her feeling "sick, stirred, titillated,
sullied, betrayed, contaminated and embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the essays in the catalog are quite so breathless.
Other writers help demystify the artworks, provide historical and art
historical context and anticipate the artists' potential missteps. In
"'Avant-Garde and Kitsch' Revisited," Lisa Saltzman locates the work
in the tradition of Pop, appropriation and conceptual art; she feels
that it "uses kitsch to frame an encounter with the very [Nazi]
history that exploited the aesthetic of kitsch with devastating
historical consequences." She cites and reviews all the canonical
thinkers on the subject (Clement Greenberg, Susan Sontag, Saul
Friedlander), but in doing so perhaps accidentally stumbles on one of
the key entangling problems with "Mirroring Evil": "The challenge of
the work ... is that it makes manifest that the representation of the
Holocaust can be too easy."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. The disjunction between the stated goals of this
exhibition and the works themselves often comes down to precisely
this: It is all just too glib, too facile and visually far too
underimagined.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Zbigniew Libera's "Lego Concentration Camp Set," one of
the pieces most often singled out by protesters. A box of Legos
adapted to building concentration camps, shows, Spitz believes, how
"evil penetrates unnoticed into ordinary life and perhaps especially
unnoticed into the lives of children." Is this so profound? Haven't
observers of human nature since long before Freud been noticing
impulses as dark and thanatotic in children as in adults? Like much
conceptual art, "Lego" relies heavily on its swiftly, niftily
delivered idea. But when the intellectual falls with such a thud, the
visual had better rise spectacularly. Libera's jaded, tweaked toy box
does not.</TE>
<TE>   What about Tom Sachs' "Giftgas Giftset," where Chanel, Hermes, and
Tiffany packaging is refashioned into gas canisters, or his "Prada
Deathcamp," where a soiled Prada box serves as the base for a model
concentration camp? "The unabashed conflation of supposed 'good' and
outright 'evil' tests our sense of propriety and our ability to
separate aesthetics from history, morality from lifestyle," writes
Kleeblatt. "I'm using the iconography of the Holocaust to bring
attention to fashion. Fashion, like fascism, is about loss of
identity," said Sachs, in an interview with the New York Times
magazine. Americans of a certain class are conspicuous and
status-conscious consumers; they buy--and buy into--Prada, therefore
they might easily buy into the uniform--or uniform thinking--of
Nazism? It's a specious syllogism.</TE>
<TE>   Sachs' disregard of the moral differences between shopping and
genocide is one of the truly offensive--intellectually
offensive--gestures to be found in "Mirroring Evil." Merely
simple-minded and artless are the parallels Maciej Toporowicz draws
in his mock advertisement ("Eternity #14") among Leni Riefenstahl's
Nazi propaganda films, Nazi imagery in postwar Italian cinema and
Calvin Klein underwear and perfume ads: This kind of attentiveness to
the subliminal messages of advertising speaks less to the dangers of
fascism's fascination (as Kleeblatt insists, drawing on Sontag's
seminal essay on the subject) than the basic suspicion of media
taught in a good high school English class.</TE>
<TE>   Do we find the perpetrators within in Piotr Uklanski's
"The Nazis," a frieze of handsome Hollywood actors who have played
movie Nazis over the years? Is the role of the Catholic church in
anti-Semitism exposed by Mischa Kuball's "Hitler's Cabinet," a
crucifix out of whose tips are projected stills from German films of
the 1920s and 1930s, thereby transforming the cruciform shape into a
swastika? What about Alan Schechner's "It's the Real
Thing--Self-Portrait at Buchenwald," in which Schechner has digitally
inserted himself into the famous Margaret Bourke-White photograph,
taken after the Jews were liberated from the camp in 1945? In the
(black-and-white) photograph Schechner displays a (color) Diet Coke
can, which for Joanna Lindenbaum, the exhibition's assistant curator,
"draws parallels between brainwashing tactics of the Nazis and
commodification . Just as much of Europe succumbed to Nazi culture
because it was the dominant paradigm, so does our contemporary
culture succumb to consumerism." Bulletin to Lindenbaum et al: There
is a significant difference between being seduced into buying Diet
Coke (or Tiffany, or Chanel) and buying into Nazism.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously--speaking of buying--Schechner's other piece, "Barcode
to Concentration Camp Morph," at least begins to fit successfully
within the exhibition's thesis, while making a meaningful visual
gesture: In this work, Schechner digitally transforms a bar code into
a photograph of camp victims wearing striped uniforms. The allusion
to the role of nascent computer technology in the Nazi war machine
(think Edwin Black's recent "IBM and the Holocaust"), as well as the
inevitable evocation of prisoners' uniforms and tattooed numbers, has
a suggestive, reverberative quality lacking in much of the other work
on display here.</TE>
<TE>   There are other ambitious and more successful pieces in the show,
among them Alain Sechas' "Enfants Gates" ("Spoiled Children"), a
group of Maus-like, Hitler-mustached pets contained in playpens with
swastikas fashioned into them and then multiplied in mirrors.
According to Sechas, the viewer is meant to be located "halfway
between being a spectator and being a witness to violence." Maybe; or
maybe the piece resonates because it finds a deft visual analogue for
repetition and imprisonment in a way that conjures the Nazi mania for
systemization in bureaucracy, iconography, record-keeping and
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   In "Hebrew Lesson," Boaz Arad splices together film clips from
Hitler's propaganda speeches to force him to say, in Hebrew, "Shalom,
Jerusalem, I am deeply sorry." The impossibility of this moment
doesn't mirror evil so much as pose one of those hauntingly
ineffable, almost dreamlike, what-if questions. So too does Roee
Rosen's "Live and Die as Eva Braun," an attempt (through narrative
and drawing) to inhabit Eva Braun on her last day on Earth (along
with some of her afterlife): Is it possible, this installation
wonders, to imagine ourselves into the psyche of the woman who
allowed herself to become so close to the ultimate perpetrator of the
Holocaust?</TE>
<TE>   Alas, Rosen's cartoonish storytelling vulgarizes and trivializes a
bold question, and concept. And as with "Live and Die as Eva Braun"
so with most of the exhibition and commentary: Substantial questions
are asked but are far too insubstantially, and unimaginatively,
answered. These mediocre pieces have been given full-dress museum
treatment, complete with warning placards outside of galleries, an
explanatory video at the end, and this elaborate, anxious catalog.
Altogether it's an awful lot of dogged mining of veins that deliver
what is basically just fool's gold.</TE>

<DH>THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN: A Novel, By Daniel Silva, Putnam: 400
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plot of Daniel Silva's fifth thriller turns on acts of conscience
by several men whose consciences, we would think, had long since been
extinguished. It's a sign of how Silva's work has declined since his
notable debut, "The Unlikely Spy," that none of these changes of
heart are dramatized. They all occur offstage. They aren't meant to
illuminate these men's characters, because character hardly matters
here; they are only devices to turn the plot.</LD>
<LD>   Augustus Rolfe, a Swiss banker who helped finance Hitler's war
machine, was rewarded with a collection of French paintings looted by
the Nazis. Rolfe's wife discovered his secret, dug her own grave in
the garden of their Zurich villa, lay down in it and shot herself.
Rolfe's daughter, Anna, a concert violinist, is ignorant of the
secret but repelled by her father nonetheless. She exiles herself
from Switzerland. Many years later, the heretofore unrepentant Rolfe
decides to return the paintings to their rightful owners--a plan that
alarms other Swiss bankers with caches of stolen art.</LD>
<TE>   Rolfe contacts the Israeli government, which sends art restorer
Gabriel Allon to Zurich, ostensibly to clean one of Rolfe's
legitimately acquired Old Masters but in fact to smuggle out the
French art hidden in his villa. When Allon arrives, however, he finds
Rolfe murdered and the paintings stolen. Leaving the scene, he is
arrested by Gerhardt Peterson, a Swiss police official in cahoots
with the other bankers, and is released only when Israeli
intelligence intervenes.</TE>
<TE>   Allon, a repeat Silva hero, is no ordinary art expert. He's also
an Israeli spy, an assassin who has tracked down and killed a number
of Palestinian terrorists. He mourns his wife and son, victims of a
terrorist's bomb, and he vomits whenever he has to kill someone. In
short, he has a conscience, though it has never slowed his trigger
finger.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the mysterious Englishman the bankers hire to kill
anyone who threatens "the institutions that had given a tiny,
landlocked country with few natural resources the world's
second-highest standard of living" seems to enjoy his lethal trade. A
former British Army commando, he works out of Corsica, where
centuries of vendettas have made the taddunaghiu, or hit man, a
feared and respected figure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, whenever he kills someone, he feels the need to visit an
old Corsican woman who casts spells to rid him of the "evil eye." And
the arrogant, ambitious Peterson shows a hint of weakness as well: a
childhood memory of asking his father about Jewish refugees being
handed back over the border to the Nazis. His father confirmed it.
The boy was shocked--this didn't square with what he was taught in
school: "that Switzerland, a neutral country during the war, had
opened its borders to refugees and wounded soldiers--that it had been
Europe's Sister of Mercy."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it squares with nonfiction exposes of Switzerland's
wartime role that Silva acknowledges, such as Lynn Nicholas' "The
Rape of Europa" and Jean Ziegler's "The Swiss, the Gold, and the
Dead." Swiss banks, the book notes, enabled Hitler to fight on a year
longer, at an immense cost in lives; Swiss bankers, aided by secrecy
laws, clung to the deposits of Jews killed in the Holocaust and many
artworks stolen by the Nazis "remain hidden in the vaults of
Switzerland's banks and in the homes of its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   As an indictment, "The English Assassin" is powerful. As a story,
though, it's mostly travelogue. As Allon, enlisting Anna Rolfe's
help, tries to re-enter Switzerland to find the paintings and unmask
the villains, and as Peterson and the Englishman try to stop them,
the action jumps from London to Zurich to Tel Aviv to Vienna to
Lisbon to Venice. In each place, Silva describes the architecture,
the weather, the history; he names streets and buildings, passes on
some local slang.</TE>
<TE>   His aim, of course, is to give the story credibility, but when
such expertise becomes the story--a common failing with
thrillers--any lapse hurts. (Anna Rolfe, for example, records a CD of
"several Brahms violin concertos," but Brahms wrote only one.) It was
different with "The Unlikely Spy," in which Silva's evocation of
Britain during World War II was absorbing and convincing, and in
which his hero, a professor uneasily working in espionage, was a
human being--not a robot who, when shot or stabbed, is as likely to
leak hydraulic fluid as blood.</TE>

<DH>FLESH AND MACHINES: How Robots Will Change Us, By Rodney
Brooks, Pantheon: 260 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>Michael Hiltzik is a staff writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If imagination precedes discovery, then credit Isaac Asimov's "I,
Robot," with its pulp fiction plotting and its Laws of Robotics ("A
robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
human being to come to harm....") for defining our notion of what a
robot should be. Thirty years ago the most advanced versions were
carts that moved a few centimeters, then paused for hours to
recompute their position before moving again; last September a host
of tiny independent machines burrowed nimbly into the wreckage of the
World Trade Center in search of victims.</LD>
<LD>   But these devices' mental acuity has not kept pace with their
physical nimbleness. Overall, the goal of creating a machine of truly
discerning intellect has remained stubbornly out of reach, like the
endlessly beckoning target in Zeno's paradox. The World Trade Center
robots could navigate inside dark dusty tunnels but could not
distinguish between a rock and a human limb; that task had to be left
to humans viewing video images transmitted from underground.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of creating a robot "mind" remains seductive. But the
quest has long been hampered by confusion over what it is the
searchers are looking for. Is a "mind" something possessed by dog, or
a frog? Or is it a higher-level process granted only to humans? Does
it require language? Does it even, in fact, exist, or is it an
illusion resulting from a meld of countless incredibly efficient but
zombie-like responses to stimuli? Can it, in the end, be
manufactured?</TE>
<TE>   With "Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us," Rodney
Brooks steps into this intellectual snarl with both feet. Habitues of
computing and artificial-intelligence conferences around the world
know Brooks as the irrepressible Pied Piper of robotics, renowned for
his thorough grasp of artificial intelligence, his chipper Australian
accent and his breezy specifications for a remote, intelligent Mars
exploratory vehicle--"fast, cheap, and out of control"--which became
the title of a well-received documentary film profiling Brooks and
three other obsessives from varied walks of life.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest book (his first not directed at a technical
audience), Brooks chronicles his attempts to coax animate behavior
from a brood of aluminum-and-silicon creations, as well as his
consequent battles with the AI establishment. He may be the director
of the artificial intelligence lab at MIT, but he launched his career
by turning the discipline's basic tenets upside-down--proclaiming
that AI was doomed to stagnation unless it shed its preoccupation
with static computer programs and accepted that the one true path to
machine intelligence was "embodiment," that is, placing the
intelligence inside a package that, like an animal, interacted
dynamically with and learned from its environment. "[A]ll previous
work in artificial intelligence," he tells us cheerfully, "was
misguided."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks is convinced that his brand of AI will eventually lead to a
type of consciousness. "Being a machine does not disqualify something
from having emotions," he writes. "And by straightforward extension,
does not prevent it from being conscious." The implications of this
argument are prodigious, not least the moral implications. Can we
ethically justify treating our machines as slaves--or maltreating or
discarding them unceremoniously--if they possess feelings,
aspirations, thought? Brooks suggests it may be a long time before we
have to confront that question in the flesh, as it were, but he
believes the day will come.</TE>
<TE>   But whether physics and engineering are capable of actually
inventing consciousness, rather than its simulation, is the question
at the heart of this book. "Flesh and Machines" is populated by
skittering blinking robots with fanciful names like Shakey, Genghis,
Cog and Kismet. The latter two, developed at Brooks' lab, have even
managed to evoke emotional responses from human interlocutors. Of
Kismet, a robot head equipped with cameras in its faux-human eyeballs
and microphones in its ears (the entire get-up resembles a creature
from the movie "Gremlins"), Brooks contends that its ability to train
its eyes on human speakers and engage in a simple programmed
conversational give-and-take made it the world's first "truly
sociable" robot: "Kismet is alive. Or may as well be. People treat it
that way."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but. People respond emotionally to any number of artificial
objects--the cartoon Bambi, the average plush toy, a Volkswagen. None
of these is therefore rendered "sociable," much less "alive." One
wonders, in fact, whether Brooks and his students didn't start
misleading themselves the moment they decided to give their
mechanical contraptions names, like pets.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks indirectly acknowledges this pitfall by retelling the story
of the computer program ELIZA, which was developed by the AI pioneer
Joseph Weizenbaum to simulate the circular conversational technique
of a trained psychotherapist ("Eliza, I'm bored." "Why do you think
you are bored?"). Weizenbaum's goal was to demonstrate how easily a
computer could simulate a conversation and thus to prove the
bankruptcy of efforts to reproduce human cognition, and he was
appalled when he started receiving letters from people begging for
private consultations with his artificial therapist.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Brooks stakes out a position on artificial
consciousness--that it's possible, even inevitable--which one tends
to hear far more often from engineers than from biologists, who
having more experience with the astonishing complexity and variety of
the brain are less inclined to view it, as Brooks does, as just
another computer. The neuroscientist Gerald Edelman puts his finger
on the problem when he reminds AI researchers that machines such as
digital computers don't "think" in the human sense; what they do is
perform logical operations on symbols, the true meaning of which they
are unable to discern. It's a long way from there to an artificial
consciousness capable of viewing itself and the world as a complex,
interactive meld of experience, remembrance and growth.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks dismisses such objections as a species-oriented chauvinism,
but this is unworthy.  The drive to discover how the purely physical
and chemical reactions inside our bodies give rise to our perceptions
of a dynamic Technicolor world may well prove to be the most
important scientific quest of our age. Likely as not, it won't be
solved until biologists and engineers agree they each have something
to contribute to the effort, rather than insisting that they
themselves are the owners of the one true key.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Route 66, so richly celebrated in story and song, is without a doubt
the most famous highway in America. First commissioned in 1926, U.S.
Highway 66 suddenly opened up the remote byways to travelers in
search of a frontier experience. What they found, however, owed far
more to P.T. Barnum and the Hollywood back lot than to the Old West.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that so many Americans began taking to the road,"
explains Thomas Arthur Repp in "Route 66: The Romance of the West,"
"turned the Southwest upside down."</LD>
<TE>   Vast stretches of the rural Southwest were untouched by the coming
of the road. "Indoor plumbing and telephone service were creature
comforts difficult to obtain," Repp reminds us. "Stores closed at
dusk for want of electricity." But, here and there, a few visionaries
saw a way to separate the travelers on Route 66 from their dimes and
dollars--they operated a string of "trading posts" that offered gas,
food and souvenirs, and they resorted to sideshow antics to slow down
and stop the passing motorists. "Route 66" offers a closer look at
these roadside attractions and the folks who ran them in a series of
richly illustrated profiles. John Edward Claar, for example, was born
in Ohio and made his living by running games on carnival midways
before buying the Hitching Post, a service station and curio shop
located a few miles outside Moriarty, N.M. Drawing on his carny
background, he opened a menagerie of wild animals--owls and eagles,
bobcats and coyotes, and the so-called Den of Death, a snake pit
stocked with diamond-back rattlers. At the bottom of the snake pit
was a wishing well with a sign that invited the tourists to drop in a
coin and promised that "your wish will come true."</TE>
<TE>   "In the spring, I'd scrape the money out of the pit," Claar's son,
Bob, recalled. "My sister and I would wash it and roll it. Every year
that well would take in hundreds of dollars in change."</TE>
<TE>   The spectacular natural beauty and rich native culture of the
Southwest were deemed somehow lacking by these good-natured
hucksters. At the Longhorn Ranch in Moriarty, actors posed as
cowboys. The famous Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, Ariz., invited tourists
to spend the night in a structure that looked like a tepee--but the
architectural plans had been borrowed from the builders of an auto
court in Kentucky. And the Beast of Barstow, as advertised on a sign
outside a rock shop near Hodge, Calif., turned out to be nothing more
exotic than a dusty old burro kept in a simple pen.</TE>
<TE>   Now and again, a bit of authenticity might be glimpsed along Route
66--the town of Gallup, N.M., still is host to the Inter-Tribal
Indian Ceremonial, an exhibition of traditional art, dance and
athletics by members of the Zuni, Laguna, Santo Domingo, Navajo,
Hopi, Acoma, Ute and Isleta people that was first held in 1922. Chief
Joe's Trading Post in Holbrook was one of the few such places
actually owned and operated by a Native American entrepreneur--Joseph
Sekakuku was an authentic Hopi "snake dancer" who performed for
tourists at the Grand Canyon before going into business for himself.
But Bob Claar recalls how his father reassured the tourists that all
of the souvenirs on sale at the Hitching Post were actually made by
Indians while "my sister and I would be in another room peeling the
'made in Japan' labels off everything."</TE>
<TE>   Colorful and kinetic in its presentation, full of arresting images
and packed with tales told with a wink and a nod by various old coots
and charming rogues, "Route 66" is clearly intended to satisfy an
appetite for nostalgia. But the oral histories, vintage snapshots and
richly evocative memorabilia on display here add up to something much
more than a sentimental scrapbook of the so-called "Great Road West."
Indeed, "Route 66" can be approached as a serious study of American
pop culture disguised as a coffee table book.</TE>
<TE>   A full century separates the first trek into Yosemite Valley by
John Muir, the 19th century naturalist and pioneering environmental
activist, from the more recent expeditions of photographer Galen
Rowell, but the juxtaposition of their work in "The Yosemite" is apt
and illuminating. Muir's classic work of natural history, first
published in 1912, is here illustrated with more than 100
contemporary images that allow us to see for ourselves what Muir
meant when he wrote that "the Sierra should be called, not the Nevada
or Snowy Range, but the Range of Light."</TE>
<TE>   The book reproduces the entire text of Muir's original, but the
glory of "The Yosemite" is the superb color plates, each one
annotated with a quotation from Muir's writings and a comment from
Rowell. Although Rowell credits Muir for the remarkable fact that we
can still see many of the same sights that the pioneering
preservationist first glimpsed so long ago, Rowell is certainly not
shy about showing us Yosemite through his own lens and answering Muir
in his own words.</TE>
<TE>   When, for example, Muir writes that "a wild scene, but not a safe
one, is made by the moon as it appears through the edge of the
Yosemite Fall," Rowell responds by showing us his own startling image
of the falls by moonlight. His 45-second exposure captures the rock
face, the falling water and the stars in the sky with an intensity
that the rods and cones of the human eye cannot match. "In this
case," the photographer explains, "photography allowed me to see more
than met my eye."</TE>
<TE>   Only rarely does Rowell consent to showing us a human figure on
the landscape of Yosemite, and even when he does, the human
experience is always a solitary one. "Only by going alone in silence,
without baggage, can one truly get into the heart of the wilderness,"
wrote Muir. "All other travel is mere dust and hotels and baggage and
clatter." Exactly here, of course, is the unspoken irony of the whole
enterprise--Rowell credits Muir with protecting Yosemite from
unrestrained development, but his photographs also remind us that the
Yosemite we see in these pages is a wholly different place than the
hectic tourist destination that it has become.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Richard Neutra is remembered for his work in and around
Los Angeles, and so it is somehow fitting that his very first
residential commission on the East Coast is now long gone. The
so-called Windshield House, named for its lavish expanses of glass,
was built on Fishers Island in New York in 1936, damaged by a
hurricane within weeks of its completion and later destroyed by fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard Neutra's Windshield House," an elegant monograph based on
an exhibition at Harvard University and the Rhode Island School of
Design, documents and illustrates what editor Dietrich Neumann calls
"a watershed building in Neutra's career."</TE>
<TE>   The stated intention of the clients was to create a home that
would be "economical to build and operate," although the Windshield
House, at a cost of $218,000, turned out to be "the most expensive
modern house in the country," writes Sarah Williams Goldhagen, a
contributor to the book. Indeed, we discover that both the architect
and his clients regarded the project as an experiment in the use of
high technology for the mass production of housing--the bathrooms,
for example, were prefabricated one-piece units designed by
Buckminster Fuller.</TE>
<TE>   "Windshield represented indeed the sounds, smells, and images,"
writes Neumann about the spare and yet stately structure, "of a
lived-in machine."</TE>

<DH>DARLINGTON'S FALL: A Novel in Verse, By Brad Leithauser,
Alfred A. Knopf: 320 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the Victorian grandeur of its title and the quixotic
presumption of a novel written in verse, "Darlington's Fall" is a
modest little book. Brad Leit- hauser, novelist, poet, professor,
husband, father, brother and demi-centurian, has allowed himself to
fall under the spell of the story of a Midwestern naturalist who
dreams great dreams. The result is charming and quite wonderful.</LD>
<LD>   The story itself is modest. At the tail end of the 19th century,
when caricatures of Darwin are still making the evening paper, Russ
Darlington, motherless son of a Hoosier millionaire, develops a major
jones for butterflies. Under the tutelage of a misshapen and
misanthropic professor at the local university, Russ grows from a
dreamy boy of 10 to an intense academic. He even discovers and
captures an unnamed species of butterfly. It takes him a little
longer to capture the birds and the bees in the form of the local
college belle.</LD>
<LD>   He (with stammering urgency): How are you, Pauline?</LD>
<TE>   She (smiling brightly): Cold, I s'pose. Refrigerated.</TE>
<TE>   But tell me (mock-solemnly), how are all the bugs?</TE>
<TE>   He (treating the question gravely): Complicated.</TE>
<TE>   She: Isn't everything? (But now the girl blinks, shrugs,</TE>
<TE>   And, looking away, finds a tone that instantly</TE>
<TE>   Evokes for them a new level of intimacy.)</TE>
<TE>   You're the expert: Is there, anywhere in Nature,</TE>
<TE>   Such a thing as a really simple creature?</TE>
<TE>   He (hoping to match her gravity): Not that I've seen.</TE>
<TE>   Capture Pauline he does. But marital bliss evades the couple. With
his eye on nature, Russ heads off on the eve of the Great War to the
Pacific islands, a heart of darkness where "He can't shake the sense
that here the leaves are cruel." Yet Darlington is no Marlowe.
Thousands of miles from Pauline and Indiana, the Midwestern schlemiel
can't quite get it right. Reaching for yet another unnamed,
fluttering rarity, Darlington falls. Broken in back and in spirit, he
returns to Indiana and pulls in his wings.</TE>
<TE>   But Darlington's is not the only story of the novel. A third of
the way through the book, the narrator reveals his own existence. He
is a late 20th century researcher into the life of Russ Darlington,
to which he'd hoped to bring the quickness of a lizard, "its
quick-eyed/Watchfulness and cool proclivity/For snug retreats." To an
extent, he is successful, slippery and sneaky. It takes another
thousand lines for him to reveal that Darlington is family--the uncle
of the narrator's crazy aunt from Surrey ("the family's leading expat
oddball") who gave him, as a college graduation present, a copy of
Darlington's long-forgotten biology textbook.</TE>
<TE>   Family--a word modest, yet, in the Darwinian sense, the
explanation for madness beyond propriety, from the suicidal matings
of the praying mantis to the gut-wrenching trek that the narrator
makes to the Malaysian jungle where Darlington met his own fall. And
perhaps it is not altogether accidental that Leithauser invited his
brother, Mark, to contribute a dozen illustrations to the volume,
line drawings as gothic as the abecedary of Edward Gorey or the
murals of New York's Museum of Natural History.</TE>
<TE>   Leithauser interweaves the familial story of the narrator with the
story of his subject--for Darlington survives his return and survives
spectacularly--with threads of 10-line stanzas. "I vowed," he writes
in an introductory note, "that nearly every line would have an exact,
or perfect, rhyme." (Author's note) Without a prescribed structure to
either stanza or line, these rhymes land with a pleasantly random
butterfly motion, pushing the story forward with only the faintest,
poetic sashaying of wings.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the narrator lets loose a gust of philosophy, over, say,
the subject of mortality, the air blows swiftly past:</TE>
<TE>   Behold the helix, like a vine trained round</TE>
<TE>   A spiral staircase long since dropped away,</TE>
<TE>   A shoot flourishing free of wall and ground,</TE>
<TE>   Itself its own nourishment and mainstay--</TE>
<TE>   A kinked plait leading everywhere and nowhere,</TE>
<TE>   For life goes everywhere (into the desert air,</TE>
<TE>   The hot springs, ice caves, broken benthic slime,</TE>
<TE>   The toxic sump, the steel-factory air vent)</TE>
<TE>   And nowhere (ninety-nine point nine percent</TE>
<TE>   Of species having gone extinct with time).</TE>
<TE>   It is a sentiment about as deep and difficult as a field of
Indiana corn, just right for an ordinary novel in verse about
ordinary men.</TE>

Espionage, By Dan Stober and Ian Hoffman, Simon &amp; Schuster: 384 pp.,

<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL PARKS</AU>
<BD>Michael Parks is the director of the School of
Journalism at USC's Annenberg School for Communication. He was the
editor of The Times from 1997 to 2000 and a Pulitzer Prize-winning
foreign corespondent for the paper, covering China, Russia, South
Africa and the Middle East.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The alarm spread fast three years ago: China had made ominous
breakthroughs in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs
and the strategic balance in Asia--and perhaps globally--was
shifting. Espionage and treason were suspected, and there appeared to
be serious reasons to believe that Beijing had stolen key secrets
from Washington's nuclear arsenal and was in a position to threaten
the United States and its Asian allies. Suddenly the 50-year
love-fear relationship between the United States and the People's
Republic of China had taken a turn for the worse.</LD>
<LD>   With the 2000 presidential campaign shaping up, the political
frenzy grew, and the FBI, searching for a leak, came to focus on a
59-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, who had come from Taiwan as a
student in 1964 and was working as a nuclear weapons scientist at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Suspected of spying for
China, for giving to Beijing the United States' most closely held
nuclear secrets, its so-called crown jewels, Wen Ho Lee was charged
with 59 counts of violating the Atomic Energy Act and the Federal
Espionage Act, 39 of the counts punishable by life imprisonment.</LD>
<TE>   A congressional investigation had already concluded that "without
the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States, it would have been
virtually impossible for [China] to fabricate and test successfully
small nuclear warheads...." Lee was suspected of giving China the
technology to miniaturize the warheads.</TE>
<TE>   The government's case against Lee ultimately collapsed as his
legal team, granted top secret security clearances and tutored by Lee
in the physics of nuclear weapons, picked apart the charges to the
point where, in a plea bargain, all but one were dismissed and Lee
pleaded guilty to downloading classified information and to copying
that information on to a computer tape.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution, orchestrated by the FBI and the Department of
Justice in the name of national security, was one of the most
shameful since the McCarthy era. Beginning with no more than a
surmise--that China might have developed an advanced nuclear warhead
similar to those deployed on the missiles on Trident submarines--the
investigation was founded on the rawest of racial profiling and
pursued with bungling and incompetence. It moved forward in an
atmosphere of race-baiting Sinophobia abetted by numerous
politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, and by key elements of
the news media, which rather than challenging the charges, added to
the atmosphere, forgetting that in such times its role is not only to
look after national security but also to defend civil liberties. As a
result, China was portrayed as the new post-Cold War rival of the
United States, and Lee was compared repeatedly to Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 after being convicted of nuclear
espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, the prosecution's failed charges against Lee
brought an extraordinary and profound apology from U.S. District
Judge James A. Parker. "The top decision makers in the executive
branch, especially the Department of Justice and the Department of
Energy and locally ... have caused embarrassment by the way this case
began and was handled," Parker declared from the bench, as he freed
Lee after 278 days in harsh pre-trial detention. "They did not
embarrass me alone. They have embarrassed our entire nation and each
of us who is a citizen of it.... I sincerely apologize to you, Dr.
Lee, for the unfair manner in which you were held in custody by the
executive branch."</TE>
<TE>   In an excellent piece of forensic journalism, "A Convenient Spy,"
reporters Dan Stober of the San Jose Mercury News and Ian Hoffman of
the Albuquerque Journal deconstruct the many bad decisions in Lee's
case, following each blunder to the top of the FBI, the Justice
Department and the Clinton White House. The prime mover in the case
was Notra Trulock, the chief of intelligence and counterintelligence
for the Department of Energy's nuclear laboratories and factories,
but there were dozens of officials who failed to question his flawed
logic or challenge his racism. Fearing that they, too, might be
blamed for the loss of U.S. strategic superiority, these officials
moved the case forward.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wen Ho Lee affair was an ugly chapter in U.S. history,"
Stober and Hoffman conclude. "It was a time when democratic ideals
were forgotten in the name of national security, when ideology and
ambition overpowered objectivity, and when partisan warfare trumped
statesmanship."</TE>
<TE>   Senior scientists, veterans of the nuclear weapons program, came
forward during the prosecution to debunk the government's working
premise--that China must have been helped by agents within the U.S.
program--and disputed whether the material that Lee was suspected of
providing would have even helped Beijing's nuclear weapons program.
And as Stober and Hoffman point out, the United States had gathered
far more intelligence on China's development of nuclear weapons than
Beijing had obtained in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But Lee, as a Chinese American scientist, was virtually
pre-ordained for prosecution, according to Stober and Hoffman's
analysis. Investigators were looking for someone of Chinese ancestry
with access to U.S. nuclear secrets and only for such a person. That
Lee was politically naive, sloppy in observing security protocols,
alarmingly forgetful and at times deceitful added greatly to his
vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of journalist Helen Zia, Lee gets his right of reply
in "My Country Versus Me." He explains that he had made copies of the
computerized codes used to model nuclear explosions, and thus to test
atomic weapons, because computer crashes at Los Alamos had cost him a
lot of hard work, destroying years' worth of code writing. He says
that he had kept all the copied material secure, much of which was
not even classified, until the investigation was well underway. Panic
set in and, fearing discovery, he deleted the files from an unsecure
computer he had used and threw away the magnetic tapes onto which he
had copied them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was simply inconceivable to me that any rational person who
had the facts could think that I was a spy," Lee writes. "As a
scientist, I thought of facts as indisputable. I clung to the simple
belief that the facts would prove the truth and that in America a
person is innocent until proven guilty."</TE>
<TE>   In their exhaustive examination of the case, however, Stober and
Hoffman do not entirely exonerate Lee, and they do raise serious
doubts about his behavior. Copying the computer codes was "an
egregious security offense," they write. "Lee broke the fundamental
trust that underlies the weapons world and, in the end, his betrayal
of that trust--witting or not--seriously eroded America's confidence
in the weapons labs and the ability of his colleagues to protect
secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Lee's actions could arouse suspicion and, as he
acknowledges, deserved official reprimand, but they cannot justify
the espionage charges against him nor his pre-trial incarceration in
solitary confinement. Some politicians and commentators have argued
that despite the dismissal of all but one charge, Lee's own behavior
and his "enigmatic character" were responsible for his fate, but in
this they are blaming the victim for the injustice he suffered.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the Lee case was far from simple, and even with
the information available for the first time in these two books,
there remain many difficult issues, unresolved questions and new
concerns. It is clear, however, that the government's prosecution of
Lee severely undercut U.S. security interests. The investigation by
the congressional committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport
Beach) into unauthorized transfers of highly sensitive technology to
China was so caught up in Washington's anti-China hysteria and was so
influenced by Trulock that its conclusions cannot be trusted. Whether
there was ever a leak of nuclear weapons secrets appears very
uncertain, at least from what we can gather from the public record.
What is the real state of China's nuclear weapons program? We may not
know for quite a while.</TE>
<TE>   Is China the United States' principal global rival, as Cox and
others asserted? Since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has focused
on international terrorism as the gravest threat to the United
States, and China so far has supported the U.S. effort against it.
What will Washington's relationship be with Beijing going forward?
The strong anti-China sentiments, so evident in the Lee case,
undermined what had been a key strategic partnership for the United
States since the Nixon administration.</TE>
<TE>   What is worse is that Asian Americans were again suspected of
having divided loyalties. They were portrayed by some in the
country's political establishment as well as the intelligence
community as almost an enemy column within, and gifted young Asian
American scientists had serious reasons not to work in national
laboratories, such as Los Alamos, or in the country's defense
industries.</TE>
<TE>   The news media fanned this Sinophobia. Fed by Trulock and other
federal officials motivated by self-interest, New York Times
investigative reporters Jeff Gerth and James Risen raised the alarm
about the supposed theft of the country's "crown jewels" and compared
the case to that of the Rosenbergs. Knowledgeable specialists in the
paper's own newsroom, however, should have quickly exposed the many
holes in the case, and its editors should have questioned the bias of
the sources. In fact, six months later, William Broad, a Times'
science writer with much experience reporting on nuclear armaments,
interviewed physicists and weapons specialists at Los Alamos for
another major piece and concluded that there was strong disagreement
about how much help China had received, or needed, to advance its
nuclear arsenal. However, the Times' two reexaminations of the case
were, in the view of Stober and Hoffman, largely self-exculpatory,
trying not to admit any failure on the paper's part while setting the
record straight.</TE>
<TE>   But The New York Times' first story, the 3,800-word account by
Gerth and Risen of the investigation at Los Alamos, set other news
organizations in pursuit of the agents that China allegedly had
within the U.S. weapons establishment. As editor of the Los Angeles
Times through most of this period, I pressed our reporters to catch
up with The New York Times, but they came back highly skeptical of
the Cox report and of the case against Lee. Columnist Robert Scheer,
based on his own reporting, argued on this newspaper's Commentary
page that Lee was a victim of racism and the case against him was
fatally flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Investigative reporting is an important defense of American
democracy, but in the case of Wen Ho Lee, it contributed to the
fear-mongering political atmosphere in Washington and nearly
subverted justice. First Amendment rights imply the obligations to be
factual and accurate, truthful and fair and, in my view,
compassionate as well. As a profession, we failed this test in the
Lee case and consequently diminished the credibility of investigative
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   All this leaves unresolved how the United States can best protect
not only the secrets of its nuclear arsenal, but other technology
with weapons potential, such as ballistic missiles, reconnaissance
satellites or biological and chemical agents. A botched case like
Lee's could deter counterintelligence officers from pursuit of real
leaks. So bungled was the Lee investigation, as Stober and Hoffman
show, that one wonders how the FBI manages to catch real traitors.
And it prompts concern that even now we may be repeating the errors
of the Wen Ho Lee case as we search for terrorists within the Arab
American community.</TE>

<TE>   From `My Country Versus Me'</TE>
<TE>   `My ordeal is a wound that will be hard to heal. I'm not sure how
to recover from it. At my age, I don't want to spend energy feeling
hate or bitterness. It will be hard for me to trust people again the
way I used to accept people's friendliness and kindness at face
value. At the same time, so many Asian, white, black, Hispanic, and
Native American people were willing to help me. I wish I could thank
every person individually. I also know that if I had been accused of
such a thing in China or Russia, I would probably be dead. I would
have been shot if this happened in Taiwan under the Kuomintang. The
fact that I could be released after being so wrongly accused is
evidence of the good in America. I can still say that I am truly glad
that I am an American ....</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for us to stay here is the warmth of our
neighbors, our friends, and the real community we are part of. Sylvia
[my wife] has her places to shop, to hike, to do yoga. I have my
work, my garden, my secret fishing holes where I can catch a 27-inch
trout, where I can find some peace of mind in the natural beauty that
surrounds us. These are the important things that make a place a
home.</TE>
<TE>   This is my home, this is my place in America. This is why America
is, after all, my country.'</TE>

<LD>Jack and Jill at home together after their fall,</LD>
<LD>   the bucket spilled, her knees badly scraped,</LD>

<TE>   We can see the arduous evenings ahead of them.</TE>

<TE>   He's in a wheelchair, but she's still an item--</TE>

<LD>UNDER DEADMAN'S SKIN</LD>
<LD>   Discovering the Meaning of Children's Violent Play</LD>
<LD>   By Jane Katch</LD>
<TE>   Beacon Press: 132 pp., $15</TE>
<TE>   "Under Deadman's Skin" is a study of violence and children, done
in the manner of Vivian Gussin Paley and Jonathan Kozol. Jane Katch,
a teacher who worked with Bruno Bettleheim at his Orthogenic School
and taught at the Chicago Lab School with Paley, draws her
conclusions by careful observation in the classroom, using the
children's own language to describe the emotions behind their games.
Her class of 5- and 6-year-olds in this book is in a private school.</TE>
<TE>   One child, a leader in the class, initiates games such as
"Suicide" and endless discussions of violent movies he has seen.
Katch sees quickly that the children have a hard time distinguishing
between what's real and what's pretend in the movies; that violent
play that is banned comes out in some other behavior, like bullying
or excluding other children. Bettleheim's words ring in her ears: "If
you want to understand the murderous fantasies of these difficult
children," he told her, "first you must be willing to look at your
own!" Bottled-up feelings simply gain power and create raw
frustration in children. Play relieves these feelings of their
obsessive power.</TE>
<TE>   Katch asks the parents to pay more careful attention to what their
children are watching on various screens, and looks instead for
stories (found mostly in other cultures) that contain violence in
clear fable form, often with morals. The blood-and-guts-for-no-reason
violence of most movies and television shows leaves children with no
sense of right or wrong. It is fun to hear the children talking.
Their language is still so close to their emotions. They use it like
an extra limb.</TE>

<TE>   ACHILLES</TE>
<TE>   By Elizabeth Cook</TE>
<TE>   Picador: 116 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Novels based on myths are more powerful for those readers who have
carefully studied those myths. It often seems that mythological
characters, such as Elizabeth Cook's great Greek warrior, Achilles,
resist coming alive on the page; our 21st century slang sounds
strange coming from their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Achilles rumbles through this novel like Godzilla. His battle with
the Queen of the Amazon is a constellation of verbs, and the novel's
background might as well be a punting reverie by Oxford students
(Keats enters late as a character in the novel, dreaming of Achilles)
on the river Styx.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY FINE FEATHERED FRIEND</TE>
<TE>   By William Grimes</TE>
<TE>   North Point Press: 86 pp., $15</TE>
<TE>   "It was the right bird in the wrong spot," writes William Grimes,
restaurant critic for the New York Times, of the day a chicken
appeared in his patch of backyard in Astoria, Queens. It's a
delightful, Thurberish tale. "This chicken was huge, and it had
obviously been eating well. Its black feathers shone, giving off a
greenish purple iridescence in bright sunlight."</TE>
<TE>   The chicken terrorizes the neighborhood cats and eats their food.
A friend puts Grimes in touch with "a real live farmer in New
Jersey," who tells him what to feed the chicken. Grimes studies the
chicken, realizing he knows quite a bit about roasting, frying and
fricasseeing chickens, but not a whole lot about live ones.</TE>
<TE>   He fesses up to a certain "hypocrisy" when it comes to animals:
"Once I meet them, I don't want to eat them." The chicken builds a
nest and starts producing eggs. Grimes learns that it is a Black
Australorp, Gallus domesticus. He writes about the chicken, and
suddenly the paparazzi are in his yard.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Garbo-like, the chicken disappears. Should she return, he
writes, there will always be a "light in the window and a warm nest
at the base of the pine tree."</TE>

<TE>   FAST GIRLS</TE>
<TE>   Teenage Tribes and the Myth of the Slut</TE>
<TE>   By Emily White</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 220 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   The slut, writes freelance journalist Emily White in this
groundbreaking book, is a "way for the adolescent mind to draw a map
.... She's the place where a girl should never wander, for fear of
becoming an outcast." Remembering a girl from her high school years,
whom the students called "AnnaWanna," White, a self-described
"goody-goody," puts a query in a local paper with an 800 number,
calling for slut stories. She is deluged with stories that are the
basis of this book. White explores our fear of teenagers, the effects
of rumors (which "thicken like a chrysalis" around a girl), "train
jobs" and male bonding, the myth of the "home wrecker" and the
lifetime effects of being labeled a slut.</TE>
<TE>   White quotes Susan Faludi: "The fear that there are not enough men
is certainly related to the fear that there's a girl out there who
wants 'too much' sex." "Fast Girls" is a book for girls, boys, men
and women.</TE>

<LD>A CHILD'S BOOK OF TRUE CRIME</LD>
<LD>   By Chloe Hooper</LD>
<LD>   Scribner: 240 pp., $24</LD>
<TE>   "Children understand tragedy in a way adults are unable to: atom
by atom." "Missing is such a polite word." "A lawyer is as interested
as any criminal in how to sideswipe a rule." Chloe Hooper's
impressive first novel is full of startling observations that nudge
along a curious story of a schoolteacher in Tasmania and her affair
with the father of her most gifted student.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher in question is Kate Byrne, and her Tasmanian tenure
has all the markings of temporary encampment: She's recently
graduated from college, cut off from the mainland and embroiled in a
futile pornographic liaison. Just as Kate plays the schoolgirl for
her lover, "A Child's Book of True Crime" blurs the boundaries
between childhood and adulthood: There's Lucien, the star pupil,
posing disturbingly adult questions; and Lucien's father, Thomas, her
middle-aged lover, re-exploring younger, randier days.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas' wife, Veronica, rears up as a menacing symbol of the
highly grown-up concept of consequence: She's written a true-crime
book about a local girl who was murdered for having an affair, and
she seems to have caught a whiff of Thomas and Kate's goings-on. As
Kate begins to question her personal safety, these role- and
age-playing games threaten to become nightmarish.</TE>
<TE>   Hooper furnishes this oddly bracing tale with childlike drawings
and a kind of parallel, kiddy-lit version of events, in which Terence
Tiger and Kitty Koala discuss forensics and blood-typing techniques.
The result is a charming, surreal bedtime story about disturbing sex,
gruesome murder and one woman's attempt to escape into adulthood.</TE>

<TE>   NO PLACE, LOUISIANA</TE>
<TE>   By Martin Pousson</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead: 262 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Nita, the ever-aspiring heroine of Martin Pousson's superb debut,
moves from daughter to girlfriend to wife to mother as if she's
desperately fleeing each of life's stages. Raised in the Louisiana
bayou country and painfully conscious of her white-trash roots, she's
"sick of this place, sick of Acadiana, sick of the word Cajun."</TE>
<TE>   She's really sick of herself, and it's one of the many wonders of
this quietly riveting story of familial tribulation that we never
tire of the embittered Nita and her desultory march toward middle
age. It's probably because Nita's dissatisfaction is so well earned:
Fatherless, futureless and forced to work in a sleazy diner as a
teen, she assents to a halfhearted marriage proposal from Louis, the
son of a well-to-do farmer and his cruel, never-satisfied wife, Anna.</TE>
<TE>   Anna is the mother-in-law from hell, and every one of Nita's
good-faith efforts--at cooking, cleaning, decorating,
child-rearing--is met with Anna's ridicule. Nita has little recourse
but to aim her bottled-up affections at her son, Marc, a precocious
boy who stands in dialectical contrast to daughter Jo, a toddler
hellion who eventually grows into a party-hearty teenager.</TE>
<TE>   While Jo's musical tastes run to Black Sabbath, Marc dabbles in
Streisand, causing Nita to go into a homophobic talespin. Louis,
meanwhile, is powerless in the face of his wife's mounting
disappointments, her demands for increasingly showy automobiles and
her heartbreaking aloneness. "No Place, Louisiana" is the Southern
answer to "The Ice Storm"; from its sultry pages there emerges a
chilling portrait of a family in the midst of a very deep freeze.</TE>

<TE>   THE CYCLIST</TE>
<TE>   By Viken Berberian</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 190 pp., $21</TE>
<TE>   "Six eyes for an eye, a dozen hands for a hand." This is the mad
calculus that seeps into the impressionable mind of the nameless
terror operative who narrates this novella from Viken Berberian. If
Berberian boldly puts a face on terrorism, then it's nothing like the
defiant mug of Atta: Berberian's Druse terrorist is little more than
an overgrown boy.</TE>
<TE>   He's a gourmand or a glutton, depending on how you look at it, and
each page resounds with meals remembered or anticipated, savored or
rejected, from Westphalian ham to savory falafel to humble lentils,
which inspire in him a certain distaste, and the following
meditation, handed down by his dear mother: "Just as the lentil is
round, so mourning comes round to all the denizens of the world."</TE>
<TE>   "The Cyclist" is littered with these muted justifications of mass
murder; it's as if Berberian's terrorist--whose assignment is to
deliver a bomb to a Lebanese hotel by bicycle--is forever looking
back upon the deadly mayhem he's yet to unleash.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to know whether Berberian has penetrated the
terrorist mind or if he's concocted a rich, feast-like fantasy;
either way, "The Cyclist" provokes both horror and sympathy as it
examines the Middle East's never-ending cycle of violent retribution.</TE>

<HD>An Industry Murder Mystery</HD>
<DH>THE REPORTER : A Novel, By Kelly Lange, Mysterious Press:
304 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERICA SANDERS</AU>
<BD>Erica Sanders is a freelance writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the third time out for former KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchorwoman
Kelly Lange, whose previous works, "Trophy Wife" and "Gossip,"
established her in women's commercial fiction. Not quite as
"denim-to-diamonds" as a Danielle Steel oeuvre but easily as slick in
the pacing, "The Reporter" does not stray far from Lange's oft-chosen
premise: When a rich, powerful and deeply loathed man (picture
Sansabelt pants, white guayabera shirt) is murdered, all eyes turn to
a bevy of scorned gals.</LD>
<LD>   Here, in "The Reporter," Jack Nathanson, an Oscar-winning actor
whose glory days are a faded memory, has been shot in the home of his
first wife, Debra Angelo, a sort of Italian-style Joan Collins. At
the funeral, which is actually attended by Joan Collins, as mourners
gather around Nathanson's Lucite coffin (a detail that novelist Bruce
Wagner would envy), we meet our cast. Maxi Poole, the TV reporter of
the title, is spouse No. 2. Her money troubles began the minute she
married the debt-ridden actor. Nathanson's current wife, agent Janet
Orson, appears suspiciously composed for a grieving widow. Then
there's the Linda Blair-like former child star who was
psychologically scarred in the making of Nathanson's hit, "Black
Sabbat," and, finally, his DJ mistress, who's got a nasty temper and
a penchant for crack (ho-hum).</LD>
<TE>   Lange lays out her thriller with all the sophistication of a game
of Clue, albeit one with a dash of industry verite--in particular, a
film premiere scene name-drops and tattles nicely. "The Reporter" is
an entertaining, if predictable mystery made better by Lange's 28
years behind the desk.</TE>

<HD>Our Damaged Nobel Laureate</HD>
<DH>SINCLAIR LEWIS: Rebel from Main Street, By Richard
Lingeman, Random House: 664 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>Keith Taylor is the author of five chapbooks of poetry
and one collection of short stories.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Literary history is usually not kind, but occasionally it is not even
just. Sinclair Lewis is a case in point. Even though we think of the
1920s as the decade that saw the ascendancy of the great
modernists--of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner--Sinclair Lewis, a
prolific Midwesterner from Sauk Centre, Minn., was the American
writer who dominated the decade. "Main Street," "Babbitt," "Elmer
Gantry," "Arrowsmith" and "Dodsworth" did more to shape the nation's
perception of itself at the time than did "The Sun Also Rises" or
"The Sound and the Fury." Lewis' satires of American life added
derisive vocabulary to our dictionaries: "main-streeter" for a
particular kind of smug provincialism; "babbittry" for tasteless
commercial boosterism; "elmer-gantryism" for religious hucksterism.
In the 1920s the rest of the world recognized Lewis' central position
too: In 1930 he became the first American writer to win the Nobel
Prize.</LD>
<TE>   And then things started to go bad. Maybe Lewis is an example of
how we always seem to turn on our success stories, or maybe he was
simply the victim of changing fashion. The Midwesterners in his books
just seemed dull after the apotheosis of expatriate bohemians in the
books of his younger contemporaries. After Freud trickled down into
the popular mind, Lewis' characters--always the understandable
products of their environments--might have seemed too flat or too
simple. After Joyce, some readers, particularly influential academic
critics, began to expect their novels to be as chiseled and as formal
as sonnets, certainly not the sprawling sociological surveys Lewis
wrote. When the American character became more self-confident after
World War II, Lewis' satires didn't seem so funny. Maybe we couldn't
even understand them anymore.</TE>
<TE>   As Richard Lingeman points out in "Sinclair Lewis: Rebel from Main
Street," the most important reevaluation of Lewis in more than a
generation, there is no easy explanation for the decline of Lewis'
reputation. It's simply too easy to blame it on early success or on
his abuse of alcohol, even though the latter does explain Lewis'
physical decline and recurring depression. He continued to work hard
after the Nobel, writing books that sold in enormous quantities,
books that tackled major themes in interesting ways, novels that
could certainly find an audience today if people knew about them. For
instance, Lewis published "Ann Vickers," a significant early feminist
novel, in 1933. As late as 1947, just four years before his lonely
death in Italy, he published a brave novel about American racism,
"Kingsblood Royal."</TE>
<TE>   He also continued to exercise a noticeable influence on American
letters. It is impossible to imagine Richard Wright's "Native
Son"--the "breakout book" of African American literature, first
published in 1940--without the example of Lewis. Wright's willingness
to explore class structure and its pervasive presence in American
life, and the manner in which he wrote about it, were certainly
influenced by the author of "Main Street." In a very different way
and in a very different kind of book, John Updike's famous Rabbit
Angstrom books are obviously an echo of "Babbitt."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lingeman admits to other causes for the relegation of
Lewis to minor status, he casts his greatest blame on the last major
biographer of his subject. More than 40 years ago, critic and UC
Berkeley professor Mark Schorer published his "Sinclair Lewis: An
American Life," a book of even more exhaustive detail than Lingeman's
already large book, but one often exquisitely written. The Schorer
biography has to be one of the oddest major studies in American
literature. The author immersed himself in his subject, yet it is
impossible to read three or four pages without finding a clause that
dismisses or diminishes Lewis. After reading the book, it is hard not
to conclude that the biographer didn't like his subject and wished
that he had found some other topic to occupy a decade or so of work.
Lingeman convincingly explains Schorer's attitude as a result of his
time, "the silent 1950s, the era of the anticommunist culture war in
academe, the heyday of the New Critics, who placed text above social
context."</TE>
<TE>   Lingeman's prose in his biography is much more workmanlike than
Schorer's. A senior editor at the Nation, Lingeman has a journalist's
reluctance to exercise stylistic flourishes. He is willing to risk
dullness rather than intrude on his subject, and at times the reading
slows under the weight of detail endlessly recorded. But Lingeman,
the author of "Small Town America" and the magisterial two-volume
biography of another Midwesterner, "Theodore Dreiser: An American
Journey," has a sympathy and an intimate understanding of Lewis that
Schorer never achieved. Lingeman has simply thought longer and more
clearly about the role of the Midwest in the national imagination,
and he is unwilling to fall into easy and dismissive cliches about a
major region of the country or about one of the major authors to rise
from that region. The reader is also left with the sense that,
despite Lewis' many shortcomings, Lingeman not only admires the
author but also rather likes him.</TE>
<TE>   We seem to be in a period that is reevaluating Lewis. His books
are being taught in universities again, and Lingeman's "Sinclair
Lewis: Rebel from Main Street" will certainly provide a biographical
touchstone for new conversations. But the damaged reputation of our
first Nobel laureate will not be restored until readers once again
turn to his novels--the big five from the 1920s, and maybe as many as
five of the lesser-known books--to hear again the satiric,
occasionally bitter, but clearly unmistakable voice of Lewis as it
invents and dissects some of our national myths.</TE>

<TE>   From `Main Street'</TE>
<TE>   On a hill by the Mississippi where Chippewas camped two
generations ago, a girl stood in relief against the cornflower blue
of Northern sky. She saw no Indians now; she saw flour-mills and the
blinking windows of skyscrapers in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Nor was
she thinking of squaws and portages, and the Yankee fur-traders whose
shadows were all about her. She was meditating upon walnut fudge, the
plays of Brieux, the reasons why heels run over, and the fact that
the chemistry instructor had stared at the new coiffure which
concealed her ears.</TE>
<TE>   A breeze which had crossed a thousand miles of wheatlands bellied
her taffeta skirt in a line so graceful, so full of animation and
moving beauty, that the heart of a chance watcher on the lower road
tightened to wistfulness over her quality of suspended freedom. She
lifted her arms, she leaned back against the wind, her skirt dipped
and flared, a lock blew wild. A girl on a hilltop; credulous,
plastic, young; drinking the air as she longed to drink life. The
eternal aching comedy of expectant youth.</TE>
<TE>   It is Carol Milford, fleeing for an hour from Blodgett College.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Several years ago, the online magazine Salon.com reprinted Vin
Scully's call of the ninth inning of Sandy Koufax's 1965 perfect
game. "Twenty-nine thousand people and a million butterflies," was
the headline, borrowed from Scully's description of the attendance
that evening.</LD>
<LD>   To read the transcript now is not only to rediscover Scully's
ability to call a game as a kind of omniscient narrator ("A lot of
people in the ballpark now are starting to see the pitches with their
hearts," he said that night, as Koufax closed in on perfection), but
also how unintelligible and out-of-touch today's broadcasters are by
comparison.</LD>
<LD>   Put their words to paper and what you get, to borrow a line from
Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles," is authentic frontier gibberish.
During the UCLA-Cincinnati NCAA tournament basketball game, for
instance, CBS commentator Bill Raftery referred to Bruin point guard
Ryan Walcott's "ability and strength to go at the numbers and
complete the sequence." (Walcott had just made a layup.) Meanwhile,
on radio, UCLA play-by-play man Chris Roberts--who has a curious
habit of calling games in the future tense, as in, "He'll throw it on
that far wing"--evidently spotted Walcott holding up his fingers,
prompting this call: "Walcott says, 'Let's run the five-play,
gentlemen.'"</LD>
<TE>   Walcott then jacked up a three-pointer. Ah, yes, "the five play."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to bemoan what has happened to sports broadcasting
without sounding like an old-school crank, but here goes: The
profession, corrupted by the imperatives of marketing and compromised
beyond repair by the influence of all-sports channels that cover an
NBA draft like a world summit, is now the province of serviceable
hacks straight out of central casting.</TE>
<TE>   On television, they fill carefully prescribed roles--the
play-by-play man, the sideline reporter, the in-studio analyst. Like
the populace of the idyllic town in "The Truman Show," everyone is
chirpy, but no one is quite real. Rather, they strive for just real
enough--for salesman real, with all the emotion of dinner theater.</TE>
<TE>   And so, before UCLA played Cal in the Pac-10 tournament at Staples
Center last month, there was Fox Sports Net announcer Bill Macdonald
nattering on about the Bruins' freshmen class. Their role on the
team, he said, was to "re-energize the energy." I thought about this
phrase: Re-energize the energy. Was it possible, given that I had
failed a science class in college, that Macdonald knew something
about the molecular structure of Pac-10 basketball that I didn't?</TE>
<TE>   But no, I had only caught Macdonald's goof because I had pad and
pen out--because, in short, I was listening to his voice. I was
trolling the dial, on the lookout for sportscaster gibberish, circa
2002. And what I concluded is this: You're not supposed to be
listening too closely to what these people are saying.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, sure, they want you to hear them, but only for verbal cues--as
in, please don't turn the channel because something utterly thrilling
is about to happen. Now that TV has exploded the demand for talent,
the game's true narrators are all technical--the cameras, the
informational graphics, the instant Internet poll questions, and the
sports ticker crawls that keep shrinking my screen, as if I'm
suddenly watching the game through the wrong end of binoculars.</TE>
<TE>   For the sports junkie, these aren't necessarily unwelcome
distractions. But the onslaught has juiced up the viewing experience,
leaving behind a human connection to the game. It's all hype, or
mostly hype. The announcer? He's just some guy trying to keep up with
the action.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that dynamic, novelist David Shields likens the current
breed of sportscasters to a man constantly running to catch a bus. As
a result, "their language has no rhythm or meaning or pace or
coherence," says Shields, who has written several works of
nonfiction, including "Black Planet: Facing Race During an NBA
Season."</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, Shields recalled the 1987 Chicago Cubs game
called by comedian Bill Murray. Murray was filling in that day for
the late Harry Carey, who at the time was recovering from a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this that terrible Foley up again?" Murray asked as Montreal
Expos infielder Tom Foley came to the plate. "Hey, Foley! Foley!
Strike out, Foley! I hate everything you stand for!"</TE>
<TE>   Murray's performance, exaggerated as it might have been, exposed
the phoniness with which most broadcasters approach a game. You don't
have to be quick-witted to be original (although it helps), you just
have to be willing to break character, to risk losing the viewer.
Dennis Miller didn't pan out as a commentator on ABC's "Monday Night
Football," but the instinct to put him in the booth was correct: If a
civilian was watching, what non-sportscaster things would he say?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, losing the viewer is not a risk anyone is willing to
take, particularly with all the options available and with ratings on
the decline for most sports. In this climate, the advertiser always
comes first.</TE>
<TE>   Because that is the real game, after all. As televised sports have
grown in importance as a means to grab coveted male viewers,
companies have increasingly superimposed their agendas on the field
of play.</TE>
<TE>   For no contextual reason, ABC anchored its coverage of last year's
college football Bowl Champion Series from California Adventure,
providing a running infomercial for parent company Disney's theme
park division.</TE>
<TE>   On basketball broadcasts, advertising has become so pervasive I
almost don't notice now when CBS or NBC or Fox Sports Net or ESPN
uses the five seconds between free throws to promote network product.
But I did notice what a pleasure it was to watch hockey games during
this year's Winter Olympics, because all the commercial stoppages
that often rob sports of its flow were mercifully absent.</TE>
<TE>   That was a rare example of the game coming before the
salesmanship, with NBC adhering to international rules that only 15
seconds elapse between face-offs. Normally, the hype imperative wins
out.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net, for example, covered this year's Pac-10 tournament
at Staples Center as if it were a political convention. On-site hosts
and sideline reporters babbled on about an event that was a mere
precursor to March Madness. In this chicken-and-egg equation, the
tournament was less for the players than for Fox, which ran countless
promos for "The Best Damned Sports Show Period," a comedy-sports
highlight show that, Fox hopes, will lure guys over from ESPN's
"Sports-Center," the clubhouse of choice for the male sports fan.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox show borrows liberally from sports talk radio, searching
for the day's hot topics and inventing them when none exists. It is
difficult to watch, and it lacks the rage of the radio call-in shows,
which have actually risen up to fill a void--providing those fans who
obsess over box scores an emotional release and counterpoint to the
happy blather of home-team-boosting announcers.</TE>
<TE>   This was nowhere more true than during the latest UCLA college
basketball season, broadcast on KXTA-AM (1150). The games, as called
by Roberts and color man Bob Myers, were stock affairs, described
with genial bias. It was possible, in fact, to listen to the entire
season and not know that anything was amiss--unless you stayed tuned
to the "Bruin Talk" post-game show, hosted by Steve Carbone, when a
torrent of angry callers regularly demanded that UCLA Coach Steve
Lavin be fired for the team's inconsistent play.</TE>
<TE>   The groundswell was so persistent that it didn't even matter after
a while who was right. Mostly, it was fascinating for its sheer
expression of outrage. Regardless, I wondered how Lavin was handling
it. This was a perspective the broadcasters, with their backstage
access to the team, never offered. I also wondered what Roberts and
Myers thought--again, perspective the two (who are employed by KXTA,
subject to the approval of UCLA's athletic department) don't usually
let seep into their broadcasts, which seem sanitized for the coach's
and university's protection.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the voices that break through the clutter do so
because they offer something of themselves. Roberts and Myers have to
observe a level of decorum, but must they remain so "Truman Show"
chirpy?</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, talk radio hosts Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian,
whose "The McDonnell-Douglas Show" is heard from 3 to 7 p.m. weekdays
on KSPN-AM (1110), have put in hard time in stadium clubs and press
rooms, and they have the confidence to veer entertainingly off-topic.
On television, the few personalities bucking the system include
Charles Barkley, the former NBA bad boy who does refreshing in-studio
commentary on cable's TNT; and Bill Walton, whose hyperbolic analysis
on Clippers games can give you a reason to keep watching an otherwise
sleepy mid-November game.</TE>
<TE>   And what about play-by-play? In Los Angeles, we're lucky, because
the local triumvirate--Scully, the Lakers' Chick Hearn and the Kings'
Bob Miller--remains.</TE>
<TE>   Well, sort of. Miller still does the hockey games but only on TV.
Hearn, sidelined this season by two major surgeries, is due back
April 9. At 85, Hearn may confuse player names, but he's such an
original that the word salad blends into his overall charm. Besides,
Hearn tells you when the Lakers look horrible.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball returns this week and with it Scully, who has been behind
the microphone for the Dodgers since 1950. As the culture of the team
changes, Scully remains a constant, calling games as if reciting one
of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" to a lecture hall full of English
majors, the game a convenient but not entirely necessary ingredient
in his narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Scully no longer does radio--not exclusively, anyway. Fans get him
on KXTA for the first two innings, but on a simulcast with one of the
Dodgers TV outlets (this season, Fox Sports Net will televise 80
games and KCOP 50).</TE>
<TE>   This is a shame for those of us who listen on the radio not for
the game, but for Scully's telling of it. If baseball is still a
radio game, the Dodgers are a television team--owned by Fox parent
News Corp., which has little incentive to boost the team's ratings on
radio because it doesn't own the station. (KXTA is part of the Clear
Channel Station group. Next year, the team jumps to Infinity-owned
KFWB.)</TE>
<TE>   Understanding Scully's iconic status, the Dodgers have every
reason to want to keep him close to the Dodger brand, and television
gives Scully room to pick his spots. In fact, he has often compared
doing a game on radio with painting a large, blank canvas, whereas TV
presents the imagery fully formed.</TE>
<TE>   But people who grew up with the more intimate version of
Scully--in the car, under the pillow at night, on the transistor
radio at the game--have had to adjust to a new reality in recent
years. For his part, Scully doesn't openly lament the technological
incursions.</TE>
<TE>   "For the sedentary person, for the person who is so interested
that he or she locks on the TV set, that [serves] a great purpose,"
he says, with his usual equanimity.</TE>
<TE>   There are advantages, to be sure, to experiencing things on TV: If
that Koufax perfect game were on the air today, we'd see an instant
replay of each strike, and countless camera angles would heighten the
tension. The obligatory excess would come after the game: player
reaction, expert studio analysis and highlights of what we'd just
seen.</TE>
<TE>   On the radio in 1965, Scully remained silent for more than half a
minute after Koufax fanned his last batter. What he'd witnessed, he
knew, needed time to be savored and digested. Plus, he says, he's
always loved the sound of the crowd. Would that the people currently
providing the pictures trusted us so implicitly.</TE>

<DH>For filmmakers and others, an ill-fated Antarctic quest has
morphed into a modern parable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY FORGIONE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In modern times, Ernest Shackleton's 1914 Antarctic expedition must
rank as the greatest story never told. His disastrous quest to be the
first to cross the frigid continent's 1,500 miles with sled dogs has
pretty much remained buried since it faded from the headlines more
than 80 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The British polar explorer and his 27-man crew never made it to
Antarctica but instead endured a two-year ordeal on ice--an ordeal
that amazingly all the men survived.</LD>
<LD>   "It's no accident the story retains the power it has because it
has a sort of classic dimension, larger than its time," said Kenneth
Branagh, who plays the charismatic Anglo-Irishman in the upcoming A&amp;E
miniseries "Shackleton." "And [there's] the parallel it holds for our
own experience, the absolutely implicit notion that you cannot fail
if you are trying. The story seems at the same time sort of
insignificant and also profoundly important."</LD>
<TE>   Important enough, it seems, to be the subject of no less than half
a dozen projects, including a $7.5-million Imax film shot in
Antarctica that re-creates the voyage, a $3.5-million feature
documentary, the A&amp;E miniseries, a "Nova" TV documentary, a
nationally touring museum exhibition and several books.</TE>
<TE>   (A possible big-screen Hollywood version of the Shackleton's tale
is still pending, however. German director Wolfgang Petersen ["Das
Boot," "The Perfect Storm"] has dreamed of making such a film for
more than a decade, according to a spokeswoman, but the project
remains on hold.)</TE>
<TE>   It is a saga that is fueling what has been called "Shackleton
fever."</TE>
<TE>   "It's been phenomenal," said Natasha Dworkin at the Burke Museum
of Natural History in Seattle, where the exhibition drew three times
the usual crowds before closing in December. "Seattle is in a
Shackleton vortex."</TE>
<TE>   Just one day shy of reaching Antarctica after leaving England on
Aug. 8, 1914, Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, became frozen solid
in the waters of the Weddell Sea. It was later crushed by the
powerful pressure of the ice and sank. For two years, Shackleton and
his men struggled to return to civilization while staving off
starvation and death--they camped on ice floes, rowed hundreds of
miles in tiny life boats on surging seas, and lived off seals and
penguins on a bleak, uninhabited island.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible for anyone to explain how 28 men lived for 635
days marooned, essentially, on an iceberg," said director George
Butler, who himself was trapped briefly in the same Antarctic ice
while filming the Imax movie "Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure." "The
story is one of the greatest stories ever. It's Homerian."</TE>
<TE>   In his day, Shackleton lived in the shadow of the steely Robert F.
Scott, who became an instant hero in Britain when he died after
planting a Union Jack on the South Pole in 1912. Although Norwegian
Roald Amundsen's team had beaten him to the pole in the biggest
exploration race of the early 20th century, Scott's icy end in a
blizzard just 11 miles from his camp set the nation mourning.</TE>
<TE>   Shackleton and his men, in contrast, returned from the maw of
white death in 1916 to an indifferent nation, one mired in the
staggering casualties of World War I, one where heroes were made on
the battlefield, not on the ice floes of the Antarctic.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Shackleton's star has risen almost as fast as Rudy
Giuliani's--and for many of the same reasons. As a terrorized America
redefines its notion of heroism and as Shackleton's story sweeps into
pop culture, this forgotten explorer is emerging as a hero for our
time, a man who saved his men by putting their welfare above all
else.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a particular kind of hero for Americans," said Susanne
Simpson, executive producer of the 40-minute Imax film, which debuted
in New York in February 2001 and was co-produced by White Mountain
Films and Nova/WGBH Boston. "He's extremely optimistic, he believes
in teamwork and he dedicated himself to saving his men. He did make
mistakes, but the truth is he did his personal best, and in this case
his personal best was that everybody survived."</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the drawn-out saga to the small, big and extra-big screen
was both a logistical nightmare and a filmmaker's dream. The
nightmare--filming on location at the edge of constantly changing
ice--dogged the Imax crew off Antarctica and the A&amp;E cast off
Greenland. But the dream was drawing on original photographs and film
footage shot by crew member Frank Hurley, an Australian photographer
Shackleton had hired to document the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Director Butler's 2000 feature film, made with his White Mountain
Films and Nova/WGBH Boston, was the highest grossing theatrical
documentary in 2001, taking in a little more than $2 million to date,
according to Daily Variety. Narrated by Liam Neeson, "The Endurance:
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition" (which carries the same
title and is based on the touring museum exhibition and its
accompanying book) tells the story in a straightforward way, using
Hurley's arresting images interspersed with interviews with
historians and descendants of crew members. One of the most chilling
scenes is that of the breakup and sinking of the Endurance, a moment
Hurley records in his diary: "Awful calamity that has overtaken the
ship that has been our home for over 12 months....We are homeless and
adrift on the sea ice."</TE>
<TE>   In "Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure," the Imax film also directed
by Butler, location and authenticity were key to the re-creation. "In
the perspective of Imax, it's really important that the audience
experience being there," executive producer Simpson said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's A&amp;E's dramatic miniseries "Shackleton," airing April 7-8,
that attempts to flesh out a more telling portrait of the explorer,
warts and all. In the first part, writer-director Charles Sturridge
shows Shackleton as a hapless but enthusiastic businessman talking up
his expedition to potential contributors while remaining largely
indifferent to his wife and children. "His personal and family life
were very confused," Sturridge said. "He was not a perfect father,
not a perfect husband and he had numerous affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Shackleton's voyage into modern times started about three years
ago with a cat, specifically one Mrs. Chippy who was a passenger on
the Endurance.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Caroline Alexander was transfixed by the story of what
Shackleton named the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no intention of writing the Endurance story," she recalled.
"I was entranced with these little references to the cat and, in a
way, I felt the other stuff had all been written."</TE>
<TE>   She wrote and published "Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition," which she
described as "a diary of sorts written through the eyes of a very
complacent, self-assured, pompous cat who clearly believed at the
back of his mind that he's running the expedition." (Despite the
name, Mrs. Chippy turned out to be a male.)</TE>
<TE>   Traveling to England and reading crew members' original diaries at
the Royal Geographic Society in London and the Scott Polar Research
Institute in Cambridge, Alexander made another startling discovery.
"I was stunned to see there was an enormous collection [of
photographs] and the quality of the images was world-class,"
Alexander said. She had found the work of Hurley, whom Shackleton had
hired after selling off exclusive photo and film rights.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander immediately realized the value of the powerful
photographs and persuaded the American Museum of Natural History in
New York to mount an exhibition. The show needed a catalog, and, as
Alexander tells it, "that's how I came to write the story of the
grown-up men and not the cat."</TE>
<TE>   In her book "The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic
Expedition," Alexander portrays "the Boss," as his crew
affectionately called him, as a leader who fostered a close
camaraderie with his men, regardless of their stations on the ship.
He kept them on strict routines of exercising the sled dogs,
scrubbing the decks and cooking while the ship was stuck in the ice.
In the bleak evenings, they would entertain each other by singing or,
one night, with a haircut contest in which they took turns shearing
off each other's locks--an event Hurley captured on film.</TE>
<TE>   The crew spent a year on the static ship before watching it
succumb to the pressure of the ice, dragging off precious supplies
and three 21-foot rescue boats. Meanwhile, the fate of the Endurance
was unknown back in England.</TE>
<TE>   When the ice began to break up, Shackleton ordered the men into
the life boats. They rowed about 100 miles for more than a week
before landing on Elephant Island, a land so forbidding no ships ever
visited. "It's the outpost of the devil," said Butler, who stopped
there six times in the course of filming.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Shackleton took five men in the sole remaining
seaworthy boat on a 750-mile journey in hopes of reaching a whaling
station on South Georgia Island. Hurricane-force winds forced them to
land on the uninhabited side of the island, which left Shackleton and
two of the men with no recourse but to cross the island's uncharted
mountains on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "At every juncture in the Shackleton story, some kind of miracle
took place," Butler said. "Here are three men who don't have a map,
don't know how to get around the mountain ranges in front of them ...
and they traveled mostly at night."</TE>
<TE>   The three walked for 36 hours straight and finally heard the first
sign of civilization--a whistle blowing at the whaling station--they
had experienced in a year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   In the Imax film, three world-class mountaineers--Reinhold
Messner, Conrad Anker and Stephen Venables--followed the route
Shackleton took across South Georgia Island.</TE>
<TE>   Even with modern equipment and clothing--and the luxury of not
having lived out in the Antarctic for more than a year--it took the
team three days to complete the crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Anker said that for the most part, he and his climbing partners
faithfully followed Shackleton's footsteps, though the terrain had
changed dramatically. "The Boss was an awesome guy. He always said,
'Onward,'" Anker said."</TE>
<TE>   After a few abortive rescue attempts, Shackleton returned to
Elephant Island three months later, on Aug. 30, 1916, to find all 22
men still alive. He scribbled a note to his wife: "I have done
it....Not a life lost and we have been through Hell."</TE>
<TE>   It was Alexander's book and Hurley's photos that inspired Butler,
director of the 1977 documentary "Pumping Iron," to team with
Nova/WGBH Boston to direct the Imax film and to make the documentary
feature.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurley became this marvelous witness to the event," Butler said.
"He needed 200 pounds of equipment just to expose a frame of film. He
had to hand-crank [the movie camera] at a perfect 19 frames per
second, with no assistant in subzero conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Hurley's photographs are the heart of the exhibition scheduled to
come to the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History on June 9.</TE>
<TE>   After his dramatic survival and perseverance on the Endurance,
Shackleton died on South Georgia Island in 1922 at age 47.</TE>
<TE>   He had embarked on an ill-defined expedition to the Antarctic with
some of his crew members from the Endurance but suffered a massive
heart attack when they reached South Georgia--dying on the very
island he had struggled to cross six years earlier with the sole
thought of saving his men.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what speaks to contemporary audiences most about
Shackleton is how he kept up the hopes of his crew, carefully
monitoring his men for signs of despair. He refused, for example, to
allow them to stockpile large numbers of penguins and seals for food,
fearing it would dull their motivation to go home.</TE>
<TE>   Noted "Shackleton" miniseries director Sturridge: "He had the
ability to simultaneously tell the truth to his companions while also
giving them something to hope for."</TE>

<LD>Two minutes in the water and you're dead.</LD>
<LD>   The safety mantra had been drilled into the cast and crew of the
miniseries "Shackleton" over and over before they started filming
late last year in the arctic waters off the coast of Greenland, a
northern seascape that would stand in for Antarctica.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't until actor Kenneth Branagh stepped into a small
wooden boat at the edge of the icy ocean--and the safety boats
retreated so the helicopter could get a wide shot--that dark thoughts
suddenly surfaced.</LD>
<TE>   "That's when we started to think, 'What are we going to do if
anything goes wrong?' They'll be awhile getting to us, possibly more
than the two minutes we have," Branagh recalled by phone from
England. "It was a bit nerve-racking, at which point the
walkie-talkie, our contact with the helicopter, fell in the water.
And we certainly did feel cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Director Charles Sturridge had a keen appreciation of what he was
putting his actors and crew through, particularly because it was only
the second day of shooting the story of polar explorer Ernest
Shackleton and his ill-fated expedition aboard the Endurance.</TE>
<TE>   "After all the conversations about safety ... suddenly you find
yourself with nobody else in sight and these huge great chunks of ice
whooshing up and down, like being in the top of somebody else's gin
and tonic," he said. "There's a kind of roar in the background, which
is the helicopter [filming from above], and they started to row. And
they rowed as if their lives depended on it and, frankly, they did."</TE>
<TE>   Sturridge didn't intend to shoot the boat scenes, which re-create
the perilous journey Shackleton's men made to Elephant Island in
1916, in such dangerous waters. The plan was to film that segment
back in England's calmer seas.</TE>
<TE>   But their ship was temporarily stuck in the ice--just like
Shackleton's, about eight decades earlier--and the Endurance replica
was two days behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned the hard way, what Shackleton learned the hard way:
There is no way to be prepared for sea ice other than recognizing
that it's going to be different every half-hour," he said. "It is
completely unpredictable and you have to adapt to what it does."</TE>
<TE>   Although the story of the 1914 expedition is being retold in many
projects, Branagh is the only one to portray the charismatic
Shackleton in a dramatic telling of the explorer's effort to save the
lives of his 27 crew members after their boat became frozen in icy
Antarctic waters and sank. The miniseries, a $50-million
collaboration between A&amp;E and Britain's Channel Four International,
is scheduled to air on A&amp;E April 7-8. In the miniseries, Branagh
deftly captures the charisma of this larger-than-life leader, from
his flaws--he was an unfaithful husband, an errant father and a
woeful businessman--to his triumphs, the deft and cheerful leader who
saved the lives of his men.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite in many ways having caused some of the problems he was
faced with ... [it's] his determination to preserve the lives of
those men that seems equally or perhaps more heroic than the race for
the prize that often seemed to guide other expeditions," Branagh
said.</TE>

<HD>Made in Japan</HD>
<DH>The nation is producing unique pop visions, not U.S.
knockoffs. But a bubblegum duo outsells all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning, there was Shonen Knife. During the late-'80s
formation of Alternative Nation, this vinyl-clad female power trio
established Japanese bands as a force in the U.S. with its ironic but
heartfelt Ramones-like attack. Sure, the songs were about obsessions
with household cleaning products or Barbie dolls. But the group
toured with Nirvana in 1991, and as "Nevermind" exploded into the
defining sound of Seattle and everything post-punk, a fair amount of
fame splashed on Shonen Knife as well.</LD>
<LD>   After that came the deluge, of sorts, and the '90s saw a
mini-invasion of Japanese bands, almost all of them strictly
alternative. From the cutesy of Shonen Knife or the Pooh Sticks to
the free-music bombast of the Boredoms and Ruins, from the serious
noise damage of Merzbow and the Stooges fetishism of Guitar Wolf to
probably the best-known Japanese acts, Cibo Matto and Pizzicato 5,
all were painted with the broad brush of novelty or homage.</LD>
<LD>   Until now. The new releases by Japanese indie rockers Buffalo
Daughter and electronica survivor Cornelius have finally transcended
pastiche, irony and note-perfect affectations to deliver original pop
visions. They may finally move the genre of Japanese indie music
beyond the smiling Hello Kitty gift-shop dolls, stickers and trinkets
that for many Americans define Japanese pop culture.</LD>
<TE>   Buffalo Daughter and Cornelius can enjoy a new space for
adventurous music marked by Radiohead's moody "Kid A" and "Amnesiac,"
which topped album charts and challenged established notions of pop
music. At the same time, this summer sees a U.S. tour by a major
Japanese mainstream pop--or J-Pop--act, Puffy AmiYumi, an adorable
bubblegum duo that's sold 14 million albums in Japan. Given the
fairly sustained mania over Britney, boy bands and upbeat fluff in
this country, could it be the right moment for the two to break out
of their Japanese-only niche? Either way, these events would seem to
mark the death of J-kitsch as an ironic statement. Goodbye, Hello
Kitty.</TE>
<TE>   What musical force lies waiting beyond the novelty? Is Japan
burgeoning with acts that American ears were simply not ready to
hear? These three acts offer a glimpse into the future of Japanese
music on this side of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   With their fifth full-length album, "I" (on the independent
Emperor Norton label), Buffalo Daughter has finally delivered on the
original promise of Shonen Knife: great indie rock music The band has
emerged from its acknowledged obsessions with '60s and '70s
electronica to come up with a sound from a less-identifiable place, a
place only Buffalo Daughter knows. Guitarist, singer and principal
songwriter SuGar Yoshinaga describes it as the sound of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "When we made this record, we didn't have a passion for any
particular music that was played around in the world," says
Yoshinaga, 35. "We were not listening to any new records. We kind of
tried to make this record from nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   From the unhurried, softly repeating opening lines of "Ivory" to
the lovely marimba-and-vocal closer, "A Completely Identical Dream,"
Buffalo Daughter's nowhere is a fascinating place to be. It is also a
place defined by statements rather than references, setting it apart
from the work of Japanese pop bands that have come before it,
including Buffalo Daughter's own albums.</TE>
<TE>   Singing in English, the Buffalo gals--the band includes Yumiko
Ohno on bass, electronics and vocals, and Mooog Yamamoto on
turntables--take their time moving calmly from experimental vocal
pieces to ecstatic disco. Most notable on the album--which has
enjoyed critical raves and sales of 20,000 in Japan since its release
there in November--is the terrific, straight-ahead rock song
"Volcanic Girl," with perfect guitar hooks for modern rock radio.</TE>
<TE>   What inspired the bold leap from obscuro Kraftwerk references and
Flying Lizards quotes on "New Rock," which sold 11,000 copies in the
U.S. and 35,000 in Japan, to sounds that are so easy to like?</TE>
<TE>   "We get tired of being told that we're playing weird kind of
music," Yoshinaga says. "With this album, we want people to think
that Buffalo Daughter can play normal popular kind of music."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that we can find all the fans of the past record and
hopefully build from there based on the strength of the record," says
Emperor Norton's marketing chief, Van Riker.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks "Volcanic Girl" will be a home run on college radio but
is cautious about its mainstream prospects. "To think that it would
do more than that, given the expense that it takes to make a record
happen at commercial radio, would cancel out any profit to be made."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Buffalo Daughter is busy shattering its creative niche.
Yoshinaga notes that this is a more mature album for Buffalo
Daughter, and thinks similarly accomplished work is coming from
electronic artist Cornelius and bouncy electro-pop innovator Takako
Minekawa. The shift, though, is toward more accomplished songs and
compositions, not away from the eclecticism of Japanese pop.</TE>
<TE>   "In Tokyo, it's really easy to access musics from Brazil to India
to Tibet, wherever," Yoshinaga says. "We can listen to all those
kinds of musics at the same time, equally, and we love all those
kinds of music equally. So we try to pull together the things we love
about them. That's why Japanese music sounds differently than
American music."</TE>
<TE>   On his new album, "Point" (on the Matador label), Cornelius (real
name: Keigo Oyamada) took a long slow walk through that Tokyo
soundscape and found in it a vein of lovely, Brazilian-inflected
vocal pop. It's a sure-footed giant step away from his 1998 album,
"Fantasma," which had more hip-hop references. It sold 29,000 in this
country and shipped 350,000 in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   With the track "Point of View Point," it's easy to forget that he
works from samples and synthesizers. At the very least he has
reclaimed them as tools of innovation.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing miles of style from the Association's "Cherish," Eno's
"Music for Airports" and the breezy guitar of '60s Brazil, Cornelius
has a series of abstract, upbeat utterances--"view point/left right
top point"--surrender to a strangely swinging flow.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow it's an update of "South American Getaway," Burt
Bacharach's brilliant vocal piece for the soundtrack to the 1969 film
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." With these vocal treatments,
Cornelius has located a guitar-and-drum-based music unlike any heard
before.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old still calls himself Cornelius (after the simian
hero of "Planet of the Apes"), but gone from his work are the hip-hop
urges for clever musical quotes.</TE>
<TE>   He says that he approached "Fantasma" like a fifth-grader--all cut
and paste--but approached "Point" like a grandpa, where everything
had to have interrelated meaning. Each piece has its own sustained
theme and lyrics, most of them in English. Like Buffalo Daughter, he
has moved beyond even the neat sound collector's tricks that made him
popular with the alternative set here and in Japan. When he arrives
at the final track, "Nowhere"--could a Japanese indie theme be
developing?--he has revealed a new psychic terrain beyond homage that
Japanese artists have so far delivered only in their mind-blowing
anime visuals.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Daughter and Cornelius have at least one more thing in
common: They are not famous. Bands in Japan are known either as
"famous"--i.e., celebrity acts--or "not famous," meaning indie or
alternative. Their chances of becoming famous in this country are
also slim, but they are laying a groundwork for original music to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Puffy AmiYumi may be using a similar tactic--even though it is
outrageously "famous." Like Smap, Japan's answer to 'N Sync, it is
huge in Asia and unknown here. In contrast to the 14 million CDs
Puffy AmiYumi has sold in Japan, its only U.S. release, 2001's
"Spike," sold 3,000 copies. But comparisons to vocal acts such as 'N
Sync and Jessica Simpson are exactly what makes the two women, Ami
Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura, feel that now is a good time to come to the
U.S. The dominance of producer-driven acts here suggests that
American tastes have come around in some small way to their kind of
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   As Onuki and Yoshimura swirl into a small tea shop in West L.A.'s
Sawtelle Avenue Japantown, the college-age girls behind the counter
explode like startled birds. Throughout the place, whispering starts
and anxious faces press against the front window. The singers, both
in their late 20s, are decked out in super-hip casual, Onuki in a
black jacket from Tokyo's trendy Bathing Ape shop and Yoshimura in
green fatigue pants and a souvenir shirt from New York that reads:
"No one who was there will ever be the same." Suddenly, every young
Japanese person in the place is holding a camera, politely waiting
for a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The two order boba milk tea, a sugary Taiwanese liquid poured over
blobs of blue tapioca and sucked through an extra-wide straw. It's a
pure pop drink and they are pure pop, true stars whose concerts fill
stadiums, who have their own TV variety show and lines of shoes and
collectible toys.</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of turf to defend, Onuki and Yoshimura aren't
singing songs from Buffalo Daughter's "nowhere." They're a classic
pop vocal duo with cleverly updated versions of Big '80s sounds,
which they call "Nouvell [sic] Vintage Rock." Their new U.S. release,
"An Illustrated History of Puffy AmiYumi" (on the Bar/None label), is
a compilation of their Japanese hits. Even coming to do their
interview in Japantown is an indication of where they're probably
going to find their fans.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Hill, a Bar/None representative for Puffy AmiYumi,
says that this is a grass-roots approach.</TE>
<TE>   "Bar/None will establish their credibility with the indie crowd,
the kind of people who appreciate vintage new wave, dance and
alt-rock, and then it has a chance to push into the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people know us here yet," says Yoshimura, speaking
through an interpreter, "so the people who want to see us here will
be really into the niche, J-Pop thing, as a kind of fanatic."</TE>
<TE>   The end of irony may have helped Buffalo Daughter and Cornelius,
but it may hurt Puffy Ami- Yumi.</TE>
<TE>   The duo's brand of J-Pop is driven by honest stylistic tribute,
but to American ears it may sound secondhand. As "Illustrated
History" bounces from easy-going Go-Go's new wave to a clever ELO
feel to straight-up Beatles, it becomes plain that these are stylists
of the first order.</TE>
<TE>   The carefully harvested sounds are blended by studio wizards Tamio
Okuda and former Jellyfish drummer Andy Sturmer, but the songs are
only a backdrop. From '70s disco to '50s rockabilly to a junked-up
Brazilian samba, the signature vocal harmonies--what Onuki refers to
as "Puffy's magic"--remain consistent throughout, making it clear
what matters here: two stars singing.</TE>
<TE>   Two stars singing in Japanese, to boot, with the exception of the
two English songs. But Onuki says they're going to bring their full
J-Pop touring production to the U.S. in mid-summer, undubbed. "The
songs Tamio Okada wrote for us have lyrics that are really beautiful,
but we don't know if these will translate well into English or not.
It's hard to say if the language is going to be a barrier."</TE>
<TE>   Could it be J-Pop's moment? Puffy AmiYumi is at least stepping
into friendly waters, with a young American radio public acclimated
to singing stars and producer-driven clone bands. The playful,
squeaky-clean image might go over with young girls in particular.</TE>
<TE>   But in this post-ironic moment, Onuki and Yoshimura are going to
have to find something original in their Japanese take on pop music
or style, something audiences can appropriate as their own--in the
way they've appropriated the Latina sass and sexiness of J-Lo or
Shakira or Christina Aguilera.</TE>
<TE>   Like Buffalo Daughter, who is touring in May, or Cornelius, who's
coming later in the summer, they'll still need to trigger that most
American of responses: aha, something new.</TE>

<HD>Art for Architecture's Sake</HD>
<DH>Which is more important--the building or the collection it
houses? Museums are facing an identity crisis.</DH>

<LD>It is a stock art-world tale. In 1949, Guggenheim Museum director
James Johnson Sweeney squared off against architecture's reigning
genius, Frank Lloyd Wright, who was designing the museum's landmark
Fifth Avenue building. Wright fought for the interests of his
architecture; Sweeney defended the interests of art. Wright won. The
result was a remarkable work of architecture and a difficult place to
show art.</LD>
<LD>   The story captures the often open disdain art-world insiders feel
for the architects who design museums. The implication is that the
greater the architect's reputation, the more art suffers.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few years, the completion of a number of high-profile
museum designs has only reinforced that cynicism. The opening in 1997
of Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and Richard
Meier's Getty Center in Los Angeles created a new audience for
architecture. Since then, museums everywhere have launched ambitious
building programs to raise their profiles. Among the most recent are
two new Guggenheim museums in Las Vegas, both by the radical Dutch
architect Rem Koolhaas, Tadao Ando's Pulitzer Foundation in St. Louis
and a major addition to the Milwaukee Museum of Art by Santiago
Calatrava.</LD>
<TE>   That trend shows no sign of slowing. Zaha Hadid's Museum of
Contemporary Art in Cincinnati and Diller &amp; Scofidio's Institute of
Contemporary Art in Boston are scheduled to open in 2004. An
$800-million expansion of New York's Museum of Modern Art, designed
by Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi, will be unveiled in 2005. UN
Studio's addition to the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in
Hartford, Conn., is scheduled for completion in 2006, as is Gehry's
addition to the Corcoran Museum of Art in Washington, D.C. And
Koolhaas is working on the design for a new Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Architects have welcomed this attention as proof of the
profession's growing cultural relevance. But many art world insiders
are skeptical. Increasingly, architecture has become the central
focus, and, in the process, it has pushed art into the background.</TE>
<TE>   "I think museums have emerged as the primary civic buildings of
their time," says Glenn D. Lowry, director of New York's Museum of
Modern Art, "and that has led to competition among institutions to
create the most spectacular buildings imaginable. The assumption is
that the building will galvanize a community and ignite the kind of
financial support that would later lead to a better collection, a
bigger endowment. But that's a tenuous proposition. In many cases,
the buildings have far outstripped the importance of the
collections."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the diminishing importance of displaying art in the art
museum is nothing new. For at least two decades, museums have been
courting bigger audiences to pump up attendance. As a result, the
identity of the art museum has radically changed. Art is now one
component in a constellation of activities that the contemporary
museum provides, including bookstores, restaurants, theaters and gift
shops. And the definition of the art museum's function has become
more elusive than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Architecture has contributed to that instability. The desire of
many museum boards to make a strong statement with their buildings
has encouraged architects to break old conventions. And that new
sense of freedom has sometimes led to muddled results. But just as
often, architects have imbued these works with a high level of
creative energy, showing a deep respect for the art their buildings
house.</TE>
<TE>   These architects are proving that art and architecture can not
only coexist, they can engage in a lively creative dialogue, one that
ups the cultural ante for both.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, when a museum design fails, the fault can be
traced to the motives of the institution's board. Many museums see a
high-profile building project as a convenient marketing tool. A
second-rate institution may use architecture to hide the mediocrity
of its collection. The assumption is that the average museum visitor
is only mildly knowledgeable about art, and that the museum has to
provide a host of distractions to hold the visitor's attention.</TE>
<TE>   An example is the $1.2-billion Getty Center. Meier's design
conceived the Getty as a temple for high art, set high above the city
on a secluded hillside in Brentwood. The Getty's collections are
housed in a series of interconnected pavilions, organized around a
tranquil, central court. The galleries, an elegant enfilade of
well-lighted rooms, are perfectly fine places to view art.</TE>
<TE>   But the galleries have to compete with a number of other
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors ride the Disney-like tram up the hillside, slip past the
gleaming white forms of the Getty Trust offices and Conservation
Institute, and step out onto a travertine plaza. From there, they can
stroll through the splendid Robert Irwin-designed garden, eat lunch
at the cafe or restaurant, or wander into the Research Institute. It
is possible to spend an entire day there and completely ignore the
museum. The real attraction is the Getty experience.</TE>
<TE>   The primary culprit is Harold M. Williams, the Getty's president
and chief executive from 1981 to 1998. It was Williams and his board
who decided to isolate the museum from the lifeblood of the city,
setting it in a residential neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   That initial decision provoked the ire of the Brentwood community,
which subsequently forced the museum to locate parking at the bottom
of the hill, three-quarters of a mile from the museum buildings.
Williams also led the fight to transform the Getty into a complex of
art-related activities, relegating its collections to secondary
status.</TE>
<TE>   Meier's design reflects that vision. The architect could have
designed the museum as a more inward-looking, self-contained
experience. Instead, upon entering the museum courtyard, the eye is
drawn out toward the landscape and away from the museum's pavilions.</TE>
<TE>   A more extreme example of art as sideshow can be found in the
Milwaukee Museum of Art, which opened in December. The museum's
director, Russell Bowman, asked his architect for a compelling public
gathering place--"the thing," he says, "that will make the museum a
community." And that's exactly what he got.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by the talented Spanish architect and engineer Santiago
Calatrava, the museum's dominant feature, the reception hall, is a
glass-and-steel bird-like form that rests at the edge of Lake
Michigan. Two enormous brise-soleils, or sunscreens, envelop the
structure's sides. Their forms open and close like gigantic wings to
shade the hall's interior.</TE>
<TE>   Calatrava took great care to link the building to the city's
historic core. A narrow bridge leads from Milwaukee's main formal
axis, Wisconsin Avenue, down into the hall. As visitors enter, a
stunning view opens up to the lake, and the cathedral-like roof of
the hall soars overhead. To one side, two long corridors--which
border the new temporary exhibition galleries--lead to the existing
museum buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The hall reflects the city's grand civic ambitions. The only
artwork in the space is an Alexander Calder mobile hanging near the
entry. Except for an occasional fund-raising event, the hall will
function as Milwaukee's biggest, most spellbinding lobby. A boardroom
overlooks the space through a large, curved window. A restaurant is
tucked underneath, on a lower level, with a view out to the water.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, art is an afterthought. The long corridors, lined with
muscular white arches, have a dreamy quality that holds visitors'
attention. The galleries, meanwhile, are so discreet they seem almost
invisible. The museum's main collection of contemporary art and
American decorative arts seems like part of another world entirely:
the tough, Brutalist forms of the 1950s and 1970s-era structures.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that art museums aren't being treated as
mundane, cost-efficient containers," says James Cuno, president of
the American Assn. of Museum Directors, in New York, and the director
of the Harvard University Art Museums.</TE>
<TE>   "But you only have a certain amount of money to invest, and when
the museum strives to become a logo for the city, it can be at the
expense of the art." A museum's priority, Cuno adds, should be
building its collections.</TE>
<TE>   There are more subtle ways to mishandle a museum's design. New
York's new Museum of American Folk Art, for example, is one of the
most thoughtful buildings to rise in Manhattan in a long time.
Designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, the structure's narrow,
five-story facade is divided into three triangular steel plates that
cave in slightly at the center, as if straining to protect the art
from the pressures of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, light spills down from a skylight at the top of a soaring,
slot-like atrium. A complex sequence of staircases circulates up
through the space, bringing visitors back to the main atrium at each
turn. The stairs, some made of rough concrete, others of wood, give
each floor its distinct identity.</TE>
<TE>   But the relentless focus on circulation pushes the art into the
background. The grand, ceremonial stair that leads to the third floor
is needlessly big. A luminous resin screen that lines the main
staircase looks fussy. By comparison, the galleries, which are set
parallel to the atrium, are tight and narrow. Both the architecture
and the art suffer from the subsequent lack of clarity.</TE>
<TE>   One response to the mess that many art museums have become is to
create smaller, more intimate venues that serve a more discerning
public rather than mass audience. The recently opened Pulitzer
Foundation in St. Louis is such a museum. Founded by Emily Rauh
Pulitzer to house her collection, the building is modestly scaled. It
has no bookstore or cafe, and it is open to the public only twice a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Pulitzer hired Tadao Ando to design the museum in 1993, and the
deft manipulation of space that has made the architect famous is
immediately apparent. Seen from the street, the building's blank
concrete facade evokes Frank Lloyd Wright's 1906 Unity Temple in Oak
Park, Ill. An intimate entry court is set at the corner of the
building. From there, visitors pass through a small reception area
before turning back into the central hall. In a series of quick,
compact moves, the outside world is left far behind.</TE>
<TE>   From this central space, the design splits into two parallel
wings. Most of the art is contained in the wing farthest from the
entry; the other wing houses a library and offices. A long reflecting
pool is set between them, giving the space a remarkable serenity.</TE>
<TE>   Ando worked closely with two artists, Ellsworth Kelly and Richard
Serra, as he fine-tuned the design, and the artists' works dominate
the building. Kelly's 28-foot-high painting "Blue Black," for
example, hangs at the far end of the main gallery. Seen from that
distance, the work has a soothing quality, evoking a distant horizon.
A broad stair leads down to the base of the painting, which looms
like a primitive icon.</TE>
<TE>   Serra's work, one of his "Torqued Spiral" series, stands in an
open-air court beyond the library and offices. A long slot window is
set in the library at the exact height of the top of the massive
steel spiral, a sort of architectural teaser. Outside, a series of
shallow steps creates a long, drawn out procession to the sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   The effect is almost too reverential. But the project's power
stems from the fact that architecture is allowed to assert itself.
Three of the foundation's best works, for example--two Rothkos and a
black Serra painting--hang in a small gallery set behind Kelly's
"Blue Black." The room is a cube, and the paintings look exquisite.
Turn back, and the doorway frames a view through a slot window
overlooking the reflecting pool. The bands of contrasting
surfaces--water, concrete, glass--are an abstract image of almost
equally haunting beauty.</TE>
<TE>   At other moments, visitors are allowed to escape the art entirely.
In the main hall, a narrow staircase leads up to a mezzanine. The
roof seems to float above this room, supported on a single, heavy
concrete column. Large windows open onto two rooftop terraces and a
garden planted with pygmy bamboo.</TE>
<TE>   A similarly elegant response can be found in Porto, Portugal, in
Alvaro Siza's Serralves Museum, which opened in 1999. The buildings'
low, abstract white forms are set at the edge of a hill in a park
that was built for the Count of Vizela in the 1930s as part of a
private compound.</TE>
<TE>   With typical delicacy, Siza sited his building so as not to
disturb existing pathways and trees. A low white wall and a narrow
bridge guide visitors into the museum buildings. A series of outdoor
courtyards breaks up the buildings into distinct components--the
theater, offices and galleries. The courtyards become increasingly
small in scale, so as visitors approach the galleries, the landscape
recedes in importance.</TE>
<TE>   With its park-like setting, the Serralves suggests what the Getty
could have become in other hands. The exquisite balance of art,
architecture and nature creates an experience of unsurpassed harmony.
The long, pure lines of the building's forms sharpen the eye rather
than distract it. The procession through the courtyards calms the
mind, preparing it for the engagement with art.</TE>
<TE>   In their aura of cozy domesticity, both the Pulitzer and the
Serralves owe an obvious debt to an earlier museum project, the 1987
Menil Foundation in Houston. Designed by Italian architect Renzo
Piano, the Menil was founded by a single patron, the late art
collector and philanthropist Dominique de Menil. Its gentle,
horizontal form is clad in clapboard siding supported on a steel
frame, echoing the scale and domesticity of the neighborhood's
1920s-era bungalows.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, small, glass-enclosed garden courts evoke the courtyard of
De Menil's house, a few miles away, designed by Philip Johnson in
1949. The museum's galleries, which house a rich collection of mostly
African and 20th century art, are generously scaled. The light, which
filters down through a louvered roof system, is exquisite.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, many curators have held up the Menil as a
perfect balance of art and architecture, a sanctuary where the beauty
of the forms does nothing to detract from contemplation of the
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think big museums provide a very broad range of experiences,"
Pulitzer says, "but one of the problems they have is this deadening
of the senses. Room after room of paintings--sooner or later you get
bleary-eyed. I wanted to give people the kind of experience that I
had looking at a work of art."</TE>
<TE>   The desire to escape to a more tranquil world points to a
philosophical split in the museum world. It assumes that the function
of a museum is to serve a relatively small cultured community. These
buildings demand a measure of time and patience to absorb both the
architectural and artistic experience. Their low profile and relative
seclusion create a natural screening process. Only those who are
truly drawn by the work will make the pilgrimage to see it.</TE>
<TE>   But it does not follow that art cannot constructively engage a
larger public. Nor does it follow that appealing to a broader
audience will inevitably lead to a decline in standards. On the
contrary, the mission of the traditional museum has always been to
bring great works to a mass audience. The wonder of older museums,
like Florence's Uffizi Gallery, is that they have become a part of
everyday life, no more or less important than a cineplex. And many
architects still believe that their talents can be used to anchor art
in a broader, contemporary public discourse.</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim remains one of the least
understood buildings in recent memory. Gehry's mission, as he saw it,
was to root art in the postindustrial landscape. As such, Gehry and
Guggenheim director Thomas Krens chose a site at the intersection of
the city's Nervion River and a rusted industrial bridge. The
building's exuberant, titanium-clad forms wrap under the bridge, as
if to embrace the surrounding context. A reverse grand stair leads
down to the building's entry, allowing the city's energy to spill
into the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, the museum could not be further in spirit from
Calatrava's Milwaukee Museum of Art. The lobby atrium spirals up to
the sky in an explosion of undulating, sexually charged forms. The
galleries branch off from this central space in various directions.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Gehry created a range of gallery types. Conventional
galleries are set inside a series of boxy, rectangular rooms. An
enormous, warehouse-like gallery--which recalls the belly of a
whale--spreads out along the river. Three smaller, odd-shaped
galleries are set between these forms.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to liberate the artist from the White Box. "We didn't
want fussy galleries, but we wanted a range," Gehry says. "So the
stodgy galleries were for the artists that were dead and couldn't
defend themselves. The more contentious spaces were for the artists
who are living."</TE>
<TE>   Creating such spaces was risky. It meant letting go of accepted
conventions. Even Gehry admits some of the galleries need
fine-tuning. The big gallery, he now says, would work better if it
were broken up by a series of partitions.</TE>
<TE>   But the power of Bilbao stems from its desire to aggressively
engage contemporary realities, rather than retreat to a sentimental
version of the past. It is a museum of the people, and as such, it
makes art seem accessible and relevant, a fundamental part of our
everyday lives.</TE>
<TE>   In Berlin, Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum employs a similar
strategy. The building's zigzagging shell carves aggressively across
its urban site. Its shimmering zinc-clad skin--cut open with hundreds
of slash-like windows--reflects the colors of the surrounding
cityscape. It is a startling apparition. Sometimes it has an almost
brutal edge; at other times it seems surprisingly calming--depending
on the light and time of day.</TE>
<TE>   To get inside, visitors must first enter the neoclassical Berlin
Museum next door, in effect taking a detour through the city's
historic past. From there they climb down a dark, broad staircase
before rising back up to the main galleries, which house an
exhibition of Jewish culture in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   The galleries are simple spaces; there are no fussy details. Five
large "voids" carve up through the space. The voids represent the
absence caused by the Holocaust. But they do nothing to disturb the
tranquillity of the galleries. Instead, they act as a device to
trigger the memory. As visitors moves through the exhibits, they
carry the recollection of that absence with them, so that it provides
a constant context for the art. It is a stunning experience.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another promising direction can be gleaned from two recent
projects by Koolhaas, one of the profession's most daring thinkers.
The first is the Guggenheim-Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas, completed
in October. The museum is small--7,660 square feet. Set inside the
Venetian Resort on the Vegas strip, it is enveloped in gaudy
distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' design seems simple at first. The museum is conceived as
a long rectangle, its four walls fabricated of heavy Cor-Ten steel
panels. Inside, three pivoting panels allow curators to reconfigure
the space as one large exhibition space or three smaller galleries.
The effect is like a vault for art, braced against the surrounding
visual noise.</TE>
<TE>   The panels are slightly raised to allow a thin sliver of light to
filter in through glass along the structure's base. The muffled
clatter of the slot machines occasionally seeps in. Such gestures set
up a subtle tension between the contemplative act of viewing art and
the mayhem outside. But this only makes the experience more serene.</TE>
<TE>   What is lasting is the art itself, which in this case is so
breathtaking that it makes the Venetian's pasted-on, neoclassical
decor look vapid. The steel walls, which were treated with an acid
process, have a soft, rust-like finish. The effect is luxurious, and
the current exhibition of paintings--late 19th century and early 20th
century works that include Pablo Picasso's "Three Women,
1908"--stands out against the walls' rich red surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' competition-winning design for a new Los Angeles County
Museum of Art ratchets these ideas up to another level. The design,
which was selected by LACMA's board in December, is still in the
preliminary stages. At this point, the galleries are nothing more
than a concept.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the sketch of an idea, the project offers a view into
a possible future for the art museum.</TE>
<TE>   The structure is conceived as three discrete layers, stacked one
on top of the other. The first layer houses the museum's storage and
offices. On top of this base, an enormous, open-air plaza will
contain the bookstore, restaurant, theater and temporary exhibition
space. The main exhibition spaces rest on a concrete slab above the
plaza, propped up on concrete columns and covered by a massive
tent-like roof.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliance of the scheme is that it allows the museum to
absorb a range of public activities without disturbing the sacred
relationship between art and viewer. The plaza is conceived as an
immense, buzzing public forum, rooted in the life of the city. Art,
placed back up on its pedestal, regains its central importance. The
roof's lightweight, playful form, meanwhile, gives the museum an
informal, unpretentious quality that is a key feature of the design's
success.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Koolhaas has proposed a museum that belongs to everyone.
And that has always been the ultimate aim of the art institution.
Museums as old as New York's Metropolitan, with their grand
ceremonial stairs, were conceived as palaces for the people. Years
later, the Museum of Modern Art's revolving doors were intended to
further narrow the gap between art and the common man.</TE>
<TE>   In the struggle to redefine themselves, museums have sometimes
forgotten that agenda. But the ensuing chaos has its benefits. It has
led to a greater degree of introspection among architects, and
launched a sometimes adversarial but nonetheless productive dialogue
about the museum's function.</TE>
<TE>   Chaos, after all, is the root of creative thought. And if that
chaos leads to a renewed sense of public spiritedness, and more
beautiful buildings, it is more than worth the occasional slip-up.</TE>

<HD>The Touch of the Poet</HD>
<DH>When Alfred Brendel isn't caressing piano keys, he's likely
creating a poem. Serious work? Not to him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Alfred Brendel has been called "the world's greatest
classical player" by the New Yorker magazine for his more than 50
years of performing and his rich legacy of recordings. He is also a
superb writer about music, with four books of essays to his name, and
recently he has published poetry as well.</LD>
<LD>   His musicianship and literary skill will both be on display next
weekend at recitals Friday and Sunday in Los Angeles and Irvine, and
at a reading Saturday at an L.A. art gallery showing work inspired by
his latest collection of poetry.</LD>
<LD>   Often identified as a Viennese pianist, Brendel was actually born
in Weisenberg, Moravia, in 1931 to a family of German, Austrian,
Italian and Slavic background. He spent his early life in Croatia, on
the Adriatic island of Krk, where his parents ran a hotel. There,
operating a record player for the guests, he learned to love pop
music and sing along to operetta arias. Later, when the family moved
to Zagreb, where his father managed a cinema, Brendel made a stage
appearance in a children's play and began his piano studies. He was
6.</LD>
<TE>   Brendel's career evolved slowly but steadily. He came in fourth in
the Busoni Competition in 1949, a year in which no first prize was
awarded. His popularity was enhanced by a series of low-cost,
post-World War II recordings he made for Vox (recordings he now
disavows because of his youth and the fact that he earns no royalties
from their recent reissue).</TE>
<TE>   Musically, Brendel has spent his life mining the works of the
central European masters, returning again and again to Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms and Liszt. Since 1948, for instance, he
has recorded the complete Beethoven cycle of 32 sonatas three times
and the five Beethoven concertos four times, each with different
results.</TE>
<TE>   Brendel spoke by phone from his home in London about his
music-making and his poetry, which Stuart Isacoff of Piano Today
described as "amusing, often trenchant, witty, startling and
occasionally wicked."</TE>
<TE>   Question: How and when did you begin writing poems?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It came about eight years ago completely by surprise. I
had not planned to write poetry at all. I would not have believed it
if somebody would have told me there would be three volumes of poetry
coming out within the next six years. It simply happened.</TE>
<TE>   It maybe requires a hypnagogic state, between sleeping and waking,
to trigger something off. It started in a plane to Japan, when after
a couple of hours I couldn't possibly sleep, and [the title poem of
his first book] "One finger too many" imposed itself on me. I wrote
it down in the dark plane. After I looked at it, I thought it was
quite funny. One could say my poetry is absurd because that seems to
be my view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In what language did that poem come to you?</TE>
<TE>   A: It came to me in German. While I write my essays in either
German or English, I write poetry in German first. But often I have
done an English version right next to the German. When I was a
"young" poet, eight years ago, it usually came much faster. These
days, I sometimes take quite a lot of time. There can be 12 or 13
versions or even 15 versions.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think in terms of rhyme and meter?</TE>
<TE>   A: They are all free. That seems to be a prerequisite of my
writing poetry. But it is not random. They constantly vary in rhythm.
It's very important that a poem surprises me. Each one does. It has
to.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How many have you written?</TE>
<TE>   A: About 200.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How seriously do you take your poems?</TE>
<TE>   A: About as seriously as I take myself. But I do take them
seriously, even the fun ones. There are more serious ones in the last
year or two. But I don't want to overestimate them. I was surprised
and delighted that they sort of live their own life. The three German
volumes were translated into French, two of them into Dutch. There
will be an Italian selection in the autumn. It really does go on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you regard your reading of poems?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's certainly a performance, and it has given me much pleasure
in the last six or seven years. I've given readings both in English
and in German, some of them with the participation of Pierre-Laurent
Aimard, who is a pianist I admire and also a person with quite a
sense of humor. What we are doing is a kind of happening, not just a
boring juxtaposition of text and sound. But in Los Angeles, I am by
myself.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your writing has always been well-received.</TE>
<TE>   A: I have always lived with literature. I have always read a great
deal, not so much about music, real literature. It was the music that
informed me about music much more than any writing about music. I
tried to write about what I found in the music, in the works, and
give some real information, which was challenging. It was dealing
with language and trying to be concise, trying to be elegant, and
trying to avoid nonsense. Maybe what an American would call "bull."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have the reputation for being an intellectual, not the kind
of guy who uses a word like "bull."</TE>
<TE>   A: That was partly prejudice. When you look at me, I have glasses,
I sit in a certain way, I do not appear to be flamboyant. It's a
particularly American view. That is my impression. Also, in America,
Classicism is by at least some critics equated with intellectualism,
and Romanticism with emotionalism, which is something that I could
never understand.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you grow up in an intellectual or a musical household?</TE>
<TE>   A: I have the good fortune--I would call it the good fortune--that
my parents were not musical, not particularly interested in music,
not particularly interested in the arts. I had to find things out for
myself.</TE>
<TE>   They were helpful to a degree. They didn't prevent me from doing
things. They were overly bewildered and not at all at ease about the
prospects of me becoming a musician. They were quite right. You never
know how well it will go. My mother was taken aback because I did not
go through the university and get a degree. She only forgave me when
I got an honorary degree years later.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Competitions did not seem to play a critical role in your
career. Los Angeles is currently involved in a Rachmaninoff
International Piano Competition and Festival. What do you think of
competitions?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, what should I say? To a degree they're a necessary evil.
They sometimes can be the trigger for a career. But if you look at
the prizewinners, the majority of them, didn't make [careers]. I did
get one of the prizes when I was 18, which helped me to get some
concerts in Austria where I lived.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In your local recitals, you will be playing Beethoven's
"Variations on a Theme by Diabelli," which you have called the
greatest piano work in the literature.</TE>
<TE>   A: This is my personal choice. I try to explain [in his essay on
the work] that for me it's the paragon of a humorous composition,
taking its cue from the Diabelli theme, which is already a funny
theme. But don't underestimate the theme. Beethoven would not have
written the work if he found it totally uninteresting. He shows what
one can do with such a theme in being aware of every component of the
theme and making use of this component, sometimes individually,
sometimes dominating a whole variation and also taking the advantage
in making fun of the theme.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you make your choices for the rest of the program?</TE>
<TE>   A: The "Diabelli" Variations are 55 minutes long, nearly entirely
in major keys, almost entirely in C major. This needed a kind of
balance in minor keys. So we have three minor-key works in the first
half [Haydn's Sonata in G Minor, Mozart's D-Minor Fantasy and Sonata
in A Minor]. I love both composers. It's very touching that they got
along so well, that Haydn was able to admire Mozart so much. Mozart
also got a lot out of Haydn's music. They are different by
temperament. In one of my earliest essays, I have a list of
comparisons between Haydn and Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you looking forward to your return to Southern California?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is one reason why I am very apprehensive to get to Los
Angeles and that is because of the coughing. I think generally in
California people cough and sneeze more than anywhere else. I haven't
heard them laugh. I wouldn't mind a laugh here and there in the
"Diabelli" Variations, however.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Maybe you can enlist them in your humorous poem about "The
Coughers of Cologne" society.</TE>
<TE>   A: When that poem was published in Cologne, in the concert hall
itself, it did help. One of the reasons for the extreme coughing in
California is the air-conditioning systems. I was sitting once in the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, in the balcony, and I was freezing. It was
like being outdoors on a winter day. I cannot imagine it's such
pleasure to be frozen indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think it's easier or harder for a young pianist to make
a career these days?</TE>
<TE>   A: It hasn't ever been easy to make a career. Maybe the chances
were a bit better when I was young, immediately after the war, living
in Vienna, and there were lots of recording firms coming there
because it was a very cheap place to record and young people
generally got a little bit of money to play. I did get to record
quite a lot in my 20s. I wouldn't recommend it as a pattern for
everybody. I learned a lot by doing these recordings. But I'm glad I
could go on recording and recording.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been an advocate of recording live performances. Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm not against studio recordings. Both have their merits. But
if a live recording is a good one and one got through it with flying
colors, it is a particular feeling of something almost heroic.</TE>
<TE>   I'm always casting my eye on [live] radio recordings to see if
there is something that can be used later--if I recognize my sound,
if the room is good enough and if the public doesn't cough the piece
to bits. There are few things which I hope will be issued later. I
have earmarked the Brahms D-Minor Concerto for later use.</TE>

<HD>Where the Stage Is King</HD>
<DH>Small Ashland, Ore., is devoted to repertory theater on a
scale unseen elsewhere in the country. Shakespeare is only part of
the story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ASHLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Packs of casually dressed teenagers swarm up and down the main drag
of this rural town. Bored locals, chafing at the restrictions of
small-town life?</LD>
<LD>   No, they're likely to be from some other state, and they're here
for the theater. Repertory theater.</LD>
<LD>   At least half of the audience at three recent performances of the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival appeared to be teenagers. They watched
and listened attentively to "Julius Caesar," "Macbeth" and Robert
Sherwood's "Idiot's Delight"--with no inappropriate whoops or
whispering.</LD>
<TE>   These young theatergoers belie the agonizing frequently heard from
theater professionals about the graying of their audiences. But then
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival--in this town of 20,000 people, only
a few miles north of the California state line--is in stark contrast
to most of the American theater, especially in its devotion to
repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Although many companies use the word "repertory" in their names,
very few attempt true repertory with any regularity--that is, when
more than one production uses the same space during the same period
of time, with overlapping actors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Oregon Shakespeare Festival's three stages--a 601-seat
thrust stage, a new theater with flexible configurations ranging from
228 to 352 seats, and an outdoor Elizabethan-style stage with
1,190-seats--are, at the height of the season, in use by nine
productions at once (out of 11 in the entire season). The 601-seat
Angus Bowmer Theatre alone is the site of as many as 12 performances
a week. During much of the season, each actor is performing in at
least two plays.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere else in the United States is the concept of repertory
theater honored as it is at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "The original dream and hope of the regional theater movement was
to maintain standard repertory companies doing classical work," said
Ben Cameron, executive director of Theatre Communications Group, the
New York organization that represents most of the nation's resident
theater companies. "Oregon is now the exemplar of that model. A lot
of other theaters look at them with great envy." In L.A., for
example, only Glendale's A Noise Within attempts repertory on a
regular basis--but on a far more modest scale than Oregon
Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   What does repertory mean for the audience?</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extraordinary and thrilling chance to see the real
rewards of actor transformation," Cameron said, referring to the
ability to see actors playing very different parts within a weekend,
and within the fabric of a long-term company. "That kind of work has
a texture that's hard to achieve without that kind of company."</TE>
<TE>   Theatrically speaking, Ashland is distinctive in other ways as
well--especially in contrast to Los Angeles. Ashland and L.A. are
near the top of any list of places with the highest number of
professional performances and actors per capita in the United States.
But by just about every other analysis, they are at opposite ends of
the theatrical universe.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's season, which runs from February to November, is
expected to sell most of its projected 400,000 tickets this year to
tourists. Those teenagers in the audience are usually on school field
trips from throughout the Northwest. Their numbers will diminish
after schools adjourn in June, but older tourists will take their
places.</TE>
<TE>   Only about one in 10 Ashland theatergoers is from the immediate
vicinity. The average distance a theatergoer travels to the festival
is 392 miles. Southern Californians make up about 4% of the
audiences, while about 48% come from the San Francisco Bay Area. By
contrast, L.A.'s theater audiences are almost entirely local.</TE>
<TE>   While L.A.'s theater scene is spread far and wide, Ashland's is
focused on the three blocks that house the festival and the second
most prominent theater in town, Oregon Cabaret Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The festival employs 74 actors on months-long contracts. In L.A.,
however, most actors float from one short job to another, in order to
be available for better paying screen jobs. Recalling her days as a
teacher at CalArts in Valencia, Oregon Shakespeare artistic director
Libby Appel said, "The mentality of believing that the film and TV
industry is everything permeated even my theater students. It was
[hard] to get them to leave their phones--as if anyone from the
industry might call."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, audiences can relax in Ashland--or other rural theater
centers such as Cedar City, Utah, home of the Utah Shakespearean
Festival. Many Ashland theatergoers park once, at their hotel or
bed-and-breakfast, and walk to the theater and nearby restaurants for
the rest of their stay. There is no freeway traffic to combat while
trying to catch an 8 p.m. curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why a festival like this would never work in a city like
L.A.," Appel said. "Our audiences don't arrive here after 43 business
meetings all day long."</TE>
<TE>   "They're relaxed and receptive when they step in the theater,"
said executive director Paul Nicholson, who emigrated to Oregon from
New Zealand 22 years ago. "You could put the trappings of this
festival in L.A., but I doubt that it would be the same experience."</TE>
<TE>   Appel has plenty of experience in Southern California. While
living in Corona del Mar, she headed the acting program at Cal State
Long Beach from 1976 to 1981. Then she was dean of the theater school
at CalArts from 1981 to 1990 and lived in Granada Hills. She has
directed at such Southland theaters as the Odyssey and South Coast
Repertory.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, she ran a more conventional resident theater,
Indiana Repertory Theatre, which doesn't actually do repertory. She
got the Oregon job in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The festival presents plenty besides Shakespeare, whose works make
up five of this year's 11 plays and who will be represented by only
four of the 11 slated for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, "Handler," a new play by Robert Schenkkan, will open
at the festival's New Theatre, which was financed with the help of a
$6-million gift from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, whose parents
took him to see Shakespeare in Ashland when he was growing up. For
the new theater, Allen relinquished the naming rights that would
normally accompany a $6-million gift so that someone else might be
inspired to make a similar donation.</TE>
<TE>   Schenkkan is best known as the author of "The Kentucky Cycle,"
which made a Pulitzer Prize-winning splash at the Mark Taper Forum a
decade ago. His new play will be directed by an even more familiar
Southland figure, Bill Rauch, artistic director of Cornerstone
Theater Company, which has been L.A.-based for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Handler" focuses on a troubled couple who belong to a small
Holiness Way congregation in the South. The worshipers handle
poisonous snakes as part of the service. After a traumatic snakebite
during a service, the husband becomes a media sensation.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Rauch was blocking a scene in which
reporters pursue the couple even as they're arguing with their
minister.</TE>
<TE>   It's a complicated scene to stage, but Rauch was assisted by a
company movement director. On the sidelines, Schenkkan observed while
flanked by a dramaturge and a voice and speech director.</TE>
<TE>   "The caliber of talent is consistently high, on stage and off,"
Schenkkan said later. "And because these artists have worked together
for a long time, there's a sense of community and continuity that's
hard to achieve in a company that's put together for a specific
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   This sensibility, he says, is especially helpful for this play,
which is about "a small community of faith, with all the advantages
and disadvantages of a community. The theater company itself echoes
that. Everyone is intimately familiar with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the possible disadvantages of such a familiar community--that
it might become stagnant or self-satisfied--are deflected in Ashland
by "the infusion of new blood," Schenkkan said. "Bill and I are
outsiders. And the fact that they are doing new plays makes the
festival edgier than it might otherwise be, challenging in ways that
the festival didn't used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Rauch agreed that the mix of long-term artists and guests prevents
the Oregon company members from becoming "stuck in patterns or not
pushing themselves." On a much smaller scale, his Cornerstone company
works in the same way, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the history of theater, the best work has come out of company
situations," Rauch added. "There is a shorthand that comes from
working with people you know that allows them to take risks. None of
the actors in my cast are sussing each other out. They're able to
dive in and be fearless. They know each other's rhythms and how to
play off them--or subvert them."</TE>
<TE>   Rauch also feels a kinship with "Handler's" subject matter, for
Cornerstone last year launched a three-year program in which it's
working with various communities defined by faith. And Cornerstone
always has worked with small communities of one stripe or another.
Rauch said the company's members have learned that within
communities, "the act of defining who's in also defines who's out."</TE>
<TE>   That act of defining occurs within the Ashland acting community
itself annually. Appel announces the next year's season, along with
the directors of the plays, in March. In May, she meets with every
actor for 15 minutes and discusses which roles each would like to
play in the following season. In June, next year's directors observe
the current repertory, taking notes on the actors. There are no
formal auditions, but the directors submit wish lists of actors they
would like in their plays.</TE>
<TE>   Appel and her staff try to match the actors' and directors' wish
lists. Each year, however, there are some roles that need to be
filled from outside, and there are some actors who either don't want
to return or are asked not to return. Appel calls each actor in
mid-July with news about next season. She estimated that nearly every
season, 20 new actors arrive and about 20 depart, although they
sometimes return in later seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The actors in Ashland seem far away from the Hollywood rat race.
Appel pointed to one of the reasons: In Hollywood and even in
Southland theater, "actors are often cast to type. Here, they're
almost never cast to type. People play roles here they would never be
cast in" elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Armando Duran, a member of this year's "Handler" and "Julius
Caesar" casts, had worked at South Coast Repertory in Octavio Solis'
"La Posada Magica" and play workshops. When a Solis play was
scheduled at Ashland in 1999, Duran was invited into the company.</TE>
<TE>   He thought he would stay only a year, and after it was over, he
appeared in another play at South Coast Rep. But then he was allowed
to join the Ashland company midseason for a second year. The
following year, he came back, attracted by the scheduling of a play
by Cuban American writer Nilo Cruz. Now Duran's in his fourth season,
and another Cruz play is slated for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Duran maintains an apartment in Silver Lake, "but I think they
hope I'll throw in the towel and say Ashland is my home."</TE>
<TE>   Still, his roots are very much in L.A., where he has lived most of
his adult life after growing up in Fontana. Duran misses L.A.'s
Latino cultura, he said, and his grandmother in San Gabriel. He's
critical of Ashland's Mexican restaurants, and he goes to nearby,
somewhat larger Medford for food, haircuts and soccer games in that
town's larger Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in Hollywood he was offered only "a gamut of roles
ranging from Colombian drug lords to Cuban hit men." In Ashland, he's
playing Southerners and an ancient Roman. "The artistic opportunities
are really satisfying. And you get to do these roles for such an
extended period. That's what keeps me here."</TE>
<TE>   Repertory is expensive. The equipment and crews required for the
relentless set and lighting changes increase expenses by 20% to 25%
over what it would cost to present one play after another, executive
director Nicholson said. Although actors perform in multiple plays,
they actually do fewer performances--usually about five a week--than
they would in most other professional theaters.</TE>
<TE>   On a strictly budgetary level, "we can't cast as efficiently,"
Nicholson said. The fest cuts expenses by dealing with only two
unions--the actors' and directors'--and by not doing costly musicals,
which would require performers who couldn't necessarily handle
classical roles in the other plays.</TE>
<TE>   Musicals are cash cows for many theaters, but when the festival
occasionally does a small musical, the shows don't sell well in
advance, and people complain that "that's not why we come to
Ashland," Appel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our audiences come because they want to see the same actors doing
different things, and they're willing to travel for it," Nicholson
said. "If we said, '[Forget] repertory,' we would not get these
audiences to come back."</TE>

<LD>   Who's new: OF Gary Sheffield, C Henry Blanco, P Darren Holmes and
Albie Lopez, INF Matt Franco, 3B Vinny Castilla.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: OF Brian Jordan, P Odalis Perez and John Burkett, 3B
Ken Caminiti, C Paul Bako.</LD>
<TE>   Strengths: The Braves were 13th in the NL in scoring last season,
but that should change with the addition of Sheffield, who should
provide great lineup protection for Chipper Jones. The top of the
rotation is outstanding, and shortstop Rafael Furcal is sound after
missing half of 2001 because of a dislocated left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Starter Kevin Millwood is coming off a shoulder
injury, and starter Albie Lopez is a question mark. There is little
speed after Furcal. 2B Marcus Giles is not a Gold Glove candidate,
and there's not much power on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: For several weeks, it seemed all General Manager John
Schuerholz did was field questions about the Mets' winter trades.
Then Schuerholz trumped the Mets by trading for Sheffield. The Braves
still have better pitching than the Mets, and they should have just
enough offense to win another division title.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: 2B Roberto Alomar, 1B Mo Vaughn, OF Jeromy Burnitz,
Roger Cedeno and Gary Matthews Jr., P Pedro Astacio, Shawn Estes,

<TE>   Who's gone: P Kevin Appier, Glendon Rusch and Donne Wall, 3B Robin
Ventura, 1B Todd Zeile, OF Benny Agbayani, Alex Escobar, Lenny
Harris, Matt Lawton, Tsuyoshi Shinjo.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The Mets pack plenty of wallop, though Vaughn (elbow)
and Edgardo Alfonzo (back) must make strong comebacks from injury for
the offense to click. Overall team speed is good, so New York should
manufacture runs as well as slug.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The rotation drops off dramatically after Al Leiter.
Astacio is pitching with a shoulder tear, and D'Amico has a history
of health problems. The bullpen is good, but it's not as strong as it
has been in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With a payroll of $103 million, the Mets have high
expectations, and they have the talent to win a playoff berth. But if
the starting pitchers get roughed up, it will put too much of a
burden on the bullpen and the offense.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: P Terry Adams, OF Ricky Ledee, INF Dave Hollins.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Omar Daal and Chris Brock, OF Brian Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: If pitching and defense win championships, the Phillies
have a good foundation. Their starting pitching looks good, though
ace Robert Person isn't in the best condition, their bullpen should
be solid, and the Phillies set a team record for fewest errors in a
season in 2001. Scott Rolen may be the NL's best defensive third
baseman, and CF Doug Glanville is underrated.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Rolen, who turned down a $140-million contract offer
this winter, and Manager Larry Bowa are barely speaking to each
other, and that relationship could put a strain on the team. Rolen, a
free agent after this season, probably will be booed at home, so it
will be interesting to see how he responds. There isn't much depth.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Phillies have a good, young nucleus and could contend
as they did in 2001, but they don't appear to have the talent to keep
up with the Braves and Mets.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: OF Jeff Abbott and John Mabry, INF Dave Berg, P
Antonio Alfonseca, Matt Clement, Ricky Bones and Jesus Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The Marlins have one of baseball's best young
rotations, a staff of power pitchers led by right-hander Ryan
Dempster. The second through seventh hitters all have the potential
to hit 25 home runs. The defense up the middle, especially C Charles
Johnson, is strong.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Their power comes at a price; many Marlins are free
swingers who lack plate discipline and strike out far too much.
Middle relief is a question and defense at the corner outfield
positions is weak.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Marlins keep waiting for a reincarnation of the 1991
Atlanta Braves, a team that got breakout years from young pitchers
John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, Steve Avery and Kent Mercker, and if the
light went on for three or four of the young Marlin pitchers at the
same time, this could be a very good team. A more likely scenario:
the Marlins fail to contend and free-agent-to-be Cliff Floyd gets
traded in July.</TE>

Fernandez, 3B Chris Truby.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Mike Thurman and Guillermo Mota, INF Jeff Blum, OF
Tim Raines and Mark Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Vladimir Guerrero hits for average and power and may
have baseball's best outfield throwing arm. SS Orlando Cabrera, who
had 96 RBIs in 2001, and 2B Jose Vidro give the Expos an excellent
double-play combination. Ace Javier Vazquez, who has a 95-mph
fastball, a good cutter, slider, curve and changeup, is a potential
20-game winner.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Expos lack speed, one of the reasons they grounded
into</TE>
<TE>   more double plays (151) last season than any team in baseball. The
bottom of the rotation is weak--health problems prevented Carl Pavano
from pitching a full season in each of the last four years. They hit
only .256 with runners in scoring position last season, and they lack
a quality closer.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Expos' farewell season in Montreal--they'll probably
be sold and moved to Northern Virginia--could be bleak.</TE>

<TE>   Strengths: Frank Thomas is back after missing almost all of last
season because of a torn right triceps and he is capable of
recapturing his old form with Lofton and Ray Durham setting the table
and Magglio Ordonez hitting behind him. Mark Buehrle won 16 games in
his first full season and Jon Garland could be on the verge of doing
something similar. Keith Foulke established himself as a top closer
with 42 saves. Manager Jerry Manuel has a deep and versatile bench.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Several relievers are coming off arm surgery. The
White Sox are below average on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With the Indians dumping payroll and the
contraction-threatened Twins tightly controlling theirs, the White
Sox are the front-runners in the AL Central. But if the Big Hurt is

<TE>   Strengths: Brad Radke, Eric Milton and Joe Mays are a formidable
threesome at the top of the rotation and Rick Reed is capable of
making it a quartet. CF Torii Hunter and 1B Doug Mientkiewicz are
gold glovers and the Twins play solid defense all the way around.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Tom Kelly quietly guided the Twins for more than 15
seasons and it remains to be seen whether new Manager Ron Gardenhire
can get the most out of a team that had a great start last season,
but finished 16 games under .500 in the second half. SS Cristian
Guzman is still nursing a sore right shoulder and the bullpen is
below average, especially former closer LaTroy Hawkins, whose poor
second half seems to have carried over to this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Twins proved last season that they could be in the
race. Now they have to show they can finish it. If the starting
pitchers perform as expected, they can make a serious run at the
division title.</TE>

and Matt Lawton, INF Mike Lansing, C Eddie Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: 2B Roberto Alomar, OF Juan Gonzalez, Kenny Lofton and
Marty Cordova, P John Rocker, Dave Burba and Steve Woodard.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Pitching hasn't exactly been the Indians' calling card
in recent years, but that could change with a rotation featuring
Bartolo Colon, C.C. Sabathia, Danys Baez, Chuck Finley and Ryan
Drese. Bob Wickman had 32 saves last season. Jim Thome hit 49 home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Gonzalez left as a free agent and Alomar was traded in
cost-cutting moves. A team that ranked second in the league in
batting average, runs and home runs is now without two players who
combined for 240 RBIs. Their absence is sure to have an impact on the
pitches Thome sees.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With no dominant team in the division, the Indians are
capable of challenging the White Sox and the Twins. They'll probably
need career seasons from Lawton and Gutierrez to do it.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: 1B Tony Clark, OF Roger Cedeno and Juan Encarnacion,
SS Deivi Cruz, P Chris Holt.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The Tigers ranked 12th in the AL in batting last season
and took steps to improve by adding Young and Paquette. 3B Dean
Palmer and C Mitch Meluskey are back after sitting out most or all of
last season because of shoulder surgeries. Efficient Jeff Weaver is
the ace of the staff, Steve Sparks led the majors with eight complete
games and Matt Anderson, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 draft, is
coming on as a closer.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The pitching staff had a 5.01 ERA last season,
next-to-last in the league, and the Tigers signed or traded for no
one who can help lower that number significantly. RF Robert Fick was
the top home run hitter with 19.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Tigers did some housecleaning to try to improve the
team's attitude. If Palmer stays healthy they will win more games,
but not enough to finish higher than fourth in the division.</TE>

<TE>   KANSAS CITY ROYALS</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: OF Chuck Knoblauch and Michael Tucker, P Darrell May.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: C Gregg Zaun.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: 1B Mike Sweeney has driven in 345 runs the last three
seasons and CF Carlos Beltran, AL rookie of the year in 1999, batted
.306 with 24 homers and 101 RBIs and had 31 steals last year.
Ready-for-trade SS Neifi Perez won a Gold Glove with Colorado in 2000
and new LF Knoblauch can be a productive leadoff hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Jeff Suppan is the ace of the staff and never has won
more than 10 games. The Royals lack power--Sweeney and Beltran were
the only players with more than 17 homers last season. Tucker returns
to the organization he started in, but he's not really good enough to
be an everyday player.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The small-market Royals don't have enough pitching to
contend for anything other than fourth place in the division. If
Sweeney and Beltran have big seasons, 3B Joe Randa bounces back and
Knoblauch flourishes in low-key Kansas City, they could help keep
Manager Tony Muser employed.</TE>

<LD>ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS</LD>
<LD>   Who's new: P Rick Helling and Mike Myers, OF Jose Guillen.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: OF Reggie Sanders and Midre Cummings, P Bobby Witt and
Albie Lopez, C Mike DiFelice.</LD>
<TE>   Strengths: No team in baseball can match the 1-2 punch of Randy
Johnson and Curt Schilling, who combined for 43 victories and 665
strikeouts. The addition of Myers, a left-handed relief specialist,
bolsters the bullpen. Luis Gonzalez (.325, 57 homers, 142 RBIs) is
coming off a monster year, and the Diamondbacks had the fewest errors
(84) in the league in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: 3B Matt Williams is out until August because of a
fracture and dislocation of the left ankle, and Arizona will miss
Sanders, who hit 33 homers last season, 16 of which tied the score or
put the team ahead. There is a big drop-off in the rotation after
Johnson and Schilling.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: If Todd Stottlemyre, who hasn't pitched since Sept. 21,
2000, bounces back from elbow surgery, the rotation will be stronger
and will give Arizona an edge in the division.</TE>

<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: 3B David Bell, OF Reggie Sanders and Tsuyoshi Shinjo, P
Jay Witasick.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Shawn Estes and Mark Gardner, OF John Vander Wal and
Eric Davis, 1B Andres Galarraga.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Rich Aurilia, Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent combined for
132 homers and 340 RBIs in 2001. Bell and 1B J.T. Snow provide
outstanding defense at the corners.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Kent, who missed most of spring training because of a
broken wrist, could have a slow start. Aurilia and Kent are only
average defensively. The Giants seem to be shoe-horning Shinjo into
the leadoff role; he had a .320 on-base percentage last season and
didn't draw a walk until his 11th game this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The addition of Sanders gives the Giants an edge over the
Diamondbacks on offense, and San Francisco has a deep and talented
bullpen with one of baseball's best closers in Robb Nen, so the
Giants should challenge for the division title. But the Giant
rotation isn't as strong as Arizona's, so that could relegate them to
the wild-card race.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: OF Brian Jordan and Dave Roberts, P Hideo Nomo,

Quantrill, SS Cesar Izturis.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: OF Gary Sheffield, P Chan Ho Park, Matt Herges, Terry
Adams, Jeff Shaw, Luke Prokopec and James Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: If Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby recover fully from elbow
surgery--and all indications are that they will--and Ishii lives up
to his billing, the rotation should be solid. Defense on the left
side, with a healthy Adrian Beltre at third base, Jordan in left
field and Izturis at shortstop, is improved. RF Shawn Green is coming
off a career season (.297, 49 homers, 125 RBIs).</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The bullpen lacks a proven closer. Eric Gagne probably
will evolve into that role, but he has never been a full-time
reliever, let alone a closer. 2B Mark Grudzielanek was slowed by a
hamstring injury for much of the spring and hasn't found his stroke.
When Grissom plays center field, the Dodgers won't have a true
leadoff hitter in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Everything must go right for the Dodgers to contend, but
when does that ever happen?</TE>

<TE>   SAN DIEGO PADRES</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: P Brett Tomko and Alan Embree, SS Ramon Vazquez, INF
Deivi Cruz, OF Ron Gant, C Tom Lampkin.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: OF Tony Gwynn, INF Dave Magadan, Damian Jackson and
Alex Arias, C Ben Davis and Matt Walbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The offense, led by Ryan Klesko and Phil Nevin, should
be among the five best in the NL. Closer Trevor Hoffman is the
closest thing in the NL to a lock for 40 saves every year.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The rotation lacks a proven No. 1 or 2 starter. Two
rookies will start on the left side of the infield, 3B Sean Burroughs
and Vazquez, and Nevin (1B) and Klesko (RF) are moving to new
positions, so the defense could be shaky. The top two set-up men,
Jose Nunez and Jeremy Fikac, have never pitched full big league
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Padres have a good young nucleus, which bodes well
for a team that plans to move into a new downtown stadium in 2004.
But their rotation is full of soft-throwing pitchers who don't record
many strikeouts, and that will challenge them on defense. Despite
their holes, the Padres should win 80 games or more for the first
time since 1998.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: 3B Jeff Cirillo, P Mike Myers, Jay Powell, Brian
Bohanon, Dan Miceli and Gabe White, C Sal Fasano, OF Alex Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Larry Walker and Todd Helton give the Rockies one of
the best 3-4 tandems in baseball. Juan Pierre tied for the NL lead in
stolen bases (46) and was the toughest player to fan in baseball,
striking out 29 times in 617 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: No. 3 starter John Thomson has potential but is injury
prone, and the bottom two in the rotation are questionable. The
Rockies have three players up the middle, CF Pierre, SS Juan Uribe
and 2B Jose Ortiz, with two years experience or less.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Rockies finished 19 games out in 2001 and trimmed
their payroll from $65 million to $51 million this season, so there's
little reason for optimism. But if they get decent pitching and Zeile
provides sound defense and some punch, they could be respectable.</TE>

<LD>SEATTLE MARINERS</LD>
<LD>   Who's new: 3B Jeff Cirillo, C Ben Davis, OF Ruben Sierra, P James
Baldwin and Shigetoshi Hasegawa, INF Desi Relaford and Alex Arias.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: P Aaron Sele, INF David Bell, OF Jay Buhner, Stan
Javier and Al Martin.</LD>
<TE>   Strengths: After winning 116 games, the Mariners did not stand
pat. They added Cirillo, Sierra, Davis and Hasegawa to a team that
led the league in batting, earned-run average and fielding
percentage. Freddy Garcia is the ace of the staff that will get
plenty of support from league most valuable player Ichiro Suzuki,
Edgar Martinez, Bret Boone, John Olerud and Mike Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Aaron Sele signed as a free agent with the Angels
after going 15-5 with a 3.60 earned-run average. The Mariners will
try to fill the void with Baldwin. Left field, long an area of
concern, is still a problem. Both Sierra and Mark McLemore are on the
downside of their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: No one expects another 116-victory season. If key players
stay healthy, however, this could be the year the Mariners reach
their first World Series.</TE>

Justice, C Scott Hatteberg, 2B Randy Velarde, 1B Carlos Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: 1B Jason Giambi, OF Johnny Damon and Ron Gant, P Jason
Isringhausen.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: A rotation that features Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and
Barry Zito is the envy of general managers across the league. 3B Eric
Chavez is an up-and-coming hitting star and rookie 1B Pena could
develop into the same. New closer Koch replaces Isringhausen. GM
Billy Beane, who recently signed a three-year contract extension, has
proven that he is not afraid to make a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Jason Giambi left a huge void in the lineup and the
clubhouse. CF Damon left for Boston, weakening the defense.
Outfielder Jermaine Dye is coming off a broken leg and the A's lack a
true leadoff hitter. They'll try Jeremy Giambi in that spot.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The A's still have plenty of young and proven talent. If
the starting pitchers stay healthy and Koch does his job, this team
will challenge for the division title.</TE>

Ismael Valdes and Pat Rapp, SS Gary DiSarcina.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Disney opened its pocketbook and signed Sele as a free
agent and traded Vaughn for Appier. Both pitchers are inning-eaters
and should augment a staff that already featured young and improving
Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis. 3B Troy Glaus is
one of the best power hitters in the majors. Closer Troy Percival is
dominant. Fullmer is a proven designated hitter who enjoys the role.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Angels ranked 11th in the league in batting
average last season and 12th in runs and home runs. SS David Eckstein
and 2B Adam Kennedy are developing defensively. C Bengie Molina needs
to regain his form of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: If Sele and Appier have good years and the three other
starting pitchers remain healthy, the Angels can contend. But they
will need Salmon and Erstad to bounce back from bad seasons and
Fullmer to produce as the DH.</TE>

and Carl Everett.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Rick Helling, Darren Oliver and Tim Crabtree, OF
Ricky Ledee and Ruben Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: If it's possible to quietly hit .318 with 52 homers and
135 RBIs, SS Alex Rodriguez did it last season. Juan Gonzalez has
returned to the scene of his best years and joins a lineup that also
includes Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro. Rookie Hank Blalock hit
over .350 this spring and earned a job at third base.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Texas ranked last in the league with a 5.71 ERA. The
addition of Park will help some, but not enough. Everett is trying to
come back from knee surgery. Clubhouse vibe will be interesting with
Everett and Rocker in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Rangers will score plenty of runs, but new General
Manager John Hart and new pitching coach Oscar Acosta still have work
to do with the pitching staff if the Rangers want to challenge in the
AL West.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK YANKEES</LD>
<LD>   Who's new: 1B Jason Giambi, 3B Robin Ventura, OF Rondell White and
John Vander Wal, P David Wells and Steve Karsay.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: 1B Tino Martinez, 3B Scott Brosius, OF Paul O'Neill,
Chuck Knoblauch and David Justice.</LD>
<TE>   Strengths: The Yankees already feature some of the best players in
the league and they opened their wallet and added another by signing
Giambi as a free agent. New 3B Ventura fills a hole for a club that
is as strong up the middle as any in the AL. Mike Mussina and Roger
Clemens lead a deep and experienced rotation and Mariano Rivera is
still the best closer in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Yankees lost core players Martinez, Brosius and
O'Neill. Their skills are replaceable but it remains to be seen how
their absence affects clubhouse atmosphere. Injury-prone outfielder
White could start the season on the disabled list. Wells has slimmed
down for his return to pinstripes, but he's still 38.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The reloaded Yankees are still the team to beat in the AL
East and they will make a run at their fourth World Series title in
five years.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: OF Johnny Damon and Rickey Henderson, 1B Tony Clark, P
John Burkett, Dustin Hermanson and Darren Oliver, 2B Rey Sanchez, INF
Carlos Baerga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Rod Beck, Hideo Nomo, Bret Saberhagen and David
Cone, OF Carl Everett and Troy O'Leary, C Scott Hatteberg.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: With new ownership and a new manager, the Red Sox are
sporting a more positive attitude. Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra
and Manny Ramirez are superstars who, if they remain sound, make the
Red Sox contenders. OF Damon and Henderson add a dose of speed.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: As great as Martinez is, new Manager Grady Little
still has to send four pitchers to the mound between his starts.
Burkett, who will open the season on the disabled list, and Hermanson
were brought in, but other teams in the division are hardly quaking.
Garciaparra must prove he's healthy and durable after playing only 21
games last season because of a torn wrist tendon.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Red Sox have a shot at the wild card if Martinez,
Garciaparra and Ramirez remain injury-free.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: DH Brad Fullmer, P Billy Koch and Paul Quantrill, INF
Alex Gonzalez and Cesar Izturis.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: New General Manager J.P. Ricciardi learned from Billy
Beane in Oakland and is attempting to mix experienced stars such as
Carlos Delgado and Raul Mondesi with talented newcomers such as SS
Felipe Lopez, 3B Hinske and DH Vernon Wells. The Blue Jays have
plenty of team speed, several good young arms in the rotation and a
solid closer in Kelvim Escobar.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: To go with the youth movement, Ricciardi dumped
salaries and was left with a thin bench, a thin bullpen and a defense
that could rank among the league leaders in errors. Blue Jay hitters
struck out more than any team besides the Red Sox and Devil Rays last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Blue Jays don't have enough pitching to challenge the
Yankees, but if the youngsters don't completely fall on their faces,
they could be a surprise while readying for a more serious run next
season.</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE ORIOLES</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: OF Marty Cordova and Chris Singleton.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: 3B Cal Ripken, OF Brady Anderson, P Jose Mercedes,
Ryan Kohlmeier and John Wasdin.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The rotation isn't going to remind anyone of the
Palmer-McNally-Cuellar-Dobson days, but it has a chance to be decent
if Scott Erickson stays healthy and pitches well. Erickson's presence
takes the heat off Jason Johnson and Sidney Ponson. The acquisition
of center fielder Singleton solidifies the defense up the middle.
Jeff Conine tied for ninth in the league with a .311 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Orioles ranked last in the AL in batting average
and next to last in runs last season and have done nothing major to
improve. Cal Ripken's farewell tour might have been considered a
distraction by some, but at least the fans came out to see the future
Hall of Famer.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Orioles have not had a winning season in five years
and their fortune is not likely to change soon. Luckily, they play in
the same division as Tampa Bay.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: No one.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: OF Jose Guillen, P Bryan Rekar, Jeff Wallace and Dan
Wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Such young players as catcher Toby Hall and second
baseman Brent Abernathy give the Devil Rays some hope. Greg Vaughn is
a powerful offensive presence, but he's making almost $9 million this
season and it's only a matter of time until his salary is jettisoned.
The rotation has shown flashes of effectiveness. Left-hander Wilson
Alvarez, who hasn't pitched in the majors since 1999 because of
injuries, had a strong spring.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Devil Rays ranked last or second to last in the
league in nearly every offensive category last season and ranked 12th
with a 4.96 earned-run average. RF Ben Grieve was a huge
disappointment last season, hitting only 11 home runs. The young
players are a year older, but they have not improved enough to make a
significant jump.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Devil Rays will consider this season a success if
they can finish ahead of the Orioles for fourth place in the
division. But even that might be a longshot.</TE>

<LD>ST. LOUIS CARDINALS</LD>
<LD>   Who's new: 1B Tino Martinez, P Jason Isringhausen, C Mike
DiFelice.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: 1B Mark McGwire, 3B Craig Paquette, P Alan Benes,
Dustin Hermanson and T.J. Mathews, OF Bobby Bonilla, C Carlos
Hernandez.</LD>
<TE>   Strengths: The Cardinals have the deepest rotation in the
division, and for the first time in three years, they have a
top-quality closer in Isringhausen. C Mike Matheny, 2B Fernando Vina
and CF Jim Edmonds each have won Gold Gloves in the last two years.
The 3-4-5 hitters, J.D. Drew, Albert Pujols and Edmonds, all have the
potential to hit 30 homers and drive in 100 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The loss of Paquette took a huge bite out of the
bench, which lacks power.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Cardinals were a Tony Womack bloop single away from
reaching the NL championship series, but they look even better this
season. Martinez won't hit 50 home runs, but he'll provide more
stability at first, leading some to believe St. Louis is better off
without McGwire. There is not enough quality left-handed pitching in
the division to neutralize St. Louis' heavily left-handed lineup.</TE>

<TE>   HOUSTON ASTROS</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: OF Brian Hunter, P T.J. Mathews, C Gregg Zaun, 3B Geoff
Blum.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: OF Moises Alou, 3B Vinny Castilla, P Pedro Astacio,
Ron Villone, Mike Williams and Kent Bottenfield, C Tony Eusebio.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: The Astros have one of baseball's best pitching staffs.
Starters Wade Miller, Roy Oswalt and Shane Reynolds combined to win
44 games in 2001, Carlos Hernandez, armed with a nasty curve, is one
of baseball's top young left-handers, and closer Billy Wagner is set
up by the reliable Octavio Dotel and Nelson Cruz. Craig Biggio is a
superb leadoff hitter, and Jeff Bagwell provides power.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The offense suffered a major blow with the loss of
Alou., who hit .331 with 108 RBIs in 2001. Houston has two corner
outfielders, Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman, who should be first
basemen and a center fielder, Richard Hidalgo, who is better suited
for right.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Astros should compete for the division title, and
their starting pitching could put them over the top. If they don't
edge St. Louis, they should be in the hunt for a wild-card berth.</TE>

Stynes.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: 2B Eric Young, P Julian Tavarez, David Weathers and
Todd Van Poppel, OF Rondell White and Matt Stairs, SS Ricky
Gutierrez, INF Ron Coomer.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Sammy Sosa, Fred McGriff and Alou give the Cubs their
most prolific 3-4-5 combination since Ron Santo, Billy Williams and
Ernie Banks in the late 1960s. The rotation is solid, and the
acquisition of Alfonseca fills the hole left by Tom Gordon, who is
sidelined at least three months because of a torn shoulder muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The departures of Weathers and Van Poppel hurt the
bullpen. Bill Mueller's knee surgery leaves them unsettled at third,
and there is no bona fide leadoff man.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The offense could be prolific, but the rotation is a
notch below those of St. Louis and Houston, and the bullpen is thin.
The Cubs' first back-to-back winning seasons since 1971-72 are within
reach; a playoff berth may not be.</TE>

<TE>   Who's new: P Sean Lowe, Josh Fogg, Kip Wells and Ron Villone, 2B
Pokey Reese.</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: P Todd Ritchie, Omar Olivares, Josias Manzanillo and
Rich Loiselle, OF Gary Matthews Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: C Jason Kendall appears sound after playing almost all
of last season with torn ligaments in his left thumb. 3B Aramis
Ramirez, who hit .300 with 34 homers and 112 RBIs and batted .378
with runners in scoring position, and LF Brian Giles (.309, 37
homers, 95 RBIs) are two of baseball's most unheralded players.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: The Pirates lack power outside of Giles and Ramirez,
and they are not exceptionally fast, so they will have trouble
manufacturing runs. Though Fogg and Wells have shown promise, most of
Pittsburgh's pitching is unproven. The bullpen is decent, but it can
hardly be considered a strength.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The good news: The new stadium, PNC Park, got rave
reviews in 2001. The bad news: The home team stunk--the Pirates were
62-100 and finished 31 games back last season. This team would do
well not to lose 90 games.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: OF Jeromy Burnitz and Devon White, P Jimmy Haynes and
Jeff D'Amico, C Henry Blanco, INF Lou Collier.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: Ben Sheets, who throws 95 mph and has an excellent
curve, has the potential to dominate, and Ruben Quevedo and Paul
Rigdon are good young starters. 1B Richie Sexson could hit 50 home
runs. New pitching coach Dave Stewart should toughen the staff.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: There is not much depth, so the offense will sputter
if Sexson or LF Geoff Jenkins gets hurt. There's no true closer
because reliever Curtis Leskanic will be out until May because of
shoulder surgery and reliever Chad Fox will be sidelined at least two
months because of an elbow injury.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Milwaukee's streak of nine consecutive losing seasons,
which is tied with the Pirates for the longest in the four major
professional sports, should reach 10 this season, and their playoff
drought should reach 20 seasons.</TE>

<TE>   Who's gone: 2B Pokey Reese, 1B Dmitri Young, P Pete Harnisch,
Osvaldo Fernandez and Dennys Reyes, OF Ruben Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Strengths: If Scott Williamson, who appeared in only two games in
2001, comes back from reconstructive elbow surgery--there is a chance
he could be ready for opening day--the bullpen should be OK. If the
Reds stay healthy, the offense should be decent.</TE>
<TE>   Weaknesses: Joey Hamilton, who has battled shoulder problems for
the past three years, is the opening-day starter, a pretty good
indication of how weak the rotation is. SS Barry Larkin, 37, is well
past his prime and has been slowed by a hamstring injury, and CF Ken
Griffey Jr. needs to overcome his hamstring problems from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: They're so desperate for starting pitching they're
considering moving closer Danny Graves into the rotation. With

<HD>Their New Approach Is Better Than Average</HD>
<DH>Angels: After an 87-loss season, improving on-base
percentage is considered essential to improving win-loss percentage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words cause old-timers to cringe and statheads to rejoice. The
words reflect a sophisticated new generation of baseball analysis
that extends beyond batting averages and home runs. And, in a sport
whose lords would have you believe that a team that refuses to spend
extravagantly might as well give up, the words help explain the
doom-defying success of the low-budget Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The words are critical in understanding why the Angels lost
miserably last season and whether they might win this season. The
words: on-base percentage. The concept is not difficult to grasp,
even for those with an aversion to calculation.</LD>
<LD>   "It's simple math," Angel center fielder Darin Erstad said. "The
more baserunners you have, the more you'll score."</LD>
<TE>   Although the Angels are justifiably proud of assembling one of the
most impressive starting rotations in franchise history, with
veterans Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele joining Jarrod Washburn, Ramon
Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis, all those fine arms are good for nothing
more than a .500 season without a revival on offense. The Angels had
a pretty good pitching staff last season too, but they lost 87 games,
lost sight of the Seattle Mariners in May and limped home 41 games
out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our offense is going to rebound," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "I'm looking for that as a probability, not a possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The logic, on the surface: The offense will be better because
Erstad and right fielder Tim Salmon can't possibly play any worse and
Brad Fullmer fills the virtual vacancy at designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   The reality, beneath the surface: That won't be enough to win if
all the Angels don't do a better job of getting on base and driving
runners in.</TE>
<TE>   So, rather than indulging sluggers happy to play bombs away in the
thin air of the Cactus League, the Angel coaching staff turned spring
training into a six-week clinic in advanced hitting--taking the
opposing pitcher deep into the count rather than hacking at the first
pitch, taking a walk, moving runners along with an out, getting a
runner home from third base with an out</TE>
<TE>   "We're eliminating batting average," hitting coach Mickey Hatcher
said. "We're eliminating selfishness."</TE>
<TE>   Said Erstad: "We're making a conscious effort to improve, to throw
batting average out the window and focus on on-base percentage, runs
scored and runners in scoring position. Those are the three
indicators of production."</TE>
<TE>   In the past six seasons, no American League team has advanced to
the playoffs while scoring fewer than 800 runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored 691 last season, joining the Baltimore Orioles
and Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the sub-700 club. The Orioles and Devil
Rays are as likely to be eliminated via contraction as they are to
make the playoffs this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels batted .242 with runners in scoring position last
season, worst in the league. Their on-base percentage was .327, worst
in the division. The top three AL teams in on-base
percentage--Seattle, Oakland and the Cleveland Indians--made the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "On-base percentage is a big thing," left fielder Garret Anderson
said. "It definitely puts more pressure on the pitcher and the
defense."</TE>
<TE>   On-base percentage measures how often a player reaches base but
does not distinguish how he does so--hit, walk or hit by pitch. A
.250 hitter with a .400 on-base percentage reaches base four times
out of 10, preferable to a .275 hitter with a .300 on-base percentage
who reaches base three times out of 10.</TE>
<TE>   In 700 plate appearances--a typical season for an everyday
player--the player with the better on-base percentage reaches base 70
times more, extending that many more innings and providing that many
more scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   The more walks, the better the on-base percentage. The more
walks--and even two-ball and three-ball counts--the sooner a team can
tire out the opposing starting pitcher and pierce the soft underbelly
of middle relief.</TE>
<TE>   Under General Manager Billy Beane, the A's emphasize the
acquisition and development of players with high on-base percentages.
The Angels have two of the best in Salmon and third baseman Troy
Glaus. They also have several of the least patient hitters in the
league in Anderson, Fullmer, second baseman Adam Kennedy and catcher
Bengie Molina.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not giving up the first pitch I see. That might be the best
pitch I'll see in that at-bat," Anderson said. "If a guy throws me a
strike, I'm going to swing at it. Taking a strike? I don't see a
purpose in doing it. You only get three. I have a pretty good idea of
how to put the ball in play.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not as aggressive as I used to be. It hasn't shown up in
my walks, but I'm not swinging at as many bad pitches as I used to."</TE>
<TE>   Said Erstad: "We have some guys that are first-pitch hitters.
That's fine. Just don't chase a pitch early in the count. Get a
hitter's count."</TE>
<TE>   Can veteran major league hitters suddenly develop discipline at
the plate? Hatcher says yes, citing six weeks of daily meetings and
drills stressing that point as well as the enforcement and
reinforcement among players.</TE>
<TE>   "On a winning team, that has to come from the players," Hatcher
said. "These guys have policed themselves very well.... They've
accepted it. They're excited about it."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the Cactus League returns were positive. In
the final week of the exhibition season, the Angels ranked second in
the AL in on-base percentage, second in runs and third in walks.
Fullmer and first baseman Scott Spiezio ranked among league leaders
in walks; Kennedy and Salmon ranked among leaders in on-base
percentage; Erstad and shortstop David Eckstein ranked among leaders
in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Take a walk? Take a few pitches? With a runner in scoring
position, make an out with a fly ball that moves him up one base?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to hear anybody saying 'I can't do it' or 'That's
not my game,'" Hatcher said. "That's not going to happen here
anymore."</TE>

<HD>With Giambi, Yankees May Be Back in Charge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless an editor files a contraction grievance, I'll reduce my 2002
preview to a top 10 as the season opens in Anaheim tonight with the
revived Angels trying to provide an answer for Mo Vaughn's recent
query, "What have they ever won?"</LD>
<LD>   1. New York Yankees: Jason Giambi was simply trying to show he
knows his place in the Bronx. "This is still Derek Jeter's team,"
said the former Oakland A's leader, catching George Steinbrenner's
attention. Responded the Boss: "Jason was trying to say the right
thing, but I would remind him that it's still my team."</LD>
<LD>   2. Seattle Mariners: On the Far West team with the Far East
flavor, ex-Angel Shigetoshi Hasegawa has joined Ichiro Suzuki and
Kazuhiro Sasaki, but Lou Piniella still speaks only one language.
Said the manager of a team that has won 207 regular-season games but
fallen short in each of the last two Septembers: "It'll be a
disappointment if we don't reach the World Series. We eventually have
to break that door down."</LD>
<TE>   3. St. Louis Cardinals: Jason Isringhausen provides the
much-needed closer, and Tino Martinez brings a clutch bat and the
Yankees' winning mentality as the replacement for Mark McGwire. It's
not an easy assignment, despite McGwire's frequent absences the last
two seasons. Wracked by injuries, McGwire still hit 61 homers in 535
at-bats, or one every 8.8 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   4. Arizona Diamondbacks: Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were a
combined 43-12 last year, dominating the West. The rest of the
rotation remains tenuous, but all Johnson and Schilling may require
again--like Spahn and Sain in another era--is a little rain and
reliable relief from closer Byung-Hyun Kim, who will have to prove he
has shaken his World Series trauma.</TE>
<TE>   5. Atlanta Braves: With Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in the last
years of their contracts, and Gary Sheffield having-- temporarily at
least--found peace, this may be a final chance for the Braves to
convert their division dominance (10 titles in 11 years) into a
second World Series crown. It also may be worth clipping and saving
this appraisal of Sheffield by General Manager John Schuerholz as the
Braves closed their spring camp: "The expectations we had about his
ability and his impact on our team, the likelihood of his fitting in
here and being comfortable here, have all come true, at this stage."</TE>
<TE>   6. Houston Astros: The Astros, Cardinals and Chicago Cubs may
stage a dogfight in the NL Central, and maybe the Astros and
Cardinals should be reversed in these rankings. The Astros boast the
best young pitching East of Oakland, will start two rookies--
shortstop Adam Everett and third baseman Morgan Ensberg from USC--on
the left side of their infield and seem to have responded to Manager
Jimy Williams, who takes over a mutinous clubhouse from Larry Dierker
after proving during a tumultuous Red Sox summer he can keep a team
focused on the field.</TE>
<TE>   7. New York Mets: A projected rotation of Al Leiter, Pedro
Astacio, Shawn Estes, Steve Trachsel and Jeff D'Amico was 41-50 last
year, the only reason the Mets are ranked this low and behind the NL
East-rival Braves. Then again, each of the five pitchers experienced
arm trouble last year, and all they really need to provide now are
consistent innings, given the additions of Vaughn, Roberto Alomar,
Roger Cedeno and Jeromy Burnitz to a potent lineup.</TE>
<TE>   8. Oakland Athletics: The A's retain a core of talented young
position players and a dominant big three of pitchers Tim Hudson,
Barry Zito and Mark Mulder, but you don't take a most valuable player
of Giambi's stature out of the middle of the lineup--and
clubhouse--or lose a catalytic leadoff man like Johnny Damon without
consequences. Closer Billy Koch may fill the Isringhausen void, but
it's doubtful that David Justice and whoever the first baseman
is--Carlos Pena? Scott Hatteberg?--can compensate for the offensive
loss. As third baseman Eric Chavez noted, "Jason is gone. He can't
carry the team anymore. One of us has to step up."</TE>
<TE>   9. Boston Red Sox: There are new owners, handpicked by
Commissioner Bud Selig. There are a new general manager, new manager,
new center fielder (Damon), new first baseman (Tony Clark) and new
reserve outfielder with the familiar name of Rickey Henderson. But
unless Pedro Martinez has a new shoulder, the new Red Sox seem
destined for their old role of chasing the Yankees. At least, with
Carl Everett gone and Dan Duquette removed as general manager, they
should do it more pleasantly.</TE>
<TE>   10. Chicago White Sox: They are poised to replace the rebuilding
Cleveland Indians as the dominant team in the AL Central. The
acquisition of explosive leadoff man Kenny Lofton and a sound Frank
Thomas figure to enhance a productive lineup. There is uncertainty,
however, regarding the pitching and defense, both of which were so
bad during spring training that General Manager Ken Williams often
left his seat to remove stress on the treadmill. "It drives me nuts,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wild West?</TE>
<TE>   Despite baseball's labor ills, there is a legitimate sense of
competitive parity--as opposed to the disparity often cited by
management--in the AL and NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the nine contending clubs has something of a playoff shot,
although it may be difficult for any of the seven also-rans to win
enough games to qualify for the wild card given: 1) the unbalanced
schedule in which each team has 19 games to beat up on each of its
division rivals; and 2) a revolving interleague format that pits some
NL West teams against the Yankees and/or Red Sox of the AL East and
some AL West teams against the Cardinals and/or Astros of the NL
Central.</TE>
<TE>   In the NL West, it may be a stretch to think the retrenching
Colorado Rockies and rebuilding San Diego Padres can qualify for the
playoffs, but neither can be totally ignored in a division that has
not had a repeat winner since the Braves moved to the East in 1993.
The Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and Diamondbacks--the defending
division and World Series champions--would be difficult to separate
if Johnson and Schilling didn't represent two-fifths of the Arizona
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "No team in the division has two horses like that at the top of
their rotation," San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said. "We
don't and the Giants don't. The Rockies have Mike Hampton and Denny
Neagle, but they're coming off tough years and haven't proven they
can win consistently in Coors Field. The Dodgers have Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby, but can they hold up physically?</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got two guys capable of winning 40 games, even if
your other three starters only win 10 each, that's 70 wins, not
counting the bullpen and the one or two spot starters that every club
uses. I mean, it's a tough division to handicap in that anything can
happen among four of the five clubs, but you have to put the D-Backs
on top."</TE>
<TE>   Hard to argue that.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Arizona's age issues, the season-opening injuries to Matt
Williams and Erubiel Durazo among others, and the question of Kim's
stability, the dominance of Johnson and Schilling represents the
major difference in a division that should have the Giants, Dodgers,
Rockies and Padres following in that order.</TE>
<TE>   In the AL West, where the Mariners, who won 116 games last year,
and Athletics, who won 102, have both gone to the playoffs each of
the last two years, after beating up on the division rival Angels and
Texas Rangers, none of that will be as easy.</TE>
<TE>   Once known as the AL Worst, the West may be baseball's strongest
division.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, last year's 43-game spread from top (the Mariners) to
bottom (the Rangers) should be significantly tightened.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers enhanced an already explosive lineup and improved an
equally explosive pitching staff, although they open the season with
a numbing assortment of pitching injuries. The Angels, who finished
only two games ahead of Texas, could be the division's most improved
team, thanks finally to Disney's realization it wasn't going to
attract buyers without improving the product.</TE>
<TE>   In a season-opening appraisal of the division, Oakland General
Manager Bill Beane said it's baseball's most competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was last year as well," he added. "The two best
records in baseball came out of the division, and the Angels were in
the picture until their difficult last month. Now it's even more
competitive because the [Angels and Rangers] have improved so much. I
mean, the road to the playoffs isn't equal when you have to come out
of this division to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Beane thinks the A's can do it again despite their
personnel losses but concedes that Seattle has to be favored.</TE>
<TE>   "To improve on a historic season like they had would be difficult,
but I'm not saying they're any less of a team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They would just have to have a lot of things go right again to
win 116 games, but they're still an outstanding team."</TE>
<TE>   Still, carrying the inevitable comparisons to 2001 could be a
burden for the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   So should the improved competition, the opinion here being that
the bedeviled Angels will make a run of it before finishing third
behind the Mariners and A's and ahead of the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fehr Factor</TE>
<TE>   Selig's announcement that owners would not lock out the players or
unilaterally impose new work rules during the season or playoffs may,
indeed, have been a grandstand play (ploy?), as union leader Don Fehr
suggested, but Fehr's hostile reaction underscored the long and
bitter history and proved again that neither side is capable of
turning the other cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Given the opportunity to inflame a situation, one of the sides
almost always will.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Fehr, accusing Selig of trying to fool the public
"into thinking this pledge is a concession of sorts on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr added, "Unilateral implementations are only designed to
affect the off-season, when players sign their contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Management lawyer Rob Manfred strongly disagreed in a phone
interview, saying, "Don was breathing his own smoke," if he didn't
think the clubs could benefit by an in-season implementation of their
proposals for increased revenue sharing, payroll luxury tax and
world-wide draft.</TE>
<TE>   "The suggestion that we didn't give up anything is ludicrous,"
Manfred said. "I could implement tomorrow if we were at impasse, and
the clubs would enjoy a huge benefit from the revenue-sharing plan
we're seeking. There is considerable leverage associated with an
in-season implementation, and we gave that up."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that would have virtually guaranteed a strike, and the
players might still choose that route if convinced the owners plan to
implement new work rules after the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   They struck in August 1994 in valid anticipation of a unilateral
implementation by owners, who were ultimately declared guilty of an
illegal labor practice, ending the longest of baseball's eight work
stoppages.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on a labor agreement resume this week, but little is
expected until the sides are facing off-season pressure and the
possibility of a shutdown by management or players.</TE>
<TE>   As Manfred conceded, "If you're going to have a dispute, it's
better of have it in the off-season, for the sake of the fans."</TE>

<HD>Back to Whack</HD>
<DH>With Ailments and Off-Field Problems in the Past, Karros
Expects to Return to His Past Productivity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Karros may never forget the first time he encountered a baseball
player with serious back trouble. The sight of former teammate Cory
Snyder is etched in the Dodger first baseman's mind, same as his
first big league home run.</LD>
<LD>   "He came into the clubhouse one day [in 1993], and he was
legitimately crooked," Karros said. "I mean, his bellybutton was, I
swear, three inches to the right. I'm thinking to myself, 'What the
heck is this? This is a joke, right?' I didn't understand it."</LD>
<LD>   He understood it last season, and all too well. Karros tore a
lower-back muscle lifting weights a week before spring training in
2001, and by the time he got to Dodgertown he was as crooked as a
lightning bolt.</LD>
<TE>   Karros played hurt all season, with the exception of a three-week
stint on the disabled list, and was a shadow of his normal self,
batting a career-low .235 with 15 home runs and 63 runs batted in. In
his first nine seasons, he had hit .270 and averaged 27 homers and 93
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   It was almost as painful to watch Karros as it was for him to
swing a bat. Never the fleetest of foot or nimblest in the field,
Karros hobbled around the basepaths and strained to make anything
beyond routine defensive plays.</TE>
<TE>   There was a day in Pittsburgh when Karros couldn't hit a ball to
the warning track--in batting practice. There was a day in Colorado
when Karros took himself out of a game, which, for a power hitter in
the thin air of Coors Field, is akin to a poker player folding with a
full house, aces high.</TE>
<TE>   There were those persistent, agonizing questions in Karros' mind:
Am I helping the team by playing hurt? Would the team be better off
with someone else at first base? Am I ever going to feel right again?</TE>
<TE>   There were off-field problems. Karros' mother, Karen, was battling
breast cancer, and Karros was being harassed by a 45-year-old
Leucadia man who later was charged with stalking and making threats.
The man allegedly followed Karros around the country and took gifts
to Karros' parents' house.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, the National League rookie of the year in 1992, declined
to discuss his personal life but did acknowledge that both issues
took a toll. A Dodger official said the stalking case "was on
[Karros'] mind" for much of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "From a statistical standpoint, it was the toughest year of my
career; it was very frustrating," Karros said. "It wasn't like it was
so unbearable I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. But it was a
bad season."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Karros' world seems right-side up.</TE>
<TE>   His mother's cancer is in remission, and Karen is feeling much
better.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Mychel Prudhomme pleaded no-contest last fall to three
misdemeanor counts of stalking, making threats and violating a
restraining order. He was ordered to serve six months at a live-in
mental facility and to stay away from Karros, his family and Dodger
Stadium until 2011.</TE>
<TE>   And Karros' back feels great, thanks to his winter work with
Vancouver physical therapist Alex McKechnie, whose cutting-edge
techniques helped Karros rehabilitate himself to such a degree that
Karros has no doubt he will return to his former production levels
this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers can afford nothing less. With Gary Sheffield traded to
Atlanta for Brian Jordan, Karros, 34, is probably the pivotal player
in the Dodger offense.</TE>
<TE>   If he can bring his normal production--25 homers, 30 doubles, 100
RBIs--to the sixth or seventh spot, it will ease Sheffield's loss and
provide better protection for the heart of the order.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any reason why I'm not going to have a year that is
comparable [to] or better than any year I've had in the past," Karros
said. "I can do things now that I haven't done in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   It can't get any worse than last season. Karros thought his
initial injury was minor, so he didn't tell Dodger trainers. He
figured he was a little stiff and would be fine in a few days, but
after a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., and a long
van ride to Vero Beach, he could barely walk into camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was crooked," Karros said. "I don't think I was ever any worse
than that."</TE>
<TE>   Karros missed most of spring training but was able to start the
season. A month and a half in, he aggravated the back and was put on
the disabled list. He was activated in mid-June and played for a
week, hitting home runs against the Angels' Troy Percival and
Arizona's Randy Johnson, but his back went out again.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers debated whether to put Karros on the DL again,
ultimately deciding to play him. He endured the pain, but his
attempts to compensate for his injury triggered a series of bad
habits that threw his swing out of whack.</TE>
<TE>   "There were days I felt good, and some where I didn't feel so
good," Karros said. "For me, the frustrating thing was, there wasn't
any type of consistency on or off the field. Physically, I wasn't
getting better. I'd go for couple days, think I was making progress
and then, whack. There was never time to shut it down and get it
right."</TE>
<TE>   Not until winter, when Karros began to truly understand how his
body works, did he realize what was happening last season.</TE>
<TE>   "My mind was saying one thing and my body was saying, '[Forget]
this, there's no pain, so this is the way we're going to move and do
things,'" Karros said. "I wasn't putting myself in the most powerful
positions, whether it was to react to a ball defensively, at the
plate, anything."</TE>
<TE>   That was obvious to others.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell by the way he was running, the way he'd go after
ground balls, that he wasn't the same," San Diego General Manager
Kevin Towers said. "Not that he ever had terrific range on defense,
but he could barely bend over. When he ran, he was tight, straight up
and down. When he had to score from first [on a double] you
half-expected him to be on all fours by the time he got to the
plate."</TE>
<TE>   When he is sound, Karros has power to the opposite field, but he
had trouble driving pitches on the outer half of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "Our scouting reports said to just stay away from him," Towers
said. "He wasn't able to drive the ball to the right-center-field gap
like he used to. He tried to pull everything."</TE>
<TE>   Karros muddled through, hoping his good days would outnumber the
bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Did it make sense for me to sit out? I felt with what I had
accomplished, and my presence in lineup, I brought something to the
team," Karros said. "It's not like we had Jeff Bagwell on the bench.
I felt like I had some good at-bats. Was I playing at the level I
played at in past? No, but I felt I did some things to help us."</TE>
<TE>   It was clear, though, that he needed help. Midway through the
season, Karros' personal trainer, Troll Subin, suggested Karros meet
with McKechnie, who was coming to Los Angeles to work with Laker
center Shaquille O'Neal. Karros declined, figuring he wouldn't have
time, but by the end of the season, he had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "By that time," Karros said, "I was open to just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   McKechnie, a Scotsman who has been the Canadian national hockey
team's physical therapist for 20 years and is also a consultant to
the Lakers, the NHL and the English Premier League in soccer, admits
he "doesn't know anything about baseball," but he's an authority on
chronic groin, pelvic, abdominal and lower-back injuries.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to work with Karros on one condition: Karros would
travel to Vancouver for an intensive, two-week training program.
Karros did, missing Thanksgiving and his wedding anniversary, but the
trip was well worth it.</TE>
<TE>   With a series of elastic bands connecting Karros' arms and legs,
McKechnie showed Karros how each action triggers a reaction, how his
body was unbalanced, and how his muscles were not firing in the
proper sequence.</TE>
<TE>   McKechnie developed a demanding three-month, high-energy exercise
program designed to establish stability and strength, and to
re-educate Karros' movement patterns to produce better balance.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric wanted to prevent back issues and told me he's going to
swing a bat about 200,000 times a season," McKechnie said. "That's a
very explosive movement that you need to control, and it's going to
take a toll on anyone's lower back. We had to establish strength to
... stabilize the joints that are subject to swinging a bat."</TE>
<TE>   McKechnie's description of the program can be confusing. He uses
terms such as "proximal strength" and "distal power," and he had
Karros working on a "core board," a three-dimensional balance board
McKechnie designed to create "torsional" movements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like he's some quack who's going to lay hands on you and
heal you," Karros said. "The theory is, your body fires in certain
sequences, and if those are out of whack, you're going to be in
trouble. When you have pain, your body will try to stay away from
that pain and fire in different sequences. Those aren't the right
sequences, but there's no pain. Then, it may lead to other issues.
You may not be as strong, as powerful, as functional, but you're
alleviating the pain."</TE>
<TE>   Karros followed McKechnie's program all winter and carried it into
this season. While teammates stretched before spring training games,
Karros was often off to the side with his core board, looking like a
guy in a one-man step-aerobic class, and doing leg, trunk and arm
exercises that looked like a cross between martial arts and
pantomime.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain it, and I would be doing a disservice to try to
explain it--you have to ask Alex," Karros said. "All I know is, my
balance is a thousand times better, and I can do things I haven't
done in a long time. I understand things about movement that I never
did."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy loves the result.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks like two different people," Tracy said early in spring
training. "Eric Karros last year was in no way as agile as he is this
spring. I'm looking at two different guys. He's a completely
different player now, and we're excited about that."</TE>
<TE>   But will it translate to success on the field? Karros didn't
exactly tear up the Grapefruit League, hitting .173 with no home runs
and three runs batted in. He still looked a little stiff on the
basepaths, though he picked up his pace in the final week of games,
and he'll never be confused with J.T. Snow around the bag.</TE>
<TE>   Several scouts remain skeptical about Karros' chances of returning
to his 25-homer, 100-RBI form, and the Dodgers gave Shawn Green
plenty of work at first base in case Karros isn't sound. Karros
doesn't think Plan B will be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "On the field, I feel great, and at the plate, I don't feel good,
but that's not atypical; I don't think I've ever felt good in the
spring," he said. "The difference is, I'm able to hit extra, to get
extra work in. There aren't physical issues that are holding me back,
and that's different.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason I shouldn't have the typical year I've had in
the past. I can't sit here and say I'm going to do this, this and
this. All I can say is, physically, I've put myself in the best
position I can. Do I feel like I'm going to be successful? Yes."</TE>

<HD>There's Potential, but Many Problems Exist</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Tracy thinks L.A. can score with speed instead of
power. Rotation and bullpen have serious questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of the New York Yankee
teams that have won four of the last six World Series is that their
whole has been greater than the sum of their parts.</LD>
<LD>   Only twice since 1996 has a Yankee hit more than 30 home runs in a
season, and only three times has a Yankee stole more than 30 bases.
There have been only three 20-game winners in the Yankee rotation in
six years, and of the six Gold Glove awards, only two were won by
someone other than center fielder Bernie Williams.</LD>
<LD>   But the Yankees combined high on-base ability at the top of the
order, clutch hitting in the middle and solid contributions at the
bottom, smart, aggressive base-running, consistent starting pitching,
superb late-game relief and dependable defense to forge another
baseball dynasty.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, on the other hand, appear to be the un-Yanks. There
are some attractive individual pieces and the potential for some
unknown pieces to emerge, but uncertainty surrounds so many key
components, they don't seem to fit together very well.</TE>
<TE>   Add it up, and the Dodgers, who open the 2002 season Tuesday at
home against San Francisco, will be hard-pressed to end their 13-year
drought without a playoff victory.</TE>
<TE>   Unless their ace, Kevin Brown, a right-hander with one of the
game's nastiest repertoires, and right-hander Andy Ashby, whose 2001
season lasted only two starts, recover fully from elbow surgery and
give the Dodgers 30-plus starts each.</TE>
<TE>   And their Japanese left-hander, Kazuhisa Ishii, suppresses the
jitters that hindered him in spring training, finds a consistent
rhythm to his delivery and controls his arsenal of pitches.</TE>
<TE>   And their young left-hander, Odalis Perez, proves the Dodgers made
a wise choice in picking him over Omar Daal for the rotation by
pitching deep into games and giving his team a chance to win on a
regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   And their converted starter, Eric Gagne, who has a 97-mph
fastball, an excellent curve and an improving changeup but only 10
career relief appearances, quickly develops the mentality required to
close games and gives the Dodgers a reliable ninth-inning hammer.</TE>
<TE>   And their right fielder, Shawn Green, who had a career year with
Gary Sheffield next to him in the lineup in 2001, sees enough quality
pitches to approach his production of a .297 batting average, 49 home
runs, and 125 runs batted in from last season.</TE>
<TE>   And their corner infielders, first baseman Eric Karros and third
baseman Adrian Beltre, rebound from awful, injury-plagued seasons and
team with new left fielder Brian Jordan to provide clutch hits and
lineup protection for Green.</TE>
<TE>   And their catcher, Paul Lo Duca, proves his breakthrough season in
2001, when he hit a team-high .320 with 25 home runs, 28 doubles, 90
RBIs, a .374 on-base percentage and a .379 mark with runners in
scoring position, was no fluke.</TE>
<TE>   And their 22-year-old shortstop, Cesar Izturis, the Dodgers' sixth
opening-day shortstop in six years, lives up to his spring-training
accolades by providing quality defense and some energy, speed and a
run-producing boost to the second spot in the order.</TE>
<TE>   And their new leadoff batter, center fielder Dave Roberts, sets
the table far better than the Dodgers did in 2001, when their leadoff
batters combined for a .306 on-base percentage, second-worst in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   Get the picture? A lot has to go right for the Dodgers, who
finished six games behind Arizona despite a dizzying array of
injuries last season, to compete for the National League West
championship. Yet, there is the potential for so much to go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the capabilities of being a very productive offensive
club if everyone does what they've done historically," Karros said.
"Nobody has to be great. But we can't have three guys be bad. I don't
even know if we can have two guys be bad."</TE>
<TE>   It seems risky for a team with a $102-million payroll that fancies
itself a playoff contender to have such inexperience in the middle of
the field, at the top of the lineup and in the closer role.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers didn't have a choice. An inflexible roster filled
with bloated, impossible-to-trade contracts tied General Manager Dan
Evans' hands, forcing him to make patchwork, mostly low-budget
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal, though, was to become more athletic and less
lethargic, to construct an offense based on speed more than power,
one that could put more pressure on the defense, and to rely on those
old staples, pitching and defense.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts and Izturis may not be the second coming of former St.
Louis Cardinal sparkplugs Vince Coleman and Willie McGee, but they
have the potential to be more productive than the top of the 2001
Dodger lineup. If they get on base, Jim Tracy can manage more
aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   "Will this lineup play itself out? I don't know, but it has some
of the ingredients that were not there in a pennant race a year ago,"
Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't hit enough at the bottom of the order, and we didn't
get on base enough at the top. If our pitchers do what their resumes
dictate, we won't have to score six runs a game."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have been a station-to-station team for several years,
but hitting Coach Jack Clark, who played with Coleman and McGee on
those great Cardinal teams of the 1980s, thinks they can wreak havoc
on the basepaths in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "When you peck away, when you can score runs without getting hits,
it just kills [opponents]," Clark said. "If you do that early in the
game, you can demoralize a team. They're like, 'God, we didn't give
up any hits, and they've already scored.'</TE>
<TE>   "That's how the Cardinals were. Guys got on base, the catcher had
to call more fastballs, the pitchers had to slide-step, and that took
more focus away from the hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense is forced to make plays. It benefits you in a lot of
little ways."</TE>
<TE>   All spring, Tracy stressed the importance of going from first to
third on singles, of taking a base on a pitch in the dirt or when an
outfielder overthrows a cut-off man, of getting runners home from
third with less than two outs, of being patient at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Tracy stressed the same things last season, and the
Dodgers scored fewer runs (758 to 798), had fewer walks (519 to 668),
a lower on-base percentage (.323 to .341) and fewer sacrifice hits
(57 to 66) than they did in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Money Can't Buy Them Love</HD>
<DH>Yankees' Free Spending Angers Rivals, but Their Success Is
Based as Much on Sound Judgment as on Expensive Signings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees have done it again, angering baseball while
trying to maintain professional sports' most successful dynasty.</LD>
<LD>   Owner George Steinbrenner opened his checkbook after the Yankees
finished on the wrong end of a thrilling, seven-game World Series
against the Arizona Diamondbacks last season, stirring off-the-record
industry criticism with each free-agent signing.</LD>
<LD>   Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks gave shortstop Alex Rodriguez a
record 10-year, $252-million contract before the 2001 season. But the
Rangers aren't expected to print playoff tickets anytime soon. The
Yankees are expected to remain big winners--and a major target for
critics of free spending.</LD>
<TE>   The 26-time World Series champions have participated in every
postseason since 1995, including five of the last six Series, but
criticism comes with the territory for the major leagues' richest and
winningest franchise. Sound decisions, not only spending sprees, have
contributed to Yankees' recent bedrock-solid foundation, and the
Dodgers can attest that spending money doesn't guarantee
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things that get lost in the shuffle when
people talk about [the money the Yankees spend], and we certainly get
defensive about," General Manager Brian Cashman said this spring.
"This is my fifth year as the general manager, and in the first four
it seems like there was a perception that we had the highest payroll
every year. Two of my first four years we didn't have the highest
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, fortunately for us, for the last seven years
or so, we've had so much success. Therefore, it's easy to say, 'Well,
the reason they win is because of the money.' I've been here since
1986. We had money in the '80s and we had money in the early '90s,
just like we have money now, but we didn't win in the '80s and we
didn't win in the early '90s. I didn't hear as much complaining as I
do now, or people saying they win because they have the money."</TE>
<TE>   However, Cashman acknowledges the Yankees do spend more than most,
and they power-shopped this winter to bolster an inconsistent batting
order and increase rotation and bullpen depth after capturing their
38th American League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks prevented the Yankees from winning their fourth
Series in a row, so Cashman invested almost $172 million in free
agents. Masterpiece of the improvement project was Jason Giambi, the
AL's most valuable player in 2000, who was coaxed away from the
Oakland Athletics for more than $120 million. The moves kept the
Yankees atop baseball's payroll list at $125 million and enlarged the
bull's-eye on those familiar pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring the dynamic Giambi was one thing, Yankee critics
contend, but they also blew out the set-up man market, giving Steve
Karsay $22 million.</TE>
<TE>   Skilled but often-injured outfielder Rondell White was considered
a risky signing at $9.9 million, then Steinbrenner dropped more than
$6 million to bring back left-hander David Wells, one of the Boss'
favorite players, despite having already committed $11.8 million to
left-hander Sterling Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   That gave the Yankees six accomplished starting pitchers for five
rotation spots--a luxury most teams can't afford. Hitchcock will open
the season on the disabled list because of a strained ligament in his
lower back, so big bucks have once again helped the Yankees' cause.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the argument about the money, but that just guarantees
you're spending a lot of money," Giambi said. "The thing that they've
done an incredible job with is that the guys they've pursued have
gelled together."</TE>
<TE>   Said center fielder Bernie Williams: "This is not a team made out
of random pieces. We have the resources to go out there and get
premier guys and then blend everything together."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees pride themselves on decision-making, and they've made
many correct ones during their latest postseason run that began in
1995. Cashman; Mark Newman, vice president of baseball operations,
and Gene Michael, vice president of big-league scouting, form the
nucleus of Steinbrenner's talented advisory council.</TE>
<TE>   The group has drafted well and augmented the farm system through
the international free-agent market, signing and developing stars
such as closer Mariano Rivera and second baseman Alfonso Soriano. The
Yankees have traded surplus talent in the minors to acquire help for
playoff pushes, retaining most of their top prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, serendipity has played a role too, explaining the
timely October contributions of journeymen such as Luis Sojo and
Dodger castoff Jose Vizcaino.</TE>
<TE>   "You can look at it and say, 'Well, they've got a high payroll,'
or you can go down the line of who's making what and see if they come
from our organization," shortstop Derek Jeter said. "A lot of our own
players are being rewarded for the team's success. You've got
[catcher] Jorge [Posada], myself, Soriano, Bernie [Williams],
[starter Andy] Pettitte, Mariano [Rivera]. These are all guys who are
being rewarded from the organization. The reason why we're able to
get a lot of players [through trades] is because we have a good
minor-league system, so it's not just because we have a lot of money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about making the right decisions and doing the right things.
Just take each organization and look at the minor-league system. You
can see that we have one of the best minor-league systems as well,
and we don't necessarily have a high payroll in the minor leagues. We
have a lot of guys who are doing a great job, Mark Newman in
particular. The job that they've done with the minor-league system
... it's something that I think other teams should try to pattern
themselves after."</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Robin Ventura, traded from the New York Mets in the
off-season, said the Yankees are simultaneously admired and resented.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain amount of envy when you're on the other side,"
he said. "They're good, they're consistent and they zero in on what
they want. Like anything else, they probably get a little lucky, but
they seem to make the right decisions."</TE>

<DH>East vs. West: Continental Divide Appears to Shape Passion
for the Game</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the dawn of a new baseball season, as if fans in Southern
California needed to be reminded. Yeah, they see the sun rise in the
East, same as the Yankees and the Mets do most years. And, right,
they see it set in the West, just like the Dodgers and the Angels,
dead-end summer after dead-end summer.</LD>
<LD>   Stow it, sun.</LD>
<LD>   Local fans, already resigned to the fact there will be no Freeway
Series in October, for the 42nd consecutive October, do not need any
more aggravation. Not when Mo Vaughn, the latest
hyped-till-he-dropped bust to sweep through Anaheim, can be heard
braying in the Met clubhouse, taunting his former teammates: "Ain't
none of them done a damn thing in this game, bottom line. They ain't
got no flags hanging at friggin' Edison Field."</LD>
<TE>   And then there's Mike Piazza, the Dodger icon who got away, the
one-time king of Chavez Ravine and Manhattan Beach, telling anyone
who will listen how much more he enjoys playing in the East, how the
fans are more passionate in the East, how the atmosphere is more
intense in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza would say that. In his five full seasons with the Dodgers,
Piazza never won a postseason game. In his third season with the
Mets, Piazza played in the World Series. Fans tend to get passionate
when their team is in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles up the coast, Oakland is going through the same thing.
The A's had their own roughhewn version of Piazza in Jason
Giambi--hero, heavy hitter, hell raiser--and now he's also gone to
New York. Giambi had been the raucous soul of the wild and woolly
A's, fighting the good fight of trying to dethrone the Yankees
despite their mid-market trappings. But then free agency beckoned,
the Yankees were in a mood to retool after losing the World Series in
the last inning of the seventh game, and there Giambi went--gone from
saving baseball in Oakland to shaving his goatee for George
Steinbrenner, just like that.</TE>
<TE>   It is 2002, or so says the calendar. It only feels like 1952, when
the baseball teams out West existed primarily to promote their top
prospects to the big clubs in the East. Learn your craft here, polish
your tools here, but when you want to get serious about your
baseball, it's time to head to New York or Boston or Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   After lobbying through the media for a trade back to the East
Coast late last year, Vaughn got his wish Dec. 27, when the Angels
sent him to the Mets for pitcher Kevin Appier. In a conference call
with reporters the same day, Vaughn, a former American League most
valuable player with the Boston Red Sox, was exultant.</TE>
<TE>   "The everyday attitude to get up and make it happen is something I
thrived on in Boston," he said. "I missed it in L.A. There's a
certain mentality, attitude that goes along with playing on the East
Coast, in New York and Boston. That fits me as a player."</TE>
<TE>   He was back in the bigs, in other words.</TE>
<TE>   This might come as news in Arizona, where the World Series
championship trophy rests, or San Francisco, where the single-season
home-run record rests, or Seattle, where the most exciting new player
in the sport, Ichiro Suzuki, never rests.</TE>
<TE>   But Vaughn espouses a view held by many in the game, that the East
is a different beast--major league baseball in its most concentrated
form.</TE>
<TE>   A case can be made.</TE>
<TE>   East Coast: Mickey Mantle. West Coast: Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   East Coast: The Green Monster in left field. West Coast: The Rally
Monkey on the video screen.</TE>
<TE>   East Coast: Fights in the bleachers. West Coast: The flight of the
beach ball getting swatted around the bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was brought up in a pressure-packed situation in Boston,"
Vaughn said before the Mets played the Dodgers in an exhibition game
last week. "Overall, the East Coast is a get-it-done-yesterday type
situation. And I seem to thrive on that. Not necessarily for the
publicity, but the situation. That's the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Piazza believes there is "more of a football mentality on the East
Coast. You lose a game, it's like the end of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember a few years ago, [the Mets] opened the season with a
$70-million payroll, in 1999. The first day, we lost to the Marlins
and the back page the next day said, '$70-Million Flops.' You laugh
about it. Next day, we won the game and it was, 'Mets Get Their
Money's Worth.'</TE>
<TE>   "A lot has to do with the blue-collar work ethic of the towns back
East. It's reflected in the media, in the whole roller-coaster ride
of the media there. You can be a hero one day, next day you're a
goat. One day you're the greatest thing since Mickey Mantle, the next
day they want to run you out of town."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Phillie Manager Larry Bowa previously coached in
Anaheim and managed in San Diego. He has seen major league life from
both sides of the country and maintains that "overall, there's more
of a sense of urgency to excel on the East Coast. They don't have a
lot of other things to do, whereas on the West Coast, the fans have a
lot of stuff to do out there. It's more laid-back. It's a little more
casual. It's really a form of entertainment for them.</TE>
<TE>   "On the East Coast, it's, 'Hey, we want you to win at all costs.
It's our summer, don't screw it up.'"</TE>
<TE>   On the East Coast, a defeat is treated "like a death in the
family," Bowa said. "Especially if they have high expectations for
you and you're floundering early. I mean, you turn on a radio talk
show and you get buried, everybody's getting buried....</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel that, that urgency as soon as you take the field.
Obviously, they're a lot more vocal. If you don't do well, they let
you know about it. I'm not saying they don't boo on the West Coast,
but it's very minimal compared to the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Part of it can be attributed to location. So it's July in Southern
California and the Angels are losing? So let's
surf/kayak/jog/roller-blade/golf the blues away.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee pitcher Roger Clemens says he has "seen a few times in
Anaheim where a guy is throwing a cool game and people get up in the
fifth, sixth or seventh inning and head for the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say those fans are any less knowledgeable about
the game. To the contrary. When the other option is three more
innings with the Rally Monkey, any savvy baseball observer is going
to opt for the pier.</TE>
<TE>   In the East, there are fewer alternatives for stress release.
"There's not that much to do, unless you want to go to the shore,"
Bowa said. "In the East, the fans line up [their lives] around
sporting events, basically."</TE>
<TE>   Part of it is a consequence of history. Most of the teams in the
East are older, hence they have more of it. More to live with, more
to live up to and, in the notable cases of the Red Sox and Phillies,
more to live down.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there is a more entrenched generation-to-generation
baseball thing in the East," baseball broadcaster and commentator Bob
Costas said. "All the California cities are either relocation or
expansion cities. Now that goes back 30, 40 years in some cases, but
the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Phillies have more of a history than
these teams do--unless you're counting the A's history in
Philadelphia and the Dodgers' history in Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "They have more of a history in their present locations. More
history--and in the case of the Phillies and the Red Sox, more
pathology. Even though there may be some disappointments, I don't
know if an L.A. Dodger fan carries the same psychic scars as Red Sox
fans do, or even as Phillies fans do.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also the settings. Dodger Stadium is a beautiful,
beautiful location and a considerable amount of history has taken
place there. But it's not Yankee Stadium or Fenway Park, you know?
Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park have that sense of ghosts being there.</TE>
<TE>   "And, you know, Sandy Koufax is not a ghost. He's alive. Duke
Snider's alive. [Almost] all the great L.A. Dodgers are alive. In the
East, there may be a little bit more of that kind of mythology
attached.</TE>
<TE>   "The L.A. Dodgers have an undeniably great history and they have
baseball's greatest voice in Vin Scully, who's an ongoing link to
that history. So I'm not saying that it's nonexistent. Not by any
means. I just think it's deeper--certainly for the Yankees and the
Red Sox and the Phillies."</TE>
<TE>   Is more intense better?</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn believes so.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels played very well in Yankee Stadium," he said, "because
the level of play has to come up. For me, to have that on an everyday
basis can only bring your game up, because you can't hide, there's
nowhere to go.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in the limelight and you're going to be seen. If you're
not intimidated by it, it can help you as a player."</TE>
<TE>   For those who are intimidated, Bowa offers some quick career
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not a mentally tough person and you're traded to an
East Coast team, it might have an effect on you--fans calling you a
bum," he says. "If that bothers you, you might want to get into
another line of work. Or try to get traded back out West."</TE>

<DH>In Final Analysis, This Self-Destructive Sport Should Have
Its Head Examined</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, doctor, my aching head.</LD>
<LD>   What's the last thing you remember?</LD>
<LD>   Swirling dust.</LD>
<TE>   You were sweeping?</TE>
<TE>   I was cheering.</TE>
<TE>   Cheering the dust?</TE>
<TE>   Cheering a baseball that fell through that dust, fell into left
field, raised Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Please?</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez hit the ball, Tony Womack scored the run, and the
Arizona Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees and their unbeatable
relief pitcher Mariano Rivera in the final inning of the final day of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Then what did you see?</TE>
<TE>   I saw people crying.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the dust?</TE>
<TE>   Because of the drama.</TE>
<TE>   How so?</TE>
<TE>   The seven-game series renewed faith in baseball's enduring powers
of imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Then what?</TE>
<TE>   Then I woke up and Minnesota had moved to death row, Montreal had
moved to Florida, and chaos had moved to Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   And?</TE>
<TE>   And Commissioner Bud Selig waved a gun at the union, the union
waved a middle finger at Selig, and their road rage could send the
season into a ditch.</TE>
<TE>   Anything more?</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds was snarling at Sammy Sosa, and Mo Vaughn was belching
on Troy Percival, and the Padres and Angels were trying to kill one
another in an old folks' home.</TE>
<TE>   How did all this make you feel?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, doctor, my aching head.</TE>
<TE>   Could you take two Tony Gwynns and call me in the morning?</TE>
<TE>   Can't.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe drink two tablespoons of Cal Ripken Jr., then go back to
work?</TE>
<TE>   Not possible.</TE>
<TE>   Eat a Big Mac?</TE>
<TE>   Going, going, gone.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the 2002 baseball season and, no, that dryness in your
throat and throbbing in your temples has nothing to do with
Byung-Hyun Kim.</TE>
<TE>   That's a hangover.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz that carried baseball through a splendid autumn has been
replaced by the drone of an awful winter, the siren of an ominous
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Our aching heads indeed.</TE>
<TE>   When baseball left the field in November, at the completion of one
of the best World Series in history, it was dancing.</TE>
<TE>   When it again sets foot on a field today in Anaheim, it will be
weaving.</TE>
<TE>   Unsettled in its labor situation. Lacking three beloved stars.
Hoping for another dust ball in the bottom of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Open up the opener. Look inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rescheduled their first game against the Cleveland
Indians for today, Easter Sunday, so it could be nationally televised
by ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   But, it turns out, ESPN is going to bump the baseball game to
smaller ESPN2 and show a higher-rated event instead.</TE>
<TE>   The national championship of women's college basketball.</TE>
<TE>   After an autumn that resurrected the game's universal heartbeat,
baseball has reverted to a league of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the playoff moment when the Yankees' Derek Jeter ran
across the diamond to cut off an errant outfield throw and flipped
the ball to catcher Jorge Posada for a tag at home plate?</TE>
<TE>   Remember how everyone said that Jeter had illustrated baseball's
splendid simplicity with his glove?</TE>
<TE>   In spring training this year, teammate Ruben Rivera stole that
glove. Sold it to a memorabilia collector. Got caught. Was fired.
Nice.</TE>
<TE>   But it was no worse than other things that happened while we were
burning our hands on that hot stove.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the Yankees' opponent in that playoff series, those
low-payroll, high-fun Oakland Athletics?</TE>
<TE>   Remember how their success was symbolized by the lovably rowdy
brothers Giambi?</TE>
<TE>   This winter, Jason Giambi was given a gazillion dollars to sign
with the Yankees while brother Jeremy was in Las Vegas being cited
for marijuana possession.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees lost four starting position players but still
improved, which is good for a sport whose history is anchored in
dynasties.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some of the lousy teams got worse, and that is bad.</TE>
<TE>   Quick, name the manager of the Montreal Expos.</TE>
<TE>   A hint: He doesn't work for the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Quick, name the manager of the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   A hint: He was not hired by the Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Quick, name three of the nine players who will be in the
opening-day lineup for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   We ask for three, because we could only name three.</TE>
<TE>   Selig had the right idea about contraction. But he wrongly tried
to rearrange the apartment without talking to the roommate.</TE>
<TE>   The union stopped him in mid-move, and now baseball looks a bit
like a house with its furniture spread across the front lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Forget trying to guess whether anyone will break Barry Bonds'
73-home run record this year.</TE>
<TE>   A more intriguing pool would involve picking the lowest nightly
attendance in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Expos' new president will be used to the empty seats.</TE>
<TE>   A guy named Tony Tavares.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and operated by Major League Baseball until somebody has a
better idea, the Expos are a dead team walking.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, so are about 15 other clubs, suffocating in small
markets with low payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   This means only about half of the teams even have a reasonable
chance.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves,
St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros will all be good again ...</TE>
<TE>   Only the Yankees will still have Don Zimmer, the bench coach who
typifies a team that doesn't let the little things bother it. Don
Zimmer, unabashedly appearing soon in a television commercial for
Preparation H.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of its baggage, baseball still has no clock.</TE>
<TE>   And where there is no clock, there is hope.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, on the tanned faces of players returning from spring
training.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, on the chilled faces of those fans who will bundle up to
watch them.</TE>
<TE>   The ivy at Wrigley Field is brown, but soon it will be green.</TE>
<TE>   The monster at Fenway Park is green, but maybe a healthy Nomar
Garciaparra hits enough line drives to turn it brown.</TE>
<TE>   There is hope in Anaheim, where the veteran starting pitchers can
remember if Tim Salmon and Darin Erstad can forget.</TE>
<TE>   There is hope at Chavez Ravine, if not for a championship, then
for a return of competitiveness, and why not? A football player roams
left field, a hockey player leads the bullpen, and a young Cesar
rules the middle.</TE>
<TE>   There won't be any of the milestone moments of last season.</TE>
<TE>   But who knows, maybe somebody will give Jose Canseco a chance to
hit 38 more home runs and reach 500.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Roger Clemens will catch enough breaks--and Alfonso Soriano
will catch enough balls--for the pitcher to win 20 games and reach
300 career victories.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Ron Gardenhire will work wonders in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mo Vaughn will work off 50 pounds in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Chan-Ho Park will find a game face in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Rick Ankiel will find the strike zone in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Gary Sheffield will be happy in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Nah.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, oh maybe, this is the year the Giants finish dead stinking
last.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least behind the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, the cure for this hangover is no complicated
formula, really.</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple prescription that can be scribbled in two words from
a pen whose ink, while prone to fading, remains indelible.</TE>
<TE>   Play ball.</TE>

<TE>   Off-the-Field Dreams</TE>
<TE>   Some key points during baseball's off-season:</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 6: Idea of eliminating two teams, reportedly the Minnesota
Twins and Montreal Expos, emerges.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 7: Collective bargaining agreement with players expires.
Negotiations continue intermittently, but season will start with no
new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 6: Commissioner Bud Selig is called before congressional
panel, says baseball lost $232 million and is in dire financial
straits. Congressional leaders ridicule the findings and Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura says, "It's asinine. [Owners] did not get the
wealth they have by being stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 4: Minnesota Supreme Court upholds injunction forcing Twins
to play out their lease at Metrodome, effectively ending any plans to
eliminate teams.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 5: Selig says idea to eliminate teams if off "for this
season."</TE>
<TE>   March 26: Selig says baseball will not lock out players or declare
a negotiating impasse in contract talk. Players' union responds that
that doesn't mean there won't be a work stoppage this season.</TE>

<HD>Setting It Right</HD>
<DH>Salmon Has Built Up a Decade of Goodwill as He Attempts to
Rebound From His Worst Season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Fish Bowl, they do not boo Tim Salmon. Never have, never will.
It's not proper etiquette to boo your host.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon and his wife Marci buy 100 tickets for each game at Edison
Field, then distribute them among youth groups, churches, shelters
and other charitable organizations. The "Fish Bowl" block of
tickets--a cute if obvious pun on Salmon's last name--is located in
the right-field stands, so the right fielder can turn around and hear
cheers, greetings and thanks from the fans he has treated to a game.</LD>
<LD>   "I can count on at least a small section of people not ragging
me," he says, chuckling.</LD>
<TE>   In the world according to Mo Vaughn, everyone else in the ballpark
would have been booing Salmon during his terrible 2001 season. It's
that East Coast intensity, Vaughn would say. Life in, well, a fish
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Fans would remind you--loudly, rudely and daily--just how much you
stink. So would columnists in the sports pages, and callers on the
radio. Team executives would be quoted--anonymously, of course--ruing
the day they guaranteed you $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Not in Anaheim, not with Salmon. The national face of the team
changes from Jim Edmonds to Vaughn to Darin Erstad, but Salmon
remains a local treasure, a quiet pillar of strength, a model of
consistency and excellence. His reservoir of goodwill, filled by a
decade of one 30-homer season after another and by twice skipping
free agency to stay with the pennant-challenged Angels, served him
well during the worst season of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, all around, I was very fortunate," he says. "Everybody
around me was supporting me--fans, teammates, media, management."</TE>
<TE>   Said General Manager Bill Stoneman, "There were a lot of us who
were feeling for Tim."</TE>
<TE>   So, when Salmon joked that the Fish Bowl assured him of a few
dozen fans cheering for him, he quickly acknowledged that thousands
of other fans had done so too. No more than scattered boos were heard
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing about Angel fans that I've always known," he
said. "We have our loyal Angel fans. They may be outnumbered many
times, but they are supportive."</TE>
<TE>   That loyalty could be severely tested this year. If Salmon, 33,
puts up another season like the last one, the waters could be rough
outside the Fish Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   One wretched season? Happens to the best of them, particularly
when injuries are involved. Another one? That would be troubling for
any team and particularly problematic for this one.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are wedded to Salmon, for better or for worse, for the
next four years, at a cost of $40 million, their longest and largest
financial commitment among players. The New York Yankees, awash in
cash, can afford to cut a fading millionaire or two and write off the
contracts. The Angels would be horrified at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   To say the Angels will win if Salmon packs his typical punch is an
overstatement. The Angels haven't won a division championship since
1986, when Salmon was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   But if Salmon doesn't hit, the Angels won't win. In 1999, with
Salmon hampered by a wrist injury and Edmonds by a shoulder injury,
the Angels lost 92 games and finished last. Last season, with Salmon,
Vaughn and Erstad all bitten by the injury bug, the Angels finished
41 games out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't underestimate how important he is," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "Not to put too much pressure on one guy, but he's
absolutely a key to our lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon does not shy away from that burden, or hide behind cliches
about how nine men make a lineup, not one. He bats third, the spot
traditionally reserved for the best hitter, a slot that demands he
drive in the hitters ahead of him and get on base for the power
hitters behind him. The hitter who replaces him in the lineup might
be more comfortable doing one or the other, but not both.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team game, but the team is made up of components, and if
they can't do what's expected, the whole thing bogs down," Salmon
said. "If it's the right guy in the right situation, it can really
cause problems."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia used 130 starting lineups last season, more than all but
one American League rival, grasping for offense from the few players
providing it. Scott Spiezio batted everywhere from second to ninth.
Scioscia dropped Salmon to sixth and, for the first time in his
career, seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd like to say, 'We're a team and we can rebound,'" Salmon
said. "Bottom line is, certain guys carry a different impact on the
game. I realize that.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between us being good when I hit 30 home runs,
drive in 100 runs and score 100 runs vs. last year, when I did about
half that, affects everybody in the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, a lifetime .291 hitter, batted a career-low .227 last
season. He drove in 49 runs, another career low. The franchise leader
in home runs went four weeks without hitting one. He hit 17 in all,
tying a career low.</TE>
<TE>   He hit .233 in April, stirring little concern because he typically
starts slowly. Then he hit .188 in May, .198 in June and .194 in
July, when the Angels had seen enough and put him on the disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman guaranteed that $40-million contract extension to Salmon
in March. The general manager insists he did not fall ill with
buyer's remorse.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't," he said. "You make a commitment and you go forward."</TE>
<TE>   So what sent Salmon spiraling? He was never at full strength last
year, not after rehabilitation from foot and shoulder surgeries
prevented him from completing his usual off-season workouts and from
lifting weights during the season, and not after a groin injury
interrupted his spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "And how much of it was in his head?" Stoneman said. "The real
answer is, probably all of the above."</TE>
<TE>   For so many years, Salmon was tagged as the best player never to
appear in the All-Star game. In one startling year, Salmon was tagged
as a veteran whose contract might outlast his skills.</TE>
<TE>   You can rehabilitate an injury, but you cannot regain lost bat
speed or reaction time. With every hitless game last season, Salmon
could not help but wonder whether this was the beginning of the end.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times where you're getting your head beat in. Guys
were beating you who shouldn't be beating you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, there's doubt. Yeah, there's questions. You're denying the
fact you're not healthy. You're assuming these guys are beating you
because they're better. Then you step back and say, 'Let me see what
I can do when I'm healthy.' You lose touch with reality and
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon appeared physically and mentally sound this spring. To the
world, the monstrous home runs offered proof. To him, the first
slider he hit offered proof.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year? Hitting the slider? I couldn't do it," he said. "I was
always looking for a fastball. When I can be strong, I can let the
ball come to me, and I can react. I don't have to be concerned with
swinging at the first fastball I see. I can let it go and have
confidence I can hit the slider."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, right field belongs to Salmon, just as first base
belongs to Jeff Bagwell in Houston and center field belongs to Bernie
Williams in New York. Tonight, for the 10th consecutive opener,
Salmon starts in right field for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous 10 openers, the Angels started 10 right fielders:
Von Hayes, Dave Winfield, Claudell Washington, Tony Armas, Chili
Davis, George Hendrick, Ruppert Jones, Reggie Jackson, Fred Lynn and
Bob Clark.</TE>
<TE>   The long-suffering Angel fans have seen the revolving door that
preceded Salmon. They're in no hurry to look ahead to the next right
fielder, or parade of right fielders. One poor year is easily
forgiven.</TE>

<DH>While Craig Armstrong the electronica artist took a break,
Craig Armstrong the film composer took a career leap with 'Moulin
Rouge.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the music industry, a long delay between a first and second album
is often seen as damaging beyond repair, raising the prospects of
being forgotten at best, or at least losing momentum.</LD>
<LD>   But in the case of Scottish composer and electronic musician Craig
Armstrong, the four years between "The Space Between Us" in 1998 and
his imminent follow-up, "As if to Nothing," may well be the best
thing that could have happened to him.</LD>
<LD>   During the hiatus, Armstrong took on the role of a musical
lifetime: writing and performing the score to Baz Luhrmann's
Oscar-winning "Moulin Rouge." Although the film's score wasn't
eligible for an Oscar last week because less than 50% of the music
was original, Armstrong won a Golden Globe and an AFI Award for his
ambitious, romantic score.</LD>
<TE>   With Hollywood relying more and more on electronic musicians for
scores (Paul Oakenfold for "Swordfish," BT on "The Fast and the
Furious"), Armstrong may well be the perfect modern composer.</TE>
<TE>   He's one of the leading figures in the dance music world. His
production, arranging and composition skills have been used by such
mainstream supporters of electronic music as Madonna, Bjork, Pet Shop
Boys and U2, as well as electronic star William Orbit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his electronic background, including work with the
seminal Bristol, England, group Massive Attack, Armstrong studied at
London's Royal Academy of Music. The combination of old and new
sensibilities has made him one of the most sought-after new composers
in Hollywood. His score credits include "Mission: Impossible," "Bone
Collector," "Best Laid Plans" and Luhrmann's "William Shakespeare's
Romeo + Juliet."</TE>
<TE>   "He learned the fundamentals of telling stories through music on
'Romeo + Juliet,'" Luhrmann says of his collaborator. "He now
actually is advancing the cause of telling stories through music. So
working with him now is an equal relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Says Armstrong, "I met my agent today, and I can get a film every
month. But I told him if I only do one film a year every two years as
long as it's really special and I can really connect to it, I'll be
happy."</TE>
<TE>   That's in large part because he wants to avoid a repeat of that
delay between his albums. Although when the atmospheric new album,
which features appearances by Bono, Scottish rock band Mogwai and
former Lemonheads singer Evan Dando, is released on April 16, the
"Moulin Rouge" connection will be a big part of Astralwerks Records'
marketing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   It's all heady stuff for Armstrong, 43, a family man who still
lives in his hometown of Glasgow and didn't decide to make his living
with music until he was in his 30s. At a time when DJs and electronic
musicians are becoming stars, his wants are modest.</TE>
<TE>   "I am one of those boring people who, if I could just do the
records, people bought them and I could go back in the studio and
make another one, I'd be quite happy."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, who in his 20s supported himself by doing score work
for a Glasgow theater, was discovered within music circles in the
'90s, when he joined forces with the English production team of
Marcus DeVries, later the music supervisor for "Moulin Rouge," and
Nelle Hooper. After being recruited by Massive Attack to provide
orchestral and string arrangements for its work, he was signed to the
influential trip-hop group's Melankolic label, on which he released
"The Space Between Us."</TE>
<TE>   Although Armstrong credits Luhrmann and DeVries with much of the
sound of "Moulin Rouge," fans of the film who come to "As if to
Nothing" will find many familiar elements.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I'm getting into my mid-40s, everything I do has a sound
now," he says. "I try not to divide my music and say, 'I'll write a
piece of film music here, or a classical piece, or a track from my
album here.' I'm going in the same direction musically in all
things."</TE>
<TE>   The new record is a bit of a departure from "The Space Between
Us." Armstrong calls it a more "emotionally concise" album, and it
offers some grand pieces, particularly the finale, "Choral Ending,"
and "Snow," with English singer David McAlmont. But the dense
"Ruthless Gravity" and the minimalist "Hymn 2," a collaboration with
electronic act Photek, are more the norm.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to like music that has that kind of cinemascope, like
[composer Angelo] Badalamenti, who uses a lot of open spaces," he
says. "I'm quite influenced by West Coast music in America. I'm a
huge Chet Baker and Burt Bacharach fan, all the West Coast movie men
who don't use a lot of notes."</TE>
<TE>   Although Armstrong worked on the record during the year and a half
he spent on "Moulin Rouge," he says the music from the film didn't
really influence him.</TE>
<TE>   However, the freedom Luhrmann gave him did.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Baz has got a very strict vision of what he wants, you
can do anything within that vision," he says. "What he taught me is
you give people you work with freedom.... If you work with David
McAlmont or Photek, the first thing you say is, 'Well, what do you
want to do?'"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most striking collaboration is with Dando on the
dramatic love song "Wake Up in New York."</TE>
<TE>   "With Evan it's just emotion," Armstrong says. "I'm not very good
at explaining music, but there's something he does that's magic. When
the mike goes on in 'Wake Up in New York,' you're just there
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong was hesitant to include the track because of the Sept.
11 tragedies, but he seems pleased with the idea that the song, in
the context of the record, conveys a message of healing.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to put something on this album, like the song 'Let It Be
Love,' that no matter what the journey is, you say something very
positive at the end."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's a connection between the two projects. 'Moulin
Rouge' and this album are just about humanity and life."</TE>

<HD>High Time for a Challenge or Three</HD>
<DH>Longing to stretch as an actress, Andie MacDowell feels
she's finally hit her stride in two films and, yes, a TV pilot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Andie MacDowell gets excited, she slips further into her famed
South Carolina drawl. "You should hear me," she says. "I definitely
have a Southern accent when I'm just being me but a particularly
strong one when I'm at home."</LD>
<LD>   On this day, she's in a Century City hotel suite, far from her
current North Carolina home but audibly enthusiastic about her latest
roles, both unexpected, in two films: "Harrison's Flowers" and
"Crush."</LD>
<LD>   "I don't very often get to carry a movie," MacDowell, 43, says
with a smile. With a television pilot in the works, she is thrilled
to be finding the kind of roles she has been longing to play. "It's
not that I don't appreciate the opportunities that I've been given,
but I was ready to be challenged more as an actress," she says.</LD>
<TE>   With credits such as "sex, lies, and videotape," "Four Weddings
and a Funeral" and "Groundhog Day," the actress has felt frustrated
with the lack of well-written roles available to women, especially
for women older than 40, especially in Hollywood. In recent years
she's gravitated to smaller movie projects like "Shadrach" and "The
Muse," and last year's "Dinner With Friends" on HBO, for which she
received some of her best reviews.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder that MacDowell, who had scored after taking a risk
on the small British project "Four Weddings," would turn to two
projects from overseas to test herself and her persona as the gal
next door: "Crush" is a British sex-in-the-country romp in which she
gets to play naughty, and the English-language French film
"Harrison's Flowers" is a harrowing drama about journalists covering
the war in the former Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   She was attracted to the love story of "Harrison's Flowers," in
which she plays the distraught wife of a Newsweek photographer who
has gone missing while on assignment in war-torn Croatia and is
presumed dead. Convinced he's alive, MacDowell's character makes a
perilous journey into the thick of battle to find him. "It's the kind
of script that you don't get to read every day," she says. "The woman
was actually strong and capable and intelligent and had integrity."</TE>
<TE>   "Harrison's Flowers," whose October release had been delayed to
March 15 because of the terrorist attacks, became more timely than
anyone could have anticipated with the film's unsettling parallels to
the kidnapping and murder in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   MacDowell points out that 47 journalists were killed over five
years while covering events in the former Yugoslavia. "But I think
right now it's more raw and fresh with us because we've all gone on
this journey with Daniel Pearl. I did it, you did it and everybody
else did it. It was there and available for us. There's loads of
other stories that just haven't been available to us."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to understand better what happened in the former
Yugoslavia, MacDowell watched documentaries and talked frequently to
former photojournalist Isabel Ellsen, who co-wrote the script and was
on the set as the stills photographer. Ellsen has written several
books about war correspondents, based on her assignments in Lebanon,
El Salvador and Afghanistan. Once, while covering a tribal war in
Africa, Ellsen used her camera to block a machete aimed at her head.</TE>
<TE>   "She was fascinating," MacDowell says. "And I also thought it was
real interesting because she looked a lot like me. She was about the
same height, about the same size and very feminine, but yet extremely
brave and capable. And she had been shot twice. The stories that she
could tell would just blow your mind. And [she] had gone into a war
and helped save people, so there was a whole reality for me for this
story."</TE>
<TE>   "Harrison's Flowers" was shot primarily in the Czech Republic
because land mines made shooting in Croatia too dangerous. The
$10-million budget meant there were few amenities.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was catering to you," MacDowell says. "I had to be sure
that I had my earplugs in, [because] no one checked....It was that
kind of chaos." She says she didn't feel entirely secure that the
crew knew what it was doing with the explosions. "I'd just have to
trust. But I didn't know how big the explosion was going to be, if
something was going to hit you or not hit you."</TE>
<TE>   She was also unnerved by the gruesome images as they re-created
scenes of the brutal bloodshed. "All the sets were completely
shocking," she says. "You're acting, but at the same time, you're in
character and you're being exposed to children being blown up. It
looked real. It looked real. You didn't really have to search for
what it would feel like."</TE>
<TE>   The role took its toll. "It was completely emotionally draining,"
she says. "I was really ready for the movie to be over. On the one
hand, particularly [for] me, as a woman, when these roles are
impossible to find, it was a great satisfaction as an actress. On the
other hand, after a while you do not want to live in hell anymore.
And it felt like hell, day in, day out. Toward the end, I would have
worked 24 hours a day just to get the movie over with if I could
have."</TE>
<TE>   As it was, she and the cast and crew worked 16-hour days during
the 54-day shoot. French director Elie Chouraqui insisted the actors
be on the set all day and not go back to a trailer between takes to
keep them in the mind-set of being trapped.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very nice photo where Andie is eating in the mud. It's
raining and someone has an umbrella on her head," he says. "I
remember once she told me, 'Please let me have a good night, let me
just have a good [night's sleep].' But I said no, because you must
... stay in the story we are telling."</TE>
<TE>   It was the only argument they had, Chouraqui says. "She wanted to
rehearse, she asked a lot of questions. Andie, she knew from the
beginning that it was really something important for her," not only
as a role but also because of the events that really took place
there."</TE>
<TE>   MacDowell was more than ready for the decidedly lighter tone of
"Crush," a $6-million British comedy opening Friday. In the film, she
plays a never-married American expatriate headmistress in the English
countryside who meets with her two fortysomething divorcee friends
each week over gin and cigarettes. The one who shares the most
pathetic unlucky-in-love story wins a box of chocolates. The women's
close-knit friendship is tested when MacDowell's character begins a
tryst with a 25-year-old former student, now an organist at the local
church.</TE>
<TE>   Says "Crush" director John McKay of MacDowell, "I needed someone
who the audience would believe, without question, was a very good
person, because Kate is being good and well-behaved and dutiful and
always volunteered for things all her life. And yet, it needs to be
someone who we also might enjoy being wicked for a while in the
movie."</TE>
<TE>   It was an opportunity for MacDowell to play a sexier role than she
has had before.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the fact that she's a headmistress but that she ends up
having sex on the tombstone [and] in the back of the car twice," she
says with a grin. MacDowell thinks nudity is often unnecessary, but
she wanted the sex scenes to be truthful if not graphic. After spying
a postcard of an old painting on the set, she suggested one shot in
which the audience sees her bare back as she sits up in bed, her face
reflected in the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want it to look like a fake in-the-bed scene," she says.
"The first time I shot it, it was humiliating because, of course, I
had to be really naked and I had to sit up in front of all these
people ... but then I was able to relax and actually do it."</TE>
<TE>   "Andie was looking to push the boundaries as far as she would go,"
McKay says. "Sometimes she's been cast as the sort of sweet
girl-next-door woman. And no, she's really a grown-up girl. She's all
woman." McKay was nervous about shooting the physically intimate
scenes between MacDowell and Kenny Doughty, but MacDowell found a way
to break the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "She taught me and my producer to do the shag, that sort of
Southern dance they do," he says. "And we thought this was very
funny, because shag means something very different in the U.K." At
the start of each rehearsal, McKay had them do the shag. "When I saw
them shagging, I knew everything was going to be OK."</TE>
<TE>   As the relationship between MacDowell's character and the young
man deepens, she faces skepticism from her friends. MacDowell says,
"I asked people, 'Do they look odd together?' And most people didn't
have any discomfort with believing that these people could be in love
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   But, she adds, "I could not be attracted to someone that young
because I am such a mother. I have a son who's 15. I would feel
uncomfortable with the age difference. But on the other hand, I felt
that it was interesting to be able to do it--because men do it all
the time--as a sense of equality."</TE>
<TE>   It's a bias MacDowell has encountered in being considered, or not,
for roles in Hollywood projects. "And it's not that I have a problem
working with someone who's 20 years older than me, but I think that I
should also at the same time be able to work with someone who's my
same age," she says.</TE>
<TE>   MacDowell remembers one discussion with a prominent director she
had admired. The subject was a script with a female lead that he said
needed to be rewritten around the male character to make it more
commercial. "Who came up with this concept?" she asks. "They have
some formula, I truly believe, and he said it: Women go to movies to
see men, and men go to movies to see men.</TE>
<TE>   "And I just don't think that's true. I think people go to movies
because they're good ... and it doesn't matter if it's a man or a
woman [in the lead]."</TE>
<TE>   MacDowell has also completed the film "Ginostra," co-starring
Harvey Keitel and directed by "Marie Baie des Anges" director Manuel
Pradal, and she continues working as a spokeswoman for L'Oreal, which
she has done almost since she started as a model more than two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   She is also shooting a one-hour pilot for CBS tentatively titled
"Jo," about a widowed veterinarian in New York who moves back to her
North Carolina hometown with her daughter after her mother suffers a
stroke. MacDowell had wanted to do a TV series for years but hadn't
found a premise she liked until Mike Newell, her "Four Weddings"
director, heard she was looking and thought her perfect for an idea
he was developing.</TE>
<TE>   The routine of doing a series appealed to MacDowell, especially
after Sept. 11. "I could not have taken a job and left [my kids]
after that, and to be able to have consistency and to be at home is
appealing to me."</TE>
<TE>   She insisted that the series be shot in North Carolina, near her
home in Asheville, so she could remain with her kids--Justin, 15;
Rainey, 13; and Sarah Margaret, 7--and husband Rhett Hartzog, a
jeweler and former high school classmate she married in November.
MacDowell moved with her family to a ranch in Montana for eight years
(with then-husband Paul Qualley) and then to North Carolina in 1999,
closer to her sisters and father.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to say I've shunned Hollywood," MacDowell says.
"That's not it. I actually think it's great here  and probably I
could have had more of a regular life here because I could have done
movies here. But the thing is, I really like living where I live, and
I like small towns, and I don't want to be, just because of my job,
made to live somewhere that I really don't want to live.... I don't
like traffic. I like it to be quiet. Two seconds and I'm in the
country. I have my horses right there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my life. I mean, I'm only going to get the chance to do this
once. I don't want to sit and say, 'Oh, I really wish--I hated that I
didn't spend my life with my family,' so I'm spending my life with
them."</TE>

<LD>The album: "Inhabiting the Ball" (the Telegraph Company).</LD>
<LD>   The performer: Jim Roll.</LD>
<LD>   The deal: Pop music and serious literature have always engaged in
a wary dance, but now this obscure singer-songwriter has put them in
bed together. On his recently released third album, Roll sets to
music lyrics written for him by two acclaimed authors, Rick Moody
("The Ice Storm") and Denis Johnson ("Jesus' Son").</LD>
<TE>   The panorama Americana born of the teaming casts an eye on the
nation's social and psychic underbelly, with Moody, known for his
dissections of suburbia, contributing whimsical ("In Flight
Magazines") and regretful ("Blue Guitar") tales, and
outsider-chronicler Johnson providing evocative if enigmatic moments
(the title song and "You").</TE>
<TE>   Roll, whose experiment-spiked musical settings jump from Neil
Young folk to Stones rock to alt-country, doesn't shrink in this
company, turning in among his five solo works the compelling
narrative "Orphan Train."</TE>
<TE>   Back story: Roll, a Chicago native who now lives in Ann Arbor,
Mich., simply wrote to two of his favorite authors and asked if they
had any lyrics they'd like him to turn into songs. Moody and Johnson
both went for it. "I just kind of was taken by the fact that both of
these guys referenced music a lot so I just thought I would give it a
shot," says Roll.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't intimidated by putting his lyrics up against the work of
two noted wordsmiths. "I didn't feel like they had slaved over
chiseling the perfect pop song or anything, and they were surreal
enough where I felt like a could find little spaces in between their
songs and have this kind of fun little record.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it's a modern, digital, slightly cartoonish version of
[Harry Smith's] 'Anthology of American Folk Music.' Just kind of
strange characters that could exist now, as opposed to the characters
like John Henry."</TE>

<HD>A Collaboration as Fluid as a Dance</HD>
<DH>For 'Cross Roads,' a composer and a choreographer offered
each other ideas and inspiration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a choreographer sits in a music studio, or a composer watches a
dance rehearsal, both movement and sound tend to take fresh creative
swerves.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least that was what happened when veteran dance-maker Donald
McKayle and flutist-composer James Newton got together to make "Cross
Roads," which has its West Coast premiere Friday night, during a
two-day engagement of the Jose Limon Dance Company at the Luckman
Fine Arts Complex.</LD>
<LD>   On this late March afternoon, the two stylishly dressed
collaborators have come to the second floor studio in Newton's airy,
art-filled Chino Hills home to try to recall the mood of their early
conversations about the work a few years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The themes of communal conflict and forbidden love provided a
starting point. "We would sit here and discuss ideas, sounds and
qualities," says the mellow-voiced Newton, standing in front of a
bank of synthesizers, keyboards, monitors and samplers. McKayle has a
way of almost performing the process: His eyes light up as if dessert
is being served, and he says, "I enjoyed getting inside of this and
seeing what he was doing. I would hear a sound and say, 'Ohhh, do
that one again.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Cross Roads" has already engendered a certain amount of buzz at
the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts (last June), at
the University of Texas at Austin (earlier this month), the two
venues that, along with the Luckman, commissioned the work from
McKayle and Newton for the New York-based Limon company. It was also
performed at the Olympic Arts Festival in February in Utah. When the
work appeared on a Limon program in New York in the fall, New York
Times critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote about its vitality and "gem-like
polish," calling it "a major piece, an allegory about the need for
tolerance among different peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Kisselgoff also noted that most modern dance companies of Limon's
era--the early and mid-20th century--were not known for their
incorporation of African-based rhythms, and that the inclusion of two
jazz-influenced works on a Limon program (Billy Siegenfeld's "If
Winter" was the other and is also on the Luckman program) seemed
"somewhat surprising." But not to McKayle. Having spent many of his
early dancing days under the direction of legendary modern dance
founders Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham, as well
as Limon, he has seen many major choreographers change over time and
incorporate new influences, just as he, at 71 and Newton, at 48, have
drawn new energy and direction from each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if Jose was still around today, he wouldn't be doing the
same thing he was doing in the '50s," McKayle says, once he's settled
into a white leather chair facing Newton in the composer's
ground-floor kitchen-den area. "I'm not doing what I did in the '50s,
so I don't think somebody like Jose would be stuck in one spot." As
for comparisons between the spare, smoothly majestic Limon aesthetic
and the often syncopated and layered mix of styles in "Cross Roads,"
McKayle points to a similar emphasis on the "theme and variation"
structure.</TE>
<TE>   McKayle, like Limon artistic director Carla Maxwell, thinks that
jazz-inspired contemporary dance can coexist happily alongside iconic
Limon works, providing a complimentary contrast with Limon's
contemplative "Psalm," for instance, another piece that the company
will perform at the Luckman in a restaged version (by Maxwell), with
a newly commissioned score by Jon Magnussen. As for the company
dancers' ability to go with the syncopated flow, McKayle says that
modern dancers are trained for just about anything these days, and
that the Limon performers were especially sensitive to nuance. "They
were so absolutely fresh and open-faced," he says about the formative
"Cross Roads" rehearsals. "They would actually give you themselves
without touching themselves up first in a mirror--just letting it
happen--so I think there was a kind of magic in the atmosphere and
everybody felt comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   As "Cross Roads" progressed and McKayle made several trips to the
Limon company's New York studios for rehearsals, he and Newton
exchanged audio and video tapes. At other times, they were in
commuting distance of each other for meetings; McKayle teaches at UC
Irvine and lives nearby, while Newton is a professor of music at Cal
State L.A. and directs the resident Luckman Jazz Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he gave me a piece of music, I'd start choreographing so
quickly, he'd have to catch up," McKayle says. "But sometimes, he was
ahead of me."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very fluid process," Newton recalls. "It's like we
started to finish each other's sentences."</TE>
<TE>   As he watched taped rehearsals and discussed them with McKayle,
Newton started thinking in terms of specific movement themes. He also
got to know individual dancers' personalities and started to tailor
his material to them. The process reminded him of Duke Ellington's
way of composing with specific musicians in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Newton also appreciates Ellington's legacy in terms of the way he
pioneered combinations of African music and various kinds of American
music. As Ellington did, Newton has traveled to Africa, and after
encountering the vibrancy and invention of music there, allowed
impressions to settle and eventually emerge in his composing voice.
Newton describes the first part of "Cross Roads" as "very much
African, very polyrhythmical," as it establishes two opposing clans
that cross each other's paths. Then comes a more lyrical love duet,
which Newton says, "takes that African feeling and makes it
American." He describes the ending as "very urban, modern jazz,"
while McKayle calls it "cacophonous," representing, "the kind of
thing modern human beings do--clash against each other."</TE>
<TE>   Having worked with other composers, McKayle says the process does
not always go as smoothly as this one. But he and Newton, who also
combined talents to make "Gumbo Ya Ya" for the San Francisco Ballet,
never argue. The advantage of creating together, both agree, is that
they each explored paths they might otherwise not have taken. Newton
found spaces in the music he knew would be filled by movement or, in
the case of a shaman character, took inspiration from one descriptive
word from McKayle--"stealth"--and one breathily percussive sound that
McKayle gave him--"da-doom."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, McKayle describes nearly "falling into" a movement
phrase that was inspired by a suspended note in the score, and easily
finding a gesture language suggested by evocative "voices" in the
music. Sharing the creative duties also eliminated any feelings of
isolation. "You feel very safe, just going ahead, rather than
worrying if you're going the right way," he says. "You allow yourself
to discover things, and that's very, very good."</TE>
<TE>   For "Cross Roads," Newton will play the flute and conduct the
score in the pit at the Luckman. McKayle wants to be in the audience
to see both casts dance the piece but will also be back in Irvine to
catch the overlapping engagement of Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company. The Ohio company will be performing two of his works on a
program at the Irvine Barclay Theatre--his early masterpiece,
"Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder," and "Children of the Passage," which
was co-choreographed with Ronald K. Brown in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Ward, Dayton Contemporary's artistic director, will also
premiere a new piece, "Mighty Fortress," a gift to McKayle in tribute
to his contribution to dance in general and the support he's offered
to the company specifically, by coaching his own works and
encouraging Ward's choreography.</TE>
<TE>   "He has definitely had an influence on me," Ward says. "I approach
works more on the human side, as opposed to the abstract formal
approach. And I approach dancers as people dancing, as opposed to
machines doing. I think that Donald is a passionate humanitarian, and
his works show that."</TE>
<TE>   Newton too has high praise for what McKayle can communicate with
movement. Seeing in performance what the choreography brought to his
music for the lovers' duet in "Cross Roads," for instance, left him
"immeasurably moved." What had begun in an electronics-filled  studio
had developed further in dance rehearsals and then come alive
definitively in performance. "I saw how the music was transformed by
the choreography," Newton says. "It just took on a whole other
reality."</TE>
<TE>   That process is always a pleasure, McKayle says, returning the
compliment, "when you know a composer and really love his music."</TE>

<DH>L.A. Theatre Works lures name actors for projects that take
a week from rehearsal to taping.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever Stacy Keach feels he needs to flex his acting muscles, he
knows he can always get a good workout doing a radio play for L.A.
Theatre Works' "The Play's the Thing" series. Keach, a founder of the
radio theater company who describes himself as one of its
"long-tooth" members, has strutted his thespian stuff in several of
the group's productions during the past 14 years, including "The
Crucible" and "The Country Girl."</LD>
<LD>   "You get to sort of dip your foot in the water of great theatrical
art," the actor says. "You get to wade in the pool. Most working
actors in Los Angeles have other lives. They have a series or are
doing a movie and they don't have the time to devote [to a
traditional theatrical production]."</LD>
<LD>   "It gives us a chance to do stuff that you don't get to do in
front of the camera," says fellow founding member Hector Elizondo,
who recently performed in the company's production of Chekhov's "The
Cherry Orchard."</LD>
<TE>   It's also doable, says Elizondo, who performed on radio as a child
actor. "It doesn't take 150 people. You don't have to have makeup on.
You don't have to get up at 4 in the morning like a ditch digger. I
prefer working in front of a microphone. What happened is that we
turned out to be the Mercury Theater of the Air," he said, referring
to Orson Welles' legendary radio company of the 1930s. "We
resuscitated and revitalized a wonderful art form--radio drama."</TE>
<TE>   The recordings are done over a five-performance engagement in
front of a live audience at the Skirball Cultural Center, and until
the program was dropped last summer, they could be heard on "KCRW
Playhouse." Santa Monica-based KCRW-FM's loss has been the gain of
Pasadena public radio station KPCC-FM (89.3). The station began
airing the company's productions on March 2. Whereas the company was
just one of the components of "KCRW Playhouse," KPCC has given it a
weekly showcase, at 8 p.m. Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   That L.A. Theatre Works has become an award-winning company, which
has recorded more than 300 works since 1988, is something of a
fortunate accident. "It started out to be Los Angeles Classic Theatre
Works," Elizondo says. "Our mission was to create a theater of
actors, funded by actors for actors. These would be folks who came
from the theater who don't get a chance to do theater much anymore
because of their filming schedules and TV. That was a utopian idea.
Fortunately, most of the people in it [including Richard Dreyfuss,
John Lithgow and Marsha Mason], in accounting terms, were liquid. So
we were able to fund the project."</TE>
<TE>   But they couldn't find one, Elizondo says. "It was difficult to
get people to decide on what project to do. At some critical point,
we had to raise more money and I think it was Richard Dreyfuss who
said, 'Why don't we record something for radio and we can raise some
money?'"</TE>
<TE>   Susan Albert Loewenberg, the company's producing director,
contacted general manager Ruth Seymour at KCRW (89.9) to see if they
would be interested in broadcasting the production. "That is the way
it started," Loewenberg says. "We decided on doing a novel, Sinclair
Lewis' 'Babbitt.' I insisted that we use all 34 original members of
this group, which included Richard Dreyfuss, Ed Asner, Marsha Mason,
Helen Hunt and Julie Harris--an incredible group of people. It put us
on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Since "Babbitt," the company's roster has swelled to 1,500
members. Over the years, actors from Nathan Lane to Amy Irving, Alan
Alda, Alfred Molina, Anthony LaPaglia and Charlayne Woodard have
participated. (The recordings are available for purchase through the
company's Web site at www.latw.org.)</TE>
<TE>   Rehearsals for each "The Play's the Thing" begin just two days
before the first performance. They were relaxed and playful for
"Middle of the Night," which opened the company's 14th season on
March 20. The rarely seen Paddy Chayefsky comedy from the late
'50s--recommended to Loewenberg by an actor--chronicles a
May-December romance between a 53-year-old widower and his
24-year-old receptionist.</TE>
<TE>   In a small conference room at the Skirball, the cast--including
Elliott Gould and Sally Kellerman--stood in front of paper plates
being used as points of reference for microphones. Stuart K.
Robinson, who has directed four L.A. Theatre Works projects, listened
intently as the actors read from their scripts.</TE>
<TE>   The group cracked up when Gould accidentally said the line "pools
of blood" instead of "pools of water." When actress Christina Haag
asked Robinson if her character and Gould's had consummated their
relationship in a certain scene, Gould piped in: "I'd like to see
what the reporter from The Times thinks."</TE>
<TE>   "Middle of the Night" was Gould's first appearance with L.A.
Theatre Works. "I knew Paddy Chayefsky and I have had an instinct
about this piece of material for quite a long time," said Gould, who
grew up listening to the radio. "Most people wouldn't think of me for
this, and I know in my heart and soul that I am right for it."</TE>
<TE>   Kellerman, who played Gould's self-absorbed sister, said that like
Gould, "this is a part I would never play in real life if you were
looking at me, but it's fun." Kellerman was brought in at the last
moment to replace Carol Kane, who dropped out of the production.</TE>
<TE>   "They called me up a couple of days ago and said Elliott was doing
this and it was written by Paddy Chayefsky," said Kellerman, who
co-starred with Gould in "MASH" in 1970. "I didn't know what the role
was. But I said 'Chayefsky. Gould. I've got to do it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Loewenberg says it is both easy and hard to get actors to do the
shows. "I think when you are working with actors of that quality,
they are very busy," she says. "If they don't know you, it's hard to
get their attention. But I will say this, once people commit, 95% of
the time they come back and they want to do more, which is wonderful.
We try to make it an experience that people want to repeat.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, from my point of view, whenever they are famous or
great working actors, since I have just one week to put this
together, I need to work with people who are absolutely tops. When I
am working with a group of highly paid actors, you know why they are
getting all of that money. I mean there is something about watching a
Julie Harris or a Kathleen Chalfant attack the work that is just
remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Who else is appearing in the production often influences actors'
decision to join the project. "That is part of the attraction for
them. The opportunity to work with someone they know, whose work they
love, or to work with someone they have never worked with before. I
would say that a lot of friendships and working alliances have come
out of this. I know people who have gone on to do projects together
having met while doing these plays. That's exciting for me."</TE>
<TE>   Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank and husband Chad Lowe will be
making their L.A. Theatre Works debut June 26 in the West Coast
premiere of Keith Bunin's drama "The Credeaux Canvas."</TE>
<TE>   Swank's name came up when Loewenberg asked the author whom he'd
like to see in the play. "We'll often try to reconstitute the
original cast, but sometimes we feel we can improve on it. He said to
me, 'Hilary Swank.' I think she had done a reading of the play."</TE>
<TE>   In another production, the original off-Broadway cast is reuniting
for "Dinah Was," a musical drama about Dinah Washington that begins
May 8.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw 'Dinah Was' at the Arena Stage in Washington," Loewenberg
says. "Gordon Hunt, who directs lots and lots of things for me,
called me one day and said, 'You know, there is this terrific piece I
think you should consider, "Dinah Was."'"</TE>
<TE>   Hunt is a friend of the author, and as it turned out, Yvette
Freeman, who starred in it originally and took it to New York, lives
in L.A. A regular on NBC's "ER," Freeman says she wants everyone to
hear "Dinah."</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to sing live, the whole thing. Doing a radio play is
using a different muscle than doing film or theater. You have to tell
the whole story with your voice because no one can see your body. I
am excited about doing that."</TE>

<LD>Have you people taken leave of your ordinarily good senses? What's
with this tabloid-quality "Oscar Comes Home" issue (March 24)?</LD>
<LD>   Why must the writers and editors of Calendar stoop to playing into
the already too-present Oscar hype? I feel like the kid pointing out
the emperor's new clothes, but doesn't anybody care that the Oscars
have nothing to do with most Calendar readers, or with any real
people for that matter? It would be different if "real people" were
handing out these awards, but the Academy Awards consist of a bunch
of Hollywood bigwigs giving awards to each other.</LD>
<LD>   And the whole world is supposed to sit back like good, sated
little sheep and live vicariously by watching these overprivileged
nepotism cases pat each other on the backs for their continuing
mediocrity.</LD>
<TE>   The Oscars might be slightly more palatable if the movies were
good, like they used to be, but when movie people reward each other
for their junk, it just ensures that moviegoers will be fed even more
noisy, self-important, blanded-out, dumbed-down junk in years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe you feel like you need to jump on the boot-licking
Oscar bandwagon like everybody else. It seems the purpose of Calendar
should be to perpetuate quality in the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't we all be out there crusading for good stuff and turning
off our televisions when the Oscar broadcast infects them?</TE>

<LD>The acting profession is difficult to break into unless you're lucky,
or friends with or related to someone influential in the business. It
takes diligence, perseverance, drive and talent to last. It has to be
something you want more than anything ("Everyone Into the Talent
Pool," by Greg Braxton and Dana Calvo, March 17).</LD>
<LD>   Being in your 20s and saying that it's so hard and not fair
because you are of an ethnic background is in some ways an excuse
that doesn't play as much as it used to. There are more opportunities
than ever.</LD>
<LD>   As a Russian-Jewish-American-nerdy-balding-chunky character actor,
I don't feel we're represented enough either. I have been pursuing an
acting career for 20 years and didn't actually get my first
professional job for 13 of those years.</LD>
<TE>   Couldn't find an agent, couldn't get in the unions, got two or
three auditions a year. Now I have a better agent, I'm in all the
unions, and I work in commercials and TV once or twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is fierce and those of us who are "appearance
challenged" have fewer opportunities than the gorgeous men and women
of all races who take the leading roles. How about a showcase for
funny-looking actors?</TE>
<TE>   I've been told I have trouble being cast because I'm too ethnic.
I'd be better off in New York because there is more opportunity for
ethnic actors. In L.A. talk this means that I look like a New York
Jew. Of course, I'm not ethnic enough to warrant inclusion in the
showcases in your article. So I'm too ethnic and not ethnic enough.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, I still believe that talent and perseverance will pay off
in the long run.</TE>

<HD>Let 'Gothic' Be Heard</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me add another heartfelt vote to novelist Alan Dean Foster's for
Havergal Brian's "Gothic" symphony as an impressive choice with which
to open Disney Hall (Letters, March 17).</LD>
<LD>   When the one CD recording of the piece was issued on the Marco
Polo label, the New York Times' Living Arts section was shocked to
discover that this unknown composer had created an out-and-out
masterpiece. It was recommended weekly for six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   As someone who writes for film, TV and the musical stage, I can
tell you there is more than one Hollywood film composer who has not
hesitated to borrow from Brian's orchestration.</LD>
<TE>   But I fear that Foster's well-meant suggestion will fall on the
same deaf ears that greeted my letter to the Philharmonic's Esa-Pekka
Salonen, Ernest Fleischmann and Deborah Borda proposing a "Gothic"
performance not even for the grand opening, but perhaps later in the
initial Disney Hall season.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Fleischmann replied that he would under no circumstances
program an "elephantine" piece by an "amateur" composer who wrote 32
"elephantine" symphonies.</TE>
<TE>   That the other 31 Brian symphonies are less than half an hour in
playing time suggests that there is not merely a lack of knowledge at
the highest levels of the musical establishment, but a hidebound
refusal to be open-minded.</TE>

regarding the then-unknown Gustav Mahler: "That derivative,
post-Wagnerian no-talent?"</TE>

<LD>It is difficult to decide if Mark Swed's Perspective ("A Question for
Passover," March 24) is a review of a concert featuring Ernst Toch's
"Cantata of the Bitter Herbs" or an essay about all he might know
about religious music, Middle East politics and synagogue artistic
commissions. Swed started with the thesis that very little Passover
music had been written, and wandered far and wide among the works
honoring Christian themes by Bach, Handel, Golijov and Wagner.</LD>
<LD>   Setting aside Swed's woeful lack of knowledge about the purpose of
a Seder (which means "Order"), he laments the lack of much public
recognition of Passover musical traditions. To compare the popular,
widely performed Easter and Christmas music in quantity and quality
to Passover music is impossible.</LD>
<LD>   The former has had the patronage of popes and large populations,
while Jewish music carries the traditions of millenniums and is the
treasure of a small minority of people.</LD>
<TE>   The March 10 concert at Beverly Hills High was an opportunity to
showcase Toch's timely message of peace and hope.</TE>
<TE>   Swed's foray into Middle East politics was quite a stretch from
Pharaoh to Arafat. His knowledge of synagogue musical commissions was
equally superficial. Evidently, his exposure to music missed the work
of Meir Finkelstein, Michael Horvit, Ami Aloni, Shalom Secunda,
Michael Isaacson and Charles Davidson, just to name a few. The L.A.
Zimriyah Chorale concentrates on this music and that of other
American Jewish composers.</TE>

<LD>As a sign company, we ordinarily spend a lot of time sparring with
project architects, who either want signs to be decorative rather
than readable, or who want them to be invisible.</LD>
<LD>   We sent architect Jeffrey Kalban designs for the Pan Pacific
Recreation Center that echoed the Streamline Moderne style but
followed all accessibility standards both in letter and spirit
("Built for Body and Soul," by Hugh Hart, March 24). Rather than an
argument from Mr. Kalban, we got an unexpected call congratulating
us.</LD>
<LD>   As a member of the new Advisory Committee for Universal Design to

excitement and beauty in our public buildings, but we also need them
to be accessible and usable by everyone. Mr. Kalban seems to keep

<DH>Dealer Steve Turner's interest in African American work
began with the tale of a largely forgotten painter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paintings, sculpture and works on paper from the 1930s and '40s;
posters from the late 19th and early 20th centuries; California
photography and ephemera from 1860 to 1960. Los Angeles art dealer
Steve Turner has developed quite a list of specialties since he
opened his first gallery in 1988. But in recent years he has turned
his attention to yet another category--African American art--and it
is consuming more and more of his time, energy and exhibition space.</LD>
<LD>   "Not Just February: Works by African American Artists, 1817-2002,"
a concise survey of works by 20 artists--pointedly not staged during
Black History Month--opens Friday at his small, second-floor gallery
on South Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. The centerpiece of an
African American series, it follows a show of works by Los Angeles
artists Mark Greenfield and Talita Long, and precedes an exhibition
featuring the work of Merton Simpson and Herbert Gentry, who divide
their time between New York and Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Along with his burgeoning exhibition program, Turner has
established a foundation to provide financial aid for young African
American artists. Each year, the William H. Johnson Foundation for
the Arts will give a grant in honor of Johnson, an accomplished but
largely forgotten painter who died in 1970. The first grant, to be
awarded at the end of this year, will be $15,000. Subsequent grants,
made after the foundation has raised more funds, will be $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for all this activity was "William H. Johnson: Truth
Be Told," a traveling exhibition that Turner organized and presented
at his gallery two years ago. That show, in turn, was the result of
an exhaustive research project, documented in a book written by
Turner and his wife, Victoria Dailey. The story they tell is a
mixture of joy and tragedy, recognition and neglect, with a tragic
ending.</TE>
<TE>   Born in South Carolina in 1901, Johnson studied art at New York's
National Academy of Design and, with the help of a professor and
friends, continued his education in France. He married Danish artist
Holcha Krake and settled in Denmark, but traveled widely and returned
to New York during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Krake died of cancer in 1944 and Johnson, finding little interest
in his work in New York, returned to Denmark in 1946. On a trip to
Norway the following year, he was diagnosed with a degenerative brain
disease caused by syphilis. He was hospitalized in Norway, then sent
by ship to the United States. He never painted again and spent his
last 23 years at Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson left a body of work that encompasses folkloric portrayals
of black people, and expressionistic landscapes, still-lifes and
portraits. But while looking for his paintings and piecing together
details of his life, Turner came to believe that Johnson's estate was
mishandled. His work should have been sent to his relatives in
Denmark after his death, but it was taken over by a foundation that
did little to promote or protect it, Turner contends. His
documentation lists more than 50 pieces in the estate that have gone
to private collections or to market, have been moved from one
institution to another, or have simply been lost.</TE>
<TE>   Turner wasn't able to answer all his questions about Johnson's
work, but "the project gave me a great sense of accomplishment," he
says. "And in doing it, I encountered a lot of African American
artists, collectors and curators who said I should do more work in
this area. I already had a great library on the artists, so I started
to think about who I could show in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   As Turner looked into the subject, he realized how little
visibility African American artists have had in local museums and
galleries. "There hasn't been widespread support here," he says.
"There are a few collectors and a few people who sell work by one
African American artist or another, but there isn't the kind of
activity that exists in cities like Detroit or Charlotte, North
Carolina."</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield, who directs the Watts Towers Arts Center while
pursuing his career as an artist, says he felt "a little bit of
reticence" when he first heard about Turner's African American
projects. "It was a white person doing it," he says, "but I don't
care at this point. What he's got in mind is something that needs to
happen. I don't care who does it, as long as it gets done."</TE>
<TE>   Turner's first African American show following the Johnson project
featured the paintings of Richard Mayhew, who retired in Santa Cruz
after a long teaching career at Penn State and other universities.
"He has been showing since the '50s and sells his work in New York,
Detroit and San Francisco. He is very good at getting his work out,"
says Turner, who essentially introduced the artist to Los Angeles
last year and sold a few of Mayhew's works to his clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing to plot his course, Turner noticed that mid-career
artists generally have more difficulty getting their work shown than
those who are more or less established. "If you are Richard
Mayhew--if you are almost 80 and you have been a devoted artist
throughout your life--there is interest in you," he says. "And
emerging artists of any sort, including African Americans, are
starting to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been a contrarian. I choose difficult things, so
instead of just showing the 80-year-olds or looking for emerging
artists, I decided to show two mid-career artists, Mark Greenfield
and Talita Long, whose work has been in community galleries but who
haven't had much contact with collectors. There is nothing like that
to give them a sense of what people think of them, and it fuels them
to do more work."</TE>
<TE>   After the Mayhew show, his next African American exhibition was
"History &amp; Mystery," a selection of Greenfield's assemblages based on
old photographs of blackface entertainers, and Long's figurative
monotypes.</TE>
<TE>   Even as that show was in the works, Turner was organizing the
current historical survey, making it small enough to fit into his
gallery but varied enough to indicate the breadth of work by African
Americans. "It's not just one style," he says. "Broad surveys of
American art tend to include one African American artist. If it's the
20th century, it's Jacob Lawrence; if it's the 19th century, it's
Henry Ossawa Tanner."</TE>
<TE>   Both artists are represented in "Not Just February," but so are
Joshua Johnson (circa 1765-1830), who lived in Baltimore and painted
portraits of the white merchant class, and contemporary artists Benny
Andrews, Michael Ray Charles, David Hammons, John Outterbridge and
Howardena Pindell. With works ranging from watercolors and oil
paintings to body prints and steel sculpture, they defy easy
classification.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to break down the expectation that the work will look
a certain way," Turner says. "It can be anything and ought to be
anything." It can also be shown anytime, he says. "The title, 'Not
Just February,' came about because I wanted to send that message."</TE>
<TE>   In shaping his exhibition agenda, Turner decided to memorialize
the artist who inspired him, William H. Johnson. "My idea for
something to honor him appropriately and sort of bring my project
full circle was to start a grant-giving foundation," he says. "We
plan to give grants to African Americans in the first third or first
half of their careers, when they are around 25, 30 or 35 and on the
edge of producing a body of work that can be exhibited and purchased.
So many artists have brief careers because it's exceedingly tough to
have the freedom to create. We wanted the grants to be big enough so
they can take some time off from their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the foundation is a great idea," says Greenfield, who has
agreed to serve on the selection committee along with Outterbridge,
Phoebe Beasley and other artists yet to be named. "If Steve can set
an example and more people do something like this, maybe more young
African Americans will be encouraged to pursue art. Right now, they
aren't getting enough support."</TE>
<TE>   The first fund-raiser for the foundation was held last year; two
others, at the Oakland Museum and at the home of a board member in
Pasadena, are scheduled this spring, says Turner, who heads the
foundation's board but will not be involved in selecting grant
recipients. Applications, currently being sought through art schools,
universities and art journals, will be due Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiastic as he may be about launching the grant program,
Turner says boosterism has nothing to do with it. "Finding artists
whose work should be and could be in museums is very selective,
serious work," he says. "Barriers move around, but they are still
there. Just look at who is, and isn't, in the museums and galleries."</TE>

<LD>Rob Zombie has parlayed gruesome horror into a pretty nice career,
always seeming to top himself in terms of shock value. But now he's
come up with something almost unspeakable for this summer's Ozzfest
tour.</LD>
<LD>   He's going to play on the tour's second stage ... in daylight!</LD>
<LD>   Well, the notion shocked tour namesake Ozzy Osbourne.</LD>
<TE>   "I came up with the idea while I was on the Merry Mayhem tour
recently with Ozzy," Zombie says. "I was sitting on the Osbournes'
bus with Ozzy and [Osbourne's wife and manager] Sharon, talking about
Ozzfest. I'd done the main stage in 1999. It was good, but those
venues are so uptight, those huge corporate amphitheaters. I'd go
watch the bands on the second stage out in the parking lot or
wherever they'd put them sometimes, and it looked like so much fun.</TE>
<TE>   "So I said, 'How about if we headline the second stage?'" Zombie
continues. "Ozzy at first was, 'No, I won't let you! You'll be
miserable. Don't do it.' But it seemed like a fun, different thing to
do--not bring the big show, everything stripped down with just the
band, play in the sunlight. I haven't done anything like that in 12
years or something."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Osbourne, Zombie says, was enthusiastic about the idea as
well, and plans were made. Now, with the breakup of the new Rage
Against the Machine lineup just two days after it was announced as
co-headliner for Ozzfest, Zombie's presence seems even larger in a
bill topped by Osbourne and P.O.D.</TE>
<TE>   Among Zombie's best memories as a fan are seeing Alice Cooper and
KISS--the archetypes for big-production rock shows--do special
concerts with no effects and staging, focusing on the music.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as I love the big show and all the production, it becomes
this huge thing of its own," he says. "Sometimes the show is so huge
everything else gets lost."</TE>
<TE>   Zombie's presence could draw more people than usual to the second
stage, helping the lesser-known acts get the exposure that is a major
point of playing there.</TE>
<TE>   "The second stage is often bands that don't even have records, or
buzz bands in the scene," Zombie says. "So hopefully, yeah, this will
bring people over who might not spend much time there normally. We'll
close the second stage, and when we finish, then they'll start the
main stage, so you can see everything, if you're up to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   RAGE OFF: A lot of questions were raised with word that Chris
Cornell had left the new band he formed with Rage Against the Machine
guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk.
But one that may prove the most complicated to resolve concerns the
contractual disposition of the band's upcoming album.</TE>
<TE>   The original arrangement had Epic Records (Rage's label) releasing
the record, with a planned eventual second record to come out through
Interscope (Cornell records for the company's A&amp;M label). Now there's
almost certainly not going to be a second. So what happens to the
delicate inter-corporate arrangement?</TE>
<TE>   As with everything else in this matter, the principal parties are
not commenting. The buzz, though, is that from the beginning, the
original contracts already had profits split. However, will
Interscope be willing to let Epic have all the credit for releasing
the album? Or maybe Interscope will be happy to let Epic have the
album, given that there will be no active band to promote it.</TE>
<TE>   HOLLYWOOD SWINGIN': With a new $50-million global deal with EMI
reportedly in hand, English superstar Robbie Williams is set for the
U.S. launch of his Frank Sinatra tribute, "Swing When You're
Winning." That album, which has sold 5 million copies worldwide,
isn't coming out here because it's been available as an import since
November, but Williams is releasing a DVD featuring his concert last
year at London's Royal Albert Hall. A theatrical screening is set for
April 15 at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD, due April 23, features live versions of all the songs
from the "Swing" album, and a bonus video of Williams' studio duet
with Nicole Kidman on "Somethin' Stupid," the Frank and Nancy Sinatra
hit. The concert portion includes an introduction and linking skits
featuring Rupert Everett, an appearance by Jon Lovitz, and a Williams
"duet" with old footage of Sinatra. Other bonus segments include a
"making of" the concert, album and video features.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, still seeking a U.S. breakthrough to give him a profile
anything close to his mega-fame in most of the world, is starting
work on his next album of original pop and rock songs.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Snoop Dogg is doing a new version of the old
Parliament hit "We Got the Funk" for the upcoming movie "Undercover
Brother." Snoop is using the original recording for the framework and
performing new rap verses, with original Parliament members Bootsy
Collins, Bernie Worrell and Fred Wesley adding new instrumental
tracks. The soundtrack album is due May 21 from Hollywood Records,
with the movie opening May 31....</TE>
<TE>   A mutual fan club met when the re-formed Breeders did a recent
photo session for Flaunt magazine with photographer Kevin Kerslake,
one of pop's top video directors who has worked with Nirvana, the
Smashing Pumpkins and the Rolling Stones, among many others. It turns
out Kerslake named his company, Gigantic, after a Breeders song, and
when it was mentioned that the group needed a director for the first
video from its upcoming album "Title TK," Kerslake offered to do it
for a fraction of his usual fee. The album is due from Elektra
Records on May 21, with the single, "Huffer," due in late April....</TE>
<TE>   Former '80s pop queen Tiffany, fresh from her Playboy magazine
appearance, has shot a guest appearance on--what else?--Fox's "That
'80s Show." She doesn't sing but plays a punk-styled character in an
episode scheduled for April 17.</TE>

<LD>   MICHELLE SHOCKED</LD>
<LD>   "Deep Natural"</LD>
<TE>   Mighty Sound</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take my joy from me," Shocked sings over an elastically
loping reggae track in "Joy," an explicitly Christian, highly
internalized call to rise above the fray. Shocked has risen above
conflicts with record companies (this album, due in stores Tuesday,
officially launches her own new label), and above the social and
political crusades with which she's been involved over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Joy is the fuel of this album, captured in the heralding reggae
dub horns that kick off "What Can I Say," the African American
allegorical storytelling traditions of the song, and the gospel
fervor and personal faith infused throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Her activist spirit is present too, but Shocked's songs are about
people and emotions, not issues. "Little Billie" tells of a woman
defying grief by dancing on the coffin of her murdered son, with the
music and Shocked's performance embodying the woman's unyielding
will. She turns the view inward in the acoustic "Moanin' Dove," a
late-night plea for strength with roots in the Delta and Appalachia.</TE>
<TE>   The set may seem miles from the epistolary folkiness of Shocked's
1988 rookie hit "Anchorage." But the passion, vision and appeal that
have always been at the heart of her music galvanize and unify what
may be her most ambitious and fully realized album. She includes a
second disc of buoyant, dub-style remixes--another joyful touch that
would be anathema in the major-label world these days.</TE>

<TE>   KINKY</TE>
<TE>   "Kinky"</TE>
<TE>   Sonic 360/Nettwerk America</TE>
<TE>   Don't let the name fool you. There's nothing perverse about this
fresh, five-man band from Monterrey, Mexico's home to wealthy
industrialists and struggling musical innovators. This inventive
group caused a wholesale sensation at the recent South by Southwest
music fest in Austin, Texas, with its, well, kinky (as in tightly
wound) web of vibrant Latin beats and cool, computerized electronica.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost a dance band, Kinky is said to shine in person (the
band's local debut is set for April 18 at Vynyl in Hollywood). Its
first album (due Tuesday) offers a fun fusion of infectious samba
rhythms and house grooves, opening with a lovely, gospel-like chorus
that explodes into a bass riff echoing Ray Charles' "What'd I Say?"
Analyzed bit by bit, the musical elements here sound starkly simple.
But Kinky's genius is in the mix. Just when a repetitive electronic
riff starts to get annoying, Kinky pulls and plugs and leaps into a
funky, finger-popping pachuco vamp or tasty timbal break.</TE>
<TE>   In its minimalist lyrics, the band also shows humor and a sense of
the absurd. In the quirky "Mirando de Lado," a mock-serious narrator
gives step-by-step instructions on how to see the world sideways. The
album peters out aimlessly near the end, but by then Kinky has given
our own musical outlook such an original tilt, it's tough to
straighten out. --Agustin Gurza</TE>

<LD>Good luck finding a place to hunt Easter eggs today if you live in
one of Los Angeles' poorest City Council districts. In a city that
trails its peers in the ratio of park acres per resident, these are
the most park-poor neighborhoods of all.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles averages just 1.1 acres of neighborhood park space per
1,000 residents, far short of its goal of four acres. The six council
districts encompassing South-Central, southeast and northeast Los
Angeles and the northeast San Fernando Valley have less than half the
already pitiful city average, just 0.445 acres per 1,000 residents.
That's hardly enough space for an Easter picnic, much less for a
soccer game.</LD>
<LD>   Numbers alone make a powerful argument for putting more parks in
these neighborhoods, and a coalition of community and environmental
groups argued just that before a City Council committee last week.
But it's the faces behind the numbers--the kids who have no place to
run off boundless kid energy or just enjoy grass and trees--that
should compel residents rich and poor to urge their council members
to support the coalition's call for an urban land trust.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of the trust would be both ambitious and simple: to put a
park within walking or biking distance of every child, and to do this
by rethinking what a park is. What the coalition envisions is not the
standard five-acre park that the city parks department has long
developed--and has a hard time maintaining. The aim instead is pocket
parks on vacant lots, however small, or where neglected buildings
could be removed. In these slivers of land there may be room for a
sandbox, some swings and a slide. Or grass and trees and pick-up
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood groups would help develop parks and act as stewards,
with support from nonprofit groups. Money would come from private
foundations, corporate donors and recently passed state and local
park bonds, with the city helping groups navigate the application
process. The trust would serve as the link between neighborhoods and
City Hall, where Councilman Eric Garcetti is overseeing a task force
to study similar trusts in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum for parks is building. A community coalition recently
won its battle to turn the Cornfield and Taylor Yards, two former
rail yards near downtown Los Angeles, into state parks with
greenbelts and playing fields. Pocket parks in the city's most
park-poor neighborhoods should be the next gems in this new necklace
of green.</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Must Deliver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The post office delivers 689 million pieces of mail per day, and
letter carriers each haul 42 tons per year. Most
Americans--98%--continue to pay their bills by mail. Yet those vital
services are jeopardized by the Postal Service's shaky finances. The
General Accounting Office has labeled the postal system "at risk,"
and Postmaster General John Potter projects a deficit of $2 billion
to $3 billion for 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Internal reform as well as congressional legislation is urgently
needed. Indeed, even as it prepares to raise rates in June, the post
office will submit a blueprint "Transformation Plan" to Congress this
week.</LD>
<LD>   The Postal Service courageously continued its work last fall
despite suffering two deaths from anthrax and the threat of further
employee contamination. In addition, the service, through no fault of
its own, has had major difficulties stemming from the recession. The
fundamental problem, however, is that the Postal Service has failed
to adjust its business model to new economic realities. It assumes
that increasing mail volume and rate increases can cover its costs.
But no matter how much it raises rates, it drowns in red ink.</LD>
<TE>   Its mail volumes have been declining in recent years, and
terrorism exacerbated the trend--mail was down 4.9% last quarter. The
overarching cause is both the rise of the Internet and what the post
office has always counted on to rescue it--steady rate increases,
particularly in first-class mail.</TE>
<TE>   Since rate increases are not enough, the service must cut costs.
Despite investing billions over the past decade in automation and
information technology, it continues to struggle to increase
productivity, which has increased by only 11% over the past three
decades,  according to the General Accounting Office. One hopeful
sign is that the Postal Service plans to implement a computer system
that would allow it to track the efficacy of new productivity
measures.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, only Congress has the muscle to transform the
postal system. Among the changes that the House Government Reform
Committee should consider is ending the mandate that the Post Service
is not supposed to make a profit; currently, there is little
incentive to cut costs. It also needs to give the service the
flexibility to raise and lower rates quickly so that it can compete
more effectively with competitors such as FedEx. Right now, the post
office can't even lower rates enough to grab contracts from federal
agencies. But perhaps the most contentious issue will be dealing with
the postal unions, which are leery of pay incentive programs and
closing superfluous mail centers.</TE>
<TE>   So volatile are these issues that the General Accounting Office
has recommended that something similar to the military base-closing
commission be created to give Congress political cover. If the
service's own Transformation Plan calls for some version of these
measures, as seems likely, Congress should pay attention. As the
Postal Service flounders, it's up to Congress to deliver.</TE>

<LD>White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. has directed all
federal agencies to purge Web sites of information useful to
terrorists. Hmm. Seems logical. Maybe even obvious. But then nothing
is safely obvious when confronting bureaucracies and the kind of
mindlessness that can infect groups of humans, even accountants, when
they inhabit an office and start filing things.</LD>
<LD>   In olden France, bureaucrats were esteemed for professionalism and
intelligence. Their reputation suffered later over here. Recall the
Immigration and Naturalization Service approving visas recently for
two Arab hijackers, long dead along with their many victims. Here's
why Card issued his memo: As late as February, according to the White
House, at least four government Web sites carried detailed
instructions on making explosives, building a germ factory, spreading
contaminants and poisoning vast water supplies. Read that last
sentence again. Now, let's ponder together: This means that despite a
September effort to remove sensitive information like pipeline
routes, for five months after Sept. 11 federal Web sites disseminated
instructions on developing weapons of mass destruction to anyone with
a PC. What planet are those Web masters from?</LD>
<TE>   It's conceivable, theoretically, that government is suddenly so
concerned with openness (except when the vice president meets with
energy companies) that it simply dumped everything into millions of
little electronic coves. And then plumb forgot about the bomb-making
and plague-spreading recipes. We've all found forgotten things in a
dresser drawer, though rarely with national security implications.
But never mind Sept. 11. What are we doing spreading such information
to any civilian at any time? Even if this information is available
elsewhere on the Web. Wasn't one Timothy McVeigh sufficient? The
United States is not up against the Grenada police force this time.
Fanatical Al Qaeda operatives planned for years, even translating
U.S. military training manuals. Does anyone think AlQaeda.org posts
"Osama's Guide to Secure Caves" or "Tips to Combat Terrorists"?</TE>
<TE>   So here, just to be clear, are some other items we probably don't
want on federal Web sites: nuclear ICBM launch codes. Where the last
smallpox germs are stored; who has the key. Map to the vice
president's secret hideaway. How to build Special Forces radio
scanners. Which U.S. ports have the weakest security. How to sink
supertankers in harbor mouths. The precise movements of all missile
subs. Shift change procedures at nuclear power plants and home phones
of all security guards behind on mortgage payments. A countdown clock
to the moment that U.S. fighters will stop patrolling over major
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, maybe Chief of Staff Card should send another memo,
reminding federal agencies to clean out Web sites regularly, even
without major terrorism acts, just as pretty much every homeowner
cleans his garage some spring day like this.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As quarterly earnings-reporting seasons go, this one is likely to get
more than the usual attention on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   The focus on the honesty of corporate accounting in the aftermath
of Enron Corp. and its ilk should put a premium on greater disclosure
in first-quarter reports, which will begin to dominate the business
headlines starting the week of April 8.</LD>
<LD>   But the key concern of investors, as always, will be the hard
numbers on sales and earnings, and what company managements say about
business prospects for the next quarter or two.</LD>
<TE>   A big issue is whether many investors have unrealistic
expectations for first-quarter profits, given the barrage of upbeat
economic data over the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's rally of the fourth quarter, and its ability to
largely hold on to or extend the gains in the first quarter, was
based in large part on trust that an earnings turnaround is in the
offing. Earnings, after all, are what underpin share prices.</TE>
<TE>   The government's reports on the economy have been almost
consistently positive, helping to support stock prices. Friday
brought more of the same: The Commerce Department said consumer
spending jumped a solid 0.6% in February after rising 0.5% in
January.</TE>
<TE>   The strength in consumer spending has belied expectations that
Americans would close their wallets in the first quarter to conserve
cash in case the economy sputtered again.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer spending also was surprisingly robust in the fourth
quarter. That couldn't halt another devastating decline in corporate
earnings in the period: Operating profit of the blue-chip Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-index companies slumped 21.7% in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, according to earnings-tracker Thomson Financial/First
Call in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter percentage decline was about equal to the
year-over-year profit slide in the third quarter, when the recession
was at its worst.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the government reported Thursday that real gross domestic
product grew at a 1.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the
fastest pace in a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Better-than-anticipated news on consumer spending has yet to give
rise to better-than-expected corporate earnings," noted John Lonski,
economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, that was true in part because many
companies continued to keep a lid on production and new orders,
preferring to let inventories run down to extremely low levels.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, consumers had much more confidence about the
future than did many businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, however, production appears to have
increased in many business sectors. A report Thursday showed that an
index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago area rose more than
expected in March. As production rebounds, it boosts many other
sectors of the economy--from raw materials to shipping to utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround in manufacturing, continued healthy spending in the
services sector of the economy and the benefits of deep corporate
cost-cutting over the last year are expected to lead to a significant
improvement in earnings in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But "improvement" truly is a relative term in this case: Many
companies still will report sales and earnings that are down from a
year earlier. The declines just won't be as steep as what investors
saw in the second half of last year:</TE>
<TE>   * S&amp;P 500 company sales, in total, are expected to be down 0.4% in
the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Wall Street
analysts' estimates as tracked by Thomson Financial/First Call. That
compares with a 4% year-over-year slide in sales in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Analysts' estimates of S&amp;P 500 operating earnings (profit
excluding those ubiquitous "one-time" gains and losses) call for an
overall decline of about 9% in the first quarter compared with a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   If the estimates are on target, the drop in earnings will be half
what it was in the fourth quarter--the first sign of a recovery in
the corporate bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Pace of Warnings on Earnings Slows</TE>
<TE>   There may be more reason to be optimistic that first-quarter
earnings will be in the expected range, or perhaps even better than
expected: Fewer companies have warned in recent weeks that their
results will fall short of estimates.</TE>
<TE>   As of last week, 385 companies in Thomson Financial/First Call's
total universe of firms had warned that first-quarter earnings would
be below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, more than 600 companies had issued warnings by this
point in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of warnings also is about 27% below what it was at this
point in the fourth quarter, said Chuck Hill, research chief at
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   But the big post-recession improvement in corporate earnings is
expected to start in the second quarter and balloon in the third and
fourth quarters. That's why the outlook companies give in their
first-quarter profit reports may be more important than their
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors will be looking for any kind of information that sheds
light on what the [rest of the year] will look like," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on analysts' current estimates, S&amp;P 500 operating earnings
are expected to rise about 9% in the second quarter from a year
earlier. That would be the first year-over-year growth in profit in
five quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Hill notes that part of the rebound will stem from an accounting
rule change: Many companies no longer will have to amortize (write
off) a balance-sheet item known as goodwill, which is the excess an
acquiring company pays for another in a merger, above the market
value of the target's assets. No write-off now is required unless the
acquired company's business has plunged in value.</TE>
<TE>   The net effect will be to boost reported earnings at many
firms--though companies should be clear in disclosing that benefit,
which merely amounts to an accounting entry, not a cash benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the technology sector is expected to lead the
second-quarter profit rebound, with earnings up 38%, on average, from
a year earlier. Consumer-goods sectors and financial services also
are expected to be particularly strong.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to
rise 30% from a year earlier, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   But Hill and other analysts are concerned about the trends behind
the expected earnings turnaround in the first half of this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the near term, Hill said, "I see the gain [in earnings] mainly
due to inventory-rebuilding. But what really counts is, what is final
demand doing?"</TE>
<TE>   If inventories are rebuilt, but consumer spending then slows and
business capital spending fails to ramp up, the earnings rebound
could run out of gas, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   On the consumer side, one potential source of weakness is the
housing market, the strength of which over the last year has been a
key element in minimizing the recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that housing did not go down [last year], so it
muted the recession," said economist Don Straszheim at Straszheim
Global Advisors in Westwood. "The bad news is that housing did not go
down, so no bounce-back is coming" as the rest of the economy
revives.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, as mortgage rates continue to rise with other long-term
interest rates, the housing market is poised to decline, albeit
gently, Straszheim predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rising energy prices also are a threat to consumer spending and to
corporate earnings. Crude oil prices in New York reached a six-month
high of $26.31 a barrel on Thursday--and that was before the military
conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians worsened, raising new
concerns that Mideast oil supplies could be threatened by a broader
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings Growth Tied to New Capital Spending</TE>
<TE>   On the business side, the biggest question is when capital
spending on technology and other equipment will revive. Many
economists believe businesses will be slow to order new technology or
to commit to expansion projects, considering the unused capacity in
many industry sectors.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a which-comes-first debate (a la the chicken or the
egg) involved in the capital-spending question.</TE>
<TE>   If corporate earnings rebound more sharply than expected, many
companies could be inclined to use that windfall to invest in new,
more efficient equipment, said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the conventional wisdom is that a meaningful profit turnaround
can't occur in many industry sectors until capital spending revives.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will be trying to sort all of this out in the next few
weeks, as first-quarter earnings reports arrive.</TE>
<TE>   While estimates of industry sector profit changes may be useful as
an overview, what matters, ultimately, is what happens at the
individual-company level. Decisions will be made about keeping a
stock or dumping it based on what a company reports and the outlook
it gives--not on how its sector may perform.</TE>
<TE>   Hill suggests that investors keep one thing in mind when weighing
earnings estimates and companies' turnaround potential: "It was a
very different recession, and that suggests the recovery will be
different, too."</TE>
<TE>   That could be for the better, or worse, depending on the industry
and on the individual company.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Industry's Plans Confirm Recovery--and More</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of September's terrorist attacks, no industry was hit as
severely as travel. Hotels and resorts languished as business
travelers and vacationers stayed home; airlines curtailed schedules.</LD>
<LD>   The travel and tourism economy is still slow almost seven months
later. But Marriott International Inc., one of the world's largest
hotel groups, is adding 25,000 to 30,000 rooms this year and the same
in 2003, a 12% increase in its chain of 2,500 hotels worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman J. Willard Marriott Jr. is confident that business travel
soon will return to a steady growth pattern. "We are starting to see
interesting things, short-term corporate meetings. Companies will
call up and say we need 300 rooms in two weeks. They want a meeting
to talk about where they're going," he says.</LD>
<TE>   Marriott is not alone. Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc.,
owner of the Sheraton, Westin and other hotel brands, is adding
14,600 rooms this year and the same number next year, a 7% increase.
Hilton Hotels Corp. will add 150 hotels to its franchised system. Six
Continents, the London-based owner of Holiday Inns and other hotel
brands, is expanding, as are Four Seasons Hotels Inc. and other
chains.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for hotel rooms is a sure indicator of recovery from
recession--and more. It is a sign that the once-mundane hotel
industry is now a force in the global economy and a business driven
by information and knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Business investment is extremely important to the hotel
business," Marriott says. If companies resume investing in new
computers and machinery, that will lift the hotel business, he says,
describing the quickening dance of recovery. "When companies are
buying new equipment, their consultants are on the road, their people
are on the road looking at new systems, salesmen are on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Leisure travel, particularly internationally, shows signs of
coming back. "Japanese tour operators assure us that their tourists
and businessmen will be traveling again by May," Marriott says.</TE>
<TE>   However, the outlook this summer remains dim for European tourists
returning to the United States, particularly to Florida, in the same
numbers as in recent years, and for American travelers going to
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott, who turned 70 last week, has presided over the
development of the Bethesda, Md.-based company's hotel business from
its start in 1957. That's when the family firm opened its first hotel
in Arlington, Va., as an offshoot of its Hot Shoppes chain of
restaurants, begun by Marriott's parents with a root beer stand in
1927 in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant business was sold in 1985 and the company, with
occasional forays into amusement parks, cruise lines and travel
agencies, has concentrated on the hotel trade.</TE>
<TE>   An Indicator of Global Economic Development</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Marriott racked up $20 billion in sales, a 1% increase
from the previous year despite a recession and the terrorist attacks
that destroyed Marriott's hotel at the World Trade Center and closed
another nearby in the Wall Street area. (The latter has reopened.)
Profit was down 16% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott has seen the hotel industry develop from a frag-</TE>
<TE>   mented field of many small companies to a worldwide business led
by chains that can offer accom-</TE>
<TE>   modations in several styles and at various prices. Marriott, for
exam-</TE>
<TE>   ple, owns the luxury Ritz-Carlton chain as well as the
economy-class Fairfield Inns. Hilton ranges from top-priced resort
hotels to lower-end Hampton Inns.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel business has become an indicator of global economic
development. When middle classes and commercial relationships are
developing, use of hotels goes with the territory. "We have 35 hotels
in China, five more under construction and we're going into India,"
Marriott says.</TE>
<TE>   Starwood Hotels boasts of its plans to open Westin and Sheraton
hotels in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Poland, Syria and Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Such ambitious building programs are possible because construction
and ownership of the hotels are financed by local or international
investors. The hotel companies offer their names, their management
and their reservations systems to bring in customers.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel business thus is an example of leveraging the value of
information and knowledge; the industry has developed communications
systems that can attract and direct customers, and management systems
that can run a complex for thousands of guests and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The fee structure typical of a hotel company's management contract
illustrates how important Marriott's role is. On top of a base
management fee of 3% to 4% of a hotel's gross revenue, Marriott can
earn an incentive fee that can be 15% to 30% of the hotel's profit
after the owner takes an 8% to 12% return off the top.</TE>
<TE>   It's a business that puts a premium on consistency, says John
Arabia, a director of Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach research
firm that covers the real estate and lodging industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers commonly make purchases without prior experience of a
specific hotel, so the brand name has to convey expectations of
quality and service," Arabia says.</TE>
<TE>   Some chains such as Holiday Inn have suffered when franchised
locations have not lived up to quality standards. Even now, Starwood
is embarked on a program to bring a consistent level of quality back
to the Sheraton chain, which it acquired in 1998. If Starwood can
improve Sheraton, the payoff will be an extra $55million in annual
earnings, says analyst Joyce Minor of Lehman Bros. investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott Sees Room for Growth Overseas</TE>
<TE>   Marriott has taken pains to protect its brand name, stipulating to
owners the kind of expenditures necessary to keep hotel facilities up
to snuff, Arabia says.</TE>
<TE>   So Chairman Marriott is eager to add more rooms, particularly
overseas. "I can't have enough hotel rooms in London," he says. "I
want more in Europe and in Asia and Latin America." The more hotel
rooms, the greater will be travelers' awareness of the Marriott brand
names, and thus the greater the occupancy rate, Marriott explains.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Marriott hotels break even at 60% occupancy. Hurt by
recession, the firm averaged just more than 70% last year for
Marriott hotels, down 9% from the more prosperous year 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion Seen in the Longer Term</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Marriott opened its first hotel in 1973,
at Los Angeles International Airport, just as rising gasoline prices
threw a roadblock up for the travel business. "Occupancy was only 25%
when we started out," Marriott recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Now the company has more than 80 facilities under various brand
names in the region and is adding hotels in Ventura, Burbank, Del
Mar, downtown San Diego, Anaheim and Cypress, plus a new luxury
hotel, Colony in Laguna Beach. It opened the Renaissance Hollywood
Hotel just before this month's Academy Awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel business overall may not be robust in the near term. The
outlook is for 2% growth in demand this year, half the growth rate of
the late '90s, reports Smith Travel Research, a Henderson, Tenn.,
firm that covers the industry. Marriott's longer-term prediction is
more expansive. "Travel will grow 4% to 5% a year long term," he
says. And the company will grow faster, he says, because it will
continue to add properties.</TE>
<TE>   Few would have predicted last fall in the wake of terrorist
attacks on top of a recession that hotel companies would be talking
of expansion so soon. Still, the stocks of all the major hotel
companies have rebounded strongly from their low points after Sept.
11. Marriott stock is up 39%, Starwood is up 78% and Hilton is up 67%
since trading resumed after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, some investors can spot a trend and growing opportunity.</TE>

<LD>What irritates me about having to sit through commercials at the
movie theater ["Coming Distractions," March 24] is precisely what
marketers love. Although I might pay money for cable television or a
newspaper that is filled with advertising, I have the option of
tuning out, switching channels, going to the kitchen, turning the
page or even looking at an interesting ad if I care to.</LD>
<LD>   But when I pay nearly $30 for the two of us to go to a movie and
enjoy an overpriced snack, I don't expect to be bombarded with three
or four minutes of inescapable commercials.</LD>
<LD>   We could stay home, rent a video and microwave a bag of popcorn
for less than $5.</LD>

<TE>   In 1996 my wife and I, on a trip to South Africa, had several
hours to kill before our plane left Johannesburg for home. Across the
street from our hotel was a mall with a movie theater, so off we
went.</TE>
<TE>   What a surprise to find the theater almost empty when we went in
and the lights went down. For what seemed like the next 20 minutes,
while we watched commercials, other theater goers trickled in until
there was almost a full house.</TE>

<TE>   I despise the idea that one of the last refuges from advertising,
the movies, is looked on as fair game for advertisers. Movies make
plenty of money to cover costs. We pay hundreds of dollars in TV
cable fees and get endless advertising and infomercials. We pay
hundreds of dollars in Internet access fees and get Web pages blocked
out by ads.</TE>
<TE>   Enough is enough. I hope every audience boos and hisses until
theaters realize people have paid good money to see the movie and
trailers and that is all!</TE>

<LD>Re: "Disney Confirms Animation Cuts," March 19:</LD>
<LD>   When the last of the projected 250 animators to be laid off from
Walt Disney Feature Animation makes her or his way out of the
towering sorcerer's hat on Riverside Drive in May 2003, so the book
will close on Hollywood's most promising and time-honored repertory
company.</LD>
<LD>   Disney management has stated publicly that this is not a signal
that they're abandoning traditional animation, simply that it's more
cost effective to hire on a "per project basis."</LD>
<TE>   That the studio most dependent on branding themselves through a
product born out of carefully and lovingly building a family of
artisans should so easily discard them is shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Gifted artists of the "second generation," who now make up the
"old guys" at Disney, were mentored by the giants who pioneered great
character animation. That's almost a century of knowledge that can't
be taught over the course of one film.</TE>

<LD>I am incensed that three airlines have now curtailed payments to
travel agents ["2 Airlines Join Delta in Commission Cuts," March 19].
Agents made the airline industry. Talk about biting the hand that
once fed them!</LD>
<LD>   It is the height of arrogance and with total disdain for the
customer that these carriers expect travelers to spend precious time
trying to figure out flights from a Web site.</LD>
<LD>   Lastly, most travelers do not know that a ticket reservation made
online (e-ticket) is worthless if a carrier cancels a flight and the
traveler must seek travel on another airline.</LD>

<HD>Putting House in Kids' Names Means They'll Inherit Tax Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We have an 84-year-old mother who is healthy and spry but
who wishes to consolidate her financial affairs to make it easier for
us when she dies. A will has been made and her bank accounts
combined. She's concerned about how to handle her house, which is in
all of our names--hers and her children's. Would it be better to take
her name off now for inheritance purposes or should we leave it as it
is?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Financially speaking, it's good your mom is in such fine
shape. Had she died with the house in all of your names, you probably
would have lived to regret it.</LD>
<LD>   It's almost always a bad idea for a parent to add a child, or
anyone other than a spouse, to the title of a home, for both tax and
legal reasons.</LD>
<TE>   The way it stands now, you and your siblings would owe tax on most
of the appreciation that's occurred since she bought the house. If
she's owned the house for a while, or if she lives in an area where
home prices have risen dramatically, that could mean a hefty tax
bill.</TE>
<TE>   If the house were in her name alone, it would get a completely
updated value for tax purposes when she dies. You and your siblings
would owe tax only on any appreciation that occurred between the time
she died and the time you sold the house. That means if you put the
house on the market shortly after her death, you probably wouldn't
owe any tax.</TE>
<TE>   Your mother also is taking an unnecessary legal risk with her
home. Should you or one of your siblings be sued or declare
bankruptcy, the creditors involved would have a claim against the
house.</TE>
<TE>   Have a chat with an attorney who has estate-planning experience
about the best way to put this right. If your mother is concerned
about avoiding the costs of probate, which is the court process that
follows death, the attorney can talk to her about putting the home in
a living trust.</TE>

<TE>   Debt Settlement Firm Uses Dubious Tactics</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've talked about the scam of marking "paid in full" on a $10
check, pointing out that such a tactic won't work with credit card
companies. But I have a question about debt settlement companies. I
have contacted a financial service to help pay off a $4,000 credit
card balance. This service claims that since Sept. 11 most banks are
willing to settle debts for approximately 15 cents on the dollar. I'm
supposed to pay them an $800 initial fee and empower them to
negotiate on my behalf so I will pay only $600 to settle the debt.
They claim it would show on my credit report as "settled and paid as
agreed" and improve my credit score by lowering my debt-to-income
ratio. Is this too good to be true? Should I use this to pay off my
department store cards? I'm currently trying to pre-qualify for a
home mortgage and need to improve my credit score.</TE>
<TE>   A: Of course it's too good to be true. This company's tactics
could trash your credit score and prevent you from getting your
mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes lenders will agree to accept less than what they're
owed, but the settlement shows up as a negative entry on your credit
record. People in serious financial trouble may resort to such debt
settlements, but you shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, didn't it strike you as the teeniest bit slimy that
this outfit was willing to exploit the terrorist attacks for its own
ends? And don't you feel a little weird looking for a way out of a
debt that you're apparently perfectly capable of paying?</TE>
<TE>   The way to improve your credit score is to apply for credit
sparingly, pay your bills on time and stop looking for shortcuts that
ultimately will be far more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   College Savings Can Be Consolidated</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've written about college savings plans before, and I have a
question. Can I transfer my son's Education IRA into his 529
college-saving plan without penalties or tax implications? His
Education IRA account is rather small and I thought it might be good
to consolidate his savings plans.</TE>
<TE>   A: You can make the transfer without owing any taxes or penalties,
said Joseph Hurley, a certified public accountant and guru on college
savings plans.</TE>
<TE>   You just have to make sure the deposit to the 529 plan takes place
in the same year as the withdrawal from the Education IRA (now known
as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts), Hurley said. Because the
beneficiary of both accounts is the same person--your son--the
transfer is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   When you complete your son's tax return for the year, classify the
withdrawal as "qualified use" of the Education IRA money and no tax
will be due, Hurley said.</TE>

<HD>Politics at Play in Pension Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two approaches to 401(k) reform are emerging from Congress after
months of hearings spurred by the Enron Corp. debacle, which saw
thousands of workers lose the bulk of their retirement savings when
the energy trader filed for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   One proposal, which could be voted on by the House next month,
encourages more disclosure and investment advice to workers with
401(k) retirement plans. The Senate's front-running measure
emphasizes putting limits on the types of investment choices
employers must offer within 401(k) plans.</LD>
<LD>   Whether either version--or a combination of the two--makes it into
law this year is in doubt, pension pundits say.</LD>
<TE>   "I would put the chances at no greater than 50-50, and probably
not that high," said Dallas Salisbury, president and chief executive
of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The big obstacle is politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether the parties in Congress would rather pass
legislation or have an issue that they could run on [in the November
elections]," said Judith Mazo, senior vice president and director of
research at Segal Co. in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Said John Scott, vice president at the American Benefits Council:
"What you could have is the two halves of the chamber staring at each
other without attaining much of a compromise. Despite the fact that
the White House is anxious to see legislation pass this year, it is
at best a 50% likelihood of a measure getting through the entire
Congress this year."</TE>
<TE>   The only hope is if workers begin to get involved in the debate
and actively start demanding reform from their elected
representatives, said Karen Ferguson, director of the
Washington-based Pension Rights Center.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that could shake this thing loose is if the public
gets involved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the poor immediate prospects, some key elements of these
proposals could make it into law next year, when such reforms would
be less affected by election-year politics.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a summary of proposals that appear to have support--and a
few that appear dead for now:</TE>
<TE>   * Limitations on company stock. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass)
wants to limit employer stock within 401(k) plans by mandating that
companies choose between providing their stock as a matching
contribution to workers or having company stock as one of the
investment options that employees could buy with their own
contributions. Current law allows companies to do both.</TE>
<TE>   Employers that offer traditional corporate pension plans would be
exempt from the limitations on employer stock within their 401(k)
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Such limitations are seen as key to some lawmakers because many
Enron employees had the bulk of their retirement savings tied up in
company stock, which became worthless as the company spiraled into
insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   Previous proposals that would have limited employer stock to a set
percentage of each employee's assets were considered too difficult to
monitor by many companies, which noted that automatic sales could be
triggered simply because a company's stock did well one day but fell
in value the next.</TE>
<TE>   Companies would prefer to have no limits on company stock within
401(k) plans, but some see Kennedy's proposal as a more acceptable
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   * Blackout warnings. When companies change plan administrators,
the 401(k) provider generally imposes a "blackout" period during
which company employees are not allowed to trade within the 401(k)
plan. Making sure that employees are aware that a blackout period is
coming, and how long the ban on trading could last, seems to have
widespread support on both sides of the political aisle, as well as
from industry and pension rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   * Investment advice.  Another area of apparent agreement is that
employees need more investment advice. The sticky issue is in how
they should get it.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill is expected to include provisions of the investment
advice bill sponsored by Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), which would
allow 401(k) plan administrators, such as Fidelity Investments,
Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, to give specific mutual fund
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   However, others in Congress, including Kennedy, believe that this
approach would invite conflicts of interest. After all, the same
companies that are getting investment management fees could be
suggesting which investments participants choose.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have good reasons to prefer their own approach.
Companies rightly note that impartial investment advice, which is
provided by some plans, is costly. The added costs could discourage
workers from taking advantage of such advice and could even eat into
their investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   Some consumer advocates, on the other hand, say companies that
stand to profit directly from employees' investment decisions should
not be in a position to lure unsuspecting workers into high-cost
funds that would benefit the advisor more than the participant.</TE>
<TE>   A possible compromise: disclosure of potential conflicts by all
company-sponsored advisors.</TE>
<TE>   * Diversification rules. Rules that bar individuals from selling
company stock within their plans for long periods probably will be
modified. Various proposals would bar employers from mandating long
holding periods on employer stock within worker 401(k) accounts. But
it's unclear at this point what the maximum holding period may be.</TE>
<TE>   * In the dustbin. Provisions that would limit company stock within
401(k) plans to 10% or 20% of employee assets appear to have died.
Other measures that remain--but probably won't pass--would require
more worker participation on 401(k) boards and would boost employer
liability for worker investment losses under certain circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Pension experts maintain that companies see these provisions as
either too time-consuming or too fraught with risk.</TE>
<TE>   Even if pension reform fails to make it out of Congress this year,
some advocates hope that the debate will set the stage for passage
next year of a comprehensive package that truly would benefit workers
who are saving for retirement through 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   "This has shaken loose so many issues that it's possible that next
year, we will see pension legislation that's much broader, much more
comprehensive," said Ferguson of the Pension Rights Center.</TE>

<HD>Markets Reflect Faith in Earnings Recovery</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: A strong rally in March helped most indexes post
gains for the quarter. But concerns persist about stock valuations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors kept the faith in the first quarter about a corporate
earnings recovery this year.</LD>
<LD>   Doubts in late January and early February sent many stocks lower
for a while, but trust in the recovery helped spur a strong rally in
March.</LD>
<LD>   That left the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index at 1,147.39 by
Thursday, the last day of trading in the quarter (markets were closed
on Good Friday). The index's net price change for the quarter: a
slight loss of 0.06%.</LD>
<TE>   Most other major market indexes posted gains for the quarter. The
Dow Jones industrial average, at 10,403.94 on Thursday, rose 3.8% in
the quarter, after gaining 13.3% in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilshire 5,000 index was up 0.6% in the first three months
after rising 12% in the fourth quarter. The New York Stock Exchange
composite index added 1.8% in the quarter. It gained 8.5% in the
previous period.</TE>
<TE>   Indexes of smaller stocks generally performed better than
blue-chip indexes in the first quarter, continuing the trend of the
last two years, as investors have hunted for bargains among
lesser-known names.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P small-stock index surged 6.8% in the quarter, and the S&amp;P
mid-sized stock index rose 6.5%. The Russell 2,000, another
small-stock index, added 3.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The standout loser among major indexes was the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which slumped 5.4% in
the quarter, to 1,858.25 by Thursday, after soaring 30% in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors are nervous about share prices, fearful that the
rebound from the three-year lows reached in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has left stocks overvalued--or at least
not undervalued--relative to earnings expected this year and in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, investors believe a profit recovery will happen,
but many are concerned that stock prices already reflect that
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks have borne the brunt of valuation concerns
because price-to-earnings ratios in the tech sector remain among the
highest of any industry sector.</TE>
<TE>   The average blue-chip stock is priced at 20 to 25 times estimated
2002 earnings per share, depending on whose earnings estimates are
used.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, price-to-earnings ratios are 40 or higher for
many leading companies based on 2002 profit estimates that already
assume a sharp recovery starting in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the stock market's ability to hold up as well as it did in
the first quarter, considering the Enron Corp. scandal, rising
interest rates and higher energy prices, suggests that most investors
believe that corporate earnings definitely are poised to rebound this
year--and that share prices aren't excessive based on expected
earnings.</TE>

the Justice Department to drop an indictment that charges the Big
Five firm with obstruction of justice for shredding documents related
to Enron Corp. And the company's chief executive, Joseph F.
Berardino, resigned.</LD>
<LD>   The firm's 1,700 U.S. partners adopted a reform package proposed
by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who is
overseeing the restructuring of the company. The proposal includes
separating the firm's auditing business from its lucrative but
conflict-ridden consulting operations.</LD>
<TE>   But the reform plan is conditioned on the Justice Department
agreeing to open talks with Andersen about dropping the charges. So
far, there has been no indication the government has any interest in
negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino stepped down after concluding that he'd become "an
impediment" to Volcker's efforts to save the firm.</TE>

<TE>   Hewlett Sues HP Alleging Improper Vote</TE>
<TE>   Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett, determined
to stop the company's acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp., filed a
lawsuit accusing HP management of improperly steering business to a
major shareholder to win the investor's votes in the closely fought
proxy battle.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's lawsuit asks a Delaware business court to throw out the
votes of Deutsche Asset Management, which could be enough to kill the
$20-billion deal.</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina says the company narrowly won the
proxy fight. Hewlett has refused to concede, saying the results are
too close to call.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner to Take $54-Billion Charge</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. said it is taking a record $54-billion
write-down in the first quarter, reflecting the steep decline in the
value of assets the Internet service provider acquired last year when
it bought the world's largest entertainment company.</TE>
<TE>   The company, whose shares have declined nearly 50% in the last
year, warned Wall Street in January that it would take a noncash
charge against earnings of $40billion to $60 billion because of new
accounting rules governing merger deals.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's write-off is the largest in corporate history,
surpassing telecom equipment firm JDS Uniphase Corp.'s record
$50.1-billion charge in fiscal 2001.*</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin Agrees to Plead Guilty</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara money manager Reed Slatkin, who built an illusory
investment empire using money collected from Hollywood celebrities,
Internet moguls and fellow Scientologists, agreed to plead guilty to
15 counts of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy for masterminding
one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin, who collected $593 million from 800 investors, could face
up to 105 years in prison, although his sentence probably will be far
less, federal prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence could be further reduced by a few years if Slatkin,
53, cooperates fully with investigators, who are trying to determine
what happened to investors' money.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin has acknowledged that at least $255million is missing in
the scheme, in which new investors' money was used to pay bogus
returns to earlier investors.</TE>
<TE>   A co-founder of Internet service provider EarthLink Inc., Slatkin
also faces a $3.75-million fine and has been ordered to make
restitution to his victims, although it is unclear how much money
will be recovered.</TE>

<TE>   Will Customers Go for Scion or ION?</TE>
<TE>   Although light trucks comprise more than half of the U.S. auto
market and their share is growing, auto makers are slugging it out
even more fiercely in the passenger car segment.</TE>
<TE>   At the New York International auto show, Toyota Motor Co.
introduced a new brand called Scion, aimed at the Gen-X and Gen-Y
customers with whom the company hasn't connected. The model will go
on sale in June 2003, initially in California only.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, General Motors Co.'s Saturn division unveiled the ION,
a compact car with interchangeable trim panels, also aimed at the
youth market.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. announced it will build a new sedan called the Five
Hundred that's bigger than the mid-size Taurus but smaller than the
full-size Crown Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Motor Co. showed its Murano "crossover" that's part sport
utility vehicle, part station wagon, and Nissan's luxury Infiniti
division took the wraps off a sleek G35 coupe and all-new M45 sedan,
priced around $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   Tipping the scales for about the same price is the Lincoln
Aviator, a luxury SUV built off the Ford Explorer that Lincoln, the
top-selling luxury brand in 1998, hopes will help pull it up from the
No. 6 spot to which it has fallen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Shares Hit by Off-Sheet Debt Report</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications Corp. took investors by surprise when it
acknowledged that it has $2.3 billion in debt not included on its
balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The company also reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter
loss as a result of a $1.5-billion write-down on the value of a
former telephone venture, Adelphia Business Solutions, which filed
for bankruptcy protection last week.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been wary of any company using off-balance-sheet
financing practices after the December bankruptcy filing of Enron
Corp., which used private partnerships to shift debt off its books.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Adelphia, the sixth-largest cable operator, the
controlling Rigas family has been borrowing money through a privately
held partnership. The family in effect shifted debt from Adelphia
Communications to the off-balance-sheet partnership, called Highland
Holdings, whose loans were guaranteed by the public company.</TE>
<TE>   The practice is not illegal, but investors say it is inappropriate
and undermines the company's credibility on Wall Street. By week's
end, Adelphia shares were at $14.90, down 29% since Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Court Ruling Keeps Napster Offline</TE>
<TE>   Online music company Napster Inc. had an eventful week in the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court Monday upheld an order by U.S. District
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel shutting down Napster's free service until
it improved its ability to block piracy.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Patel gave Napster 10 months to gather evidence that
the major record labels misused their copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a battle for control of Napster's board broke out in
Delaware Chancery Court, with original investor John Fanning--the
uncle of wunderkind programmer Shawn Fanning--suing to oust
representatives of venture capital firm Hummer Winblad.</TE>
<TE>   John Fanning is trying to ensure that Hummer Winblad won't walk
away with all the proceeds if Napster is sold to European media
conglomerate Bertelsmann.</TE>

<TE>   SEC Accuses Former Waste Execs of Fraud</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued six former executives
of Waste Management Inc., the largest U.S. trash hauler, accusing
them of inflating profit by $1.7 billion in a "massive financial
fraud" the agency said was aided by accounting firm Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   By deferring or eliminating expenses, among other techniques, the
company, from 1992 to 1997, was able to meet Wall Street profit
expectations and boost its stock price, enriching the defendants by
more than $28 million in performance-based bonuses and other
compensation, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary investors, however, lost $6 billion, as the company's
stock plunged after the firm recorded a $1.7-billion earnings
restatement in 1998, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The case is an extension of an SEC investigation that resulted in
a settlement last June with Andersen, the company's former auditor.
Andersen paid $7 million in fines to settle charges that it had filed
false Waste Management audit reports for 1993 through 1996.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Sues Union-Backed Firm Over Lost Funds</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department has sued a major union-backed financial
services company, Union Labor Life Insurance Co., alleging it broke
pension laws by making a $10-million investment of retirement funds
in a shaky Las Vegas real estate venture.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that the company, through its investment
subsidiary Trust Fund Advisors Inc., used Laborers' International
Union pension funds to buy 120 acres of land that was to be developed
into residential building sites. No work was done, and the land was
sold in 1999 to Newport Beach-based developer Capital Pacific
Holdings Inc. at a loss of nearly $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department contends that because the $10 million could
have generated substantial earnings during the booming mid-1990s, the
actual loss is far higher than $1 million. The company says it acted
appropriately.</TE>

<HD>IRS Returns to Tougher Stance on Tax Cheats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government is making it tougher for Americans to get away
with cheating on their taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The Internal Revenue Service's announcement last week that it is
stepping up efforts to nab taxpayers who hide income in offshore
accounts is the latest move to turn up the heat on tax cheats. A
surge in hiring at the IRS, better technology, stricter sentencing
guidelines, a pledge to reverse the decline in audit rates and a wave
of patriotism that may be pushing judges to impose stiffer penalties
make tax fraud increasingly risky, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "[IRS officials] are putting more resources into audits. They are
getting agents back and hiring new agents," said Philadelphia
attorney Ian M. Comisky, co-author of the legal guide "Tax Fraud &amp;
Evasion." "They are going to up the audit rate this year for the
first time in years and they are working on a project to figure out
who to audit.</LD>
<TE>   "There is never a good year to be a tax cheat, but this is a worse
year than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't always been the case. Audits are at historically low
levels, with less than one-half of 1% of individual taxpayers coming
under IRS scrutiny. On the criminal tax fraud front, investigations
initiated, indictments and convictions dropped during the last three
months of 2001. But these numbers don't tell the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   Experts acknowledge that taxpayers who simply fudge on a deduction
or two are highly unlikely to attract IRS scrutiny. But those who
fail to pay taxes at all, hide income in offshore havens or create
bogus trusts or businesses to avoid federal taxation increasingly are
targeted for prosecution, said Charles P. Rettig, partner with
Beverly Hills law firm Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher &amp; Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "People might be tempted to play the audit lottery because the
stated audit rates are very low," said Rettig, who represents
taxpayers in trouble. "But the numbers are distorted. The audit rate
isn't that low for people who have reason to be audited," such as
self-employed people who operate cash-intensive businesses, or those
who try to "untax" themselves under the guise of a debunked theory
about income from wages being exempt from U.S. taxation.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that it's taking a harder stance on serious tax
fraud, the IRS is ratcheting up its search for the more mundane forms
of tax cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti told Congress
that the agency plans to boost the national audit rate because of a
funding increase that has allowed the IRS to hire hundreds of new
auditors and collection agents. Congress, which only four years ago
forced the agency into a "kinder, gentler" era after critical
hearings about IRS abuses and passage of a bill of rights for
taxpayers, now is supportive of the agency's renewed efforts to crack
down on cheats.</TE>
<TE>   "At our hearing last year, the IRS promised to crack down on tax
cheats. I'm glad to see the IRS following up so aggressively," said
Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking minority member of the Senate
Finance Committee. "Since tax cheats are endlessly creative, the IRS
has to be just as creative to catch the crooks."</TE>
<TE>   Grassley's committee will hold a hearing on tax schemes and scams
next month to gauge the IRS' progress in pursuing tax cheats over the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this renewed emphasis on taxpayer compliance?
Officials believe tax cheating has soared and is causing the loss of
about $200 billion in revenue each year. Moreover, as news has gotten
out about the declining audit rate, government officials have become
increasingly concerned that normally honest citizens will be tempted
to cheat.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to deter the small percentage of people who would cheat
to convince the rest of the community at-large that they are not a
chump for paying their fair share," said Mark Matthews, chief of the
IRS' criminal investigation division.</TE>
<TE>   Pendulum Has Swung Back to More Audits</TE>
<TE>   The shift toward a more aggressive IRS doesn't show up in recent
statistics for several reasons. The latest figures for prosecutions
and other actions are for the IRS' fiscal first quarter, October
through December of last year. During that time, hundreds of agents
were diverted to serve as air marshals and to investigate the
financial side of terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks, Matthews
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the agents are wrapping up their terrorism-related work and
are pouring back into IRS offices. At the same time, he said, the IRS
has been hiring and training hundreds of new agents.</TE>
<TE>   "The pendulum is now in the process of swinging back," said
Elliott H. Kajan, principal with Beverly Hills tax firm Kajan, Mather
&amp; Barish. "There will be more examinations, more audits; there will
be more civil, if not criminal, penalties."</TE>
<TE>   Internal changes at the IRS are having an effect as well. The
agency gradually has been replacing outdated computer systems and
adding income-matching software, which makes it easier for the IRS to
identify taxpayers who fail to report income.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also is trying to root out taxpayers who use offshore
bank accounts to hide income. These accounts long have been favored
by tax cheaters because foreign banks are unwilling to share their
records with U.S. tax authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Holders of offshore accounts often use credit cards to access
their cash, however, and the IRS has been gathering records from
major credit card companies to identify them.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, American Express Inc. said it would join MasterCard
International Inc. in supplying information to the IRS, and the
Justice Department has requested records from Visa International, the
largest issuer of credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS is beginning to see results from its move several years
ago to a "specialist" system designed to give auditors an area of
expertise. The agency's auditors now are far more effective at
quickly rooting out cheating, Rettig said.</TE>
<TE>   "The agents focus in a hurry. They ask the right questions. They
have a lot of tools to get information from third parties," Rettig
said. "And, I'll tell you, they hit home run after home run. It's
frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing Guidelines Have Been Revamped</TE>
<TE>   The conviction rate for tax-related crimes, already high, has been
going higher--to 93% last year from 91% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, sentencing guidelines for tax cheats were revamped
late last year. For example, the mandatory sentence for someone who
had evaded $200,000 in taxes was increased to 27 to 33 months from 21
to 27 months, tax fraud expert Comisky said.</TE>
<TE>   Those tougher sentencing guidelines should continue the recent
trend of rising prison terms for tax cheats--which have grown from an
average of 18 months in 1998 to about 25 months this year. And
Matthews of the IRS said sentences being handed down today are for
crimes committed two or three years ago, when the sentencing
guidelines called for shorter prison terms. The average term probably
will increase as tax cheats are sentenced under the new guidelines,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some think the wave of patriotism that followed last fall's
terrorist attacks may be spurring judges to impose prison terms at
the higher end of the sentencing guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of being one country and doing the right thing against
self-interest has certainly been the tone since Sept. 11," Rettig
said. "There are judges who believe that reporting your income and
paying the right amount of taxes is a patriotic act. Somebody who
plays loose with the rules certainly pays the price when they end up
before those judges."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent sentencing hearing in federal court in Sacramento,
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. lectured Richard Pfeiffer, a
67-year-old Northern California orthodontist, about "the obligations
of citizenship."</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad that the widow of the Special Forces soldier who was
cut down ... can't sit here and listen to you talk about avoiding
your taxes," Damrell said as he sentenced Pfeiffer to 27 months in
prison for concealing taxable income in a series of offshore
accounts. "That young person gave up his young life to protect you
... and you pursue a scheme to avoid paying taxes to your country."</TE>
<TE>   Whether heightened enforcement and tougher sentencing lead to a
noticeable increase in taxpayer compliance remains to be seen, of
course. But officials are convinced they're already having an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that going to jail for a tax crime was the
exception," said Edward M. Robbins Jr., assistant U.S. attorney in
the Justice Department's tax division in Los Angeles. "These days,
the rule is that you go to jail."</TE>

<HD>Small-Town Utilities Fear Losses of Global Proportion</HD>
<DH>Telecom giant's financial woes and federal probes have some
independent carriers on edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than a century, Crown Point Telephone Corp. has had few
problems serving its tiny Adirondack Mountains community in upstate
New York. But owner Pat Knapp now worries that her 1,100 customers
might see rate hikes if network developer Global Crossing Ltd., which
filed for bankruptcy protection in January, doesn't pay its bills in
the coming months.</LD>
<LD>   Half a country away, Jerry Melick, general manager of Liberty
Communications in tiny West Liberty, Iowa, also is feeling the pinch.
And he is deeply concerned about the fate of the state's 150
independent phone companies as regulators investigate accounting
practices at major carriers to see whether they artificially pumped
up revenue.</LD>
<LD>   There are about 1,200 of these small utilities nationwide that
provide the critical last link from the vast phone infrastructure to
the homes and businesses of customers. Many derive a significant
amount of their annual revenue from big telecoms by allowing traffic
to run over their lines.</LD>
<TE>   "Global Crossing is not going to put us out of business, but the
trend is disturbing," said Melick, whose family has owned Liberty for
four generations. "How many inflated deals are out there? Is it all a
house of cards?"</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigations of the accounting practices of Global
Crossing, Qwest Communications International Inc. and WorldCom Inc.
have local exchange carriers on edge, ready to fight any attempt to
foist long-distance losses onto their customers.</TE>
<TE>   Global alone pays $2 billion a year to local phone companies in
access charges, mainly to complete calls that its business customers
make worldwide. About $1.7 billion of that is spent in the U.S., with
about 80% going to AT&amp;T Corp., Qwest, WorldCom and five other major
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the big companies can absorb what for them are tiny
losses--BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., with $29 billion in annual
revenue, is setting aside a reserve against the $52 million that
Global owes it--many of the independent exchanges across the country
are hurting.</TE>
<TE>   "It means we can't do certain things this year that we would have
hoped to do," said Richard M. Vohs, president of Iowa Network
Services, a company owned by 128 local carriers to coordinate
long-distance calls. The company's 200 employees could see a drop of
as much as 2% in their profit-sharing checks because of losses from
Global. "And it was no fault of the employees," Vohs said.</TE>
<TE>   In Global's bankruptcy case, the company said it had an excellent
payment record before its Chapter 11 filing and has sufficient
funds--$700 million in unrestricted cash--to pay for goods and
services it has been ordering since it filed its petition Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming days, as February bills come due, utilities will
find out whether Global can make good on its promises to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most vendors, who can cut off sales if a customer fails to
pay new bills, utility companies by law must continue to provide
services without much assurance they will be repaid fully. Even if
bills aren't paid, hundreds of utilities involved in the case may be
required to continue providing services for up to 60 more days.</TE>
<TE>   For a small rural utility in Crown Point, a sleepy town on the
southwestern shores of Lake Champlain just north of Ticonderoga, the
unpaid debts are a burden for the Knapps' family-run enterprise.
Global's monthly bills of about $1,500 are about 5% of Crown Point
Telephone's total monthly revenue, Knapp said. That's $18,000 a year,
income the local exchange can't afford to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Global has not paid its bills for December and January, which are
part of the bankruptcy petition. And the February bill, which is not
part of the bankruptcy and must be paid, is due in a week, Knapp
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We really can't do anything but wait," she said. "We have to
provide service."</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy judge in New York has rejected motions by utilities
to force Global to set aside two months' worth of billings as
assurance they will be paid for continued services. But the judge
shortened to two weeks the time Global has to pay its utility bills,
and he set up procedures to deal quickly with late payments and to
seek a cut-off of service for nonpayment.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp, Melick and even the big carriers don't feel reassured. In a
court filing, Citizens Communications Co., which bought the local
operations of Frontier Telephone of Rochester Inc. from Global, said
Global's claim to an excellent payment history is "untrue." Of the
$11.6 million Global owed at the time it filed for bankruptcy
protection, $3.4 million was a month late and an additional $2.8
million was overdue by two months or more.</TE>
<TE>   If Crown Point doesn't get paid for "a few more months," Knapp
said, it may ask state regulators for a rate hike; customers now pay
$8.79 a month for basic service. "It's a rural area, so we don't have
the panoply of services that we can use to spread the losses out,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Small Companies Pay a Price in Time, Legal Fees</TE>
<TE>   The town of 2,500 on the eastern edge of the state has little in
the way of business. NoTECO Inc., a one-man inventor, designs roof
rakes and bicycle seat posts, boasting that its products are "well
behind the times." And there are home-based operations, including
Adirondac Hands and History craft items and Rafferty's American
Bulldogs breeding outfit.</TE>
<TE>   Most people work at the International Paper Co. plant in
Ticonderoga, eight miles to the south, where a Wal-Mart built three
years ago is the closest thing the area has to a shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   With 15 workers, Crown Point Telephone is the biggest employer in
town next to the school system. It started, then sold, a cellular
business, and it brought in high-speed lines. It created an Internet
subsidiary with three employees.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Global's financial problems haven't forced a change in
Crown Point operations, but they have taken up more of Knapp's time
and are costing the exchange about $1,500 a month in added legal
fees.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp said she worries that the situation could get worse if
another major carrier files for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like the whole industry is wobbly right now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   From Melick's view in the gently rolling land of eastern Iowa,
companies such as Global and Qwest aren't keeping a handle on the
profit structure. Long-distance carriers gripe about paying access
fees, but Melick said such fees are a lot cheaper than building a new
network or buying all the local companies.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Iowa phone companies have made it easy: They built a
modern fiber-optic network linking each company to a terminal in Des
Moines, where Iowa Network Services can connect them to any
long-distance carrier that comes to the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Faces Prospect of Cutting Operations</TE>
<TE>   The network has spurred growth in high-speed and Internet
services, but as Melick deadpans, Liberty Communications has enjoyed
"single-digit growth" since his great-grandfather bought the company
in 1908. It has 4,200 lines serving about 3,900 customers in West
Liberty and nearby West Branch, birthplace of President Herbert
Hoover.</TE>
<TE>   West Liberty, about 115 miles east of Des Moines, was built at the
junction of the east-west and north-south routes of the old Rock
Island Railroad, and its past role as a major depot made it more
prosperous than other communities. But AT&amp;T and its Bell operations
had a stranglehold on local and long-distance calling until its
breakup in the mid-1980s, Melick said, and his grandfather had to
sell electrical appliances and teach cooking classes in his basement
to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the trains pass without stopping, and the depot has been
turned into a museum and headquarters for the local chamber of
commerce. Liberty Communications is thriving, though, in a state that
regulates the rates of only the three major telephone companies.</TE>
<TE>   Access fees account for 60% of Liberty's revenue, and Global's
average monthly bill of $3,500 is about 1% of total revenue, Melick
said. At the time it filed its bankruptcy petition, Global owed
Liberty about $7,000, an amount, he said, that "makes you stand up
and take notice."</TE>
<TE>   Should Global fail to make payments over the next several months,
Liberty would start looking at cutting operations. Its small size
allows it to draw up a contingency plan in a flash.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always spending so much on new equipment and laying cable.
That would be our first cut before looking at staff cuts or anything
else," Melick said. "And if it gets that bad, we'd be leaning on
[national trade groups] to find out why this is all being laid on
local customers."</TE>
<TE>   One group of local Iowa exchanges already has taken action.
OmniTel Communications Inc. in Nora Springs (halfway between Des
Moines and Minneapolis) and 12 other independents canceled a contract
with a long-distance company that used Global Crossing as its
underlying carrier.</TE>
<TE>   OmniTel, with 6,000 lines serving 5,500 customers, had been
billing Global about $63,000 a month in access charges for both
incoming and outgoing long-distance calls. Global now owes
$120,000--about 17% of OmniTel's total monthly income--said OmniTel's
CEO, Ronald Laudner Jr.</TE>
<TE>   By going with a different long-distance carrier for outgoing
calls, OmniTel has reduced its potential losses by nearly $38,000 a
month, Laudner said. The company can't stop incoming callers from
using Global lines.</TE>
<TE>   Vohs said Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing isn't the only
failure that has hurt the industry--"It was just the largest."
Companies such as Internet service provider PSINet Inc., which filed
for bankruptcy protection lastJune, have played havoc with the
revenues of local utilities. And he said he's worried that the
carnage isn't over.</TE>
<TE>   "We started a new budget line this year for reserves against these
kinds of losses. We're setting aside several hundred thousand dollars
in reserves now," Vohs said. "Just so we're prepared for the
possibility that we'll lose more revenue in the future."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is correct in looking toward the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge as a very practical supplemental solution to resolve
the imported oil-dependence problem of the United States ("Mr. Bush's
Arctic Obsession," editorial, March 27). The U.S. is the largest
consumer of oil. Currently, imported oil is the lifeblood of our
economy and cherished lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, a former oilman and now commander in chief, clearly
understands that oil can be used as a devastating and persuasive
weapon against our national interests. The current crisis in the
Middle East makes those of us who do not see Israel with religious
fervor wonder where we would stand on our foreign policies should
long gasoline lines again develop and jobs disappear.</LD>
<LD>   The insignificant use of 2,000 acres out of 19 million for oil
production must be balanced with reducing the potentially devastating
threat on our citizens and lifestyle against the remotely possible
adverse effects on a few caribou. The oil produced out of ANWR would
last many years--if we use it to supplement our growth while
maintaining our current or slightly reduced level of imports and as
an emergency reserve for national security.</LD>
<TE>   Frank Bajinting</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the theme of your editorial, but some things must be
added. The oil drillers can use ice to build their roads but where
does the water come from to make the ice? The North Slope is a
desert, and what do the ice roads and drilling pads sit on? Massive
areas will be crushed and drainages will be disrupted, so huge swamps
will result. But this is not what is critical; Bush does not want to
drill for oil in the ANWR; he knows that he would lose a tremendous
amount of voters because most Americans don't want to destroy this
area. This is a ploy! He will say OK, we will give up ANWR but give
us these park areas in the lower 48. That is his obsession, not the
ANWR.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Leavell</TE>
<TE>   Professor of Ecology</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton College</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The notion that tapping the oil in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge will provide some number of months supply to the nation is
misleading. Any oil produced will become a part of the global
production and distribution system, of which the U.S. currently uses
about 25%. It is this profligate use which underlies not only our
energy problems but our frenzied relationship with the Middle East,
where the real reserves lie, and upon which we are and will stay
dependent.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, of course, the oil in the ANWR will have to come out.
It is a resource which should be exploited later rather than
sooner--like a century later.</TE>

<HD>Historic Registry Burdens Homeowners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"They'd Like Registry to Be History" (March 25) showed structures
that likely have real merit and public benefit. But communities
should not arrogantly burden individual property owners with the
inconvenience and expense of preservation. An owner should not be
forced to continue to occupy, upgrade and endlessly repair a
functionally and structurally obsolete structure. Add seismic and
structural upgrades, a new roof, kitchen, modern heating, plumbing,
electrical and insulation and you have a museum for a family of four
with one bathroom and a one-car garage. Such expenses typically
exceed the replacement costs. An owner would be more likely to
voluntarily repair a worthwhile structure and submit it to scrutiny
if it's publicly funded. Exercising the power of eminent domain may
be appropriate because the seller would be paid.</LD>
<LD>   It has become a trend to abuse the enormous power to designate,
victimizing a powerless owner. The agenda might actually be
anti-growth or preservation of affordable housing. A community would
be less likely to designate an aging tract house if it had to
publicly fund it and find a suitable use.</LD>

<HD>'One Strike' Eviction From Public Housing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As sadly ridiculous as our Supreme Court was in supporting the "one
strike" eviction ruling ("'One Strike' Eviction Policy Affirmed,"
March 27), surely it should be consistent in its folly and include
alcohol abuse, if not usage itself, in the list of substances and
paraphernalia whose mere possession by even a visitor to a publicly
owned residence is cause for eviction. (It's unbelievable, isn't it?)</LD>
<LD>   Applying eviction from public housing because a child, visitor or
owner on or off the premises abused alcohol, a higher standard than
mere possession, would of course mean that President Bush would be
evicted from the White House for his daughters' actions. Great
sections of military dormitories and base housing would be vacated
(unless military drinking has changed radically since my days in the
Army) and many members of Congress would lose their publicly owned
office space.</LD>
<LD>   A marijuana cigarette or a few bottles of beer? We all know the
major difference is that one is illegal and the other isn't. Either
will do the job on your brain and get you out there.</LD>
<TE>   Our senators and representatives need to act now to redress this
amazingly unfair policy. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the
court justices saw nothing in the U.S. Constitution that would
prevent this policy, but I suppose that's understandable, since
they've let the DEA seize and sell property of suspected drug dealers
and users prior to a trial of the accused.</TE>
<TE>   Proof of intent, knowledge or participation in a criminal
activity, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty--all that
is what I thought were constitutional matters we all should expect
the Supreme Court to honor. This is all very sad.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Davidson</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court ... not! The Supreme Court's recent tenant
eviction ruling confirms and affirms the sad fact that the court is
out of touch, out to lunch and outdated. The court should be
abolished and dismantled--it's become a politicized dinosaur that is
an embarrassment to the great citizens of this country and to the
great history of the court itself.</TE>

<LD>I completely agree with "It's the Owners as Much as the Dogs That
Need Training" (Commentary, March 22), about owners having to take
responsibility for their dogs' behavior. However, this is not only
for the so-called aggressive dogs--but all dogs, regardless of breed
or temperament.</LD>
<LD>   A growl is a warning, but doesn't necessarily mean a dog will
bite. Any dog who is mistreated, neglected or even unintentionally
abused may have a breaking point. Since most dog bites in this
country are directed at children, parents bear a particular
responsibility to teach their children to be kind and respectful
toward their pets; they are living creatures who feel pain and will
react, if tested. Positive training is imperative for the dog and the
owner.</LD>

<HD>Green Pill Reduces Odors, Plain as the Nose on Your Face</HD>
<DH>Will Body Mint replace deodorant, cologne or soap? It
reduces scents --for big bucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MORAGO</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have not used deodorant for a week. I've pushed aside mouthwash,
foot sprays and body talcs, too. My signature cologne sits untouched
on my dresser. Though I have showered each day and brushed my teeth,
no odor-containing or odor-altering product has touched my skin. I'm
living the hygienic equivalent of going commando.</LD>
<LD>   Except for my little green pill.</LD>
<LD>   My little green pill is supposed to reduce body odors from the
inside. It's a swallowable Mennen Speed Stick, a digestible can of
Lysol. The size of a Tylenol but the color of moss, my Body Mint pill
claims to reduce breath, underarm, foot and feminine odor (hey, what
the heck?) courtesy of chlorophyllin, a derivative of chlorophyll.</LD>
<TE>   Body Mint, which advertises itself as a "100% total-body
deodorant," is the hot new commodity in the personal-grooming realm.
It's flying off the shelves at pricey boutique stores such as Henri
Bendel in New York and Fred Segal in Los Angeles--two particularly
odiferous cities, where the rich and famous will go to any lengths to
smell like anything other than themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Curious, I decided to forgo my usually rigorous daily hygiene
routines to test Body Mint for a week. For someone who will go to any
length to smell like anything other than himself, this was also a
personal test of will. How could a little green pill take the place
of dozens of cleansing and grooming items to which I'm slavishly
devoted?</TE>
<TE>   It was a week of living dangerously. It was a week I thought a lot
about smell (its physical and psychological manifestations) while
contemplating the oddly diverse subjects of sweat glands, foot
perspiration, body image, pheromones, animal magnetism, flatulence,
and "natural" living.</TE>
<TE>   Let me pop another green pill and tell you about it.</TE>
<TE>   I was brought up believing that men smell, women don't. Men are
stinky pigs, and women are dewy lilacs. Men can sweat all they want,
but women don't. Sure, Dad and assorted uncles might smell like
English Leather or Aqua Velva in the morning, but it was only a
temporary curtain over the inevitable odors of armpit, beer, smoke,
wet dog and apres-workout gym bag.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why I started at a very young age to aggressively
deodorize myself. It's not that I wanted to smell like a woman; I
just didn't want to smell like a stinky man. By the time I was a
teenager, I could recite the pros and cons of every smell-good
product on the market. I did them all--from Old Spice to Brut to
Canoe. My body reeked, not of sweat but of Palmolive, Vitalis and
British Sterling.</TE>
<TE>   Today, I have graduated from dime-store after-shaves and odor
eaters to designer lathers and lotions. I have spent ridiculous
sums--$24 for a bar of Hermes soap, $28 for a Aqua di Parma
deodorant--in my mad quest to keep from smelling the way a man was
meant to smell (like himself). Oh, and on the first day of eschewing
all that, I swallow two Body Mints.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 2 million sweat glands in the average human body,
but men sweat about 40% more than women. On Day 2 of Body Mint I can
detect no unpleasant odor. "Smell me!" I push my underarm into a
co-worker's face. "You smell like starched shirt," he says. I don't
believe him. I ask another co-worker to smell the other pit. "You
smell clean," she says.</TE>
<TE>   On the third day without deodorant, I should smell somewhat
unclean. Yet surprisingly, I don't. Could Body Mint be working so
effectively from the inside? Well, it makes sense. After all, if you
eat garlic, you reek of garlic. Is the little green pill making me
smell, well, green? Clean green?</TE>
<TE>   A friend, who is perfectly happy making a meal of sprouts and
assorted lettuce, wonders if vegetarians smell better because they're
already eating green. But then I recall all those vegetarian,
hippie-dippy granola eaters I've met in my life. They are the kind of
people who eschew deodorant and fast food and save all their yogurt
containers so they can be recycled into toothbrushes. And while they
may have the faint whiff of patchouli, they still stink. Body odor
visits even the leaf-eaters among us.</TE>
<TE>   I do not alter my diet during my experiment. My diet usually
consists of coffee, tuna sandwiches and potato chips, takeout
Chinese, pizza, cigarettes and gin. Come to think of it, despite
being a smoker, my friends claim I do not smell like smoke. Perhaps
Body Mint is also neutralizing the fumes.</TE>
<TE>   Olfactory receptors in the nose are remarkably sensitive. Humans
can distinguish thousands of odors. Women are said to have a better
sense of smell than men.</TE>
<TE>   I have a keen sense of smell. At work, I can smell a tuna sandwich
or vegetable soup an office away. If someone's eating licorice or
Fritos, I know it. And yet, on the fourth day of Body Mint, I smell
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   I am only mildly worried that Body Mint, whose glowing statements
of success have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, might be turning my insides green or, worse. On my
sixth day without using my roll-on, I am convinced that Body Mint is
working and that deodorants are useless. Body Mint, however, costs
$20 a bottle (a one-month supply). Sure, I could ditch my $2 stick
deodorant, which usually lasts me about 3 weeks. That's about $35 a
year I spend on deodorant. Body Mint would cost me $240.</TE>
<TE>   This, however, doesn't make deodorant the automatic winner. I am a
product of the Jacqueline Susann generation; I love taking pills.
Popping a green doll is much more fun and glamorous than swiping a
pasty white stick back and forth over a hairy patch of skin.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, I am happy and, surprisingly, odorless.</TE>
<TE>   I realize now I'm becoming a tad too fixated on the subject of
body odor. But don't blame me: I'm American. Americans tend to have
an obsession with being clean and avoiding natural odors. When
compared with people of other countries, we bathe more often and
spend more money on products to reduce odors. Products like Body
Mint.</TE>
<TE>   Today, I go off the green pills. My experiment is completed. I
return to Right Guard. But, even if only for a week, it was easy
being green.</TE>

<HD>The Role of a Lifetime</HD>
<DH>Playing Jesus in Mexico City's oldest Passion procession
has brought Pedro Limon closer to his faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>IZTAPALAPA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Pedro Limon has been sinfully busy this year. When he wasn't at his
restaurant manager job, he was jogging or lifting weights. In the wee
hours, he studied the Bible and watched religious movies. On
weekends, it was church and talks with his priest. And in all these
months, he didn't have a single shot of tequila or a date with a
girl. If you want to be Jesus during Easter, expect to make
sacrifices.</LD>
<LD>   After winning a competition to play the role of Jesus, the
26-year-old Limon donned a white robe, a beard and long, fluffy wig,
and solemnly walked through the streets last week in Mexico City's
oldest and most traditional Passion play processions. He trained for
four months for the spiritual and physical demands of leading the
parades that were expected to draw 3 million spectators to the
neighborhood of Iztapalapa. The biblical Mary and Peter were no
slackers either, practicing their lines and studying the Bible to
make spiritual links to their characters.</LD>
<LD>   Their efforts demonstrate an idiosyncrasy of a working-class
community in modern-day Mexico City where Catholic traditions with an
indigenous flair shape civic life as they have since the Spaniards
conquered Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Though there are many processions that mark Holy Week in Mexico
and in Latino neighborhoods in the United States, Iztapalapa's have
reached epic proportions, with its 150 players dressing in ever more
ornate, detailed costumes as the years pass.</TE>
<TE>   Iztapalapa, which gets its name from an indigenous Nahuatl word
that refers to how the city was built atop fill dirt over water, is a
gritty sprawl of 2 million people in southeast Mexico City. They
convert their neighborhood each year into a stage for reenactments of
the Last Supper, Jesus' arrest and trial and the Crucifixion. A
citizen group, not the church, takes the helm of the festivities.
Beginning in January, the nine-member committee conducts tryouts for
the major parts. Limon was picked over 14 other young men.</TE>
<TE>   The rules stipulate that Jesus must be about 5 feet, 7 inches,
unmarried, have no tattoos and be a native of Iztapalapa. Once those
requirements are met, committee members delve into the moral
character of the contestants and their families. The winners of the
roles must participate in workshops and rehearsals, raise money for
procession costs, pay for their costumes and help decorate the
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want is someone who understands the idiosyncrasies of
this event and wants to live the part, not just play it," said Tito
Emeterio Dominguez, president of the committee for this year's
procession, the city's 159th.</TE>
<TE>   Limon says he was indeed such a person. While other Mexicans were
taking off for beaches during the national Holy Week, he concentrated
on his training.</TE>
<TE>   Iztapalapa's Jesus gets his strength not only from his soul, but
from his sweat. Limon, usually clad in a suit and tie 60 hours a
week, changed into sweats and a T-shirt to jog and lift weights for
several hours each day. The exercise prepared him to carry a 40-pound
cross for about three miles, remain strapped to the cross for about
30 minutes and climb a grassy knoll for the Crucifixion scene.</TE>
<TE>   Like the others in the major roles of the play, Limon was glad for
the chance. For years, they watched the Easter processions from their
front steps and dreamed of a chance to be Jesus, Judas, Mary or even
Veronica, a bystander who wiped Jesus' face and kept the cloth that
the faithful believe was evidence of his divinity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big role that I have dreamed about since I was a child.
I did everything to do the best I could do," said the 5-foot-9 Limon.
"To me, it's a sacrifice that has a meaning, and it brings me closer
to my religion."</TE>
<TE>   After work, he'd flip through the Bible, the scripts and even
watch movies such as the 1977 "Jesus of Nazareth," starring Robert
Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporating Spanish, Indigenous Traditions</TE>
<TE>   Homero Aridjis, a renowned Mexican author and poet who recently
was a visiting professor at UC Irvine, said Iztapalapa's residents
envelop themselves in the Passion plays because they are brought up
to do so. The plays incorporate Spanish and indigenous traditions and
are uniquely Mexican, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were in Spain, it would be a very serious, upright
production. Here, it takes on an open-air market quality where people
sell food as they watch the processions," he said. "The youth
consider this an honor, and they do whatever it takes. It's a sign of
status and honor."</TE>
<TE>   The community hopes by 2003 to expand on its Easter renown to draw
tourists all year. Its plans include creating a Passion museum,
erecting a huge cross and putting up sculptures of the key biblical
figures.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 people watched the procession on Palm Sunday, a
virtual dress rehearsal for the better-attended events last Thursday
and on Good Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing one of two $500 velvet tunics he bought, Limon confidently
strode through three miles of streets flanked with palms held by
purple-robed "Romans," youngsters who walk the procession barefoot or
wearing sandals.</TE>
<TE>   Limon remained stone-faced as he moved in seeming slow motion with
his hand in the air through a market area scented by onions,
cilantro, oranges and sausage, and toward the gritty neighborhood
church for Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Right behind him was the Virgin Mary, robed in blue velvet. She is
Erika Yasmin Mendez Reyes, the 21-year-old daughter of a fruit vendor
who moonlights as a band singer.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had this as a goal for many years. Some of it is just
because this is a tradition here, but I think she likes the spotlight
like her father," said her mother, Leticia Reyes, as she proudly
followed the procession for two hours.</TE>
<TE>   After paying $300 for her costume, Mendez's biggest fear was how
she might look in front of the whole town with no makeup. Mary
Magdalene was the only character allowed to use any cosmetics, fake
nail tips. Though she was honored to get her role, Karla Vividiana
Hernandez Garcia, a 19-year-old social work student and assistant in
Iztapalapa's parks department, says she has missed her boyfriend
these four months.</TE>
<TE>   She stopped smoking and walked several miles a day to get in
shape. When her mother was hospitalized, she barely had time to care
for her because of the demands of her role, her job and her studies.
She had auditioned to be Veronica, a role her aunt played years ago,
but was elevated to Mary Magdalene.</TE>
<TE>   "What was really hard was not being with my mom and then telling
my boyfriend that we could not see each other for a while," Hernandez
Garcia said. "I told him that this is important because it is our
culture, our tradition. It's for the love of my beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   He Gave Up Partying to Be an Apostle</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Apostle Peter had to beg off a family party where
he would have likely dipped into a bottle of tequila. "My dream to be
in this was important. It's only a few months of sacrifice," said
Gabriel Rueda, the 20-year-old veterinary student and used-car
salesman who plays Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Rueda and others often have family members who have participated
in past years. Brother Joaquin Rueda, a 23-year-old teacher, played
Jesus in 2001, an experience he says changed his life. Like Limon, he
regularly jogged and went to the gym. He walked miles carrying wood
to train for the big day. He was on a tight schedule as he finished
his university studies, held down a full-time job and studied for his
part. In the end, it wasn't the physical training that left its mark,
he says. It was the spiritual exercise that continues to help him
make decisions in life. He says he goes to fewer parties and spends
more time reading the Bible and other books.</TE>
<TE>   Gerardo Granados, who played Jesus in 2000, said that while many
young Mexican adults seem to be distancing themselves from the
church, he has come closer. "We do not have to be Jesus. What we try
to do is follow his teachings. Of course, we are humans and we sin,
but the church tells us that we can be forgiven."</TE>
<TE>   Osvaldo Mendoza, the 1999 Jesus, said his experience led him to
get a better job as a bus driver. Now, when faced with conflict, "I
think more before I act and I act according to what I learned. The
training, the sacrifice that I made, is something that I will never
forget."</TE>

<HD>Today's Preteens Put Their Faith in Folks They Know the
Best</HD>
<DH>Survey* Youths say that they trust their parents, teachers
and local law enforcement more than music celebrities and sports
figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They may swoon for 'N Sync, be slaves to Britney and clamor for
Shaq's autograph, but when it comes to trust, today's preteens don't
stray far from the people they see every day.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10,000 kids responded to an online questionnaire at
www.pbskids.org/zoom  designed to gauge who they looked to for
guidance and support.</LD>
<LD>   The results were not only surprising, but may be reassuring to
families everywhere. They trusted parents, teachers and local law
enforcement over music celebrities and sports stars.</LD>
<TE>   "We can trust the family to have their best interests at heart,"
says Ben Gervey, director at Applied Research and Consulting, which
worked with the PBS series "Zoom" to conduct the survey from November
to January.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and teachers got the biggest thumbs-up, with an 86%
approval rating each. Police scored well, with an 83% on the
trustworthiness scale. Friends received 77%.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the scale, 35% of these kids believed music
celebrities told them the truth, with sports stars dipping to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Gervey's research points to a much more skeptical group of
youngsters "very attuned to the expertise of the speaker," he says.</TE>
<TE>   So depending on the topic, kids will gravitate toward those they
consider knowledgeable in a certain area, trusting peers with issues
related to being a kid or NBA players Vince Carter or Allen Iverson
for recommendations on basketball shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "It really seems to underscore the idea that kids are becoming
much more savvy consumers of the media than ever before," Gervey
says. "They have greater access to information than at any other time
in history, and as a result they've been forced to find ways to sift
through it."</TE>
<TE>   Gervey says he is not surprised at how the kids responded, but he
does see the divide as significant.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust is developed over time, and there's been a real shift in
how children approach the media," he says. "This isn't the '50s.
People have a lot of issues with trust, with all these messages
trying to persuade them to go one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   These results, Gervey says, "signal a loss of naivete, almost as
if kids are being forced to develop a filtering mechanism. It makes
the source of information important to trustworthiness."</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even at 5:29 in the morning, Edwin C. Bearss' voice is booming--full
of passion for the history of our country.</LD>
<LD>   He's off to Mississippi to lead a four-day Smithsonian Institution
tour on Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's successful 1863 campaign to
capture Vicksburg. Then, without a break, it's on to Shiloh, Tenn.,
to lead a three-day Blue and Gray Education Society tour of the
battlefield where more than 13,000 Union and 10,500 Confederate
troops were killed or wounded April 6-7, 1862.</LD>
<LD>   The fast pace is typical for Bearss, chief historian emeritus of
the National Park Service, who loves to walk America's battlefields
and historic sites while delivering dynamic lectures.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like he just had dinner with these people, he brings them so
alive," says a veteran of Bearss' Valley Forge tour. "He talked
nonstop for 12 hours and there wasn't a dull moment."</TE>
<TE>   At 78 Bearss remains energetic and ebullient.</TE>
<TE>   He's doing 40 tours this year for the Smithsonian and other
outfits, some a week long: "Sherman's March to the Sea," "The Road to
Gettysburg," "The Black Hawk War and the Great Sioux Uprising of
1862," "Boston: Cockpit of the Revolution," "Battle of the Little
Bighorn," "Quebec City: A Military History" and others. His tours are
usually sold out within an hour of being posted.</TE>
<TE>   Washington lawyer Bill Vodra remembers Bearss at Gettysburg's
Little Round Top: "His voice carries, and all of a sudden the crowd
tripled as tourists joined us. Jaws were dropping, people recognized
him from the Ken Burns 'Civil War' series. Writer Mike Kernan
described the hillside covered with people [and quoted someone as
saying], 'It was like the Sermon on the Mount.'"</TE>
<TE>   In Quebec City, Vodra recalls Bearss leading a group through an
alley in a driving rain, tracing the route American commander
Benedict Arnold had followed in an unsuccessful 1775 assault.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a national treasure," says Vodra, who has been on more than
70 trips with Bearss. "He's not pedantic and not a showoff. If he
gets something wrong he'll say, "Thank you for correcting me.'"</TE>
<TE>   "First off, I like people," Bearss says in an interview in his
Park Service cubbyhole. "I don't view any of their questions as
foolish. I've never led a tour where I haven't learned something new
myself. And giving a presentation is an emotional experience; it
gives me a high!"</TE>
<TE>   Even indoors, Bearss' voice had a strong, dramatic quality. He
says his first speech half a century ago was a boring flop and he
vowed never to let it happen again.</TE>
<TE>   He masters his material ahead of time, avoids notes, employs a
hearty tone. Outdoors, he strides up and down, gesticulating with a
riding crop and often leading his audience miles across rugged
terrain where events took place.</TE>
<TE>   "I always walk the ground," he said. "It's critical in
understanding what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Bearss was born in Montana and grew up on a ranch, riding
horseback to school. He got hooked on Civil War history in the
seventh grade when his dad introduced him to a biography of Jeb
Stuart, the famous Confederate cavalry officer.</TE>
<TE>   At 18, Bearss joined the Marines and fought in the Pacific in
World War II. He was wounded and spent 26 months in hospitals,
reading history. After receiving degrees from Georgetown and Indiana
universities, he joined the National Park Service at Vicksburg in
1955 as a historian.</TE>
<TE>   There, he discovered the underwater remains of the Union ironclad
Cairo, which became the subject of the first of his 15 books.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* I love America because most people have houses, books, food and
running water.</LD>
<LD>   --Max, 6, home school, Twin Peaks</LD>
<LD>   * I like America because people help each other and they care
about family. America has more food than Mexico. America is a free
country.</LD>
<TE>   --Jesusita, 8,</TE>
<TE>   Badillo Elementary, Covina</TE>
<TE>   * I love America for its freedom. It's lucky for us that we have
food to eat every night. We also have civil rights. We can go to any
church or be any religion. It doesn't matter if you are black or
white. We can also go wherever we want any time. No one can tell us
where to go. This makes me feel free, glad and safe to live in
America.</TE>
<TE>   --Sofia, 8,</TE>
<TE>   Glenoaks Elementary, Glendale</TE>
<TE>   * America is beautiful and free. We have schools, nice houses and
schools for kids who can't see, talk or hear. We don't have slavery.
We have hospitals open 24/7. It's clean, we have good food and we
help the poor.</TE>
<TE>   --Jesse,</TE>
<TE>   Grant Elementary, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   * America means sharing to me. My family and I share the TV. When
I play with my friends we sometimes share jump ropes. America also
means teamwork. My family and I work together when there's a problem.
That way the problem always gets fixed.</TE>
<TE>   --Anna, 8,</TE>
<TE>   Clover Avenue Elementary, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   * What I love about America is that we have freedom. We can do
anything we want, but you have to follow the laws. We also have the
best governors and presidents and teachers. Our newspapers give us
information that we need.</TE>
<TE>   --Gina, 8,</TE>
<TE>   St. Joan of Arc Elementary, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   * America has nice woods. I went backpacking in Sequoia National

<LD>"Chester Cricket's Pigeon Ride"</LD>
<LD>   by George Selden</LD>
<LD>   This book is an exciting adventure of a cricket named Chester who
lives in a drainpipe in New York City with a mouse called Tucker and
a cat named Harry.</LD>
<TE>   One night Chester goes to Bryant Park, where he meets a pigeon
named Lulu. The pigeon takes Chester on a ride to see the Empire
State Building, Central Park and the Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   I recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure stories.</TE>

<TE>   "The Stinky Cheese Man and</TE>
<TE>   Other Fairly Stupid Tales"</TE>
<TE>   by Jon Scieszka</TE>
<TE>   This is a book about fairy tales, or so you think. If you know the
fairy tales of "Chicken Little," "The Princess and the Pea," "The
Ugly Duckling," "The Frog Prince," "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Jack
and the Beanstalk," then you will have fun reading this.</TE>
<TE>   The book makes fun of fairy tales. You will want to know what
happens in "Chicken Licken," "The Princess and the Bowling Ball" and
"The Really Ugly Duckling."</TE>

<TE>   "Kristi Yamaguchi: Triumph on Ice"</TE>
<TE>   by Andrews McMeel Publishing</TE>
<TE>   This book tells how Kristi Yamaguchi skated well enough to win the
gold medal in figure skating at the 1992 Olympics. I liked the book
because it told how much Kristi practiced. I decided to practice
more. I liked this book and so will other young skaters.</TE>

<HD>He Said, He Said: A Lifetime of Low-Key Male Bonding</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle* No tribal rituals here, just a group of men who
sought a safe place to express themselves. Thirty years later,
they're still talking--and listening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERTO LOIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THETIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine of us sit in a circle, talking about the life transition faced
by Irv, whose wife died recently after a long illness. He finds
himself a widower now, after more than a half-century of marriage.</LD>
<LD>   A 78-year-old dentist, Irv Newmark is tall, white-bearded,
balding. He looks like the archetypal grandpa and has had more than
his share of woes, including the death of a daughter. He cries
easily, which he claims keeps him healthy. What also keeps him
healthy is this men's group, which has been in continuous existence
for 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Since we have no leader and almost no rules, anyone can kick it
off. Joel Satzman, 66, a retired orthopedic surgeon, asks: "So how're
you doing?"</LD>
<TE>   Irv shrugs. "There are moments of sadness. You know. Look, I'm
doing as well as could be expected."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Stambul, 55, a lawyer, asks Irv the question we often pose
when somebody exposes a wound: "What do you need from us?"</TE>
<TE>   "You're doing it. Letting me talk and having you listen." Irv's
eyes well up. "We had our problems, you guys know. What I remember
now is the good times. It was so hard for her these last few months.
Look, it's a relief. Her suffering's finally over."</TE>
<TE>   Each of us provides Irv with his own brand of solace, but there
are no conventional mourners' platitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to have to learn how to be alone," Rick says.</TE>
<TE>   "I know. I'm already learning."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Satzman, 61, a lawyer and the person who got me into the
group four years ago, says, "Learning how to be alone ... what does
that look like?"</TE>
<TE>   "You know," Irv says, "making sure the laundry gets done, taking
care of my own food .... "</TE>
<TE>   "Well, OK," says Richard. "First thing you're going to have to
learn is how to boil water."</TE>
<TE>   Irv's lack of domestic skills is constant fodder for Richard's
jokes, and ribbing each other helps us get through the tough times.
But Richard's comment also points to something deeper, which we often
talk about. Irv's attitudes were shaped by the Depression, Richard's
by women's liberation. It's no surprise that they have different
ideas of what the male role should be.</TE>
<TE>   The male role, and the changing dynamic between men and women,
were central topics in 1972, when consciousness-raising groups
sprouted like wildflowers. So several men--mostly lawyers, doctors
and therapists--created a forum where they could be open with each
other about these and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Thus our men's group was formed.</TE>
<TE>   "Male alienation, that was the starting point," says Herb Eveloff,
72, a psychiatrist. "Men are taught that we have to be strong and
keep things inside. Men are ashamed to admit that they even have
problems. Women are good at it, but not men. When there's a problem,
men always want to fix it. It's hard for us just to listen, but
that's what the group is about--listening."</TE>
<TE>   What generated the group, and what has kept it going, is that it
speaks to a deep longing for a place where you can meet with the same
bunch of guys, time after time, and say anything, anything at all. A
place where you can let out your feelings, and others listen without
judgment. For the men who founded the group, as with most people,
this need was not necessarily filled by friends, family, or even
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says Richard, "in our daily lives we go around keeping up
appearances. We present a certain face to the world. We're fathers,
husbands, professionals. Whatever vulnerable stuff lurks inside, we
keep it hidden. The group has given us a chance to reveal that part
of ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The group's roster has changed little over the years, but a few
have left, and others have taken their place. Within the past 10
years, two longtime members died: Mel Albaum, a lawyer, and Al
Bauman, a therapist. And Curt Batiste--the one most responsible for
starting the group--suffered a devastating stroke. Curt, 68, keeps
coming to meetings: a silent, childlike shadow of the brilliant
psychiatrist he once was. With two deaths and a stroke, the group has
lost three key people. Yet it goes on. There have been only two
additions. I'm the newest, and Rick joined 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   We meet every other Thursday night, like clockwork. Twice a year
we go out of town for a weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On these retreats we don't beat drums or invoke ancient male
rituals. No. We sit in a hotel room, eat at restaurants, sleep in
comfortable beds. But like the men around the campfire, we deal with
important matters: how the past is prelude to the present, how to
live a more conscious life, how to come to grips with our daily
reality.</TE>
<TE>   I choose to talk about my older son, who's 27 now, 34 years
younger than I am. A few years ago he graduated from Harvard, and now
he's working for a nonprofit agency, doing community organizing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's saving the world," I say sarcastically, "one block at a
time."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Penrose, a psychologist for more than 50 years, says: "What
would you like to see him doing?"</TE>
<TE>   I say that I wish he would become an academic. It's hard for me to
hide my disappointment about the choices my son has made.</TE>
<TE>   Joel--bearded, with a soft voice--puts his palms together, tips of
his forefingers at his lips.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't really about your son, is it?"</TE>
<TE>   I feel the intensity level rise and remind myself that the point
is not to look good, but to try to find what's real.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has something to say as we all try to get at what my
disappointment is really about. When we go through these
explorations, it's like an archeological dig--finding old bones,
sifting through layers of memory and feeling, then seeing how the
past helps us to make sense of the present.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after prodding and guidance from the others, I understand
that it's not about my son. It's about me. It's about the ambivalence
I feel about the choice I made not to become an academic when I was
my son's age.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it is with us. When we talk about our concern for
our children or the ups and downs with the women in our lives,
someone always points out that it's not about them, it's about us:
how we--as men, husbands and fathers--can understand and deal with
our world.</TE>
<TE>   During the weekend, each of us gets a chance to talk about his own
concerns. Fred, who's 80, describes the aging process he's going
through: physical weakness, memory lapses, loss of balance, brittle
bones.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting old sucks," he concludes.</TE>
<TE>   From old age we go to the next step--death. Rick, the youngest in
the group, suggests: "What would each of you like to see written on
your tombstone?"</TE>
<TE>   Richard, as expected, is funny: "My tombstone? 'Just once he would
have liked to have been called for goal-tending.'" Joel--Richard's
older brother--gives us his: "He was just a cork on the sea of life."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Rick says to Joel, "that really gets to the Buddha-nature
you aspire to, doesn't it? Accepting whatever comes, floating with
life's changes."</TE>
<TE>   Richard has a different view. "You'd better hope," he says to his
brother, "that the stonecutter doesn't put a 'd' instead of a 'c.'"</TE>
<TE>   It takes us a moment, then we realize: "He was just a dork on the
sea of life."</TE>
<TE>   Richard often makes fun of Joel, and sometimes they argue, but we
know how much strength they give to each other.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Richard and Joel is what the group as a
whole is about. We get angry with one another. We poke at one another
with sarcasm. But at the end of the day, our love for one another is
never in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   We turn our attention to Walter King, a retired lawyer, who is
fearful about an angiogram he will undergo the following day. He
brought his medical records. Given Walter's age (73) and poor
physical condition, the doctors in the group are concerned that the
angiogram could end up a multiple bypass.</TE>
<TE>   Walter--perhaps feeling that this will be his last chance to
address the others if things do not go well at the hospital--talks to
each of us, telling us what each person means to him. A couple of men
in the group have serious illnesses, and none of us is getting any
younger. As Walter gives us his benediction, the unspoken thought is:
This could be the last men's group weekend for any one of us.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, after a meeting during which we spent most of the
evening talking about health issues, Joel said: "I liked this group
better when we talked about our love affairs." When I remind Joel of
that now, he says that he was being facetious. He loved the group
years ago, and he loves it now.</TE>
<TE>   "The group has gone through all the stages of life," says Joel.
"Like in Asian religions, where you go from disciple to householder,
with all the desires of each stage, and finally, at the last stage,
you become spiritual. That's where we're at now. A great pleasure for
me has been to see this group go through the whole rich tapestry of
life."</TE>
<TE>   When Joel says this, I think of Hesse's Siddhartha, who listens to
the river and hears all the sounds of his entire life--the pleasure
and pain, the laughter and tears, all of it as a single sound.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when I'm with the group, I hear that sound too: all of
life, the joy and sorrow, as if all past years of shared history had
merged into a timeless present. Maybe, in the end, after all the
questions and advice, after all the laughter, what the group is left
with is something beyond words--the simple act of having been
together year after year, for practically a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   That is the sound of the men's group, and it's more than enough.</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: Walter went in for an angiogram, and no surgery was
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Irv is learning how to boil water.</TE>
<TE>   And in the days after the weekend, Fred made a collage: the heads
of nine men floating on a blue, wavy background. He calls it, "Corks
and Dorks on the Sea of Life."</TE>

<HD>Saddam's Strength as a Novelist? It Would Have to Be His
Plots</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BBC News item: Two novels soon to be published in Iraq are thought to
have been penned by President Saddam Hussein. Newspapers in Baghdad
did not mention him by name but hinted the two books were his work.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed Saddam Hussein has published two novels already.
These books were released with the credit "A novel by its author."
The two books now causing a ripple of excitement go under the same
pseudonym, according to the official Iraqi news agency INA, but no
other details have been released.</LD>
<LD>   Attempts to reach Hussein to get to the bottom of these reports
were unsuccessful, so here's our best guess at the substance of the
works, and a look at his other forays into creative self-expression.</LD>
<TE>   Novel 1</TE>
<TE>   "Hussein Humiliates Bush: A Historical Novel"</TE>
<TE>   Author's note from book jacket: "I don't think of myself so much
as a writer, but as a literary medium. I feel the characters within
me and just write what they tell me. That is, until a character tries
to say or do something I don't like. Then, I kill him. Without mercy.
Without hesitation."</TE>
<TE>   Synopsis: It's 1991 and the humble Iraqi leader is, as always,
busy caring for his people. New roads, new hospitals, new weapons of
mass destruction. Nothing is too good for his people. In fact,
Saddam's people are his weakness. He simply cares too much.</TE>
<TE>   Then, George Herbert Walker Bush and his greedy American hordes
invade his country. They want oil. The world cowers before the
Americans, even Saddam's beloved people are afraid, but the desert
strongman stands up to Bush and says, "No, you cannot have my
people's oil. At least not for less than $30 a barrel." The great
Saddam tricks the blundering Americans into overrunning 90% of Iraq
in less than 72 hours. Saddam signs a "surrender" and watches the
greedy Americans pack up and leave. Saddam triumphs again!</TE>
<TE>   Novel 2</TE>
<TE>   "Hussein Humiliates the Son of Bush"</TE>
<TE>   Synopsis: In late 2002, Saddam's charitable works for his
impoverished people are again interrupted by the pesky American
hordes hellbent on revenge. Having humiliated the elder Bush, Saddam
now faces the son of Bush. But again, Saddam outsmarts the American
cowboys. He hoodwinks them into bombing his country into the Stone
Age and turning Baghdad "into a multi-decker parking lot." And just
when the enemy thinks it has won, Saddam throws an old-fashioned
Texas BBQ Surrender Party, signs the papers and watches the Americans
head back home in another humiliating defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Poetry</TE>
<TE>   "A Line in the Sand--The Collected Poems of Saddam Hussein"</TE>
<TE>   The dictator bares his soul. We soon forget about Saddam, the man
working feverishly to build a 10-megaton nuclear device capable of
being detonated inside an attache case, and instead long to be close
to the vulnerable human beneath the bullets.</TE>
<TE>   The title poem is a forbidding and sophisticated cry for peace and
international brotherhood:</TE>
<TE>   Here is my line in the sand</TE>
<TE>   Cross it</TE>
<TE>   And I'll kill you</TE>
<TE>   And your family</TE>
<TE>   And everyone you and they</TE>
<TE>   have ever met or spoken to</TE>
<TE>   or e-mailed.</TE>
<TE>   I'll dig up all your relatives</TE>
<TE>   And kill them again too.</TE>
<TE>   You better believe it, buster.</TE>
<TE>   Saddam's Other Works</TE>
<TE>   * Watercolors by Saddam: An amazing study of light and composition
called "Anthrax Dawn."</TE>
<TE>   * Children's book: "Saddam I Am," in which a cuddly Saddam teaches
kids to read while never questioning a state-approved author's intent
or content.</TE>
<TE>   * Pop song: "I'm Not a Goblin, Not Yet the Devil." Saddam answers
his critics head-on with this tender coming-of-age ballad.</TE>
<TE>   * Saddam's Home Catalog: The dictator's boot isn't the only thing
that leaves an impression. Wait until you see his fabulous new home
designs that are sure to brighten any hut or hide-out.</TE>

<LD>The star attraction of "An Unforgettable Evening" was Elton John. But
it was the spirit of Renette Ezralow that left the deepest imprint on
Tuesday's benefit for Research for Women's Cancers, which raised $1.7
million for programs at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   When Ezralow co-founded the group six years ago, she was already
waging a battle with ovarian cancer. For 13 years, she and her family
quietly faced her illness with dignity and valor until her death Jan.
12. For her many contributions, Ezralow was honored posthumously with
the annual Woman of Courage Award at Tuesday's event.</LD>
<LD>   Natalie Cole--whose family signature tune, "Unforgettable,"
inspired the title of the benefit--presented the award to Ezralow's
husband, Marshall. "Throughout her illness," he said, "Renette never
stopped helping others," as was revealed in a poignant video tribute
created by Bonnie Bruckheimer, the group's national spokesperson.</LD>
<TE>   For his dedication to AIDS prevention and education, Elton John
received the Courage Award from Cedars-Sinai and Saks Fifth Avenue,
sponsors of the event. "What Elton has done for the platform shoe,
sequin and eyeglass industries is only a fraction of what he has done
for the well-being of men and women all around the country," Tom
Hanks said in his tribute to the entertainer. In acknowledging the
award, John said, "I've always devoted myself to AIDS, but because of
the epidemic of breast and ovarian cancer, I will commit myself to
help finding a cure. I will always be there for you."</TE>
<TE>   Along with Hanks, Rita Wilson, Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg
served as honorary co-chairs of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Event chairwomen included Anne Douglas, Marion Laurie, Kelly
Chapman Meyer, Sandra Krause, Margie Petersen and Jamie Tisch. Dennis
Miller emceed the evening, which featured rock musician John
Mellencamp backed by a gospel choir. In the crowd were Saks execs R.
Brad Martin, Lori Rhodes, Michael Macko and Tom Voltin; Linda and
David Foster, Paula Kent Meehan, Jolene and George Schlatter, Lilly
Tartikoff, Betty and Fred Hayman, Lisa Kudrow, Fran Drescher and
Dominique Swain.</TE>

<TE>   The style-conscious Fashion Institute of Design and
Merchandising's annual benefit, which fell on the night before the
Oscars, was held at the Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hangar. "There
wasn't a hotel ballroom that wasn't booked for Oscar weekend," said
Jim Watterson, who has been producing the "L.A. Fashion Gala" for 20
years. More than 750 packed the house for the March 23 show
showcasing FIDM students graduating in Theater Costume and the
Fashion Design Advanced Study programs.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's irrepressible booster and honorary mayor, Johnny
Grant, emceed the event, which raised more than $125,000 for FIDM
scholarships. The doings started with a cocktail reception followed
by a Renaissance-catered dinner and a fast-paced parade of FIDM
creations interspersed with costumes by this year's Academy Award
contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Oscar-nominated costumes on view was Harry Potter's,
worn by a thrilled 9-year-old, Kirk Bucy. An ardent Potter fan, Kirk
has recently been treated for Ewing's sarcoma. When Watterson heard
about Kirk (his mother, Marcy Bucy, is the receptionist at FIDM) he
instantly cast him as Harry. "He is so excited," said his mom.
"That's all he has talked about since he found out."</TE>
<TE>   Others attending included film designers Jim Acheson, Judianna
Makovsky, Michael Kaplan and Sophie de Rakoff Carbonell; FIDM
president Tonian Hohlberg; congressmen Ken Calvert, David Dreier and
Howard "Buck" McKeon; and USO exec Elaine Rogers. Also, Maureen
O'Hara, Robert Amonic, Michael Novarese, George Martin, Barbara Beno,
Francine Bardo, Lonnie and Karen Kane, Craig Israel, John Martens and
Stuart Kaplan, a weary Beverly Hills dermatologist, who said he had
worked into the wee hours the night before, dispensing Botox and
collagen treatments to Oscar-goers.</TE>

<TE>   Aerialists and acrobats with iL Circo entertained the 700 guests
who attended a dinner benefit netting $250,000 for St. Jude Medical
Center of Fullerton's endoscopy center for the prevention and
treatment of colon cancer.</TE>
<TE>   During the gala at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, it was
announced that Russell and Mildred Knott of Fullerton had pledged
$1.3 million to the endoscopy center. When the center opens at the
end of the year, it will be called the Knott Family Endoscopy Center,
announced Robert J. Fraschetti, president and chief executive officer
of St. Jude Medical Center. "To say that we are grateful is
insufficient," he said. "This truly amazing gift will help St. Jude
remain at the forefront of medicine."</TE>
<TE>   Julianne Haynes was chairwoman of the March 23 benefit
co-sponsored by St. Jude and its Damas de Caridad support group.
Guests included Christine Fraschetti, Joseph and Joanna Lawton, Walda
Anderson, Bill and Pat Lenahan, Bob and Marilyn Clark and Al Crosson.</TE>

Children's Hospital of Orange County celebrated the 40th anniversary
of a benefit fashion show that, during those years, has raised nearly
$4 million for the facility's outpatient clinic and Kids Care Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruby Reflections," which included luncheon and dinner shows on
March 21 at the Anaheim Marriott, drew 1,500 guests and netted
$175,000. Susan Carter and Beverly Singer were co-chairwomen.</TE>
<TE>   "The guilds have become the bedrock of our financial support,"
said Helen Wardner, senior development director at CHOC. Since the
guilds were founded 40 years ago, members have helped raise more than
$20 million for the Orange-based hospital.</TE>

<LD>Allison's heart thudded when her teacher, Mrs. Arden, announced that
the class was going to do a spring pageant. The children would be
flowers and trees and bugs and other creatures. Best of all, there
would be a fairy princess.</LD>
<LD>   The princess would wear a spangly dress and a sparkly crown. She
was to carry a magic wand that would bring the flowers to life. More
than anything in the world, Allison yearned to play the part of the
princess. On the day the parts were announced, she closed her eyes
and waited for Mrs. Arden to say her name.</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Arden began, "The part of the fairy princess will be played
by--"</LD>
<TE>   She stopped and looked at the class.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, please, please," Allison thought silently, "pick me."</TE>
<TE>   "By Jill," Mrs. Arden said.</TE>
<TE>   Allison slumped in her seat.</TE>
<TE>   Jill had pretty curls and big eyes. She could sing and dance.</TE>
<TE>   Allison had straight hair and ordinary eyes. She couldn't sing,
and she tripped over her own feet.</TE>
<TE>   She knew Jill would be a good princess. But maybe Allison could be
a lovely flower. She straightened up to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "Kate will be Rose," Mrs. Arden said. "Emily will be Daffodil.
David will be Spider. Ted will be Beetle."</TE>
<TE>   She went all the way down the list. Finally she said, "Allison
will be Toad."</TE>
<TE>   Toad! Nevermind that Toad was the one who saved the flowers from
the spiders and beetles. Nobody wanted to be a toad!</TE>
<TE>   But Allison's mom made her a bright silver costume with glittery
eyes and huge purple warts on the back. Allison practiced speaking
her lines in a croaking, toady voice that made everybody laugh.</TE>
<TE>   She liked hearing them laugh. In fact, she liked it so much that
she learned to hop around on all fours like a toad.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the pageant, the audience laughed and clapped
every time Toad came on stage. Allison won an award for being the
best actress.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be really nice to be a princess," she told her mom and
dad on the way home. "But I had fun being the very best toad I could
be."</TE>

<TE>   Lael Littke was never chosen to be the princess in a school play,
but she did get to be the author of books for kids, which she thinks
is much more fun. Her newest book is "Lake of Secrets," Henry Holt &amp;
Co. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>It's Strictly Secular</HD>
<DH>Bush's frequent use of the word "evil" has little to do
with his Christianity. Rather, it's a word that evokes something
real.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLOTTE ALLEN</AU>
<BD>Charlotte Allen is the author of "The Human Christ: The
Search for the Historical Jesus."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of
evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world." That was President
Bush in his State of the Union address in January, daring to point
out that something should be done about the arsenals of mass
destruction currently piling up in Iran, Iraq and North Korea before
we have, say, another anthrax scare or Sept. 11 massacre. Naturally,
our oh-so-sophisticated European friends couldn't wait to ridicule
Bush's characterization of these rogue states as "evil" as yet
another example of American moral "simplisme," to paraphrase French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine--he of the land whose recent Winter
Olympic Games pairs figure-skating judge admitted that she threw her
vote under pressure.</LD>
<LD>   But the oddest of all the takes on Bush's choice of words was the
church-and-state critique leveled by many media pundits. The idea was
that by using the word "evil," Bush was inappropriately injecting
religious discourse, specifically the discourse of Christianity, into
political matters that are supposed to be strictly secular--just as
he had presumably done when he declared during his presidential
campaign that Jesus Christ was his favorite political philosopher.
Here, for example, is an interpretation of "axis of evil" from Robert
Wright of the online magazine Slate:</LD>
<TE>   "It means Bush is on a mission from God ....It wouldn't surprise
me if he thinks that part of his mission is to teach a Godless
society about moral absolutes--to re-inject the words 'good' and
'evil' into serious discourse. And, of course, if you take the word
'evil' really seriously, the 'axis' part follows; the various
manifestations of evil are inherently coordinated, since they all
have the same source. Iran and Iraq may hate each other, but they're
both on Satan's team."</TE>
<TE>   For the likes of Wright, Bush has taken in too many Sunday sermons
at the Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, where he
found his savior in a midlife born-again conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of Bush's conservative admirers have been eager to find
hidden religious references in both his State of the Union address
and his statement on Sept. 11: "Today, our nation saw evil." James W.
Ceaser, politics professor at the University of Virginia, analyzes
Bush's words in the current issue of The Weekly Standard: "George
Bush has been influenced to his core by his encounter with the
Bible." And, yes, it would be difficult to be a regular churchgoer
reciting the Lord's Prayer ("deliver us from evil") and pondering the
Scriptures ("because the days are evil") without being influenced by
both the language and the mental categories of Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, it is fairly clear that Bush's use of the word "evil"
in these two contexts was not an effort, conscious or unconscious, to
bring theology to bear on matters of national security. The phrase
"axis of evil" (by all reputed accounts, a coinage not of Bush
himself but of his former speechwriter, David Frum), far from
alluding to any passage of the Bible, seems clearly lifted, chapter
and verse, from the Gospel According to Ronald Reagan, who almost
never went to church. Remember "the evil empire"? And, of course, the
word "axis" evokes the Nazi-led trio of nations that slaughtered
millions during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his speechwriters selected the phrase "evil axis"
because, first and foremost, it is rhetorically powerful, evoking the
charnel houses that tyrannies of the right and left made of entire
nations during the 20th century. During those regimes' years of
terror, every day was Sept. 11 for members of disfavored religions,
ethnic groups and political affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil" is a word that works, and not just for politicians and
their speechwriters. Look it up in a quotation dictionary. You will
discover that one of the most frequent literary sources for the word,
after the Bible, is likely to be from William Shakespeare, master of
rhetorical effect on the stage: "The evil that men do lives after
them;" "Sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, When evils
are most free?"</TE>
<TE>   This suggests something further: The word "evil" works in the
public mind because it evokes something real, and
everybody--everybody except a handful of pundits, that is--knows it
is real. Hence, the spellbinding power and runaway audience success
of "The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring," a movie that has
no overt religious content but is precisely about a struggle of good
against evil, evil in all its grasping, corrupting murderousness.
Because we know perfectly well that people have the capacity to
create living hells for other people, we don't hesitate to use the
word "evil" when it is appropriate, even in our presumably "godless"
society. The Holocaust wasn't evil? The mass murders of Sept. 11--of
children and rugby players and restaurant workers--weren't evil?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's "simplistic" to think so, and maybe it's an effort to
inject moral absolutes where they don't belong, but "evil" does
happen to be the word that springs to mind. And if you should believe
in Satan, you might logically attribute some of the mayhem to his
fiendish cunning.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Bush and Reagan are hardly the only recent
presidents to have used the word "evil" where it seemed highly
appropriate. Former President Bill Clinton, for example, used the
word in connection with the 1994 shooting of an Israeli soldier by
Hamas militants, the 1998 murder of gay college student Matthew
Shepard in an hate spree, the fatal pipe bombing during the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ga., and the Oklahoma City federal-building
bombing of 1995. Few deemed the word overly judgmental.</TE>
<TE>   At a dinner in 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore, referring to a
number of mass shootings, declared, "My religious tradition says evil
has always been with us, and we need to meet evil with good." This
was explicitly Christian language, yet no one accused Gore of
"incoherence," as Wright did in his Slate essay on Bush.</TE>
<TE>   As for the contents of Bush's "evil axis" reference in his State
of the Union address, it is conceivably possible to accuse him of
overstatement. Conceivably possible, at least in the case of
starving, doddering North Korea, but only if you don't take the
possession of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons seriously,
which is impossible to do after last fall. A recent article in The
New Yorker by Jeffrey Goldberg details Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's genocidal war against his country's millions of Kurds in
the north, marked by deliberate starvation, inhumanly crowded and
filthy concentration camps, and poison gas that causes death,
blinding and cancer. If that's not evil, what is?</TE>
<TE>   Bush is unabashedly religious, and as such, he is like many
Americans shaken by the events of recent months. There is no doubt
that his Christian faith, including the Christian delineation of a
clear line between right and wrong, informs his thinking. Such
forthright faith, at this difficult time of war and looming war,
obviously strikes many Americans as a good thing; the president's
popularity ratings continue to soar.</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, just as crudely simplistic to attribute his every
reference to "evil" to a caricature of Christianity as it would be if
Bush himself were a caricature of Christianity "on a mission from
God." Evil, alas, is real, and it is sadly with us.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Not for 40 years has a U.S. president visited Yosemite National Park.
The last one to do so was John F. Kennedy, who, in a sign of the
times, dropped in between dedicating two Western dams. So, when it
seemed last year that President Bush would be the first in four
decades to visit Yosemite, the valley was atwitter with preparation
and advance scouting by Secret Service teams. When Bush changed his
itinerary, park officials weren't too disappointed, because the first
lady came instead.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Bush's visit, it turned out, was purely recreational--an
outdoor outing for the first lady and a handful of pals known in this
administration as "the MGs," for the "Midland Girls," a circle of
friends from back home in West Texas. Reports are that the women so
enjoyed their backpacking trek across the High Sierra that they made
their National Park Service interpretive guide "an honorary MG."</LD>
<LD>   National Park Service Supt. David A. Mihalic is not unduly upset
that the 40-year streak remains unbroken. "If the president finds
time to come out here, I think that's great," Mihalic said in an
interview. "His wife has been here. As an educator, I think she got a
lot out of it."</LD>
<TE>   While brought on board to facilitate the Yosemite Valley Plan to
limit traffic congestion, Mihalic seems to have a different mission.
The Bush administration, it seems, is trying to make national parks
as accessible as possible, gridlock or not. In part, this is because
surveys indicate that, in these times of slow economic growth and
terrorist scares, national parks are among the safest places in which
to vacation.</TE>
<TE>   But the general public's visits to Yosemite have been trending
downward the last five years. Since peaking at 4.2 million visitors
in 1996, annual visitation dropped to some 3.5 million park attendees
in 2001. A couple of factors may have been at work. In January 1997,
a big flood washed away some of the park's capacity to accommodate
overnighters. Second, 1996 was the year that park authorities
attracted widespread news coverage for temporarily bringing down the
gates and denying cars entrance. Since then, Californians may have
steered clear of the park because of a misconception that getting
turned away actually occurs more frequently than it does. In fact,
Memorial Day weekend in May 1996 was the last time it happened.</TE>
<TE>   After the flood, as parties worked on the Yosemite Valley Plan for
future park management, talk surfaced of requiring a day-use
reservation system to regulate traffic flow in the Valley. That
notion faded, however, as feedback indicated that the public feared
it might restrict access to all but the well-heeled overnight hotel
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile congestion in the seven-mile-long Yosemite Valley is
still a big concern, most notably during the height of the travel
season. Park spokesman Scott Gediman says that 95% of park visitors
are destined for its picturesque valley. Conversely, the popular
Yosemite Valley comprises just 5% of the park's entire acreage.
Authorities figure if they can get more visitors to leave their
vehicles on the park's fringes and head into the valley on shuttle
buses, they've got a big part of the overcrowding problem licked.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, park service folk are supposed to be above worrying
about head counts at the gate. "We are not in the business of
encouraging or discouraging visitation, just providing the quality
visitor experience," says Gediman. But dramatic drops can be a source
of consternation for the corporation that runs park concessions, the
surrounding "gateway" communities and others who depend upon the
trickle-down economy of Yosemite tourism. GOP Rep. George Radanovich,
who grew up in the region and often complains about the shortage of
parking spaces and campgrounds in the Valley, is merely giving voice
to his constituents when he makes a big stink about it.</TE>
<TE>   As for Mihalic, he clearly wants to get the word out that Yosemite
is open for business, particularly in the post-Sept. 11 climate.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing a group of journalists in January, Mihalic extolled the
park as a getaway destination, pointing out that Los Angelenos "don't
have to go through airport security to get here....We're just a
six-hour drive away.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in turning people away, even if there's
gridlock." Mihalic went on to say. "I will go out on a limb and say I
do not see a day when cars will be turned away."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks suggested a move away from preventing gridlock to an
open-armed invitation to visit the park, come what may. "We are
trying to make a visit to this place an easy thing to do," Mihalic
says. "I wouldn't be surprised if the visitation went up."</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by the Clinton administration in 1999, Mihalic is
nothing if not a survivor. "The new administration pretty much wants
this place to stay the same year after year after year, so that you
would not come back and say, 'Gee, we're disappointed.' I think it
will be a sad day if we can't take in the family that says, 'Kids,
we're going to Yosemite!'" Mihalic says.</TE>
<TE>   As for a visit by President Bush, Mihalic says, "Whether the
president comes to Yosemite or not is really not as important as
whether he understands what the park does for the American people."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the 40-year streak holds, and Yosemite lure, lore
and legend continue to grow. To this day, stories are still shared of
Kennedy's visit and how, from time to time, in the second-floor
Ahwahnee Hotel suite in which he slept, a chair is occasionally seen
rocking with no one in it. On windless days, no less. As presidential
visits go, perhaps that will have to do for now.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hollywood's getting serious, but it isn't Sept. 11 that's
responsible. The entertainment industry has identified the real
threat to its continued existence--Silicon Valley. Alarmed by the
rise in pirated DVDs and CDs, Hollywood and the record companies have
stepped up their efforts to push Congress to pass legislation
extending the protection of intellectual-property rights. Lawmakers
have held several hearings on digital copyright protection, and, at
the urging of the industry, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) has
introduced a sweeping bill called the Consumer Broadband and Digital
Television Promotion Act. If the legislation passes, Silicon Valley
would have a year to come up with measures to solve the copyright
problem. Short of that, the bill could even lead to new electronic
computer products containing software that would alert a government
regulatory agency to a user's attempt to violate copyright rules. The
aim is give the entertainment industry virtual control over the
digital domain.</LD>
<TE>   But technological change is not a zero-sum game. Instead of trying
to restrict consumer rights, the entertainment industry should create
a new business model that works with--not against--technology. If
copyright protection is expanded, technological change will be
slowed, and consumers will be the big losers. Not only does creating
a government agency that would electronically monitor consumer
behavior have unpleasant overtones of Big Brother, but it would also
cripple Silicon Valley's ability to put out new, innovative
technologies. Congress should be in the business not of trying to
slow the digital highway but of lifting speed limits.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes that the entertainment industry is in the
doldrums. Over the past two years, sales of music CDs have plummeted
by as much as 10%, depending on the numbers you're looking at. At the
recent South by Southwest Music Conference, pop-music industry's
biggest annual conclave, keynote speaker Robbie Robertson of The Band
said the dominant emotion is "doom and gloom." British music giant
EMI Group has announced plans to cut about 20% of its work force and
release 400 of its 1,500 artists. Sony, Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG)
and Warner Music Group have also had lousy sales.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood fears a similar financial fate awaits it. Jack Valenti,
head of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, recently declared in the
Wall Street Journal that, "With what velocity will this avalanche of
thievery roar when broadband is more widely used?"</TE>
<TE>   But are technology and the Internet solely to blame for the
industry's woes? No one forced EMI to give singer Mariah Carey an
$80-million music package that it has had to eat. With sales
plummeting, it's also hard to justify the tens of millions of dollars
in compensation that record executives have grown accustomed to. The
ripping and burning of CDs from the Internet--about 3.6 billion songs
are illegally downloaded a month, according to the Recording Industry
Assn. Of America--may well cut into sales, but no one knows exactly
by how much. Anyway, there is no hard evidence that those doing the
ripping and burning would actually have bought the originals if they
weren't available cost-free on the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Such uncertainty hasn't deterred the industry from seeking
copyright protections that may violate the rights of consumers to use
a product noncommercially as they see fit. The U.S. Supreme Court has
found that within the private sphere, no harm is done when a
consumer, say, records a movie in the morning and then watches it in
the evening. Furthermore, the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act
specifically says that consumers have the right to copy material for
their own use.</TE>
<TE>   But the entertainment industry wants to criminalize all CD
copying, as well as digital broadcasts. Already, it has started to
encode some CDs to block copying--at a cost to consumer satisfaction.
The encoded CDs sometimes skip or can't be played in normal CD
machines, and listeners, in blind tests, have noted that their sound
quality is inferior to regular CDs. This is perverse. One reason to
buy CDs is that the sound quality isn't supposed to be degraded, as
it is with MP3 versions.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental problem in all this is Hollywood's desire to
maintain complete control and to make ever greater profits. As Joe
Kraus, co-founder of the Internet portal Excite and of
Digitalconsumer.org, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
earlier this month, "[The industry's] goal is to create a legal
system that denies consumers their personal-use rights and then
charge those consumers additional fees to recoup them."</TE>
<TE>   If Hollywood and the music industry get what they want, consumers'
incentive to upgrade their technology might be weakened, a
development with obvious economic implications. Their old personal
computers or DVD players that are free of controls might be
preferable. Hollywood's hardball tactics have already slowed the
spread of broadband access because the stream of movies it promised a
few years ago has been, at best, a slow trickle. High-definition
television may look sharper in your local audio-video store, but why
pay a premium for an HDTV-ready set when the distribution system is
such a mess?</TE>
<TE>   Nor can the industry be trusted when it gets what it wants. In
1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
created new safeguards for the industry and eroded some consumer
rights. The industry claimed that the legislation would allow it to
start pumping out high-quality digital wares. Fearful of unauthorized
copying, it has not followed through. The new Direct TV satellite
system may end up containing tuners with devices that downgrade
picture definition, which was not the point of buying a more
expensive television set capable of receiving higher-frequency
signals. The industry is insisting on the device because any copy
made by a product containing it would be worth less. The rationale is
that the higher the retained definition of the medium, the more
valuable it is.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has played Chicken Little in the face of technological
change before. Two decades ago, Valenti decried the VCR as a mortal
threat to the movie industry. Now, video licensing fees make up a big
percentage of the film industry's profits. And when the CD was
introduced in the early 1980s, the recording companies immediately
jacked up prices. Barry Willis, an editor at Stereophile magazine,
notes that the movie industry has always predicted doom whenever a
new technology emerged: Television and even drive-in movies were said
to be dangerous, because "somewhere, someone might be able to watch
for free."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stand in the way of technological progress and
consumer satisfaction, industry executives should start working to
build an online distribution system that consumers can pay for.
Clearly, some safeguards for entertainment material that can be
commercially copied are in order. But right now, the industry is
stuck on automatic rerun, and consumers may have to foot the bill.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf's Faustian Bargain</HD>

<AU>MANSOOR IJAZ</AU>
<BD>Mansoor Ijaz, an American of Pakistani origin, is a
member of the Council on Foreign Relations.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Last week, Pakistan's reform-minded dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
rolled out plans to directly ask the people of Pakistan to extend his
stay in the President's House five years before October parliamentary
elections are held. He did so in fear that the country's established
political parties will find him an untenable leader after the fall
vote. It was a disturbing echo: In 1984, Pakistan's last military
ruler, Gen. Zia ul-Haq, called for a similar vote to legitimize his
power grab before holding elections in which political parties were
prohibited from participating. Musharraf also barred Benazir Bhutto
and Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's two most notable--and corrupt--political
leaders, from running in the fall elections to choose the next prime
minister.</LD>
<LD>   On the surface, these moves by the man who many in Pakistan
consider the country's last and best hope for stability and
respectability fall well within Pakistanis' tolerance for bad
governance. Musharraf, after all, is widely perceived, in Pakistan as
well as overseas, as reversing dangerous trends set in motion by Zia,
who curried favor with religious extremists to dilute the power of
the country's political parties.</LD>
<TE>   But on the same day that Americans and foreigners were attacked as
they prayed at a church in Islamabad, Musharraf released from house
arrest religious extremists he had cracked down on in his landmark
January anti-terrorism speech. As worrisome, the decision revealed
the hidden role that Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence
agency (ISI) continues to play in domestic politics and provided
further evidence of why the agency needs to be overhauled thoroughly
if Pakistan is to become a more viable state.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to release the mullahs appeared to be part of a
larger strategy to appease hard-line Islamist elements, whose
followers constitute an important and potentially large voter bloc in
the proposed May referendum. An alarmingly low voter turnout in last
year's local district elections, whose candidates were vetted by
Pakistani intelligence, probably forced Musharraf's political
operatives to settle on the referendum option as the best way to
legitimize the general's stay in power beyond the October vote.</TE>
<TE>   The need to call for a referendum organized by ISI political
operatives in which Musharraf is the sole choice suggests just how
weak the general's internal grip on power may be: Rather than achieve
his stated goal of continuity by retaining the presidency through a
majority vote of the newly elected national assembly this fall,
Musharraf seems prepared to opt instead for the lesser--indeed,
questionable--legitimacy bestowed on him by an ISI-run referendum.</TE>
<TE>   With the war on terrorism bogging down in Pakistan's
semi-autonomous northwestern tribal areas and religious extremists
regrouping, Musharraf's global travels to wrest economic concessions
from U.S. allies is not keeping his friends where he needs them
most--at army general headquarters in Rawalpindi and on Pennsylvania
Avenue in Washington. During the internal debate over whether or not
to hold a referendum, Musharraf's fellow army lieutenants are said to
have questioned the Pakistani leader about the value of his being
both president and army chief. The implication was that Musharraf had
to choose one or the other.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies Musharraf's dilemma. Without command over military
personnel and assets, Musharraf's powers as a self-anointed president
who lacks a broad public mandate would not be of much use to U.S.
military planners and the war on terrorism. On the other hand, a
successful referendum vote turning on the support of ISI-backed
religious fanatics desperate for a way back into Islamabad's power
circles would send Washington an equally troubling message--the
extremists may be back.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be the first time. By October 1990, then-ISI chief and
Islamic fundamentalist Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul had cobbled together a
coalition of anti-Bhutto political parties, called the Islamic
Democratic Alliance, to block her reelection. Sharif, the victor of
the ISI-rigged election, morphed into an Islamist sympathizer to
maintain his gravitas with the intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when clarity and composure are needed in Islamabad,
Pakistan's military-intelligence complex has exhibited remarkably
conflicting agendas for the country's future. Pakistan remains a
breeding ground for rogue intelligence operatives intent on executing
a jihadi agenda of disrupting Pakistan and its neighbors. Reformed at
the top though it may be, the ISI remains a deeply politicized
institution full of radical Islamists at the middle-management level.
It spies on Pakistani citizens who aspire to power, and crafts and
finances radical Islamic policies abroad.</TE>
<TE>   When its agenda is served, the ISI targets foreigners at home as
well. That Sunday attack on churchgoers in broad daylight, in which
its perpetrators got away without so much as a police siren going off
inside Islamabad's diplomatic enclave--heavily guarded by elite
police squads--may prove that.</TE>
<TE>   In not owning up to the serious management problem created by the
deep divide between reformists and extremists inside the ISI,
Musharraf is fueling the duality--and duplicity--of Islamabad's
anti-terrorism policies. By letting Pakistan's mullahs and
fundamentalists back up for air, he has made himself an easier target
of their wrath for signing up Pakistan in the U.S. war on terrorism.
The religious fanatics may be quiet now, and they may secure
Musharraf's short-term future. But the revenge they seek for
Musharraf's secularism will surely come, and Pakistan as a state will
be the ultimate casualty.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stumping for extremist votes, Musharraf needs to end
the ISI's dubious mandate by dismantling the heart of its Islamist
operations. He needs to reassign its national-security
responsibilities to the more secular military intelligence
directorate within the army, the same group on which U.S. military
forces have relied since Sept. 11. He needs to reallocate ISI's
resources to the recruitment, training and deployment of secular
anti-terrorism squads throughout Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   And Musharraf should stop playing electoral games with his people.
Pakistan's chief military man should stay out of politics and
concentrate on destroying terrorists. To do otherwise is to set the
stage for his own self-destruction, and for America's withdrawal from
the region once again.</TE>

School of Journalism at UC Berkeley.</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>The headlines called it the most sweeping overhaul of
campaign-finance laws since Watergate. Editorial writers rhapsodized
that it would sever the link between federal officeholders and the
raising of huge, unlimited sums from rich individuals, corporations
and unions. And when the U.S. Senate finally sent it on to President
Bush for his signature last week, its chief sponsor, flush with the
praise of his Capitol Hill colleagues and an almost fawning political
press corps, declared that this newest installment of
campaign-finance reform would take about $500 million of "soft" money
out of political campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it will cure baldness, too.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing seduces Washington like a reform crusade, especially if
the adjective "bipartisan" can be attached to it. That the substance
of the reform is questionable from the get-go, that it is guaranteed
to prompt legal challenges or that it ultimately amounts to far less
than the ardent reformers once promised, is beside the point.</LD>
<TE>   What matters, as any accomplished storyteller knows, is the
crusade itself. Long and difficult is good. Better still is an aura
of struggle against sinister forces--ORGANIZED labor, BIG business,
SPECIAL interests. Not just soft money, "SEWER money" in the
overheated rhetoric of one East Coast editorial page. Add a
charismatic crusade leader who prevails against all odds--in this
case, maverick Republican senator and chief Bush nemesis John McCain
of Arizona--and the plot is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Straight-talking Vietnam War hero battles sewer money. It's almost
mythic.</TE>
<TE>   In the final telling, that campaign-finance story--as opposed to
the messier one explaining what soft money really is and how little
about it will actually change under the new law--became irresistible
to members of Congress and to Washington insiders who have followed
the reform crusade for the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   The most important change in the law actually deals with "hard"
money, substantially raising contribution limits Congress set for
individuals in 1974. Hard-money contributions are subject to strict
reporting requirements and are easily traceable, and their increase
will almost certainly benefit Bush in his reelection campaign. He
probably could not have won such a provision had he proposed it
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps intending merely to deprive McCain of another photo-op,
the president underscored the splendid absurdity of what the
reformers ultimately embraced. He signed the legislation early last
Wednesday morning, without cameras or ceremony, and immediately flew
off to raise $3.5 million on behalf of GOP candidates in the South, a
sizable chunk of which was soft money. Since the law won't take
effect until after the November elections, collecting that soft money
is perfectly legal.</TE>
<TE>   And with some relatively simple accounting and organizational
changes for political activists, collecting it will also be perfectly
legal once the law kicks in. That will be true even if the U.S.
Supreme Court were to uphold the dubious constitutionality of
provisions that ban certain types of political advertising within 30
days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.</TE>
<TE>   But the new law specifically bans soft-money contributions to
national political parties, so how could that be? Contemplate what
attorney Steve Lucas and others call the "shadow party." Lucas is a
campaign-finance expert at a Republican political law firm. In fairly
short order, he expects both the Republican and Democratic parties
will be spinning off what amount to soft-money subsidiaries, entities
that will be able to collect unlimited sums from corporations, unions
and wealthy individuals and then dole the money out, as the parties
themselves have until now been able to, for either issue advocacy or
independent expenditures on behalf of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Issue advocacy is the term of art for political advertisements,
most commonly TV commercials, that stop just short of saying vote for
or against a particular officeholder. "Tell Congressman John Doe you
don't approve of federal budget boondoggles" might be an ad that airs
in the congressman's district around election time, or perhaps, with
appropriate name adaptations, in the districts of a dozen different
House of Representative members targeted by the national party.</TE>
<TE>   Independent expenditures are made expressly on behalf of a
particular candidate, but they cannot be coordinated with the
candidate's campaign. "Vote for Jane Smith, the candidate who cares
about clean air and water" would be an example.</TE>
<TE>   Both types of political communication are already used by
politically active interest groups like the Sierra Club or the
National Rifle Assn. And the new law may lead to more such activity
by these groups financed with soft money.</TE>
<TE>   But the shadow parties Lucas describes are another animal
altogether. On paper, they would look something like the interest
groups, which for tax purposes are generally organized as nonprofits
under Section 501 (c ) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code. In reality,
they would operate with the know-how, sophistication and unofficial
blessing of the national political parties, although under the new
law they would be prohibited from any coordination with candidates or
the national and state political parties.</TE>
<TE>   So, why not the "Friends of Republicans Club," headed by former
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour? Or the "Friends
of Democrats Club," headed by Charles T. Manatt, a former chairman of
the Democratic National Committee?</TE>
<TE>   The way Lucas reads the new campaign-finance law, shadow parties
could probably maintain under the same legal roof separate bank
accounts to handle their 501 (c) (4) issue-advocacy activity and
their more explicit, nonprofit political activity covered by Section
527 of the tax code. Names of individual soft-money donors would have
to be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service for the 527 accounts,
but donors to the issue-advocacy account could likely still hide
behind such meaningless labels as Citizens for Good Government.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, almost nothing about the soft money that the
public has been told is the rotting core of democracy actually
changes. "The so-called reformers have created such high expectations
of getting money out of the system," Lucas says. "They have no
constitutional right or ability to do that. All they have the right
to do is keep the money from corrupting the individuals."</TE>
<TE>   But even the ban on federal candidates as soft-money fund-raisers,
the "solution" to the much proclaimed problem of appearances of quid
pro quo and impropriety, turns out to be pretty flimsy. Nothing in
the new law prevents a federal candidate or officeholder from being
the keynote speaker at a shadow party (or interest group's)
fund-raising event.</TE>
<TE>   True, the candidate or officeholder cannot directly solicit funds
(with the possible exception of California Gov. Gray Davis, most
politicians detest that chore), but nothing prevents said candidate
from having a private meet-and-greet with the biggest of the big
donors before the main event or from being chatted up about a donor's
legislative wish list.</TE>
<TE>   Since they can't talk about political money, what else are they
going to speak privately about, except the very thing we regard as a
conflict of interest, Lucas observes with some amusement.</TE>
<TE>   At a law firm that handles political lawyering for Democrats,
including for Davis, veteran attorney Joseph Remcho sees much the
same scenario of shadow parties replacing the national parties as
vehicles for collecting and dispensing soft money. "The new law is
one more step in making individual candidates less accountable," he
says. "There is no way you keep the money out of politics. You are
simply pushing it to private entities."</TE>
<TE>   It's funny, Remcho adds, "We think it's perfectly O.K. to spend $1
billion to see "Titanic," but to spend $500 million on core political
speech is somehow bad, because people have been told there is too
much money in politics."</TE>
<TE>   That perception about money and politics, indeed about politics in
general, isn't likely to improve in a system where political parties
are replaced by elite fund-raising circles operating with minimal
obligation to ordinary voters. It may actually be the biggest
overhaul of the campaign- finance system in a generation, but hardly
one anybody should be proud of.</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a political analyst for CNN.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Politically speaking, it's still Nov. 7, 2000. The two parties remain
deadlocked. The red state/blue state division of America persists,
with the red (Bush) states like Texas getting redder and the blue
(Gore) states like California getting bluer.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the division enshrined in the 2000 election map
wasn't a division over policy. It was a division over values: liberal
America and conservative America. Nothing has happened in the last
year and a half to heal that division. No, not even Sept. 11, which
was widely expected to break the stalemate in U.S. politics.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, there is widespread agreement on the war. And broad support
for President Bush. But those things are above politics. Even Bush is
above politics. The evidence? Most Democrats support the president.
It's the right thing to do at a time of national crisis.</LD>
<TE>   But beneath the exalted level of the presidency and the war,
deadlock and confrontation persist. You can see it in the legislative
process--the failure of Congress to pass a meaningful
economic-stimulus package or an energy bill or prescription-drug
coverage for retirees or a patients' bill of rights. You can see it
in electoral politics--Bush's negligible influence in the New Jersey
and Virginia governor's races last year and in the California
Republican primary this year.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism has not transformed U.S. politics. In fact,
there are indications the opposite may happen. The war may become
more political as it goes on.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of America's political deadlock go back to the great
civil rights war of the 1960s, a cultural civil war in which a New
Left and a New Right emerged to challenge the country's post-World
War II consensus. The center emptied out, especially after Presidents
Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter failed to govern effectively from the
center. The dominant figures of U.S. politics in the late 20th
century were Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, two presidents whose
political identities were forged by the conflicts of the 1960s. The
2000 election was a showdown between Reaganism and Clintonism. The
result? A tie.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans are often perplexed by the failure of Americans to get
over "the sixties." After all, they, too, were convulsed by great
cultural changes during that turbulent decade. But only the United
States experienced a ferocious backlash against those changes, partly
based on America's religious culture.</TE>
<TE>   Religion has lost influence everywhere in the industrial world.
But in America, it continues to thrive. In the early 1990s, I held a
post as visiting professor of American politics at a leading Jesuit
university. One of the perquisites of that position was an invitation
to tea with the cardinal. After we exchanged pleasantries, the
cardinal asked, "Is there anything happening in American politics
that I should be aware of?"</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of fact, there is," I answered. "Since 1980,
religious Americans of all faiths--fundamentalist Protestants,
observant Catholics, even Orthodox Jews--have been moving toward the
Republican Party. At the same time, secular Americans have found a
home in the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something new in American politics," I explained. "We
have never had a religious party in this country." Then I went a
fateful step further, adding, "I'm a little uncomfortable with a
religious party in this country."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal pounced. "Well, I'm a little uncomfortable with an
irreligious party in this country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, it was even more true that religiosity defined politics.
Regular churchgoers voted heavily for then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
Nonobservant voters went strongly for then-Vice President Al Gore.
American politics had become less and less about economic interests
and more and more about lifestyle--a 1960s word.</TE>
<TE>   What brought things to a head was Clinton. Clinton created an odd
legacy in American politics. He brought the country together on
policy and tore the country apart over values.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton really did create a policy consensus. And why not? He
stole most of his policies from the Republicans. Clinton's most
significant policy achievements--welfare reform, the North American
Free Trade Agreement, a balanced budget--passed only because of
Republican support.</TE>
<TE>   For most Americans, however, Clinton's most important attribute
wasn't his policies. It was his values. He was the first, and so far
the only, president to come out of the culture of the 1960s. (Bush is
of that generation, but not of that culture.)</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives never accepted Clinton as legitimate, no matter how
much they agreed with his policies. To them, Clinton was the draft
dodger, the war protester, the womanizer, the truth-shader, the
gun-hater, the gay-protector, the non-inhaling drug fiend.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton may have gotten elected because of "the economy, stupid,"
but what defined his presidency was "the values, stupid." The 2000
election brought three decades of cultural conflict to a head. And
neither side was able to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of close party balance is not the normal condition of
American politics. Usually one party dominates: the Republicans in
the early 20th century, the Democrats in the mid-20th century. The
only other time we had a deadlock was during the 30 years after the
Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Then the conflict was North vs. South, not liberal versus
conservative. What were the politics of the late 19th century like?
Bitter and intense party battles. Two reversals of the popular vote
(1876 and 1888). And the partisan impeachment trial of a president
(1868).</TE>
<TE>   The current partisan stalemate seems likely to persist for a
while. Despite President Bush's record high popularity, there's no
evidence the Republican Party has acquired a lasting advantage. The
latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll asked registered voters how they
would vote for Congress. The result: 46% for the Democrat, 46% for
the Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   Can anything break the stalemate?</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting goes into effect this December, and it's supposed to
shake things up in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it won't.
Redistricting is likely to perpetuate the stalemate because in state
after state, most notably in California, new district lines were
drawn to protect incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   In a democracy, voters are supposed to choose the candidates.
Redistricting allows the candidates to essentially choose the voters.
And the candidates always choose voters who will keep them in office.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate of the late 19th century was broken when a new wave
of progressive politics swept the country and cast aside old party
divisions. A lot of people expected the trauma of Sept. 11 and the
war on terrorism to create a new politics, turning the red state/blue
state division of 2000 into ancient history.</TE>
<TE>   But America's New War has not created America's New Politics. The
war in Afghanistan has been nonpolitical. Now the Bush administration
wants to expand that war into Iraq. The USA/CNN/Gallup Poll asked
Americans how they feel about sending U.S. ground troops into Iraq.
The result: 46% in favor, 50% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   Ominously, that stalemate has become highly politicized.
Conservatives and Republicans favor using U.S. ground troops in Iraq.
Liberals and Democrats are strongly opposed. This is the first time
since Sept. 11 that a war issue has become partisan and divisive.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is likely to be far more controversial than Afghanistan.
America's Old Politics--the political division of 2000--could end up
infecting America's New War.</TE>

<BD>Bruce J. Schulman, who teaches history and American
studies at Boston University, is the author of "The Seventies: The
Great Shift in American Culture, Politics and Society."</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>"Security" has become the buzzword of U.S. politics. In his January
State of the Union address, President Bush renamed his
economic-stimulus package the "economic security plan," billing it as
the fiscal counterpart to the new Office of Homeland Security. At
Harvard University recently, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
laid out a liberal alternative to the president's agenda, insisting
that "we should also be working for homeland energy security,
homeland health security, homeland environment security." Meanwhile,
a House and Senate conference committee is ironing out the details of
what was once called the "Farm Security Act of 2001."</LD>
<TE>   It is tempting to dismiss such rhetoric as political opportunism,
unsubtle efforts to wrap long-sought domestic priorities in the Stars
and Stripes. Who wants to oppose the president's tax cuts or Sen.
Clinton's health-care initiative if it places the homeland at risk?
But the constant invocation of national security represents more than
cynical stealth politics--attempts to sneak through programs little
related to the war on terrorism. The obsession with security draws
heavily on long-established traditions in U.S. political history,
born of previous crises like the Great Depression in the 1930s and
the Cold War. Like these earlier challenges, the war against terror
not only offers opportunities to break through logjams and pass
much-delayed legislation, it also skews priorities and reshapes
policy in unexpected and often unintended directions.</TE>
<TE>   In his new emphasis on security, President Bush recalls the early
days of the Cold War. Then, the shadow of nuclear destruction hung
low over the nation, prompting a daily routine of civil-defense
drills, military buildup and efforts to purge Communists from schools
and colleges, factories and Hollywood studios. From the late 1940s
through the early 1960s, the term "Cold War" really meant something.
It signified a truly dangerous state of all but war, with almost no
travel, trade or cultural exchange between the two sides, a belief
that negotiation was impossible, troops facing each other in hot
spots across the world and actual military encounters in places like
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   An obsession with security overran almost everything. As Adm.
Hyman Rickover put it, "If the newspapers printed a dispatch that the
Soviet Union planned sending the first man to Hell, our federal
agencies would appear the next day, crying, 'We can't let them beat
us to it!'"</TE>
<TE>   This Cold War climate transformed domestic politics. Policies that
had been dismissed as too expensive, too radical, too
whimsical--interstate highways, federal support for schools, or
greenbelt towns--could sail through Congress when justified as
measures to move troops and tanks, beat the Soviets into space or
move industrial plants away from big-city targets. Meanwhile, other
liberal policies became stigmatized. Attacked as communistic,
President Harry S. Truman's proposals for full employment and
national health insurance were defeated.</TE>
<TE>   The strange odyssey of the National Defense Education Act of 1958
revealed how Cold War conceptions of national security dominated and
skewed domestic politics in the 1950s. For two decades, a broad
coalition of legislators had pushed for federal aid to education.
They hoped to enhance educational opportunities for all children, but
mainly to help disadvantaged students and undeveloped regions build
the schools that might lift them out of poverty. But no measure ever
emerged from Capitol Hill. Federal aid to education seemed like a
non-starter.</TE>
<TE>   But in October of 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik I, the first
artificial satellite in Earth's orbit. The prospect of superior enemy
technology, of dangers rained down from the heavens, stoked the
nation's already acute insecurities. When asked in the early 1960s
what future American astronauts would find on the moon, physicist
Edward Teller, the designer of the H-bomb, answered "Russians."
Partisans of federal aid to education, like then-Texas Sen. Lyndon B.
Johnson, blamed Sputnik on poor schools and rammed a federal-aid bill
through Congress. The National Defense Education Act became law.</TE>
<TE>   But in hiding their domestic agenda under the umbrella of national
defense, Cold War politicians distorted their priorities. The
National Defense Education Act chiefly channeled resources to
scientific and technical education. Because it did not resolve
lingering questions about racial segregation or public support for
parochial schools, the law proved ineffective. It did virtually
nothing to relieve educational inequalities.</TE>
<TE>   The current efforts of farm-state representatives to portray
agricultural subsidies as protection for the nation's food supplies
echoes almost verbatim the arguments of their 1950s forbears. When
President Bush pushes his familiar recipe of tax cuts and investment
incentives to ensure economic security, he calls upon that very same
Cold War tradition.</TE>
<TE>   In seizing the mantle of security, Bush's Democratic opponents
sometimes borrow the Cold War formulation. But they also call upon
the legacy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.
Security became the byword of Roosevelt's efforts to combat the Great
Depression and rebuild American democracy. He imagined a truly
national safety net for all citizens. He saw no reason, he told his
secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, "why everybody in the United
States should not be covered" or why "it should not last from cradle
to grave."</TE>
<TE>   Not only the Social Security system, the landmark achievement of
the 1930s with its protections for the elderly and disabled, but the
New Deal's entire legacy promised to relieve what FDR called "the
dreadful consequence of economic insecurity." Roosevelt sought
security for the hungry, the homeless and the jobless, to be sure,
but also for corporations and farms, unions and homeowners and
bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Even Hillary Clinton's call for environmental security possesses a
New Deal pedigree. FDR's conservation measures--huge dams, vast
reservoirs and huge parks--shielded Americans from floods and
drought, from pests and erosion and dust.</TE>
<TE>   But justifying environmental, economic or education programs in
terms of security not only misleads the public; it often flouts the
very goals of their sponsors. The contributory, insurance features of
Social Security ensured passage through Congress but derailed FDR's
hopes for more extensive cradle-to-grave social benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental security might protect property holders from natural
disasters, farmers from loss and consumers from toxins, but it does
little to preserve the land or the wildlife on it. And wartime
economic stimulus, designed to reassure shaky financial markets and
jump-start growth, threatens inflation and huge deficits without
necessarily aiding those ordinary citizens most suffering the fallout
from recession and war.</TE>
<TE>   The constant chorus of "security" little advances public debate or
national policy. It may even, in the end, make us less safe.</TE>

<LD>Out on a gravel road on the very edge of the Southern California
megalopolis, I am sitting in the sunshine on a stack of freshly sawed
boards with Mike Easterling.</LD>
<LD>   I'm here in Irvine because two things are occurring simultaneously
in U.S. cities. One of them is lousy, the other heartening.</LD>
<LD>   Both are happening in front of our eyes, although they are not
easy to discern.</LD>
<TE>   I am referring to our essential regard for nature. Plus scary
topics such as global warming, our brimming landfills, the loss of
our rain forests, polluted water and rising energy demands. I am also
thinking about our love of wood--in this case, prime softwoods and
exotic hardwoods from the far corners of the world, the stuff to make
floors and guitars and conference tables and paneled living rooms and
patio furniture and salad bowls and 1,000 other fine things.</TE>
<TE>   Our topic is trees.</TE>
<TE>   The cedar boards on which Easterling and I are sitting are part of
a revolution. His San Marcos-based company, East-West Urban Forest
Products, sells lumber salvaged from our frontyards, from roadway
medians and city parks, trees uprooted by storms, trees that have
reached the end of their lives, trees taken down to make way for
development.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years or so, a few farsighted people have begun to
conceive of urban landscapes in a new way. They saw the forest in the
trees. Now the idea is catching on, and it's about time. Scandalous
waste is being transformed into entrepreneurial gain for the
well-being of us all, and just in the nick of time.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Of the 50 million tons of solid waste produced in
California, 16% is so-called green waste from vegetation and 4% is
wood. Municipal officials regard the wood/tree component as a drain
on their civic budgets--all that tree trimming, storm cleanup and
stump pulling that ends up in landfills. Under state mandate to
reduce solid waste, city officials are increasingly turning away from
replanting big trees in favor of smaller ones and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   Incrementally, day by day, these decisions promise unpleasant
consequences for city dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   Big trees provide shade, which saves energy by cooling homes
naturally (up to 20 degrees). They capture rainfall that otherwise
courses over dirty streets and creates toxic storm-runoff problems.
They scrub the air clean, dampen noise, beautify our neighborhoods
and renew our connection to the cycles of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating big trees in favor of scrawny ones is presumed to be
cheaper in the short run but costly in so many other ways.</TE>
<TE>   Easterling, with a background in furniture-making, is in the
retail end of a movement out to prove that city trees can be managed
as forests. They can pay for themselves and for the good of the
environment, here and afar. "Our mission is to put the lumber from
our urban forests to higher use," he says. "Every time someone buys
urban wood, that's one less tree that has to come down in the rain
forest."</TE>
<TE>   He opens a gleaming wooden case. Inside are 36 rectangular
samples, like tiles, of the most common commercial woods produced
locally. California has the advantage of a favorable growing season
and a long tradition of planting exotic trees in the cities, from gum
to carob, from carrotwood to black acacia. These woods have the added
cachet of sentimentality, as any woodworker could tell you. Each tree
ring, each fancy twirl of figuring is part of our shared history,
whether it ends up as an architectural accent in a home or a night
stand in the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prime hardwood fetches premium prices at specialty lumber yards. A
board foot--1-inch thick by 12 inches square--of silk oak imported
from Australia could cost $7.50. That same species of tree, common to
Southern California, has been ending up in landfills, or at best, as
firewood.</TE>
<TE>   Now, West Coast Arborists Inc., which does tree service for 100
municipalities throughout the state, is also becoming a lumber mill,
using Easterling to market and sell the wood.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been disconnected from the things that trees bring to our
lives," says Eric Oldar, an urban specialist with the California
Department of Forestry. "To think of trees as potential commodities
brings the idea of sustainability to our cities .... Trees are an
essential part of the cultural nervous system of livable
communities."</TE>
<TE>   With grants and the loan of milling and drying equipment, the
state is now coaxing along half a dozen projects to bring city trees
to market, and similar urban forestry endeavors are underway
elsewhere, although the yield in lumber is still only a tiny fraction
of its potential. The goal is more trees, more shade, more rain
absorption, cleaner air, more nature in our urban environment--and as
soon as city officials realize the payback potential from lumber,
let's hope we see a planting boom.</TE>
<TE>   Where do you live?</TE>
<TE>   I live in the forest. I live in Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Civilian Courts Give Terrorists Far Too Many Loopholes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SPENCER J. CRONA and NEAL A. RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, a career thief and murderer who was sentenced to
death in 1984 for the rape, torture and murder of Denver bookkeeper
Lorraine Martelli died in the Colorado State Penitentiary--of natural
causes. His last rounds of appeal still were pending. Frank Rodriguez
was a lifelong street predator who savagely attacked a decent,
hard-working person and whose case was otherwise unextraordinary. His
case stands as sadly representative of a civilian criminal justice
system that simply is not appropriate for adjudication of terrorist
war crimes.</LD>
<LD>   It is into the breach of that system that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
now rides with a proposed death sentence for Zacarias Moussaoui, the
alleged 20th hijacker of Sept. 11. Moussaoui's case has been
relegated to U.S. District Court, along with various accused bank
robbers and drug kingpins, despite Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld's recent issuance of complete procedural rules for war crime
trials before military commissions.</LD>
<LD>   Can't the Bush administration get its Justice and Defense
departments right on this issue?</LD>
<TE>   No compelling reason has emerged for not charging Moussaoui and
alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid as war criminals. Both are accused
of targeting civilians for mass murder, which constitute war crimes
under international law and should be tried before military
commissions. The same goes for Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged
Al Qaeda terrorist charged in Pakistan with masterminding the killing
of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl; for all those alleged
Al Qaeda agents on the FBI's "Most Wanted Terrorists" list; and for
the Al Qaeda detainees at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have argued against military tribunals have said that
these commissions cannot be fair. That argument falters with the
procedural rules, which provide for presumption of innocence,
defendant right to private counsel, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden
of proof, defense right to review the evidence, preclusion of double
jeopardy, public trial except where necessary to protect national
security or intelligence assets or witnesses, unanimity required for
a death sentence and a 30-day appeal process. In one concession to
the reality of terrorism prosecution and to the aims of efficiency
and truth, the rules provide for a relaxed standard of evidence
compared with the civilian system.</TE>
<TE>   In the civilian criminal justice system, we as a society find
acceptable the risk that the guilty may go free as a consequence of
providing extensive procedural safeguards to the accused. With
terrorist war crimes, the risk isn't that a serial killer or a rapist
may go free to prey upon future victims, but that the killer who goes
free will later detonate a "suitcase" nuclear weapon in mid-Manhattan
or L.A.</TE>
<TE>   We don't want a process in which decades pass while mass murderers
of civilians cool their heels, contemplate their opportunities and
percolate their hate in U.S. jails. Consider Sheikh. He was released
when his cronies took hostages on an Air India airliner in 1999 to
force Indian authorities, who'd been holding him in connection with
the kidnapping of an American, to free him. Sheikh recently boasted
that he'll be released again the same way.</TE>
<TE>   The swiftness and certainty of the military commission process
reflect a policy choice to err in favor of eliciting the truth and
prosecuting the guilty in a fundamentally fair tribunal, rather than
freeing the guilty to attain an absolute ideal of procedural
fairness. Since mass slaughter and economic devastation are national
security issues, national security in time of war mandates military
trials.</TE>

<HD>Lines in the Valley Sand Underscore L.A.'s Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For once, it's not rhetorical overkill to say the City Council holds
the future of L.A. in its hands. Last week, a hard-working citizens'
redistricting commission gave the council its best chance to keep
intact La Ciudad de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de
Porciuncula--better known as Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   If enough council members can muster the courage and vision to
approve the new district boundaries, the campaign to have the San
Fernando Valley secede from L.A. can be defeated. But if a majority
of the 15 council members put parochial political interests above all
else, Valley secession will be a foregone conclusion. Then the only
open question will be how many other parts of town--Hollywood? the
harbor?--will bolt when the secession vote is held in November.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. City Council Redistricting Commission was created by the
City Charter that voters approved in 1999--one of the best things to
emerge from that reform effort. It took the contentious process of
redrawing council districts to reflect census changes out of City
Hall's back rooms and into the sunlight. The job was given to 21
citizens appointed by various city officials.</LD>
<TE>   The commission went about its work with diligence and patience.
More than 1,000 people attended 50 hours of public hearings. It also
received more than 5,000 letters, e-mails and other correspondence
from interested citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The map that commission members drew can be derided as politically
correct, but it's also politically astute. It keeps three inner-city
districts with a plurality of black voters--40%, as defined by the
federal Voting Rights Act. It also increases the districts with a
plurality of Latino voters from four to five, making it possible for
Latinos to increase their council representation without diminishing
the clout of African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the commission put five districts completely
within the San Fernando Valley, giving one-third of the council's
seats to a region that encompasses one-third of the city's land mass
and is home to slightly more than one-third of its population.</TE>
<TE>   Only four council districts now are completely in the Valley;
three others combine Valley neighborhoods with communities south of
Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Some in City Hall insist that arrangement keeps the Valley closely
linked to the rest of the city, but hardly anyone in the Valley buys
that. Given a recent Times poll that showed 46% of city voters in
favor of Valley secession, with 55% of Valley voters favoring a
breakup, the commission's new district map may be the only way to
keep L.A. in one piece. It creates a potential coalition of voters
likely to cast ballots in favor of staying in L.A. by offering more
clout to the city's emerging majority, Latinos. It maintains the
influence of the city's most consistent voting bloc, African
Americans. And it finally gives the Valley representation
commensurate with its size and population.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say the commission's map is flawless. A few
communities are still divided between two districts, including Van
Nuys. But even that's an improvement. Van Nuys is now divided among
five districts.</TE>
<TE>   To make its political balancing act work, the commission had to
move Ruth Galanter's Westside council district into the Valley. More
problematic, Eastside council members Nick Pacheco and Ed Reyes want
to shift parts of Downtown's 9th District into their neighboring
districts. Normally, such City Hall infighting could be tolerated.
But not this year.</TE>
<TE>   Council members have until June 30 to approve the commission's
handiwork, and the less they muck it up, the better. Not for them,
perhaps, but certainly for the rest of the city.</TE>

<HD>Viet Lesson: Make Trade, Not War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE PETERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, I remember the
horrors of the battlefield and understand how difficult healing can
be. In 1997, when I returned to Vietnam as the U.S. ambassador and
was chauffeured to my destinations, I could not forget the times when
I had traveled those same roads in the back of a prison truck,
handcuffed, shackled, blindfolded and often gagged. Nor did I forget
the days when I only thought of Vietnam as a war, not a country.</LD>
<LD>   But I soon realized that I did not need to forget the past. I
simply needed to focus on a different and better future.</LD>
<LD>   Today, U.S. military forces are fighting on a new battlefield in
Afghanistan, and I am pleased to see that some of the lessons I
learned in dealing with my past are being put into practice there.
While the United States and its allies have properly committed to
fight our common terrorist enemies, we understand that it is equally
important to make sure Afghanistan is provided with the tools
necessary to succeed once the war is over. The U.S. commitment to
help rebuild infrastructure, support the formation of a new
government and feed the hungry people of Afghanistan is critical.</LD>
<TE>   As in Vietnam, Afghanistan's future success may depend on whether
its people choose to embrace some of the values that Americans hold
dear, including a robust free market economy, respect for individual
rights and democratic principles. During my tenure as ambassador, I
often made clear to the Vietnamese that a free market is an essential
element of a free nation.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than 20 years for the U.S. to actively begin
reconciliation with Vietnam. That was far too long.</TE>
<TE>   The recent implementation of the bilateral trade agreement between
the U.S and Vietnam has the potential to make up for some of the time
lost. The agreement will help to improve the quality of life for
every Vietnamese citizen and sends a positive signal to American
companies that Vietnam is open for business.</TE>
<TE>   There is an increasing demand for Western goods and services
throughout Vietnam. The commercial potential for American companies
is enormous. This demand can partly be attributed to the
extraordinary demographics of Vietnam: half of its 80 million people
are under 25. This young, literate and hard-working population
provides an ideal consumer base for American businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam possesses enormous natural resources as well. It is the
second largest exporter of rice in the world; coffee and quality
marine products also have become lucrative exports. Petroleum is the
country's largest monetary export, and it has vast quantities of
energy products and minerals that have yet to be fully developed.</TE>
<TE>   Because Vietnam was not completely integrated into the global
market, it did not greatly suffer the effects of the Asian financial
crisis in the 1990s. Vietnam's currency still is not fully
convertible, and it only recently opened its first stock market. With
the Asian economies somewhat on the rebound, Vietnam's economy is
starting to take off. Vietnam recently was recognized by a poll of
business leaders as the safest place to do business in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The vast untapped market in Vietnam could be an important boost to
the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   Major political, economic and cultural change has taken place over
the past 15 years in Vietnam, and the transition in each of these
sectors continues. The changes have been aided by Washington's policy
of engagement, signaled by the termination of the economic embargo in
1994 and the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Through candid dialogue, mutual respect and a strong commitment to
succeed by the leaders of both countries, Vietnam and the United
States have become friends again. Vietnam has become a respected and
peaceful member of the community of nations--finally a country, not a
war, in the minds of people around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Our experience in Vietnam proves that engagement works. If we draw
from the lessons we learned in Vietnam, there is a real hope for a
stable, free and future-oriented new nation of Afghanistan.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Alleged Slur Brings Call for Caruso to Resign," March 27: OK,
let's call it for what it is. U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)
has decided that if she can get rid of Los Angeles Police Commission
President Rick Caruso she can keep the chief of police and have more
control of the board. Now, if she were a "politician" herself, she
would have discussed this fiasco in private chambers with Caruso
rather than taking it to the streets to tarnish his career and
reputation, and she probably would have gained a more positive
reputation herself. He must have looked like an easy target for her
to attack.</LD>
<LD>   If this had happened to two kids at school we would call them into
the principal's office and talk this over. After all, we all agree
that name-calling (even if it was via a third party who overheard it
and wished to remain anonymous) is not nice. But this is about power
and politics, not what is best for the city.</LD>
<LD>   Get a life. We have a city to run here. We need leadership. There
must be a better way to assert one's interests and serve the public
than this childishly disturbing acting-out behavior on display in Los
Angeles. We deserve better than this from Rep. Waters. If this is how
she handles her interpersonal issues, we are all in trouble.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In most places of business, absolutely no credence is given to
anonymous letters. None. In this thinly veiled political tussle, what
about Caruso's 1st Amendment rights? His comments about Walters were
made in private.</TE>
<TE>   I find it hard to believe that in her long and colorful career,
Walters has never been described with the "B-word" before, and my
guess is that she might be described with the "B-word" again. Sticks
and stones, Maxine; sticks and stones.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that the reports of Caruso allegedly calling Rep. Waters
the "B-word" are true, I fail to see what the uproar is all about.
For years many people have been subjected to Waters' vituperous
tongue. If true, the only crime Caruso has committed was telling the
truth.</TE>

<TE>   Chief Bernard Parks inherited a very dysfunctional Police
Department. He did not create the problems. Throughout his tenure he
has been working diligently to resolve the department's woes. But
clearly there are factions in Los Angeles that refuse to judge him
fairly regardless as to what he does. Certain people do not want an
African American police chief and that's the bottom line.</TE>

<LD>It is shocking and unconscionable--if not outright criminal--that so
much public business is conducted by the L.A. County Board of
Supervisors behind closed doors, away from public scrutiny. To
further read in The Times that the supervisors defend this process as
being efficient is outrageous ("Supervisors' Decisions Made Mostly
Behind Closed Doors," March 26). By that logic, we should live under
the most efficient system of all--a dictatorship run by an inner
circle or committee.</LD>
<LD>   These people handle a budget larger than that of a small state,
and should conduct all business pertaining to the county budget in
public, in the spirit of democracy, even if it means they work a
little harder for their exorbitant salaries.</LD>

<AU>KRISTINE MCKENNA</AU>
<BD>Kristine McKenna is a Los Angeles writer. A second
volume of her collected interviews will be released later this year.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's amazing what it's OK to do in public these days. If you need to
blow your nose while walking down a city street and find yourself
without a tissue, it's OK to press on your left nostril, lean to the
right, and blow hard out of your right nostril. If you execute the
appropriate maneuver correctly, the mist of mucous you emit will land
on others and not on you. I've seen this nose-blowing technique
performed with considerable aplomb several times on the streets of
Santa Monica. Not only is it OK for your cell phone to ring as the
casket is being lowered into the ground at a funeral, it's OK to take
the call. Yes, I was shocked when I witnessed this recently at the
funeral of a friend's mother in Orange County, but I have to assume
it's OK because nobody said a word. (Granted, everyone may have been
temporarily stunned into silence).</LD>
<TE>   Whereas business attire was once de rigueur for air travel, wife
beater T-shirts are now OK, and once your plane is airborne, it seems
it's OK to unbutton snug trouser waistbands, remove your shoes and
pad up and down the aisle in threadbare socks. It's also OK to pack
your travel gear in a Hefty bag and drag it on board with you. Leaf
blowers are illegal in many communities, but it's still OK to use
them, at least it is in my neighborhood. And, yes, it's apparently
fine if you go away for the weekend and leave your three dogs in the
backyard to bark non-stop for 48 hours, as my neighbors recently did.
Based on the results of a test conducted two years ago by the San
Francisco Chronicle, seated passengers on Bay Area Rapid Transit
trains no longer feel obliged to relinquish their seats to standing
passengers on crutches, and it's also OK to ignore a lost pedestrian
studying a map.</TE>
<TE>   What all these instances of infantile narcissism share is a
failure to grasp the fact that the world is a small place. There are
lots of us crammed together here, and there are aspects of the world
we have to share. When occupying public spaces--or even when within
earshot of others--we would do well to remain respectful of issues
involving body space, eye contact, sound and smell. No one has the
right to pollute these shared spaces, whether by driving around in a
car blasting music at a decibel capable of triggering seizures,
throwing trash on the ground or screeching into a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   More annoying than the sound cell phone users make is the subtext
of this activity. (Doctors and parents of small children--the only
people with a legitimate claim to cell phone use--are excused from
this part of my lecture.) Essentially, a person on a cell phone is
saying to everyone around him; "I'm not here inhabiting this space
with you, we are not together, I am someplace else." This incredibly
anti-social message is a complete negation of the notion of
community, and is also a way of not being fully present in the world.
The world's an interesting place. Let's show up for it and pay
attention.</TE>
<TE>   All aspects of telephone etiquette have, of course, eroded in
recent years. Social satirist Harry Shearer's weekly radio program,
"Le Show," once featured a character in a skit who was talking to
someone on the phone when another call beeped through. "I better get
that," said the character. "It might be somebody else." Really, isn't
that what call waiting is all about?</TE>
<TE>   If you're thinking of heading for cyberspace in an attempt to
escape the madding crowd, don't bother--things are bad there, too.
When a friend sends you one of those blanket e-mails that's also been
sent to twenty other people, don't you feel as if you've been
demoted? I always scan the list of fellow recipients and think, "oh,
so this is how I rate." "It's a way to stay in touch in a busy
world," protest those multi-tasking spammers, but a mimeographed memo
is not my idea of communication. If you're not convinced of the
depths of cyberspace gaucheness, just check out Roger Clarke's 1995
typology "Net-Ethiquette: Mini Case Studies of Dysfunctional Human
Behavior on the Net," which covers such things as "flaming,"
"trawling" and "spidering" along with the ultimate in what he terms
"Power Rudeness"--firing someone by e-mail. Nice, huh?</TE>
<TE>   While evidence seems to abound that man is rapidly creeping back
to the primordial ooze, in fact, the ever-shifting code of etiquette
we cling to in an effort to perceive ourselves as civilized creatures
is constantly in the process of breaking down. The offenses listed
above represent nothing more than how it's breaking down right now.</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting to romanticize the past, to think of it as a sort of
endless "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," the
signature work painted by Georges Seurat during the years 1884-1886.
In this romantic vision, life used to be a choreographed social
minuet in which beautifully dressed, impeccably polite people enjoyed
interacting. Although wealthy people lived more formally in Paris 150
years ago, they also engaged in behavior that would strike us as
weird today. Most of the rules that have governed public conduct for
centuries originated in the French royal court in the 16th and 17th
centuries, and while some of them still make sense, others have
become obsolete. Children were once taught the proper way to kneel
before a teacher, and to remain silent until spoken to, but they were
also taught how to use a pointed dinner knife as a toothpick.</TE>
<TE>   When people first began reading in public shortly after the
industrialization of literature in the early 19th century, it was
considered downright thuggish, just as when people first started
walking around plugged in to Sony Walkmans, they were often perceived
as hostile and remote. Neither activity raises an eyebrow now. My
mother nursed her children with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth,
and so did most of her friends. Driving drunk was once considered not
that big a deal. When abstract painter Jackson Pollock wrapped his
car around a tree in 1956 he went down in history as a romantic hero,
and nobody made much of the fact that a woman named Edith Metzger,
who'd just met Pollock and had the bad luck to be in that car with
him, lost her life because Pollock was drunk. It's unlikely such
behavior would pass without sterner condemnation now.</TE>
<TE>   What constitutes acceptable behavior is clearly a kind of a
one-step-forward, one-step-back situation. We've gotten smarter about
some things, but we've gotten wretchedly grubby about others. The guy
at the next restaurant table is no longer allowed to light up a
cigarette, but he may go outside and blow his nose on the sidewalk.
Granted, that nose-blowing isn't endangering anybody's life, but it
hardly seems a mark of social progress that people have come to feel
at liberty to do it. Somebody needs to rework the rule book.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Housing Finance Agency has increased price limits for
its programs in 31 of California's 58 counties, making homeownership
possible for more first-time home buyers.</LD>
<LD>   "California has one of the lowest [housing] affordability rates in
the nation. The price limit changes won't solve the housing crisis,
but they will help to make homeownership a reality for more
Californians," said agency Executive Director Theresa Parker.</LD>
<LD>   Orange, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, San Joaquin, Sacramento,
Placer and Sonoma counties are among those that will see new
construction increases ranging from 10% to 20%. But price limits in
20 other counties will remain the same as they were in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The agency's price limits for resale homes range from a low of
$95,741 in Tulare County to a high of $558,721 in San Francisco and
Marin counties. Price limits are based on annual surveys of housing
sales in each statistical area to determine an average.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We live in a 25-unit common interest development near the
beach in Southern California. Year after year, we request that the
board and management company fix common area problems surrounding our
home. They ignore us.</LD>
<LD>   At considerable expense, which doesn't seem to bother any of the
board members, we were forced to hire attorneys to write the board
telling them to fix the problems.</LD>
<LD>   All of the attorneys we have hired throughout this ordeal have
expressed their dismay and puzzlement as to why the homeowners
association and management company are not fixing the problems.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, an attorney friend told us to write a letter, telling the
board we are writing in "anticipation of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the board and management company did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent conversation with a board member, I was told that the
reason they were doing nothing was because my correspondence said
"anticipation of litigation" in it. They are making this impossible
to get anything accomplished. What can we do to fix the problems?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: A board's ignorance of the law is no excuse for its
actions or inactions. Your board has legal obligations under the
Davis-Stirling Act, Civil Code section 1364(a), that says, "The
association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining
the common areas."</TE>
<TE>   If a lawsuit is necessary to force your board to adhere to its
responsibilities, you first need to verify that wording similar to
the Davis-Stirling Act is in your governing documents, such as your
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions, or CC&amp;R. If it is and your
lawsuit against the board to force them to perform the obligations
required of them under the CC&amp;Rs is successful, the court should
award you attorney's fees.</TE>
<TE>   Your board needs to step back and recognize that homeowners in
your development are so fed up that they are actually telling the
board they are going to sue. It doesn't get any clearer than that.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately there are attorneys who advise boards to do nothing,
instead advising a board to ignore the homeowner. Their reasoning is
that the person is going to sue anyway, so let them.</TE>
<TE>   What the board's lawyers fail to say is that lawyers benefit in
the event of a suit, because the insurance company or the association
pays their fees.</TE>
<TE>   They get paid regardless of the outcome within the common interest
development.</TE>
<TE>   This fee-based rather than resolution-based approach creates
opposing factions among people who supposedly live in a community.</TE>
<TE>   Interests can turn to getting even, not getting problems solved.
The approach can encourage litigation and goad homeowners into suing.</TE>
<TE>   Solving the problem would certainly be cheaper and less stressful
than a time-consuming lawsuit, the impact of which could be increased
premiums or possible policy cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   Funds spent that are not covered by the insurance company would
better be spent on repairing, replacing and maintaining your complex,
or damage caused to homeowner units, which was the board's duty to
begin with.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently writing your board has proven fruitless, yet you need
to try one last time.</TE>
<TE>   Send a copy of your letter to the board and to your state
legislator, and request that your elected representatives enact laws
that include penalties for boards that break the law.</TE>

<HD>Contract Clarifies What's Included in Sale</HD>

<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home sales are setting a rapid pace in most cities. With mortgage
interest rates continuing to stay low, the traditional peak spring
home-buying season promises to be an excellent time to be a buyer or
seller.</LD>
<LD>   But a confusing aspect of home sales involves determining what is
and is not included in the sale. Bitter fights between residence
buyers, sellers and sometimes even their real estate agents too
frequently erupt over what items automatically go along with the
property.</LD>
<LD>   Ask any experienced real estate sales agent and they will usually
have fixture "horror stories" to tell, especially about dining room
chandeliers. For some unexplained reason, many home sellers presume
they can take this light fixture with them. However, the law of
fixtures is on the buyer's side because, unless specifically
excluded, all light fixtures are automatically included in the sale.
But sellers are entitled to remove the light bulbs, which are
personal property not included in the sale.</LD>
<TE>   Home buyers, sellers and their realty agents should be aware that
the simple law of fixtures determines when personal property has been
converted into real estate and is included in a real property sale.</TE>
<TE>   After movable personal property is permanently affixed to a
building or land, it becomes known as a "fixture," which is part of
the realty. The attachment can be by bolts, screws, nails, glue,
cement or any other means of permanent attachment.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when a dining room chandelier is attached to the
ceiling by bolts or screws, it is converted from personal to real
property. If the seller doesn't want to include an item in the sale,
it should be removed before showing the home.</TE>
<TE>   Home sales fixture problems can be prevented by not only
understanding the law of fixtures but by using a well-written sales
contract.</TE>
<TE>   A contract clause that avoids fixture misunderstandings reads:
"All existing fixtures and fittings that are attached to the property
are (if owned by seller and unless excluded below) included in the
purchase price and shall be transferred free of liens. These shall be
deemed to include, but are not limited to, the following: existing
electrical, lighting, plumbing and heating fixtures, fireplace
inserts and attached fireplace equipment, solar systems, built-in
appliances, screens, awnings, shutters, window coverings, attached
floor coverings, television antennas, satellite dishes and related
equipment, private integrated telephone systems, air
coolers/conditioners, pool/spa equipment, water softeners, security
systems/alarms, keys to all exterior locks, garage door
openers/remote controls, mailbox, and in-ground landscaping."</TE>
<TE>   Any fixtures the seller wants excluded from the sale should then
be listed. Next, the buyer should list in the purchase contract any
non-fixture personal property items she or he wants included, such as
patio furniture, free-standing stove, refrigerator, washer and dryer.</TE>
<TE>   If a legal dispute arises as to whether a personal property item
has become a real property fixture that is included in the property
sale, five basic rules are used by courts:</TE>
<TE>   * Method of attachment. The most important test for determining if
an item has become a fixture is its attachment to the land or
building. If it is nailed, bolted, glued, wired, built in or
cemented, then the personal property has become a fixture.</TE>
<TE>   However, if the item can be easily removed without damage, such as
removing hanging drapes from a drapery rod, unscrewing a light bulb
or unplugging a refrigerator, the seller can remove that personal
property (unless the buyer listed it on the purchase contract as
being included).</TE>
<TE>   Wall-to-wall carpet that is nailed, tacked or glued to the floor
is included in the sale because it has become a fixture. Similarly,
linoleum tile glued to the floor is part of the structure. But area
rugs that are not permanently attached to the building are personal
property.</TE>
<TE>   Window coverings, unless included by contract, often cause
trouble. The drapery rods, since they are screwed to the wall, must
remain because they are permanently attached fixtures. But drapes are
personal property that the seller can remove (unless included in the
sales contract).</TE>
<TE>   * Agreement of the parties. The buyer and seller can agree in the
purchase contract to include or exclude specific items. Everything is
negotiable. But any fixtures the seller wants to exclude must be
specifically listed in the sales agreement; otherwise, they are
automatically included.</TE>
<TE>   * Intent of the buyer and seller. The intent of the buyer and
seller often becomes important in determining if a disputed item is
included or excluded.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the home's multiple listing service description
says "beautiful Sub-Zero refrigerator matches kitchen cabinets," that
indicates the seller intends to include it in the price.</TE>
<TE>   * Adaptability for use with the property. Items that are specially
adapted to the property, such as built-in stereo speakers, are
usually considered to be included fixtures. However, the stereo
equipment that can easily be unplugged remains personal property and
is not automatically included in the sale.</TE>
<TE>   * Relationship of the parties. When the buyer and seller cannot
resolve their disagreement and litigation becomes necessary, courts
usually favor buyer over seller, tenant over landlord and lender over
borrower.</TE>

<HD>Whole-House Surge Suppressor Is a Bright Idea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES DULLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I plan to install a whole-house voltage surge suppressor in
addition to the plug-in ones. My VCR, microwave, computers, etc.,
seem to fail too often. Will a whole-house model help? Which are
best?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Installing a whole-house surge suppressor is extremely
important in today's homes. In addition to the items you mentioned,
dishwashers, clothes washers, kitchen ranges--practically every
electrical device in your home--has delicate electronic components
that can be damaged by voltage surges.</LD>
<LD>   These surges are of short duration but can peak to 5,000 volts or
higher. Hundreds of these surges enter your home every day through
the wiring. They can either burn out an electronic component
instantly or, more likely, gradually degrade its performance.</LD>
<TE>   Small plug-in surge suppressors, commonly used on computers, block
many small surges, but other appliances in your home are totally
unprotected. Adding a whole-house surge suppressor will protect every
appliance in your home. You should still use the plug-in type on
computers, VCRs, DVD players, TVs, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Voltage surges are often created when motors start and stop. This
could be from a freezer motor in a convenience store down the street
or any nearby business. Even your own vacuum cleaner and dishwasher
motors create surges.</TE>
<TE>   The best whole-house surge suppressors protect your electric items
from almost all surges other than a direct lightning strike. Many
include a free $10,000 to $25,000 warranty to replace items a voltage
surge has damaged. The appliance will be replaced with a new one, not
just prorated for its age.</TE>
<TE>   A surge suppressor works by absorbing a voltage spike above a
certain level (clamping voltage). The absorbed energy is dissipated
safely through a ground wire. If there is an exceptionally powerful
voltage surge, the components inside the surge suppressor will burn
out to protect your equipment.</TE>
<TE>   There are several whole-house surge suppressor designs: circuit
breaker box mounting, beneath the electric meter or built into a
circuit breaker. The circuit breaker design has only one ground wire,
while the others attach with three wires. Your utility company will
often install the beneath-the-electric-meter design.</TE>
<TE>   The performance specifications are more important to a surge
suppressor's effectiveness than its mounting method. The features to
compare are clamping voltage (lower is better), maximum surge current
(higher is better), total energy dissipated (higher is better) and
reaction time (lower is better).</TE>
<TE>   Some whole-house models also include connectors to provide surge
protection for TV/modem cable lines. Using a plug-in model with
telephone line protection is wise for computer modems.</TE>

buyer's guide to the 13 best whole-house and plug-in surge suppressor
manufacturers listing reaction times, maximum surge, clamping
voltage, prices and features.</TE>
<TE>   Operable Fireplace Doors Send Heat Up Chimney</TE>
<TE>   Q: We are remodeling our living room, and I thought of installing
a two-sided fireplace with glass doors that open. It will be between
the living room and the dining room. Is this an efficient way to heat
both rooms?</TE>
<TE>   A: Many of the major fireplace manufacturers offer two-sided
fireplaces in gas and wood-burning designs. A model with gas logs and
sealed glass covers will probably be your best choice for efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The efficiency problem with a design with doors that open is that
too much indoor air may be lost up the chimney. Even with the doors
closed, it is difficult to have them all seal well enough to prevent
excess room air loss.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the Quality of Various Mini-Blinds</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am planning to buy some mini-blinds for privacy and to block
heat loss through my windows.</TE>
<TE>   There is a huge price range from name-brand styles to home center
lines.</TE>
<TE>   What should I look for when comparing them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Although mini-blinds do not provide much insulation value to
block heat loss through a window, they can create an effective
dead-air space near the window. They can also block unwanted glare
during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The thickness and rigidity of the individual slats is a good
indication of the quality of the mini-blinds.</TE>
<TE>   Also compare the strength of the top section that mounts in the
window opening. This is most important in wide windows.</TE>

closet known as "the mother-in-law room"; a secret, spacious balcony
accessed by opening a door in the back of a bedroom closet; and a
door off the kitchen that leads to a staircase and the "maid's room"
on the second floor. There is also a water closet with a working
toilet in the garden.</TE>
<TE>   The home was recently restored and now has central heat, a
retrofitted foundation and a new roof.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $750,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: Four bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,500 square feet</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home has spectacular views of downtown L.A., even

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Helen Hunt has listed her newly built, Hollywood Hills home
on 10 acres at $8.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   About three acres of the site had been swashbuckling actor Errol
Flynn's estate until he died in 1959. The Flynn estate was later
owned by singer-actor Rick Nelson.</LD>
<LD>   Before Hunt bought the site in 1997, Flynn's house, the scene of
many Hollywood parties, had been razed. Hunt, who married actor Hank
Azaria in 1999, started to build a family home.</LD>
<TE>   However, after she filed for divorce in December 2000, the home
being built on the site seemed too large for her, particularly since
Hunt spends a lot of time in New York. She put the home on the market
after it was completed earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style home has five bedrooms in 12,000 square
feet. The estate also has two office suites, a theater with a
projection room, reception-lobby and wet bar, a large gym and a guest
house.</TE>
<TE>   There is a 1,000-square-foot porch with sweeping view of the San
Fernando Valley. The porch was Hunt's idea, said her mother,
co-listing agent Jane Hunt. Rick Pollack of Santa Monica designed and
built the home, keeping the actress' wishes in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Inside and out, the home reflects her desire for privacy. The
bathtub in the master suite has a valley view that can be covered in
seconds by a motorized shade, although "the house was built so there
is no need for window coverings," said Mary DeLoach, the co-listing
agent.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar-winning actress ("As Good as It Gets," 1997) also
expanded the site with her purchase of seven adjoining acres.</TE>
<TE>   Among the few remnants from Flynn's days on the property are a
tennis court, an area for viewing the game and some meandering
pathways.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn's pool has been filled in but there is room for a pool on
three sides of the house. Next to the guest house, there is an
orchard filled with lemon, apple and kumquat trees. The grounds also
include a meadow with oaks, sycamores and weeping willows.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, who has a number of film and TV projects in development,
probably will not elect to build and sell another home any time soon.
Asked if Hunt would do it again, her mother said, "Probably not for a
while. It's quite an undertaking."</TE>
<TE>   The actress, 38, was a presenter at last Sunday's 74th Academy
Awards. The multiple Emmy Award-winning co-star of the '90s sitcom
"Mad About You" had a leading role in Woody Allen's "The Curse of the
Jade Scorpion" (2001), and she co-starred opposite Tom Hanks in "Cast
Away," had a leading role with Mel Gibson in "What Women Want" and
starred with Kevin Spacey in "Pay It Forward," all in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   DeLoach and Jane Hunt share the listing at Coldwell Banker
Previews, Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Former Clippers forward Loy Vaught, who retired from the
Washington Wizards in November after a 12-year NBA career, has
purchased a Brentwood home for about its $2.8-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Vaught bought a Mediterranean-style home in a gated community of
about 20 homes.</TE>
<TE>   His new home has five bedrooms in 7,200 square feet. The house
also has four fireplaces, an infinity pool, a spa and a three-car
garage with guest quarters. The community has shared tennis and
basketball courts.</TE>
<TE>   Vaught, 35, played with the Clippers for eight seasons before
signing with the Detroit Pistons in 1998. He was traded to the Dallas
Mavericks before he joined the Wizards, where he was sidelined with
back problems. He had two years remaining on his contract, which the
Wizards bought out for about $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is active in the acquisition and development of shopping
centers, offices and multi-residential properties in Southern
California. His real estate portfolio is said to be worth more than
$40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Armen and Artak Dovlatian of Specialized Realty represented Vaught
in buying his new home.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Spendlove, president of motion picture music for Miramax
Films, has purchased a home for about $1.5 million and sold his
former home for $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Spendlove, who supervised soundtracks for "The Shipping News"
(2001) and "Scary Movie 2" (2001) as well as for "Scream 3" (2000)
and "Reindeer Games" (2000), bought a 6,000-square-foot house in the
Hollywood Hills with seven bedrooms and unobstructed city views.</TE>
<TE>   He sold his Hollywood Hills home with three bedrooms in about
2,500 square feet to Century City attorney Malcolm McNeil and his
wife, Shahrezad. Spendlove, 37, had remodeled the home, built in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Spendlove, who also was the executive producer of Sting's
Oscar-nominated song performed at the Academy Awards, plans to
completely rehab his new home, built in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Cohen of Re/Max Olson, Westlake Village, represented
Spendlove in his purchase and sale; Doris Fannin and Daphne Dumas of
Prudential-John Aaroe, Hancock Park, represented the McNeils.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Shirley Mitchell, widow of composer Jay Livingston, has
purchased a furnished condominium in Westwood for just under the
asking price of $2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, 3,300-square-foot condo is in a 21-story tower
with views of Century City, the L.A. Country Club and Beverly Hills.
The unit has two balconies, a steam shower and a spa tub. The
building has a pool and a gym.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who does voice-overs, appeared in such TV series as "The
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," "Petticoat Junction" and "I Love Lucy," in
which she played Marion Strong. She played Mrs. Dewitt in the movie
"The War of the Roses" (1989).</TE>
<TE>   Livingston, who co-wrote such popular Oscar-winning songs as
"Buttons and Bows" and "Mona Lisa," died in October at 86.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had been married since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Dannenberg-Weinstock of Prudential-John Aaroe, Beverly
Hills, represented Mitchell in buying; Steve and Karen Heiferman of
Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Actor-comedian Robert Cait, who has done voice work in such
animated movies as "Captain Sturdy" (2001) and "In Search of Peace"
(2000), and his wife, Michelle, have sold their Hollywood Hills home
to L.A.-based fashion trendsetter Lisa Kline and her husband, Robert
Bryson, a financial planner. The asking price was about $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   The home, which has three bedrooms and a hot tub, sold with
multiple offers.The Caits bought a five-bedroom home in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Kline owns two Robertson Boulevard boutiques: Lisa Kline and Lisa
Kline Men. Her celebrity clients have included Britney Spears, Reese
Witherspoon, Cameron Diaz and Kate Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Debby Cannon of Prudential-John Aaroe, Beverly Hills, had the
listing; Nancy Sanborn and Lucy Matsumoto of the same office
represented the buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The West L.A. home of the late Maude Chasen, who helped to run the
popular Beverly Hills restaurant Chasen's for half a century, has
been sold for close to its $1.65-million asking price. There were
multiple offers on the three-bedroom, 2,700-square-foot condo, which
sold to local residents seeking to downsize.</TE>
<TE>   Chasen died in December at 97. Her husband, who started the
entertainment-industry gathering spot, died in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Brant of Coldwell Banker, Brentwood East, had the listing;
Frank Jakwerth of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, represented
the buyers.</TE>

<HD>There's No Changing Her Spots</HD>
<DH>Actress and animal activist Tippi Hedren is right at home
in Antelope Valley, caring for wildcats and an elephant in her
decades-old refuge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tippi Hedren keeps a mountain lion outside her kitchen, two African
wildcats known as servals off her bedroom and a liger, an offspring
of a lion and a tiger, behind a fence a few feet from her front
porch.</LD>
<LD>   The actress, who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" (1963)
and "Marnie" (1964), also has elephants in her house. Not live
ones--they're part of a collection of jewelry and art. But the cats
are real, and an adult elephant does share the grounds.</LD>
<LD>   Hedren lives in the Antelope Valley, 40 miles northeast of Los
Angeles, in a wild-animal sanctuary she named Shambala--Sanskrit for
a meeting place of peace and harmony for all beings, animal and
human.</LD>
<TE>   Home to the actress since the mid-'70s, Shambala is a refuge for
about 60 big cats and Timbo, a 45-year-old African bull elephant. All
of the cats were born in the U.S. Some were kept as youngsters in
private homes. Many were abused.</TE>
<TE>   None should be considered a pet, Hedren said, who first became
interested in the plight of wildlife while filming in Africa during
the late '60s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that she opens a window in her house to let Daisy, the
mountain lion, get a drink from the kitchen sink.</TE>
<TE>   Forget that Hedren steps onto the deck and into the yard off her
bedroom to summon a serval named Bugs Bunny.</TE>
<TE>   These cats are predators. Asked if she has ever been bitten,
Hedren said, "It comes with the territory, but I've had no bad
bites--I'm still here."</TE>
<TE>   She and her 11-member staff have learned how to treat the animals
"with the dignity and respect they should have," she said. Of course,
gaining that knowledge took time.</TE>
<TE>   Shambala, in Soledad Canyon with a post office box in Acton, was
founded by Hedren in 1972, the year Timbo arrived after being evicted
from a game park in the Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren moved to the sanctuary, then on 40 acres on the edge of the
Mojave Desert, when her house was built there in 1976. Before that
she had lived in Sherman Oaks and Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Rustically elegant, her Shambala house is decorated in leopard and
tiger prints and such Hedren collectibles as stuffed toys of lions
and other animals. "I collect everything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The one-story house has two bedrooms and two bathrooms in an
estimated 3,000 square feet plus outside decking for another 1,000
square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Hedren has added onto the house and Shambala,
which has the Santa Clara River running through it. Roar, the
nonprofit foundation that operates Shambala and is headed by Hedren,
recently acquired another 32 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "And I've added rooms," Hedren said. She calls one, which was
formerly part of the porch, the Raintree Room "because there is a
tree in it, and it rains in here."</TE>
<TE>   The room also has a love seat and a leopard-print rug, an African
mask, lots of plants and a cat tree for her domesticated animals.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren has six house cats. Five have the first and last names of
actors in her life: Melanie Griffith, her daughter; Antonio Banderas,
Griffith's husband; Rod Taylor, her co-star in "The Birds"; Marlon
Brando, one of her co-stars in "A Countess From Hong Kong" (1967);
and John Saxon, her co-star in one of a couple of movies she made in
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the cats are taken by "catmobile--as opposed to
Batmobile," Hedren said, to the Shambala gift shop and office for a
change of scenery. Most of the time, the cats stay in the house.
Signs in both places read: "Please don't let the cat out, no matter
what it tells you."</TE>
<TE>   Another sign, which marks Hedren's dressing room, says "Tippi
Hedren" on a star like those on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her
dressing room is big enough to be a bedroom, and in fact was her
bedroom until she added on a room with a Dutch door for viewing the
large-eared servals, which she sometimes walks on a leash.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren also can see the liger up close from the bedroom window,
which her bed faces, often with Rod Taylor--the house cat, not the
actor--snoozing on the canopy.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the house, Hedren has filled walls, tops of credenzas
and other furnishings with photos of herself and her extended family.</TE>
<TE>   There are pictures of her famous daughter and son-in-law,
snapshots of her three grandchildren and photos of wild animals that
Hedren took. Some of her photos and sketches have sold for as much as
$1,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Many are of her favorite Shambala animals, such as Natasha, a
tigress. "She lived her whole life with me," the actress said.
Natasha died at 19.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren's house also has a dining room, family room, sitting room,
gift wrapping/sewing room and guest quarters.</TE>
<TE>   There is a detached guest house on the grounds, where Hedren's
daughter has stayed. The guest house, actually a safari tent on a
platform, is available to the public for a price.</TE>
<TE>   With a gift of $2,500 to Shambala, which depends on donations to
house and feed the animals, a couple can stay overnight on a
featherbed in the tent from April to October. The price covers a tour
of the preserve, cocktails and a gourmet dinner.</TE>
<TE>   A shower off the guest house has a window. "I put it in so you can
watch the tiger and the tiger can watch you," Hedren said. Diners on
the veranda get a view of the elephant. After-dinner conversation is
punctuated by the sounds of big cats.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast brings out the ravens and other birds. Ravens were
Hedren's nemesis in the thriller "The Birds," but she looks kindly on
them now.</TE>
<TE>   The exotic cats and elephant at Shambala stay in their habitats
unless taken on walks or to other places, like the makeshift jungle
made with fresh boughs and bushes by elephant handler Chris Gallucci,
who helped build Hedren's house.</TE>
<TE>   Among the animals are retired circus and Las Vegas performers, old
TV and movie actors and big cats that were considered cute gifts when
they were little but too much for their owners to handle as
adolescents and adults.</TE>
<TE>   A cheetah born in Oregon with three legs came to Shambala at
birth. "We taught her how to stand, how to walk," Hedren said. "Now
she runs."</TE>
<TE>   Georgie, a black leopard, came to the sanctuary during a divorce.
Neither husband nor wife could decide who should get the animal.
"They're still deciding," Hedren said, "and Georgie has been with us
now for 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Leo, a lion, was living unhappily in somebody's basement in
Branson, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian lynx came to Shambala without a name. "So we had a
contest," Hedren said, and the winner was Garvey, sent in by a class
of schoolchildren in the Garvey School District in Rosemead. The
contest was held through the preserve's Partners in Education
program, designed to inspire students to learn more about saving
endangered animals.</TE>
<TE>   Shambala is not a zoo, but it is occasionally open to the public.
For groups willing to pay at least $35 a person, the refuge is open
about once a month. A donor paying a minimum of $75 a month can
attend "Adopt a Wild One Day." Shambala can be reached on the Web at
www.shambala.org or by phone at (661) 268-0380.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren is passionate about her work at the refuge and plans to
introduce her Shambala Wild Animal Protection Act to Congress in the
fall. The act would require permits and licenses to keep such
protected wild animals as lions and tigers. Hedren has lobbied for
similar legislation for some time with the intent of ending so-called
canned hunting on ranches in states where captive animals are stalked
by hunters for sport. She is also against domestic breeding of exotic
animals. Shambala does not breed, buy, sell or trade animals.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of her time is spent as an animal activist, Hedren is
still an actress. Since she starred in "The Birds" in her 20s, she
has appeared on TV as well as in movies, including "Tea With
Grandma," for which she just won a best actress award at the New York
Film Festival. She also was in the movie "The Sixth Sense," the CBS
series "The Bold and the Beautiful" and the thriller "Pacific
Heights," co-starring her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The two were also in the docudrama "Roar" (1981), the namesake of
her foundation. "Roar" was directed by Noel Marshall, her second
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Hedren has been single now for more than a decade, but she is
never alone at home in Shambala.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love my house," she said, "and I love the animals. I
love them all."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although elated that Charles Chang was able to purchase and renovate
his first home ("From Junkyard to Gem," Pardon Our Dust, March 17), I
was also infuriated to read that his neighbors had to put up with the
"dilapidated, junk-strewn rental property" before the make-over. This
illustrates the lack of concern some property owners have toward
their rentals and toward the people who live in those neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of homeowners have worked hard to attain their dream
of owning a piece of property. Why do they have to live among those,
be it the renters or the property owners, who could care less about
the condition of a property?</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope articles like these not only shed light on the
possibilities for a better house, but also on the possibilities for
better neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   PILAR LERMA</TE>
<TE>   East Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading Pardon Our Dust, we would like to see a follow-up
piece on exactly where every dollar was spent.</TE>
<TE>   We are planning an inexpensive remodel of two bathrooms and a
kitchen and we're at around $20,000. The person in the story chose
cost-effective solutions, but we looked at extremely inexpensive
cabinets for the kitchen and they're $4,500. How do you gut and redo
a kitchen (and add a hardwood floor) for $3,500? How do you redo a
bathroom for the price in the article? We would be very interested to
know.</TE>
<TE>   STEVE and SUZANNE WELKE</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The writer, Kathy Price-Robinson, responds:</TE>
<TE>   You and several other readers found the $45,000 price of the
remodel hard to believe. But after following up with the banker, the
contractor and a carpenter on the job, I'm convinced the prices are
accurate (however, the homeowner paid $1,200 for new kitchen
appliances, which was not part of the price quoted).</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons the cost of the remodel was so low.</TE>
<TE>   * The contractor, Michael Hinkson, buys materials and products in
advance and on sale, sometimes during close-out sales for 50% off,
then offers them to homeowners or apartment owners at a discount. He
makes a profit, yet the client saves over retail.</TE>
<TE>   * Subcontractors, such as carpenters and floor refinishers,
typically charge contractors 25% to 30% less than they charge
homeowners. Contractor Hinkson passed this savings on to the
homeowner, Charles Chang.</TE>
<TE>   * The homeowner did hours and hours of research on each trade and
product, compiling a thick notebook of facts and figures by the time
he hired the contractor.</TE>
<TE>   He is, Hinkson said, "a shrewd negotiator," and was able to
negotiate each element of the remodel to the rock-bottom minimum.</TE>
<TE>   * Most important, Chang was satisfied with low-end materials and
products. The kitchen cabinets were painted pressboard, the bathroom
floor a basic white tile. Because Chang did not respond to the urge
to upgrade, he kept the price very low.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Dust in Ducts Can Cause Serious Health Problems" (News in
Brief, March 17): It is true that the EPA does not regulate air duct
cleaning in a manner like asbestos and lead, but to say that the
agency does not "address" duct cleaning is incorrect.</LD>
<LD>   A search of the EPA Web site for "air duct cleaning" pulls up 11
items.</LD>
<LD>   The EPA published an excellent brochure on the issue, and it is
available online at www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/airduct.html.</LD>
<TE>   The bottom line is that the EPA does not recommend air duct
cleaning except in unusual situations.</TE>

<LD>So the American Bankers Assn. has sent more than 54,000 letters to
Congress ("Bills Would Block Banks From Selling Real Estate," March
17) in an effort to pressure lawmakers to defeat proposed
legislation.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side we have the California Assn. of Realtors and the
National Assn. of Realtors mounting their agents in an effort to push
the legislation through.</LD>
<LD>   But wait a minute ... for the last 20 years real estate agents,
brokers and most national franchised real estate offices have been
offering everything from mortgages, escrows, title insurance and
termite repairs--all in the name of service.</LD>

<LD>Water is a precious commodity, particularly in drought years, but
rain can be a cause of serious damage to homes.</LD>
<LD>   Poor watershed and drainage will cause soil to swell, leading to
cracks over windows and doors. It can cause doors to stick and cause
rot in siding and framing under the house. Even though the winter
rains are over, it's still a good idea to waterproof your home by
installing roof gutters and downspouts.</LD>
<LD>   Make sure that downspouts discharge into drainage pipes that carry
water away from the house. Soil or concrete that surround the home
should slope away from the foundation to further minimize damage.</LD>

<DH>Angels: Sele, Appier strengthen rotation, but team has to
have Salmon and Erstad bounce back from poor seasons and newcomer
Fullmer produce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN PETERS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels are well-armed headed into the season. Now if they can
just hit.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels considerably strengthened their pitching over the
winter by acquiring two quality starters in Aaron Sele and Kevin
Appier.</LD>
<LD>   Even with what shapes up as one of the league's best staffs, they
won't contend in the talent-laden AL West unless two old hands, Tim
Salmon and Darin Erstad, and newcomer Brad Fullmer can provide some
punch on offense.</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, the Angels have been a good hitting club that
lacked pitching. But last season, their pitching was improved, but
they ranked 12th in the league with just 691 runs, ahead of only
Baltimore and Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who had a career average of .290 with four 30-homer
seasons, underwent shoulder surgery after the 2000 season and never
really got on track last year. He slumped to .227 with 17 home runs
and 49 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, slowed by a strained ligament in his right knee and other
ailments, batted .258 with nine homers and 63 RBIs. The previous
season, he hit .355 with 24 homers and 100 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn missed the entire season after surgery to repair a torn
biceps tendon and was dealt to the New York Mets for Appier in
December.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels acquired Fullmer, who figures to be the designated
hitter most of the time and can also fill in at first base, in a
trade with Toronto. Fullmer hit .274 and had 18 homers and 83 RBIs
last season. The previous year with Toronto, he hit .295 with 32
homers and 104 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia expects Salmon and Erstad, who were both
sound and hitting again this spring, to bounce back this season, and
hopes Fullmer can have another year like he did in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Two hitters who did come through for the Angels last year were
Garret Anderson (.289, 28 HRs, 123 RBIs) and Troy Glaus (41 HRs, 108
RBIs).</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finished third in the division in each of Scioscia's
first two years as manager, and he believes they have the talent to
make a run at the playoffs this season. He's particularly pleased
with the acquisitions of Sele and Appier.</TE>
<TE>   "They're unique because they're veteran pitchers who are still
extremely productive. You look at the number of innings they've
pitched combined with the playoff experience and the whole package,
and there's something that was sorely needed in our organization,"
Scioscia said. "Hopefully our younger pitchers will grow into that
experience and have that playoff experience they have and keep
passing it on.</TE>
<TE>   "They're outstanding competitors and we're looking for them to
produce the way they have the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   Sele, 31, signed as a free agent, was 15-5 with a 3.60 earned-run
average and pitched 215 innings last season. Appier, 34, was 11-10
with a 3.57 ERA and worked 2062/3 innings for the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   They join a rotation that includes Ramon Ortiz (13-11), Jarrod
Washburn (11-10), and Scott Schoeneweis (10-11).</TE>
<TE>   The bullpen includes Dennis Cook, a left-hander signed as a free
agent; and right-handers Ben Weber, Al Levine and Donne Wall in setup
roles. The Angels have one of baseball's best closers, Troy Percival.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finished 75-87 last year, losing 25 of their final 31
games. They'll have to do considerably better this year if they are
to make a run at playoff spot in what may be the major league's
toughest division.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous, the talent in this division," Appier said.
"Oakland won 100 games last year and they finished how many games out
of first?"</TE>
<TE>   The Athletics, who won a wild-card berth, finished 14 games back
of Seattle's 116-46 record.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Texas Rangers look improved, adding Chan Ho Park, Juan
Gonzalez and Carl Everett.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the wild card may come out of the division again," Appier
said. "I feel like we have the talent to win the division, but we
certainly have our work cut out for us."</TE>

<HD>Defense Provides Baseball Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense is baseball's highlight reel, its great and most reliable
source of surprise, spontaneous creativity and pure athletic beauty.
In a sport that is defined by the confrontation between pitcher and
hitter, it is the taut array of fielders who surround that central
battle that provide an infinitely varied kaleidoscope of fresh
possibility.</LD>
<LD>   Hitters and pitchers have their quirks, their individual stances
and windups, which often mirror their personalities. Yet there's a
sameness to them all. Every baseball, thrown or batted, has a
familiar arc. Sometimes a ball goes 100 mph or flies 500 feet, but
that's just a few breathtaking percent beyond the game's norm.</LD>
<LD>   For surprise, defense always offers the game's best chance to
amaze us, send us home muttering, as we claim we do after any game,
"Well, I never saw that before in my whole life."</LD>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. never climbs the center field wall exactly the
same way twice. Why? Because no two long blasts ever fly exactly the
same way, on the same trajectory, through the same breeze, with the
sun in your eyes exactly the same way or with a teammate on a
collision course for you at exactly the same speed. Willie Mays once
noticed that his right fielder was standing, back to the plate,
watching a ball fly over the wall. Mays climbed his back and got it.</TE>
<TE>   Do you fly, eyes fixed on the ball, no matter where it takes
you--like Pete Reiser or the young Bobby Valentine--even if it takes
your career into oblivion? Or do you make judgments of relative
value, unrelated to the game, as you run full speed, hear the crowd,
imagine your teammates and what they'll think of you?</TE>
<TE>   During fielding practice before every game, players work on
fundamentals, trying to utterly erase misfortune from basic plays.</TE>
<TE>   "Make the routine plays and the great plays will take care of
themselves," the old-timers say. Though Brooks Robinson bare-handing
a bunt proved you could meld "great" with "routine."</TE>
<TE>   Yet once the game starts, you realize those pregame drills are
only half the truth. Defense is one part mastering the mundane and
one part perpetual amazement at what the game can throw at you that
is slightly, or diabolically, different.</TE>
<TE>   Once Ozzie Smith dived behind second base just as the ball hit a
rock and bounced crazily behind him. The Wizard reached backward in
flight, barehanded the ball in midair, hopped to his feet and threw
his man out. You're forgiven for the bad hops. Yet every bounce is
unique as backspin switches to topspin. If the moment's right and the
ball takes a flat skip just as you sneak a peek at the base runner,
you can be Bill Buckner. Forever.</TE>
<TE>   Defense is our infinite spontaneous variation on familiar
patterns, a fresh twist or even a full Ozzie flip. A box-seat railing
or a charging 200-pound runner make a dozen plays per game into
something just a little bit unique, and occasionally, ominously
dangerous. Your toes might end up pointing at the moon.</TE>
<TE>   That pop fly, like a million before it, triangulates with perfect
diabolical intent among three sprinting defenders. You can practice
it all your life. You can scream, "I got it" into a wall of 40,000
voices. But it's not like any other "flare." This could be the best
play you ever made. Or the one you wish you'd never tried.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, defense can even be a moment of strategic discovery. If
you're Derek Jeter in last year's American League Championship
Series, you may decide to invent a new shovel-pass cut-off
play--something no one had thought of in 133 previous major league
years--and pull it off on the spot to save a game and a Yankees
pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Once, in Cuba, a quadruple play decided the island championship.
Bases loaded, bottom of the ninth, home team one run behind. Liner to
right in the gap. On instinct, the runners go. Diving catch. Throws
back to second, then first for a triple play. But the runner on third
has tagged in the meantime to score and tie the game. Defensive team
appeals that the runner at third left too soon. Appeal upheld.
"Fourth" out. Run denied. Game over.</TE>
<TE>   That's the gasp of the unexpected-like three runners (usually
Cubs) standing on the same base-which energizes defense. In the '80
World Series, a foul pop jumped out of catcher Bob Boone's mitt. But
Pete Rose anticipated the mistake and caught it. Second baseman Billy
Martin once saved the last game of a Series by realizing nobody had
called for a popup near the mound. He made a diving catch.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is the only major sport in which athletic ability is
routinely subordinated to form. Strength, quickness and technique are
compacted into one gesture--the pitch or the swing--that is repeated
endlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Defense is where baseball lets the genie of athletic genius and
the flair for inspiration have an equal place beside the game's vast
respect for the studious perfection of quotidian routine. Baseball
celebrates dogged dailiness, craftsmanship and a million mind games
full of strategy and situational memory.</TE>

<HD>New-Look Mets Need a Fast Start for Once</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAUN POWELL</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It was in the second series of the 2001 season, a three-game set in
Montreal, when the Mets allowed 25 runs. Or one per Expos fan. That's
when Mike Piazza knew something was up.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time you get swept in any situation, it's tough," Piazza
said. "But that one right there was tougher than most."</LD>
<LD>   The Mets never really recovered from the first weekend of the
season. Or from all of April. Or May. They had no spring in their
spring. By June 1 they were 10 games below .500 and 13 games out of
first place. Given how they eventually mustered a dramatic rally and
came within three games of first place with nine to play, imagine
what a decent start would've meant.</LD>
<TE>   "Or just an average start," Piazza said. "If we had just broken
even, things would've been very interesting at the end. But we never
really gave ourselves a chance."</TE>
<TE>   OK, with April and a promising new season just days away, here's a
tip for the Mets: Give yourselves a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Do like the flowers at this time of year and bloom. Instead of
being the chaser, become the chasee. Build something, don't blow
something.</TE>
<TE>   And for your purposes, "spring break" means give yourself a break,
not take one.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, a 162-game season can't be parceled out into sections.
Nor is one more important than the other. A summer swoon, for
example, can ruin any great spring or fall. Slumps and funks are just
part of the journey. They happen at any time.</TE>
<TE>   "But since I've been here," opening day starter Al Leiter said, "I
don't remember us having what I would call a great April or a very
good spring. It stinks having to play catch-up all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Already, the spring storm clouds are threatening. The Mets aren't
taking much positive momentum into April. They're wrapping up a
somewhat ugly, mostly uneven spring training and giving off mixed
messages. On paper, they're a beautiful collage of power hitting,
speed and slick infield fielding. On the field, they've been another
piece of work.</TE>
<TE>   "A little sloppy" is how Mo Vaughn described it.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Phillips made a lot of sensible moves in the off-season to
build a team for October. But what about the first few months? The
Mets, for some reason, usually make it tough on themselves. As
impressive as the Mets appear to be, remember that the Braves helped
themselves, too. And you know what always happens when the Braves
grab the lead. Like a pitbull with a mailman's leg, they don't let
go.</TE>
<TE>   If another bad start is forthcoming, then you can almost predict
the excuses that'll be given for it. There are four new faces in the
lineup and the chemistry, especially in the field, might take time to
develop. You only needed to see Roberto Alomar and Jeromy Burnitz
allow a fly ball to drop between them the other day to realize that.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn didn't play at all last season because of a ruptured
biceps. The season before in Anaheim, he led the league in
strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   His timing might need, well, more time.</TE>
<TE>   "I've hit almost non-stop from November until spring training,"
Vaughn said. "My manager was telling me to take it easy. But I wanted
to be even with everyone else once spring training started. It's
getting there. I have no doubts about what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Edgardo Alfonzo. He's playing third base for the
first time since '98, but more importantly, he's playing for a
contract. You think he might feel a little urgency in April? More
than anyone else, Fonzie summed up the Mets last spring. He developed
back problems and couldn't raise his batting average much above .250
or drive in many baserunners. It was a dreadful sight, watching a top
five second baseman suddenly hit with Rey Ordonez-like results.</TE>
<TE>   But last season's early stumble wasn't all about hitting. Steve
Trachsel and the since-departed Kevin Appier had rough moments, too.</TE>
<TE>   Trachsel didn't get his first win until April 30 and then, after
getting whacked for four homers in a single inning and prompting
Manager Bobby Valentine to erupt, was sent to Triple-A on May 18.
That probably was the low point right there, when the Mets had to
tell a pitcher they'd just signed for millions that he needed
remedial work in the minors.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember in '99, after we brought a lot of guys in, our April
and May wasn't that good, either," Piazza said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets stood 27-24 after the first two months in 1999 and needed
a one-game playoff to squeeze into the postseason. So at least it
says something about their ability to rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Leiter said, "but I'd rather get out of the blocks and
stay ahead. Like the Seattle Mariners last year."</TE>

<HD>Injured Jordan Is on Last Legs</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Player, coach admit his days are limited if he
can't stay free of injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WILBON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of course Michael Jordan isn't going to play a second season with
Washington if he's in and out of surgery, on and off the injured
list, in and out of the lineup. Doug Collins said it Wednesday,
Jordan said it Thursday, and why this has caused a firestorm I have
no idea. It's common sense, nothing else. Collins only said what most
of us have felt the last few weeks, since Jordan was forced from the
lineup with the first surgery of his career. Jordan, not
surprisingly, said exactly the same thing.</LD>
<LD>   "'I've been saying all along that if I'm not capable of playing
next year, why would I play?" Jordan said after practice Thursday.
"Based on what Doug sees that I've been going through as of late,
obviously he would have his opinion about it. I'm not mad at him.
It's an observation and as a coach you have observations like that.
That would be my observation, too. If I felt this way, I'd be totally
surprised if I'm playing next season."</LD>
<LD>   I'm wondering what else people expect Jordan to say, what other
tack he should take.</LD>
<TE>   "I have all intentions," he said, "of (playing) out my contract.
If I physically can't, if I have to go through the same situation I'm
going through right now, it's not meaningful. (But) you guys are
asking me to make a decision about next season now based off the way
I feel right now and that's not really fair."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if Jordan feels healthy enough, if he feels
physically the way he did approaching the NBA All-Star break when he
and the Wizards were on a roll, he plans to play again. If he
doesn't, he won't.</TE>
<TE>   Is it that earth-shattering for this story to be the lead on
sports show or front pages?</TE>
<TE>   Yep, apparently so.</TE>
<TE>   Silly me. When Collins told me Wednesday on the set of ESPN's
"Pardon The Interruption" that he would be surprised if Jordan went
through all this again next season, it sounded logical enough to me.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been saying all season long that if I'm going to go through
surgeries and things like that with my knee I wouldn't play, it
wouldn't be wise for me to play," Jordan said. And Collins said, "I
don't know what the big news is. I don't think anything was said that
everybody didn't know.... It's interesting how I said nothing
yesterday that's different from what Michael's been saying all year,
but it gets all this attention."</TE>
<TE>   Collins and I had a momentary lapse. We should both know why it
gets all this attention.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in, oh, 1989 a bigger deal was made of Jordan than
seemed reasonable at times. By 1992 anything he did was news. When he
came back to the game after a 20-month retirement in March of 1995,
anything he did and stuff he didn't do were considered "news."</TE>
<TE>   Readers, viewers and listeners can't get enough, neither can most
of the people covering him, nor can the corporate sponsors and even
people inside the international basketball community. Perhaps it's a
natural reaction when you appear on screen with Bugs Bunny and have a
cologne and apparel with your own likeness in the form of a log.
Also, it's insane.</TE>
<TE>   Any declarative sentence spoken by anybody two degrees of
separation from Jordan is an absolute story. I told a Post editor
back in January of 2000 when Jordan arrived to run the Wizards on a
day-to-day basis that I feared covering him would be like covering a
second president. Wednesday's tornado of activity suggests I wasn't
as far off as I'd like to have been.</TE>
<TE>   Collins clearly was caught off guard by the whole swirl, and I
don't blame him. I certainly hope this doesn't make him guarded all
of a sudden, because the reason I have been dying to have Collins as
a guest on PTI, the reason I've stood in front of him with a notebook
or tape recorder for 15 years and counting, is that he's the best
damn basketball analyst ever. He's the most insightful, to-the-point,
dead-on man I've ever listened to on the subject of professional
basketball. You can watch basketball every day for the rest of your
life and see less than half of what Collins sees in half the time.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't say anything controversial Wednesday, he just made the
observation a coach ought to make. Collins wasn't speaking for
Jordan, or disclosing something secret. He made a point that more of
us probably should have made earlier, that Jordan is playing on one
leg and nowhere near healthy but is doing so to help his team make
the playoffs. That's the larger point Collins made quite eloquently.</TE>
<TE>   But any observation that insightful made by someone that close to
Jordan is a big stuff.</TE>
<TE>   My guess, and that's all it is, is that Jordan will do everything
in his control to play again next season. If there's any way he can
stay relatively healthy, he'll go.</TE>

<KH>French Polynesia</KH>
<HD>Awash in Tropical Bliss on Bora-Bora</HD>
<DH>Under the spell of waving palms and colorful fish, a family
finds paradise--mostly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBBIE SEAMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BORA-BORA, French Poly- nesia</DL>
<LD>BORA-BORA, French Polynesia--We felt like characters out of "Peter
Pan" flying over a colorful kingdom, my son, Lachlan, and I agreed
later. Arms spread like wings, holding hands, we were swept along
with surprising force by the ostensibly tranquil teal waters of the
tropical lagoon. Wide-eyed behind our snorkeling masks, we gazed at
the coral gardens below.</LD>
<LD>   Tugging at my arm, one of my 61/2-year-old twin boys pointed out
wonders along the way: jutting branches of coral, resplendent in hues
of royal blue, purple, lavender and dark yellow; broad, black patches
of porcupine-like quills where sea urchins nestled together near
hollows in the coral outcroppings; flashes of vivid colors and
intriguing designs. Nor did the magic dissipate after our heads broke
the surface. Deposited by the current on a motu, or islet, its white
beaches thickly fringed by coconut palms, we walked around a point
and were rewarded with a knockout view of Bora-Bora. This gem of a
tropical island, the higher of its two volcanic peaks shrouded in
mist, gleamed green against the pale waters of the lagoon. My own
Bali Hai.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, it was partly because I had heard that Bora-Bora was the
inspiration for that song in the musical "South Pacific" that I
heeded the island's call. (I later learned it wasn't, but never
mind.) Conjuring up visions of tropical flowers in flowing black hair
and bronzed bodies wrapped in bright fabrics--I have always been a
devout "tropo-phile"--Bora-Bora became my dream destination.</TE>
<TE>   Bora-Bora lies 165 miles northwest of Tahiti in French Polynesia's
Society Islands and is only about 20 miles in circumference. Its very
name is provocatively primitive. Persuading my husband, Warren
Lancaster, that we and our sons should have a real vacation on the
way back from visiting his family in Australia, I booked us for eight
days here last winter. I was determined that we would become beach
creatures and, if possible, manage to slow down time itself.</TE>
<TE>   We were not disappointed. Succumbing willingly to tropical torpor,
we were happy to do little more than snorkel and take the
shark-and-ray-feeding expedition that landed us on the motu.
Bora-Bora is not for the easily bored, who might find more action on
the larger Tahitian island of Moorea, but rather for those who have
enough stimulation and stress back home, thank you. Had it not been
for Lachlan and Cameron and their constant inquiries about what we
would be doing next, we might have slowed time to a crawl.</TE>
<TE>   Bora-Bora is enticingly exotic in a way that no place I have
traveled to can replicate, including Hawaii. It's impossible for me
not to love a place where every restaurant has a thatched roof and an
open-air veranda, and where even the soap smells of coconut and
gardenia. On Bora-Bora, men as well as women wear flowers behind
their ears--the left side signals that you're taken, the right that
you're available--and pull their raven mane back from their face,
weaving it with palm fronds and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Both sexes also sport pareus (PA-ray-ewz)--large rectangles of
brightly colored fabric tied at the waist into a wraparound
skirt--along with necklaces of shells and beads. It doesn't take long
for most visitors to aspire to this particular sartorial splendor.</TE>
<TE>   Even with those multihued blue waters and green volcanic peaks,
Bora-Bora could not be Bali Hai without the warmth of its people. We
felt embraced and welcomed, never merely tolerated. When we and our
children were without a place to eat one holiday night--the special
dinner at our hotel, Le Maitai Polynesia, seemed prohibitively
expensive--the host of the snack bar at a simple accommodation called
Village Pauline made room for us in what already was a full house. We
subsequently enjoyed a festive multinational barbecue that blended
locals, American backpackers and French soldiers on leave.</TE>
<TE>   When I was jogging one morning and distracted by a beachside
clothesline pinned with pareus, the women selling them (for about $10
each) insisted I take the two I wanted even though I didn't have
enough cash with me. When I later returned with the money, they sent
me off with an extra.</TE>
<TE>   Our journey to Bora-Bora did not start out auspiciously. Low on
cash, we arrived in Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia on the
main island of Tahiti, and discovered that our bank cards, which
worked fine in Australia and Europe, didn't work at these ATMs. We
foolishly hadn't bothered with traveler's checks, so we ended up
charging money to our hotel bill, a luxury that came with a 5%
commission. Island life was already costly enough: We tried to keep
costs down by buying snacks and beverages at the island grocery
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was our first night on Bora-Bora, spent about four
miles south of the main town of Vaitape at a hotel on Matira Beach,
where many of the island's hotels and resorts are clustered. I awoke
in the wee hours, sweating and swatting mosquitoes. To be fair, our
bungalow was standard for the island in that it had no
air-conditioning or screens on the louvered windows, only a pretty
useless mosquito coil and an equally futile ceiling fan. And although
most of our days on Bora-Bora were sunny, we were there in the
warmer, muggier "wet season" between November and May, when
mosquitoes can be a nocturnal nuisance. Our bungalow did not get the
sea breezes, so I vowed to find a hotel with air-conditioning the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes away by foot down the main road that circles the
island, Le Maitai Polynesia was able to accommodate us. Like other
upscale hotels on Bora-Bora, it offers breezy over-water bungalows
but also has less expensive, more traditional accommodations across
the road from the beach. Our room had a view of the sea and a sofa
bed for our kids. At $231 a night it was more expensive than our
first hotel, but mosquitoes had not figured in my tropical fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   Although my mood improved dramatically, I soon wondered if somehow
we had displeased the local deities. I arrived back at our first
hotel to find that Lachlan had been bitten by a stray dog on the
beach when he approached it and was screaming in my husband's arms as
they waited for a doctor. I held my son while the doctor stitched up
wounds on both sides of his hand--at the same table in the hotel's
beachside restaurant where we had just eaten breakfast--and listened
incredulously as the doctor reassured me that there was no rabies on
the island. (Although the medical clinic and the police on Bora-Bora
backed him up, I took no chances and had Lachlan start a series of
vaccinations when we got home.)</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Lachlan was showing off his bandages, and we
were relaxing over salads and sandwiches at our new hotel's beach
restaurant while a stunning array of pareus displayed overhead swayed
in the breeze. A couple of days later we saw an image that seemed
even more quintessentially Bora-Boran. As we all swam around the
patches of coral close to shore, I spied about a dozen bright red
hibiscus blossoms bobbing in the bright blue waters, blowing in our
direction. A local later told me that it was a tradition for people
leaving the island to throw their crowns or necklaces of flowers into
the lagoon. If the flowers made it to land, it meant that the person
would return.</TE>
<TE>   What was below the water, though, proved a constant fascination
for us, especially the boys, whom I watched metamorphose into
veritable amphibians. The highlight of the week was the day we spent
offshore on the lagoon, with about a dozen other visitors of various
nationalities, on a trip organized by Moanareva Tours and the hotel.
Wearing fins or rubber reef sandals to protect our feet from the
sharp coral, we rolled off the motorized outrigger canoe that was our
transportation. Then, under the tutelage of Tepoe Pere, our principal
guide, we gathered on one side of a rope barrier to watch as dozens
of small, black-tipped reef sharks and manta rays congregated for a
feeding.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the sharks were shy (and not dangerous), the rays were
downright sociable. About 4 feet in wingspan with a tail of equal
length, the gray-skinned creatures were silky and slippery to the
touch. As long as no one made sudden movements that could alarm them,
they would come up and rest their flaps on the shoulders of our
guides, appearing to embrace them like long-lost friends, and take
pieces of fish right from their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   During the subsequent visit to the coral garden, we saw
black-and-white zebra fish, pale, nearly translucent needlefish,
brilliant blue damselfish and yellow, black and white angelfish. We
lunched later on Motu Piti Aau (or as it is informally called, Motu
Roa), "the long motu" across from Bora-Bora's west side. Tepoe,
swashbuckling as a pirate at the helm of our boat, emerged onshore to
give a coconut-opening demonstration, dressed only in a hie oviri (a
"wild crown" of tropical vines) and a shocking-pink-and-white pareu.</TE>
<TE>   The coconut, its meat sliced and shared among us, was just an
appetizer. On a pavilion under a thatched roof, laid out on palm
fronds on one of several long tables, were plates of tuna and chicken
barbecued by our guides, as well as bowls of rice and corn salad,
baked bananas, raw tuna marinated in lime juice, and freshly cut
slices of papaya and mango. This type of buffet, similar to the one
we had enjoyed at Village Pauline, is easily the most satisfying kind
of meal on Bora-Bora, never mind the generally pricey French cuisine
that comes with the territory.</TE>
<TE>   The multilingual Tepoe was a fount of information and local lore
as well as a chef. Piloting the boat around the island, he pointed
out Bora-Bora's highest peak, Otemanu, 2,384 feet high, which
reportedly has never been climbed because the stone of its sheer
faces is too soft and crumbly. He showed us the rusted cannons
protruding from the island's hillside foliage, remnants of the days
when more than 4,000 American troops were stationed here during World
War II. When it was time to depart Bora-Bora a few days later, I
created a crown of red hibiscus blooms, purple bougainvillea and some
flamboyant red and yellow spiky flowers found by the road near our
hotel. As the launch from Vaitape to the airport on Motu Mute motored
past a beach, I braved a rare rain to go to the top level and gaze at
the receding greenery. Lifting the floral crown from my head, I threw
it in the lagoon, accompanying it with a little prayer that the
flowers would float to terra firma and that we would see Bora-Bora's
shores again.</TE>

<LD>Midnight buffets and jangling casinos may be fine for the average
cruiser. But there's a different group of vacation sailors who want a
more authentic taste of seafaring: a ship that you don't need a floor
plan to navigate and whose activities are geared toward life at sea
and the ports visited. For these voyagers, we introduce three smaller
cruise companies that offer reasonably priced vacations with
interesting itineraries and well-staffed ships of human size and
scale.</LD>
<LD>   World Explorer Cruises:  This one-ship cruise company has big
ambitions. While the competition dashes around Alaska, stopping for a
couple of hours here and a couple of hours there, World Explorer
allows its passengers full days onshore, preparing them with lectures
and workshops presented by noted historians, glaciologists and
professors of natural history, anthropology and geology. It's the
thinking person's dream vacation.</LD>
<LD>   For its May 5 sailing, World Explorer is offering a "Stowaway"
sale, dropping prices by half to $878 per person (based on double
occupancy) for cabins of the company's choosing, including all
gratuities and taxes. Simply mention "Stowaway" when you call (800)
854-3835 (or check www.wecruise.com). The ship will travel from
Vancouver, Canada, visiting the Inside Passage, Metlakatla (a Tlingit
reservation), Glacier Bay, Skagway, Juneau, Sitka and Ketchikan.</LD>
<TE>   World Explorer also has well-priced two-week itineraries
throughout May, June and July. The price above is per person, double,
but the line will drop its single supplement in four cabin categories
for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Viking Star: Yachting the Greek Isles is another budget
option, and your budget doesn't have to be that of an Onassis. Greek
Islands Cruise Center has created packages for May 3, 10 and 17 and
Sept. 13, 20 and 27 that let Americans see the best of the islands
and mainland. After a seven-day Aegean trip to Mykonos, Santorini,
Delos, Paros and Naxos, the company will throw in a free four-day
escorted tour of ancient Peloponnesus. This 11-day trip is selling
for $1,195--about $120 a night.</TE>
<TE>   The Viking Star is a pleasant, unpretentious ship with 24 cabins.
All breakfasts, six lunches and a captain's dinner are included in
the cruise as well as transfers by high-speed ferries to and from
Tinos, where the yacht docks. At this low rate you'll have a
lower-deck inside cabin, but you can upgrade to a room with a view
for an extra $100.</TE>
<TE>   For the land part of the package, all hotels, guide and bus are
included as you drive between Nauplion, Mycenae, Olympia and Delphi.
A licensed English-speaking guide leads the trip. Call (800) 341-3030
or visit www.vikings.gr.</TE>
<TE>   Windjammer: For a laid-back cruise on an old-fashioned tall ship,
there's no groovier outfit than Windjammer Barefoot Cruises. You sail
on a genuine old-fashioned schooner with a group of like-minded
adventurers, spending your days scuba diving, snorkeling, windsurfing
or simply lazing on less touristed beaches.</TE>
<TE>   From May 24 to Sept. 6, Windjammer will discount its family
cruises to the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao) and the
Bahamas. One child for every two adults can sail free, and the fare
for a child accompanied by one adult (single parents listen up) will
be half off. On the Legacy, which will sail from Miami to Bimini, Gun
Cay, Great Abaco, the Berry Islands, Freeport and Nassau, the adult
cost of four-day cruises will start at $345, five days at $460, eight
days at $700. The Polynesia will circle the ABCs in six days, with
prices from $700. Go to www.windjammer.com and click on "Hot Deals,"
or call (800) 327-2601.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Parked in the alley behind my apartment in Los Angeles, I sat with an
X-Acto knife in one hand, a pair of scissors in the other and as many
boxes of cereal as I could cram into my compact car.</LD>
<LD>   I had very little time to come up with the 16,000 miles I needed
for free air fare to India. These 160 boxes of cereal were just the
ticket.</LD>
<LD>   I had planned my trip to India based on how far I could get with
the miles in my American Airlines frequent-flier account. I had
94,000; I needed only 70,000 for a coach ticket to New Delhi, thus
saving me about $2,000 in air fare.</LD>
<TE>   I planned to go during the Christmas holidays, and even though it
was only August, flights were beginning to fill. Taking one of the
few remaining coach seats on Japan Airlines, or JAL, an American
affiliate, with availability even close to when I wanted to travel, I
reserved my seat and began planning the land part of my trip. JAL
holds reservations for up to 30 days, but you can call back and
reserve them again for another 30 days up until two weeks before
departure.</TE>
<TE>   I had remembered to re-reserve my ticket in September, again in
October, but by November I was so engrossed in planning that I forgot
to book my ticket.</TE>
<TE>   When I checked again on the first Saturday in November, my
reservation had expired. The only seats were in business class, which
required 110,000 miles. I was 16,000 miles short.</TE>
<TE>   I had already put down a nonrefundable $5,000 for my land costs,
so I begged the agent to check for anything even remotely close to my
now etched-in-stone land travel dates. Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   My options looked dismal. I could buy a business-class ticket for
$4,487. Or I could try to earn 16,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   My credit card is linked to my miles at a dollar-per-mile rate,
but a $16,000 shopping spree didn't seem cost effective. My
long-distance service pays five miles per minute. To make it, I'd
have to talk for 53 hours. Pass.</TE>
<TE>   But halfway down the page on my mileage summary statement was a
promotion: Earn 100 miles per box on participating Kellogg's cereal
on a promotion that lasts until November 2002 (or while supplies
last). At 100 miles per box, I could get 160 boxes of cereal at, say,
about $4 a box, for $640. That was better than a $4,500 ticket.</TE>
<TE>   My quest had begun.</TE>
<TE>   I zipped to the supermarket. Making eye contact with no one, I
nonchalantly pushed my shopping cart to the cereal aisle, searching
for the American Airlines airplane on the front of the boxes that
read, "Earn 100 AAdvantage miles."</TE>
<TE>   The "participating cereal brands" were not the kinds of cereal I
would actually want to eat. No, this offer was good only on the many
brands formulated to promote health and regularity. Cracklin' Oat
Bran, All-Bran Extra Fiber, Bran Buds, Just Right, Complete Wheat
Bran Flakes, Raisin and Strawberry-filled Mini Wheats, Product 19 and
Mueslix.</TE>
<TE>   I began to pile boxes into the cart, managing to cram in about 50.
In line, I pretended I was just another shopper. No one said a word
at the first two grocery stores. At the third and final store, the
cashier asked, "Is this for your own personal use or a group?"</TE>
<TE>   "Group," I said matter-of-factly. I would worry about which group
later.</TE>
<TE>   No one thought to list it in the specs of the car owner's manual,
but you can fit a lot of cereal into a Saab--160 boxes, actually,
with just enough room to see out of the rear window. How would I
explain this if I got stopped or had a wreck?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, I never had to work that one out, but I did have to
figure out how to get the coupon off the back of all 160 boxes.
Arriving home, I calculated the number of trips it would take to get
40 bags (four boxes per sack) to my second-story apartment and
decided instead to remove the coupons in the car.</TE>
<TE>   The operation entailed opening each box, prying the wax paper bag
of cereal away from the sides of the box, then removing the bag
without splitting or spilling it. Next, I used an X-Acto knife to cut
two sides of the dollar-bill-sized coupon on the box, allowing just
enough room to get my hand in to cut the remaining part with
scissors. Then I put the cereal bag back in the box and closed it.
One down, 159 to go.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I reached 160, my thumb and index finger were swollen
and numb.</TE>
<TE>   Foot-high stack of cardboard coupons in hand, I went upstairs to
begin filling them out. A roll of address labels took care of some of
the writing; I added my frequent-flier number, and I was done.</TE>
<TE>   Then I saw the fine print on the bottom of the coupon: "Allow six
to eight weeks for processing." I was leaving in three weeks. I would
call Kellogg's on Monday to sort things out.</TE>
<TE>   By now I was late for a party, a slightly overdue celebration of
Mexican Day of the Dead. Guests were to bring a memento of a loved
one and place it on an altar above the fireplace. Reverently, I
placed a box of each kind of cereal on the mantel.</TE>
<TE>   "In honor of Gandhi," I whispered. It was a sure-fire conversation
starter and a perfect segue to getting complete strangers out to my
car to buy my cereal. "Hi, I'm Lori. Say, are you folks breakfast
eaters?" Perhaps not the best icebreaker, but next thing I knew,
those who recognized a great bargain when they heard one were out
front buying eight boxes for $20, a steal for them, a small return on
my investment for me.</TE>
<TE>   Two people said they would love to help me but didn't have any
cash or a checkbook. I gave them my card, said they could mail me a
check and sent them on their way with arms full of fiber. One guy
never sent me a check; I figured it was his karmic debt to pay in the
next life. I drove home 60 boxes lighter.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning I phoned Kellogg's headquarters in Battle Creek,
Mich. The customer service rep told me my award coupons could not be
expedited, explaining, "If we make an exception for you, we'll have
to make one for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who goes out and buys 160 boxes of cereal? I somehow
doubt that's going to be a problem," I barked, holding my bandaged
hand to the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Following my motto of "the squeaky wheel gets the grease," I
hounded Kellogg's day after day, demanding to speak to a higher-up.
Finally I got someone to expedite my claim and give me an actual
person to whom I could express-mail my coupons.</TE>
<TE>   With that part of the problem solved, I now had 100 boxes of
cereal in my car to contend with. In the warm Southern California
sun, that new car smell had begun to be replaced with the sickly
sweet smell of toasted wheat, whole wheat with crunchy fiber,
strawberry and raisin filling, and whatever those gooey yellow things
are that stick to your teeth in Mueslix.</TE>
<TE>   By now I had told some friends and family what I had done. They
greeted this news with long silences. No, my brother didn't want any
cereal, and he would not ask his co-workers whether they wanted some
either. I considered carting a trunkful to Phoenix for Thanksgiving
for my mother to hawk to her bridge friends, but now I just wanted to
be rid of those boxes. It was like driving the streets with a dead
body in the trunk, only weirder.</TE>
<TE>   Driving in downtown Los Angeles, I spotted a Salvation Army store.
The organization would love a donation of cereal, it turned out. I
unloaded the goods and was later sent a receipt for a tax deduction.</TE>
<TE>   While the blisters on my hand healed, I took time out during the
next two weeks to check out JAL's Web site. Under "Our Aircrafts" was
the seat plan of the 747 I would be on: 315 coach seats crammed side
by side and only 78 spacious, inviting business-class seats, of which
I had one.</TE>
<TE>   Besides just getting my ticket, I was now getting to fly business
class instead of coach. For 20 hours of flight time trapped in the
cabin of a plane traveling halfway around the globe, this could be
well worth the upgrade adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Finally on board the plane, stretched out in my comfy seat, I was
awakened by the flight attendant asking whether I wanted a Japanese
or Western breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "What's your Western breakfast?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Cereal," she said--Kellogg's Product 19.</TE>
<TE>   Who could resist the fruits of my labor?</TE>

<HD>Luxury Train to Ply the Rails in Canada and New England</HD>
<DH>News, Tips &amp; Bargains</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new luxury railway company using vintage cars will begin tours of
New England and Eastern Canada on June 7.</LD>
<LD>   The Acadian Railway Co., based in Houston, is the brainchild of
Texan J.R. Parten, whose Train Collection Inc. has marketed fall and
winter train tours of Mexico's Copper Canyon since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Cars from the Mexican operation are being renovated and
transferred north for the summer-to-fall New England and Canada
tours. One train, the Acadian, will have 11 rebuilt stainless-steel
cars from the 1940s and '50s, including a domed dining car. A second
train, the Lake Champlain, will consist of up to three vintage cars
attached to Amtrak's Adirondack train.</LD>
<TE>   A range of train tours, from two to eight nights, will depart
Boston; New York; Portland, Maine; Montreal; and Halifax in Canada's
Nova Scotia province. Some include travel on routes operated by
Amtrak, Canada's VIA Rail and Conway Scenic Railway in New Hampshire.
There also will be trips lasting up to 11 nights that combine rail
travel with coastal cruises by the Carnival, Regal, Holland America
and Scotia Prince lines.</TE>
<TE>   Prices begin at $799 a person, double occupancy, for two-night
trips. Call (800) 659-7602, www.acadianrailway.com.</TE>

<LD>Airlines continue to add service as travel picks up after the
fall-winter slump. Among the additions:</LD>
<LD>   * Air Jamaica this month increased its LAX-Montego Bay nonstop
service from four to five flights per week and will go daily June 20.
"Our passenger loads have been steadily increasing," said Allen
Chastanet, vice president of marketing and sales. The airline said it
offers the only nonstop service between the West Coast and the
Caribbean.</LD>
<LD>   * Hawaiian Airlines is also expanding service from the West Coast.
On June 7 it will begin nonstop flights to Honolulu from Ontario,
Calif., and Sacramento. It also plans new nonstop service to Maui
from LAX and San Francisco starting June 15.</LD>
<TE>   * American Airlines plans a new daily round trip between LAX and
Kauai starting June 15. United also flies the route nonstop.</TE>
<TE>   * America West has installed self-service check-in kiosks at LAX
and John Wayne airport in Orange County. (The Phoenix and Tucson
airports got the kiosks last year.) Customers can upgrade to first
class (if available) and select or change a seat assignment, besides
checking in.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Stop Paying Commissions to Agents</HD>
<DH>News, Tips &amp; Bargains</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following Delta's lead, several major U.S. airlines this month
eliminated most commissions paid to travel agents for domestic
tickets. The American Society of Travel Agents denounced the move as
"anticonsumer."</LD>
<LD>   Citing the need to reduce costs after a billion-dollar net loss in
2001, Delta on March 14 ended commissions on domestic tickets sold in
the U.S. It continues to pay foreign sellers of airline tickets. The
company said it would continue "individually negotiated incentive
commissions to select agents" but did not elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   Within a week American, America West, Continental, Northwest,
United and US Airways took similar action. Most would not discuss the
issue further, so it was not clear whether they would offer incentive
commissions. America West said it would offer commissions of up to 5%
to agencies "in exchange for booking more of their business on
America West." Air Canada said it would end commissions in April.</LD>
<TE>   On March 21, the day after United ended commissions, online travel
seller Travelocity, www.travelocity.com, began imposing a $10 service
charge on United tickets. A spokeswoman said Travelocity had
negotiated compensation with other major airlines and objected to
"working for free" for United. Competitor Expedia, www.expedia.com,
briefly demoted United to the bottom of its displays, without listing
fares, then resumed normal displays. An Expedia spokeswoman declined
to explain the actions except to say that United was now compensating
the online agency for selling its tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Before cutting commissions entirely, major U.S. airlines had
gradually cut them back, starting in 1995. Travel agencies, which
began adding service fees after the cutbacks, are widely expected to
raise them.</TE>

<LD>Check-in at the Cypress Inn was uneventful. Our two "little ones"
quickly discovered the jar of biscuits on the reception counter and
were more than happy to let Brennan the bellman carry their food and
toys to Room 110, an end unit with a king bed and a gas fireplace.
Sherry, a fruit basket and bottles of water were waiting.</LD>
<LD>   Rusty, knowing that tennis balls often wind up under beds--at
least in our house--immediately checked what precious gifts might be
under this one. Much to our amusement, he fetched a note from the
hotel staff saying that they strive for absolute cleanliness, even
under the bed. It bore that day's date and the maid's initials.</LD>
<LD>   I was impressed, even if Rusty wasn't.</LD>
<TE>   My husband and I like traveling with our two golden retrievers,
and we like staying in nice places. It's the rare occasion when we
get to do both at once, as Vic and I did at the Cypress Inn in Carmel
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Co-owned by animal-rights advocate Doris Day, the 34-room
Spanish-style inn welcomes four-legged guests (even rambunctious ones
like ours) with open paws. Pet blankets, laundered daily, are
provided in the rooms to protect the expensive brocade bedspreads.
Leashed dogs are allowed in all areas of the graciously appointed
hotel, so bellying up to its bar landed Rusty and Chloe nothing but
pats and cookies. Although guests are not permitted to leave animals
unattended in rooms, the hotel provides a list of pet-sitters who
charge $10 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Our Topanga thugs, as another guest dubbed the dogs after an
unfortunate misunderstanding involving a biscuit, were able to join
us for afternoon tea in the garden, happy hour in the library bar and
mingling with other guests in front of the living room fireplace. The
weekend wasn't growl-free, and the froufrou factor ran high. But
overall, I'm happy to report that four-star travel with Fido is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Vic and I made the 325-mile trip along U.S. 101 from Los Angeles
one Saturday, taking about six hours. After checking in and arming
ourselves with pooper-scooper bags provided by the staff, we set out
to explore the inn. (Rates are $125 to $395 a night, plus tax. We
paid $235, plus a nightly $35 fee for two dogs; breakfast was
included, as were the fruit basket and other extras.)</TE>
<TE>   In the lobby we "ran into" Charlie, a one-eyed chocolate Lab whose
people told us about the beach. It sounded too perfect to miss, so we
set out on foot and paws toward the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks down a steep hill and lo and behold: legal
leashlessness! Our dogs bounded toward the surf to chase seabirds.
Charlie's people had said the beach was filled with more than 200
dogs earlier in the day, but by the time we got there the crowd had
thinned.</TE>
<TE>   We walked along the shore for about an hour; then, concerned about
finding a place for dinner that would take us with the dogs, we went
back to the hotel wet, sandy and redolent of the delightful scent
that can only come from rolling on your back in kelp and stinky
seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   The unflappable inn staff took us in stride and directed us to
outdoor hoses. We gave the dogs makeshift baths, and, while they
settled down to dry in the sun, we indulged in happy-hour drinks and
complimentary hors d'oeuvres (fried chicken nuggets and assorted
olives). Everyone in the lush garden had a dog or two, except for one
couple from Washington who had flown down for the weekend and spent
most of it phoning home to check on the springer spaniel they had
left behind.</TE>
<TE>   All was peaceful until Chloe decided to practice her chokehold on
an unsuspecting Australian sheepdog. We were assured by guests that
the skirmish sounded much worse than it was. Later, my husband said I
was just imagining that people were avoiding us.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan the bellman provided a list of restaurants that allow pets
on their patios and helped us with a reservation on a busy Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   We dined at the moderately priced PortaBella, where leashed dogs
are walked through the indoor dining room to a covered, heated space
outside. I managed to eat all of my pasta with seafood. Vic's roasted
free-range chicken with crispy red potatoes was equally tasty--which
meant no doggie bags at our table.</TE>
<TE>   We had dessert next door at the Cottage of Sweets, known for its
English candies and homemade chocolate and fudge. I spent 10 minutes
perusing more than 45 flavors of licorice before finding happiness
with saltwater taffy.</TE>
<TE>   After a brisk walk to work off dinner and for other obvious
dog-related reasons, we returned to the inn to look at scrapbooks
filled with photos of canine visitors through the years. The living
room was quite the happening place. I counted nine dogs, all lying
quietly--until we came in--and 12 people, all talking about dogs. We
joined in long enough for Vic's eyes to glaze over and for Rusty to
become fascinated with two whippets. We beat a hasty retreat to our
room before the stare-down turned into a brawl.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a long day, and we all fell asleep within minutes. The
reality of being in a hotel hit at 5:30 a.m. when there was no "just
open the door and let the dogs out, honey" option to nature's wake-up
call. Vic had to dress, find leashes in the semidarkness and take
them out for a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast was an impressive assortment of freshly brewed coffees
and tea, bagels and fresh fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Vic and I are dalliers and could have spent hours looking at the
Doris Day movie posters that line the walls of the breakfast room.
But somewhere between "The Winning Team" (with Ronald Reagan) and
"Please Don't Eat the Daisies" (David Niven co-starred), the constant
tugging on the other end of the leashes diverted our attention.</TE>
<TE>   There was only one place the dogs wanted to be: back at the
beautiful city beach. This time they led the way, pulling us down the
hill. With a snap of the leashes, they sped off to meet, greet and
teach those gentle waves a lesson. Vic and I walked, sat and read
between tennis-ball throws. Two hours later, fearing we would have to
carry two tired dogs home, we dragged them back to the car and headed
for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   I was hoping to eat at the Chateau Julien winery in the Carmel
Valley, less than 20 minutes away. Although the winery offers
tastings, it lacks a restaurant or picnic area. The staff directed us
to Baja Cantina two miles away, where the dogs were allowed on the
patio while we ate salads--one Cobb, one with grilled chicken.</TE>
<TE>   After a leisurely meal, we returned to Carmel to shop the town,
which proved a bit frustrating. While I can recreationally shop with
the best, I found myself relegated to "just looking" because of the
boutique prices. The only store that held any interest for the dogs
was Fideaux, which bills itself as "outfitters for dogs and cats."
Though Rusty and Chloe would rather have their noses caught in an
electric car window than wear doggie bandannas, they showed genuine
interest in rawhide chews.</TE>
<TE>   Walking around the residential areas of Carmel can be almost as
heavenly as the beach. This is where those famed fairy-tale cottages
line the streets, reflecting the originality and creativity of their
owners. Gardens spring from the smallest lots, and where there is no
room for gardens in the ground, flowers bloom in clay pots.</TE>
<TE>   We wound down the afternoon with a brief doggie dip in the ocean,
then put our exhausted pups in the car to dry off and nap while we
got ready for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel had cleared out and was decidedly more subdued on Sunday
night. Feeling somewhat subdued ourselves, we fed the dogs in the car
and realized that we really wouldn't mind one meal without them
underfoot. Vic and I walked around the corner to Tutto Mondo, where
the garlic scent was so strong that it permeated the street. As
exhausted and content as Chloe and Rusty were in the car, I don't
think they even noticed we were gone.</TE>

<HD>A Stroll Into Conejo Valley History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 19th century travelers, the Conejo Corridor was part of the
stagecoach route connecting Los Angeles with Ventura. For hikers
today, the corridor is a trail network that extends west from
Westlake Village all the way to Point Mugu State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Offering bed and board to stagecoach passengers and horseback
riders, the Grand Union Hotel (later called the Stagecoach Inn)
opened for business in 1876 near the spot where present-day Ventu
Park Road meets the Ventura Freeway in Newbury Park. The two-story,
Monterey-style building featured a wraparound balcony and fine
dining. The structure later served as post office, military academy
and restaurant. The inn was saved from the wrecking ball in the
mid-1960s by the Conejo Valley Historical Society and moved to its
current location. These days it's a museum with displays on local
history--and the starting point for the hike I'm featuring this week.</LD>
<LD>   A fire destroyed the building in 1970, but it was rebuilt to
emulate its original appearance. Outlying buildings include an old
schoolhouse and a carriage house with a collection of tack and
coaches. (The museum is open for docent-led tours 1 to 4 p.m.
Wednesday through Sunday. Admission is $3 for adults, $1 for
children.)</LD>
<TE>   For an enjoyable introduction to Conejo Valley life yesterday and
today, visit the museum, picnic in Stagecoach Inn Park and then hike
the Rosewood Trail, which starts just south of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From the Ventura Freeway in Newbury
Park, exit on Ventu Park Road and drive south. After about half a
mile you'll notice the entrance to Stagecoach Inn Museum; go a block
farther to Lynn Road and turn right (west). Then make another right
on Susan Drive, which looks like a long driveway, and park along the
edge of Stagecoach Inn Park. (You can walk through the park's back
gate to the museum when it's open.)</TE>
<TE>   Carefully cross Lynn Road and join signed Rosewood Trail.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The path crosses a creek, passes homes and climbs some
hills. The sights get better and better, culminating in the ridge-top
views at Angel Vista Point, a grandiose name for a little flat spot
with a picnic table.</TE>
<TE>   Catch your breath before joining signed Los Robles Trail heading
west. The path dips into a draw and passes junk piles and a rusted
tractor. It continues across private land (courtesy of a trail
easement) and meanders up and down the ridge until it reaches a
parking area off Potrero Road.</TE>
<TE>   To extend your walk, cross Potrero and join the connector trail
that leads west half a mile to a property called Rancho Sierra
Vista/Satwiwa, part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area. Ambitious hikers can continue a mile or so to a Native American
cultural center, then connect with the extensive trail system in
Point Mugu State Park.</TE>

<HD>Southern Comforts</HD>
<DH>In an era of unrelenting urban hipness, the quiet,
unpretentious spa town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, is a breath of fresh
Americana, a getaway that's tonic for the times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHERMAKAYE BASS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HOT SPRINGS, Ark.</DL>
<LD>Hot Springs is not what you think. Then again, it is.</LD>
<LD>   Quiet, verdant, sublimely quirky and occasionally urbane, Hot
Springs is the comfort food of American travel, with a dash of sake
and celluloid.</LD>
<LD>   Cradled by mountain lakes, with a 5,000-acre national park and 47
hot springs, an unexpectedly fine documentary film festival and a
smattering of global cuisine, this is a Norman Rockwell town of
40,000 with a streak of Jackson Pollock, a sort of Ma
Kettle-meets-Billy Bob Thornton kind of place. It has drawn Hollywood
moguls, generals, gangsters and presidents to soak in what is said to
be some of the purest mineral water outside Baden-Baden, Germany.</LD>
<TE>   For reasons that are less obvious, this historic town in Arkansas'
Ouachita (pronounced WA-she-tah) Mountain foothills also may be a
tonic for the times, an idyllic getaway for urbanites wearied by a
post-Sept. 11 world. Here you can take the baths, bet on the ponies,
scuba dive the lakes, catch a new presidential library exhibit and
browse the mom-and-pop shops. By night you can sample French-Japanese
fusion cuisine that rivals some of the best I've had and sip Godiva
chocolate martinis--all without the pressure, as one restaurateur
noted, to be constantly hip.</TE>
<TE>   In early March I drove here to partake of America's original Spa
City, where explorer Hernando DeSoto is said to have been the first
European to take a sip. I wanted to catch the races at Oaklawn Park
racetrack, where thoroughbreds run January through mid-April and the
Arkansas Derby on April 13 provides a glimpse of Kentucky Derby
hopefuls. I would meet my parents, who live a few hours away, stay at
the Arlington Resort Hotel and check out the growing buzz about this
undiscovered slice of bohemia.</TE>
<TE>   I followed scenic Arkansas 7 into town until it segued into
Central Avenue. A narrow artery that snakes through
lichen-and-ivy-covered bluffs with trickling springs, Central hugs
the west side of Hot Springs National Park, the oldest park in the
country. Central is the main drag, with striking turn-of-the-century
structures; among them are seven early 20th century bathhouses,
including the Buckstaff, which provides old-style treatments, and the
splendidly restored Fordyce, now a visitors center and fascinating
four-floor museum.</TE>
<TE>   Central Avenue also holds a bizarre collection of novelty shops
and "museums": an aquarium, a wax museum, a fun shop, a reptile
house. But the kitsch is offset by some fairly progressive art
galleries, antiques shops and cool vintage stores.</TE>
<TE>   Central is where you'll find the Arlington Resort Hotel and Spa, a
1924 grande dame of a place with wraparound verandas, double towers
and a soaring lobby ballroom flanked with surreal tropical murals and
giant footed candelabra. Al Capone kept a fourth-floor suite when
frequenting the town's casinos, and Bill Clinton, who grew up in Hot
Springs, attended his senior prom in the ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   My digs were on the seventh floor, down from the heated swimming
pool, which is terraced into the hillside and accompanied by a
tree-canopied hot tub farther up. The room had spindle-post
headboards, framed botanicals, cushy armchairs and a round wood
table, chintz curtains and long windows overlooking the park and its
spring-fed falls. The 5-foot-long porcelain bathtub has thermal
waters from the same springs as the hotel's old-school in-house spa.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 p.m. I was out the door, and by 7:10 I was seated five blocks
away at Sink's Kitchen, a funky little cafe and gallery. Paintings by
owner-musician-chef-artist Bryan Sink adorn the walls, and a jazz
combo, with Sink on percussion, sizzled. (Sink's is moving this month
to a spacious upstairs loft across the street, with separate rooms
for gallery, music, dining and cocktails.) Customers use the honor
system when they're ready to pay, depositing cash or personal checks
(really) in a basket.</TE>
<TE>   For starters I had red-bean garlic hummus ($1), and for an entree,
the lobster ravioli ($11) in an artichoke and red bell pepper
lemon-butter sauce, tangy enough to balance the lobster-and-cream
filling.</TE>
<TE>   During dinner I met Jonny Frye and Pam Crawford, a couple who
relocated from Austin, Texas, and now work at Sink's. I asked why
they chose this town. Frye says he perused the Hot Springs phone book
and "didn't see a ... Starbucks."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'This is mom-and-pop central. This is what we're
looking for.'"</TE>
<TE>   They invited me for a nightcap at the cavernous basement-level
Brau Haus, a onetime brothel circa 1889, with dining niches, live
music and a reportedly mean jaeger schnitzel, made from a family
recipe. We sipped peach schnapps and sampled the German beer (three
on tap and 50 bottled), and after our goodnights I walked back to the
Arlington, accompanied by the sounds of crickets and the trickling of
springs.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I drove up the serpentine park road, which cuts
through dense hardwoods and pines on its way to a 200-foot overlook
tower. On a summer day I might have driven the 20 minutes to Lake
Ouachita and rented a Jet Ski (or scuba gear, if I knew how to
dive--I'm told that Ouachita lures many divers to its deep, clean
waters). Or you can rent a houseboat with hot tub, full bar, slide
and sleeping quarters from Brady Mountain Resort or Hill's Houseboats
on Lake Ouachita.</TE>
<TE>   The views on this spring day were soothing, with pinpoint pricks
of light dappled among the flowering trees.</TE>
<TE>   Refreshed, I headed down and met my parents at the Arlington's
Lobby Cafe, an elegant place for people-watching. Which is good,
because we had to wait awhile for our food--typical of the
Arlington's slow but friendly service. My turkey Reuben on rye was
tall and tasty ($5.95). My mother was less impressed with her
grilled-basil chicken salad served atop melon and pineapple ($7.50).</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon we were bound for Oaklawn racetrack, and I
couldn't help but giggle as we passed the Howard Johnson's with the
Jesus mural just down from the track.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Oaklawn, horse fever set in. Wizened codgers gathered
around the paddocks, eyeballing the ponies and watching the odds
change on the electronic post boards. The wealthier set headed to the
Jockey Club, a VIP lounge at the top of the track, while regular Joes
crowded into the Carousel, a cafe and bar with beautiful hand-painted
vintage carousel horses.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately I stuck with the $2 minimum bets, because I managed to
win not a single race in four.</TE>
<TE>   That evening we went to the Hamilton House on Lake Hamilton, a
15-minute drive from downtown. Like most old buildings in Hot
Springs, the beguiling Spanish-style villa has a colorful story.
Built in 1935 by Van M. Lyell, a wealthy Coca-Cola distributor, and
now a multilevel warren of dining rooms, it has a tunnel that leads
to a private dock, built for the distributor's wife--who was said to
enjoy late-night skinny-dips.</TE>
<TE>   Seated in a cozy but formal upstairs room overlooking the lake, we
nibbled on oysters Marshall ($5.95), baked oysters on the half shell.
Mom's veal Wellington ($24.90) offered a nice, if unevenly cooked,
cut of meat, crowned with prosciutto and shiitake mushrooms and
enveloped in a flaky pastry. I enjoyed my brace of quail ($17.95)
with sage-and-thyme-flavored foie gras stuffing, and Dad loved his
buttery prime rib ($21.95).</TE>
<TE>   After dinner we took in the ballroom scene at the Arlington, which
on weekend nights transforms the lobby into a mecca of dancers
swirling to a swing combo in a multigenerational pageant:
octogenarians waltzing, young tourist couples trying to keep time and
bemused sophisticates who wind up becoming seduced by the whole
affair.</TE>
<TE>   I hit the Buckstaff at 8 the next morning, knowing that bathers
arrive early, especially in racing season. Once upstairs I deposited
my things in a locker and then, swathed in a crisp white sheet, was
whisked to the women's bathing area, where 10 huge vintage porcelain
tubs are divided by partitions and curtained off. An old-fashioned
whirlpool apparatus churned the 105-degree mineral water until I was
steeped to perfection.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 minutes my attendant led me to the sitz bath, a porcelain
basin made for sitting and soaking, which held water even hotter than
the whirlpool. My feet propped on a stool, I let the tension melt
from my back until I was shepherded into the vapor cabinet, which
looks as though it could trap you (it won't) but is actually
paradise. Then it was on to the needle shower, an enclosed stall with
a metal grid of shower heads spraying warm water from different
angles and levels. Finally my toga and I slithered onto a massage
table in a private room just outside the cooling area with its
vintage metal lounge chairs. My Swedish massage lasted 20 minutes,
and, as requested, the therapist kneaded the remaining tension from
my lower back.</TE>
<TE>   When the Buckstaff finished with me, I was virtually
catatonic--and incredulous: For nearly two hours, the tab was $37.</TE>
<TE>   Soon my mother and I hit the galleries and shops. We were one day
early for the opening of "White House Photographs: The Clinton Years,
1993-2001," at the Hot Springs Convention Center. This display of 70
photographs taken during Clinton's presidency runs until Sept. 6 and
will eventually reside in the Clinton Presidential Library in Little
Rock, set to open in 2004. (You can also take a self-guided tour of
Clinton haunts, with information from the visitors bureau.)</TE>
<TE>   Instead we navigated the dozen-plus galleries on Central. Blue
Moon Gallery had an exhibit of Dolores Justus' ethereal expressionist
seascapes in muted gray-green palettes. Also worth a gander was
TheArtFoundation gallery, where Texan Sam Yeates took an interesting
perspective on solitary men and women, all winged and with backs to
the viewer, and Benini had an exhibit of pop art cutouts in lush
color blocks. In Gallery Central, Sue Norton-Kent's paintings of
Tudoresque women with elongated necks and faces contrasted with the
ceramic sculpture of Sarah Noebels.</TE>
<TE>   Between galleries we stopped at the Belle Arti for lunch. The
Caesar salad ($4.75) was fine, but the homemade sausage in my
spaghetti ($7.95) was bland and the marinara tinny. Locals later told
me the place for authentic Italian is Pompeii, closer to the track.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner at the Exchange made up for it. I had heard praise for the
French-Japanese fusion fare, and it lived up to its billing.</TE>
<TE>   The Exchange, co-owned by Ken Lumpkin and Chris Rix, has a funky
retro-furnished bar and weekend pianist and is popular with the arts
set. Lumpkin learned his magic with fresh seafood from his Japanese
mother and studied French cuisine under chef Jose Gutierrez at the
Peabody Hotel in Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Lumpkin's fare is pricey for this town: Appetizers of lobster tail
run $13.50; spinach potstickers with Asian duxelles and roasted red
pepper beurre rouge, $8.50; an entree of sesame-crusted tuna with
roasted greens, black Thai rice and sun-dried tomato miso vinaigrette
was $24.50. Everything we ate was extraordinary, including the
appetizer of hotategai ($11.50), perfectly cooked Japanese scallops;
the entree of grilled unagi, or eel ($27.95), basted in teriyaki; the
grilled pork loin ($25.50), choice pink medallions fanned across
stir-fried snap peas, accented with apricot chutney; and rack of lamb
($28) cloaked in Japanese bread crumbs, with a side of sweet potato
puree.</TE>
<TE>   We concluded with a delectable vanilla-infused creme brulee ($7)
topped with fruit and a martini spiked with white and dark chocolate
Godiva liqueurs.</TE>
<TE>   As my visit to Hot Springs came to a close, I began to consider a
return--perhaps in June during the classical music festival, or in
October for the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, one of the
country's most comprehensive, co-sponsored by the Academy Foundation
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. In its 10th season
last fall, it featured 70 works by filmmakers from around the globe.
Screenings included Mark Jonathan Harris and Deborah Oppenheimer's
"Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport," which
took the 2001 Documentary Feature Oscar, and Peter Miller's "The
Internationale." (Miller co-produced Ken Burns' "Jazz" series as well
as his Frank Lloyd Wright biography.)</TE>
<TE>   I asked Rix of the Exchange how Hot Springs manages to be so many
things--yet remain unpretentious.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a lot of Europeans and New Yorkers and L.A. people through
here," he says. "You've got hip all day long in every major city.
People come here to chill out and get away. They come here to be
quiet. It's not the place where you go seeking the hottest nightspot,
although there is just enough going on that you won't feel trapped in
hell. But it's a place where you come seeking relaxation, serenity."</TE>
<TE>   And in seeking, I found just that.</TE>

<HD>Need Info? Get Ready for the Virtual Tourist Office</HD>
<DH>Walk-in bureaus where a country's prospective visitors can
get advice are fast giving way to call centers and the Web.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many foreign tourist offices in the U.S. these days might as well
hang out signs saying "Gone Webbin.'" The days when prospective
travelers could walk into a tourist office and pick up brochures or
get a human being on the phone are waning as more offices shift
operations to call centers and the Internet. Call them "virtual
tourist offices."</LD>
<LD>   If you dial Tourism New Zealand's new toll-free information
number, (866) 639-9325, you'll get a nearly two-minute recorded menu
that, among other things, routes you to another toll-free number for
information about "touring New Zealand as Middle-earth" (a reference
to "Lord of the Rings," shot in New Zealand), gives you four other
numbered options and refers you more than once to its Web site,
www.purenz.com. To talk to a staff member, you must call its Santa
Monica headquarters at (310) 395-7480 or visit its offices at 501
Santa Monica Blvd. between 9 a.m. and noon.</LD>
<LD>   When you call the Mexico Tourism Board's toll-free number, (800)
446-3942, you'll be speaking with someone at a call center in Bend,
Ore.</LD>
<TE>   Each day, about 16,000 people visit Switzerland Tourism's Internet
site, www.myswitzerland.com, but only about 200 call its North
American offices in Los Angeles, New York and Toronto, says Urs
Eberhard, the New York-based director for the agency in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that full-service tourist offices have disappeared. The
Bahamas, which has one of the larger operations, fields about 80
people to staff its five North American offices. Its largest one, in
Miami, has specialists who can counsel travelers on weddings, boating
and other niches.</TE>
<TE>   But as the statistics indicate, more travelers are migrating to
the Internet or slogging through toll-free telephone menus to get
maps, brochures and other information, such as regional food
specialties and attractions for children, that they previously got
from visiting or calling staff at a tourism office.</TE>
<TE>   Government austerity in Europe and the prolonged recession in Asia
have squeezed many foreign government tourist outposts. "Every year
our budget gets cut," says Marian Goldberg, spokeswoman for the Japan
National Tourist Organization in New York. She says her office copes
by mailing fewer pieces of literature, relying on e-mail and
directing tourists to its Web site, www.jnto.go.jp.</TE>
<TE>   At the Australian Tourist Commission in Los Angeles, spokeswoman
Rachel Crowley says, "We're trying to point a lot of people to the
Web [www.australia.com].... It's a heck of a lot cheaper than having
live people answer the calls."</TE>
<TE>   Walk-in visitors may be subtly discouraged by some foreign tourist
offices; other offices are officially closed to the public and market
only to the trade, such as travel agents and tour operators.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York there are virtually no street-level [tourist] offices
anymore" among members of the European Travel Commission, says
spokesman Neil S. Martin. As recently as the mid-1990s there were
several, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet provides potential visitors with a vast amount of
information on subjects as diverse as visas and tour operators--and
you don't have to wait weeks to receive it, as is often the case with
phone-ordered brochures. Tourism New Zealand's site, for instance,
lists hundreds of places to stay, from backpacker hostels to luxury
hotels, in a database you can search by price range; calculates
distances and driving times between cities; and lists more than 70
bus companies, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   Operators at some 800 numbers offer limited information on the
destination they represent; others seem more eager to collect
marketing data on the callers, such as age, ZIP Code and how they
learned of the 800 number, than provide information.</TE>
<TE>   But many are helpful. For instance, the 30 operators in Florida
who answer calls to 800-BAHAMAS (224-2627) are either natives of the
islands or have visited them, and they also get regular training,
according to Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace, director general of the
Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. They can put callers through directly to
information sources in the Bahamas, and since January they've been
able to book vacations for callers, he says. The number gets about
800 calls a day, compared with about 80,000 daily hits on the
ministry's Web site, www.bahamas.com. The figure for walk-ins to its
offices is so small that it's "insignificant," says
Vanderpool-Wallace, adding: "We don't even track it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   What if you can't find the answers you need on a tourist office's
Web site or at its toll-free phone? Your options are narrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Many tourist offices were cutting back even before Sept. 11. In
the last five years, among the European Travel Commission's member
nations, Bulgaria has closed its New York headquarters, Greece has
closed its Chicago and Los Angeles branches, Germany has closed its
Los Angeles branch and the Netherlands and Switzerland have closed
their Chicago branches. In the same period, Portugal, the Slovak
Republic and Romania opened new offices.</TE>
<TE>   The tourist offices of Mexico and Indonesia scaled back their U.S.
staff and moved them into consulates in 1998. Australia, which once
had three U.S. offices, now has only one. The Seychelles closed its
New York office last summer, and the Cook Islands transferred its
North American operation from Los Angeles to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11 there have been a few more cutbacks. The Cayman
Islands announced Nov. 26 it was reducing its U.S. tourist staff from
51 to 34 and closing its Los Angeles branch; it still has offices in
New York and Miami. By today the Hong Kong Tourism Board was expected
to have closed its Chicago branch; it still has offices in Los
Angeles and New York.</TE>
<TE>   In January the French Government Tourist Office branch in Los
Angeles closed its doors to the public "because we don't have the
staff to welcome them," says Rick Graham, promotions and public
relations manager. (The change was planned before Sept. 11.) The
office used to get 25 to 30 walk-ins and "maybe 60 phone calls" a
day, he said. It lost two of its five staff members last year and now
operates as a marketing office to the trade. Only the head New York
office is open to the public, he says.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Switzerland Tourism has responded to the travel slump
by increasing its staff from 17 to 25 in North America, welcoming
walk-ins at its New York office, increasing its marketing budget and
redirecting phone calls from a fulfillment house back to the tourist
office, says Eberhard. "We want to know what the consumer wants," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The British Tourist Authority, staggering from the combined
effects of Sept. 11 and last year's foot-and-mouth epidemic, will
launch a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign next month aimed at
getting U.S. visitors to return.</TE>

<HD>Ground Zero Is No Tour Destination</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was shocked to see the Travel section cover story about ground zero
("Ground Zero," March 17). It was just like any other travel feature,
except it is a crime scene you are visiting rather than the most
popular beach in Maui.</LD>
<LD>   Your story offended me on many different levels. How sad it is
that you chose to pander to the misguided New York City officials who
thought it would be a good idea to make it easier for people to gawk
at the carnage.</LD>
<LD>   Ground zero is not a tourist destination. It's a gravesite. My
friend is still buried in that wreckage. His widow cries every day
because he is gone. His baby boy will never know him. And there are
thousands with similar stories and aching hearts who find it almost
impossible to get up each day.</LD>
<TE>   If it were your family member or friend, would you want a viewing
platform built so thousands could stroll by and take in the wreckage?
Would you want major newspapers to publicize the site as a tourist
destination?</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Taking a Long Flight? Don't Come Hungry" (Travel Insider,
March 24): My wife and I do not eat the food served on airlines.
Before a trip we stop at a deli or market and have four dry
sandwiches made of turkey and/or ham (with the mustard and mayonnaise
in packages). We also take baked goods and two large bottles of water
on board so we are not bound by the airlines' drink serving schedule.</LD>
<LD>   We do not rely on the airlines for anything but getting us there.</LD>

<LD>The March 17 Travel section featuring Solvang ("Santa Ynez Valley for
a Song," Weekend Escape) and Salamanca ("A Class Act in Salamanca")
was a double bonus for me.</LD>
<LD>   Salamanca is my all-time favorite destination in Spain. I lived
there for six weeks last spring studying Spanish at the Don Quijote
School. I recommend visiting the city during Semana Santa (Holy
Week). The daily processions are spectacular.</LD>
<LD>   My hotel of choice is NH Palacio de Castellanos, just around the
corner from the cathedral and very quiet. An excellent regional menu
can be found at the nearby restaurant Cuzco, where I enjoyed many
tasty meals at a moderate price.</LD>
<TE>   I have visited Solvang many times and found the Royal Scandinavian
Inn very comfortable at an AAA rate of $78 per night on winter
weekends. Cafe Angelica, a delightful family-owned restaurant, is
across from the little park.</TE>

<LD>Bob Dolan ("Internet-Savvy Seniors," Letters, March 17) says Internet
sites do not discriminate against senior citizens. One that does is
United Airlines (www.ual.com).</LD>
<LD>   United terminated its United Connection software last July. The
software provided detailed information on schedules (considering all
airlines between points A and B), lowest possible fares and available
seating (by seat location). It had the ability to store one's age and
calculate senior fare discounts without even being asked.</LD>
<LD>   Because I fly more than 100,000 miles per year, this is an
important feature for me.</LD>
<TE>   If I order tickets through the Web site, I cannot obtain my senior
discount. That's why I still use a travel agent to book reservations.
She gets my discounts for me; www.ual.com doesn't.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Andrea Ashley was at a picnic table last spring when
lunch was served. "I was barely 15 feet away, but this momma bird was
so busy feeding the babies, she didn't seem to notice me," the Hidden
Hills resident said of this photo from Three Rivers, Calif. "She
would fly in, feed those kids and fly away. The little birds would
duck down and disappear from sight, then reappear the moment her feet
touched the nest again."</CP>

<KH>Her World</KH>
<HD>In Praise of a Simple Food That Helps the World Keep Its
Sunny Side Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Cambridge World History of Food" says eggs are popular
everywhere, but to know that, you don't have to crack open that
weighty tome. All you have to do is eat breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   In my travels, I've had Scotch eggs, which are hard-boiled, coated
with sausage and deep-fried; eggs with cold cuts and cheese at
breakfast buffets in Scandinavia; huevos rancheros; raw eggs on
Japanese rice; frothy French omelets; frittata-like egg tortillas
filled with potatoes and served at room temperature in Spanish tapas
bars; dehydrated eggs while backpacking in the wild; and--perhaps my
favorite--fried egg sandwiches on cottony soft kaiser rolls from New
York delis.</LD>
<LD>   In Beijing some years ago, I came across a man cooking eggs on an
upended metal barrel. Travelers must be careful about eating at
street stalls, of course, but I couldn't help myself. I was rewarded
with one of the finest egg sandwiches west of the Hudson River, and I
suffered no ill effects.</LD>
<TE>   I admire eggs. They teach travelers about packing in one
container, with no loose ends hanging out. They are inexpensive, rich
in protein and readily available. Even at a fancy resort or on a
cruise ship known for magnificent breakfast spreads, I go straight
for the eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "The egg is a great food for travelers, low in calories, high in
protein, with vitamins and minerals," says Joan Carter, a chef and
registered dietitian at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. One
large egg has 74 calories, 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat,
Carter says. (By contrast, a Sara Lee croissant packs 170 calories, 4
grams of protein and 8 grams of fat.)</TE>
<TE>   Fried and scrambled eggs are butter sponges and can be far fattier
than poached or boiled ones. Eggs also can be problematic for people
with elevated cholesterol, which is associated with heart disease. A
large egg has 212 milligrams of cholesterol; the American Heart Assn.
advises a daily intake of no more than 300 milligrams. Eggs can
contain salmonella, which causes food poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to praise in eggs than to shatter. Above all, I
love finding the egg in some of the most outlandish places and seeing
how differently it is prepared and served. The egg is global but no
instrument of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   There's an important distinction between seeing eggs and eating
them. I am a moderately adventurous eater, but in China I couldn't be
forced to take even a bite of a so-called 100-year-old egg, which is
buried, uncooked, in clay, saltpeter and tea leaves for several
months. When it is unearthed, the shell has gone black and the inside
is gelatinous and green-veined.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Tokyo for several years taught my sister to enjoy raw
egg and rice bowl breakfasts, with which she favors seaweed. I was
just a teenager when my parents and I visited her and valiantly tried
to follow her example. Finally, at a ryokan in Kyoto, she arranged
for my father to have cooked eggs for breakfast. I will never forget
the look on his face when he put his chopsticks to his mouth and
realized that the morsel of artfully presented omelet he was about to
eat was stone cold.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for me to even think about eating a boiled duck egg with
a partly formed chick inside, a favored street food in the
Philippines, known as balut, and in Vietnam, called hot vit lon. I
asked Richard Sterling, who has written about the cuisines of Spain,
Hong Kong and Vietnam, among others, for Lonely Planet's World Food
guidebook series, what this Southeast Asian egg specialty tastes
like. "It's delicious," he says, "vaguely like French cassoulet."</TE>
<TE>   Sterling got his unflappable taste buds and cast-iron stomach
eating powdered egg C rations in the Vietnam War. He has even tried
ant eggs, atop a steak, in Tijuana; he claims they are wonderfully
crunchy. These days, at home in the Bay Area, he relishes Sunday
brunches at San Francisco restaurants where caviar omelets are
served. "Eggs with eggs," he says gleefully.</TE>
<TE>   I can do without fish eggs, but I fondly remember many of my
favorites laid by hens, the mode of preparation, the cooks and the
places where I ate them. On a bicycling trip in County Clare,
Ireland, six years ago, the breakfasts were gigantic servings of
porridge, bacon, eggs and brown bread, served by pithy Irish farm
women who could make the newspaper sound like the poetry of Yeats.</TE>
<TE>   Later, on a clattering local train bound from New York City to the
Jersey shore, I had an egg salad sandwich on white bread, which I had
prepared at home and packed in a wicker basket. I can't say why, but
I firmly believe that egg salad and train rides are soul mates, like
hot dogs and baseball games.</TE>
<TE>   I was once lucky enough to eat eggs at La Mere Poulard on Mont
Saint-Michel in France. I had been on a 30-mile walking vacation in
Brittany, ending at the island abbey, connected to the mainland by a
long causeway. To celebrate my accomplishment, I ordered the $22 set
menu, its centerpiece a plain, unbelievably light omelet that tasted
of wood smoke and the Middle Ages. Merveilleux.</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure where chickens and their highly palatable eggs came
from. The question bears further study and a lot more travel, I
believe. Along the way, maybe I'll figure out which came first.</TE>

<TE>   Alaska: River Voyages</TE>
<TE>   James Henry River Journeys, in its 30th year of river tours, has
planned two new educational expeditions this summer in Alaska and
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The tours are designed for adventurous adults and families who
want to go white-water rafting and camping while learning about the
natural history of the region and Native American folklore.</TE>

<HD>Born in the '60s</HD>
<DH>The events of that tumultuous decade inspired a new kind of
filmmaking. 'Reel Radicals,' on AMC, takes a look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Reel Radicals: The Sixties Revolution in Film," a 90-minute
documentary premiering Tuesday on American Movie Classics,
illustrates how directors pushed boundaries and altered the art of
filmmaking during the turbulent, swinging 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   Narrated by Woody Harrelson, "Reel Radicals" features clips from
such seminal films as Arthur Penn's "Bonnie &amp; Clyde" (1967); Mike
Nichols' "The Graduate," (1967); Dennis Hopper's "Easy Rider" (1969);
John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962); Stanley
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" (1964) and "2001: A Space Odyssey"
(1968); John Schlesinger's "Midnight Cowboy" (1969); Richard Brooks'
"Elmer Gantry" (1960) and "In Cold Blood" (1967); and Norman
Jewison's "In the Heat of the Night" (1967) and "The Thomas Crown
Affair" (1968).</LD>
<LD>   Frankenheimer, Jewison, Hopper, Schlesinger, Penn, Buck Henry,
Paul Mazursky, Roger Corman and Arthur Hiller are among the
filmmakers who discuss the decade.</LD>
<TE>   Though Hollywood was still making traditional films such as "The
Alamo," "The Sound of Music" and "My Fair Lady," the '60s saw an
infusion of young filmmakers who began their careers in live
television in the '50s and were inspired by the intimate, personal
and humanistic films made by such European directors as Roberto
Rossellini, Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman.</TE>
<TE>   This new breed of Hollywood director explored America's fear of
Communist Russia, the growing uneasiness about the Vietnam War and
the rebelliousness of the country's youth. Previously taboo subjects
such as racism, sex, drugs, politics and the war took center stage.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all so young then," says Jewison, who began his film
career in 1963 with the fluffy comedy "40 Pounds of Trouble," then
quickly segued into such diverse, sophisticated and often
controversial fare as "The Cincinnati Kid," "The Russians Are Coming,
the Russians Are Coming," "In the Heat of the Night" and "The Thomas
Crown Affair."</TE>
<TE>   "I think America was going through big changes in the '60s," says
Jewison. "Let's face it: Cities were being burnt down and the nuclear
threat was so ominous in the '60s. The iron curtain was
impenetrable."</TE>
<TE>   Because the majority of the young directors came from New York
television, "they were not part of the film industry," says Jewison.
"They didn't think Hollywood. Their films were very personal and very
strong. There were new technical ideas--the zoom lens, the
multi-screen. It was really an infusion of different thinking and
much more rebellious. There was a certain amount of resentment [from
old Hollywood] at the time because most of us were from the East
Coast. We were all mavericks here."</TE>
<TE>   Hopper had been part of the Hollywood establishment, making his
film debut at 18 in 1955's "Rebel Without a Cause." But as with
Jewison and Frankenheimer, he was influenced by European filmmakers
too. "The first guy who really twisted my head around was Ingmar
Bergman," Hopper says. "I also loved the comedies of Alec Guinness,
like 'The Lavender Hill Mob.' Then we got Godard and Truffaut.
Intellectually, Godard was amazing, but I didn't really care for his
films. But I loved Truffaut's films--'The Four Hundred Blows,' what
an amazing film. That influenced me probably more than anything
else."</TE>
<TE>   "Easy Rider" probably had more impact on Hollywood than any other
movie released in the '60s. Hopper and Peter Fonda played young men
who chucked everything after scoring a drug deal and hopped on
motorcycles to "find America." The movie reflected the alienation and
dissatisfaction of that generation.</TE>
<TE>   Before his film, says Hopper, "we had been doing 'Pillow Talk'
with Doris Day and Rock Hudson. I am not putting down 'Pillow Talk.'
I am just saying that was it. We had gone through the '60s and no one
had done anything on the '60s. How ludicrous was that? I mean, the
Summer of Love was over and nobody had addressed rock 'n' roll in
films. I wanted to leave a time capsule."</TE>
<TE>   "Reel Radicals: The Sixties Revolution in Film" can be seen
Tuesday at 7 and 10:15 p.m. on AMC. The network has rated it TV-PG
(may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Letting Go of the Past, Embracing the Future</HD>
<DH>Justice: Wrongly accused man who spent 27 years behind bars is
granted his release and given a new lease on life. But his prosecutor
wanted something too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL SHEPARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE
</DL>
<LD>The gravelly voice on the phone was one he hadn't heard in years
and didn't expect to hear again. But he recognized it instantly.</LD>
<LD>   It was the voice that had filled a courtroom so long ago and
successfully prosecuted him for murder.</LD>
<LD>   A murder he didn't commit, but spent 27 years in prison for.</LD>
<TE>   "I can still remember him pointing his finger in my face yelling to
the jury that I was the killer," Michael Austin says.</TE>
<TE>   The voice was that of former Baltimore prosecutor Joseph Wase, who
called Austin days after his Dec. 28 release from prison. Finally, the
overwhelming evidence of Austin's innocence had forced a judge to
overturn the wrongful conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the voice Austin had recalled with dread had a calm, friendly,
even warm, tone.</TE>
<TE>   Wase asked to meet Austin--face to face. He offered to buy drinks and
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Then a question Austin couldn't process at first: "He said, 'Mike,
could you give me a hug? I need a hug to know that everything is all
right.' "</TE>
<TE>   Austin's lower lip trembles as he talks about the call--and the
courtroom shouts long ago. "I can't forget that," he says of Wase's
combative courtroom manner.</TE>
<TE>   But a hug? He didn't know what this meant for his former antagonist,
or himself. Could he do this?</TE>
<TE>   But imagining the blueprint he would follow to reconstruct his life,
he wondered: Could he not do it? Would he let anger and vengeance run his
post-prison life?</TE>
<TE>   "Part of me figured that if I could hug the guy who put me in prison,
I could get through anything out here. I don't want to carry around bad
karma and those negative feelings with me," Austin said. "But I can't
forget what he put me through.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Austin, 53, missed Cal Ripken's entire professional baseball
career. Ripken, the Baltimore Orioles' iron man, broke in in 1981 and
retired last year.</TE>
<TE>   During Austin's imprisonment, the Soviet Union died, a free South
Africa was born, and five presidential administrations served.</TE>
<TE>   His long ordeal grew out of a breakdown in the criminal justice system
at his 1975 trial for the murder of a grocery store guard during a
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Austin was an iron pourer; a time card showed he was at
work at the time of the murder, but his defense attorney didn't make full
use of it.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest was based on an identification by a store clerk who told
detectives the shooter was a light-skinned black man about 5-feet-8.
Austin is 6-feet-5 and dark-skinned.</TE>
<TE>   No credible evidence pointed to his guilt, but when the store clerk
told the jury Austin was the man who pulled the trigger, he was
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Retelling the story makes the bookish-looking Austin shake his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't imagine what that jury was thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Austin's attorneys are exploring the best avenue toward financial
compensation for the wrongful imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the trial and jail sentence are a nightmare seen in a
rearview mirror.</TE>
<TE>   With 27 years to make up, Austin says feelings of vengeance and
self-pity wouldn't be a productive use of time. He needs every second to
reconnect to a world without prison bars.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, Austin moved in with his girlfriend, Yvonne Rahman,
whom he first met while in prison in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   What used to be a small parlor in her northwest Baltimore colonial now
looks like a recording studio. A keyboard and trumpet share space with
microphone stands, music books, mixers, amplifiers, recorders.</TE>
<TE>   With his massive hands caressing piano keys, Austin says, "This is how
I kept my balance in prison. Getting music right takes discipline and
focus and concentration. I had to use all of those to get by every day."</TE>
<TE>   It's 7 o'clock at night. The big man with the trumpet sitting on the
bar stool in the wood-paneled basement is Wendall Shepherd. He has seen
the big time, touring with acts like Parliament/Funkadelic and Angela
Bofill.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, he's counseling Austin, who is searching for an elusive
note on his own trumpet.</TE>
<TE>   "Calm," Shepherd says. "Just let it flow."</TE>
<TE>   At a keyboard is Glenn Grainger. He served in prison with Austin from
1977 to 1979. Grainger had a degree in music and, seeing Austin's
interest in playing, he taught him to read scales, to distinguish a C
flat from a C sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to give them something positive to do," Grainger says,
"and it took off from there."</TE>
<TE>   When Grainger's sentence was up, he took a job at the city's water
treatment plant but kept playing with local bands through the '80s and
'90s. Then one night, on the television news, he saw a familiar face and
name. The story said Austin was getting out of prison after being wrongly
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Grainger called Austin's lawyer, and they met again.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him this was like something out of the movies, getting
together after all this time," Grainger says. "He said he wanted to do
something with music, and it clicked. I always worked with a band, but I
said with Mike out, if he kept up his skills, we could take it to another
level."</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to get a job at a mid-sized club in Baltimore sometime
this summer. Later, if the right people take a liking to the group, maybe
there could be a recording contract.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Austin, Shepherd, Grainger and a few others are practicing,
bantering, pushing each other toward the next level, into the early
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can make it big," Austin says.</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Rahman can remember the day she met Austin behind the walls of
the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown.</TE>
<TE>   She was visiting as a prisoner aide, helping inmates with writing
projects.</TE>
<TE>   He was writing a play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was married at the time so I wasn't interested in him like that.
But Michael isn't the kind of person you can forget easily. He seemed
like a special man."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, a teacher with the Maryland Department of Education, helped
Austin with the writing and staging of the play.</TE>
<TE>   The pair lost touch with each other for several years until 1991, when
Austin asked her to write the parole board on his behalf. He sent her
records of the trial, police reports and other evidence pointing to his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   She pored over it, dumbfounded. "I figured I had to be missing
something," Rahman says. "Anyone could see he didn't do it. Absolutely
nothing pointed to Michael."</TE>
<TE>   She turned amateur detective and began investigating Austin's case in
her off-hours. Now divorced, she resumed visiting Austin in prison and
they wrote each other weekly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Centurion Ministries, a Princeton, N.J.-based group that
seeks to free the wrongly convicted, took on Austin's case.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Circuit Judge John Carroll Byrnes wrote in a decision
vacating the conviction that Austin's trial "was plagued by multiple
problems which, cumulatively, present the inescapable conclusion that he
was denied a fair trial."</TE>
<TE>   Finally freed, Austin's nephew offered to rent an apartment for his
uncle. That day, Rahman made the offer he really wanted to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "Yvonne said I could stay with her and I didn't know what to say,"
Austin recalled. "I wanted to. But I had so many things on my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly do love Yvonne," he said. "But we are taking it one day at a
time. We kept in contact through visits and letters every week for 10
years. But now we have to really know each other."</TE>
<TE>   Austin and Rahman recently took Wase up on his invitation to dinner at
a steakhouse. "He had bought a trumpet for me," Austin says.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, the three returned to Wase's home and the ex-convict and
the prosecutor settled in the den for a private chat.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he seemed a little uneasy and he said he just wanted me to
reassure him we would be friends forever," Austin recalls. "I said,
'Yeah, man. We could.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then he asked for his hug." Austin said.</TE>
<TE>   Wase won't discuss the hug but expresses admiration for the man he
sent to prison. "It amazes me that he's not bitter," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel guilty about what happened but I do feel responsible. I
feel responsible for every case I ever prosecuted," Wase says.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we are not perfect in deciding who goes free and who we send
away, but when mistakes are made, we should try to correct them."</TE>
<TE>   Austin extended his arms for the hug. "The guy is huge and I could
hardly get my arms around him. But I think it made him feel better."</TE>
<TE>   And that was that, another step for Austin toward putting the past
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure I could do it," he says, "but I did."</TE>

<DH>Justice: Scars from Death Row incarceration haunt talented writer
who had always envisioned a better life for himself.</DH>

<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Even now, when friends introduce Delbert Tibbs, they say his name,
then in the same breath feel compelled to mention where he lived 25 years
ago:</LD>
<LD>   On Death Row. Fighting to stay out of the electric chair.</LD>
<LD>   Those desperate years when Tibbs loudly proclaimed his innocence all
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court were the reason he became a celebrity
long ago. Now, decades later, they may be the reason he drifts from job
to job, surviving, but not thriving in the way he once dreamed.</LD>
<TE>   "The personal demons that I struggle with now--I'm sure that in some
sense they come from that experience," he says. "But," he adds, his voice
rising, "how do you know?"</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs, now 61, lives alone in a one-room apartment in a gritty
neighborhood. He has a wide circle of friends and admirers, but none of
the accouterments that come with financial stability: no car, no
insurance policy, no nest egg--and for the moment, no permanent job.</TE>
<TE>   "Delbert either doesn't want to or can't function in the dog-eat-dog,
mainstream rat race the rest of us live in," says Jennifer Bishop, a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   So Tibbs scrapes by, writes poetry and campaigns actively against the
death penalty (he has spoken on three continents). But while friends
still bring up his past in social situations--something that embarrasses
him--he doesn't dwell on it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get hit by a car, every day that's not the predominant thought
in your head," he says. "I don't think about it a lot."</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, it was a different story.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Tibbs was sentenced to die for murder and rape in Florida.
His conviction was overturned and he was freed on appeal in 1977. The
charges were eventually dropped. But his impassioned campaign to prove
his innocence turned him into a cause celebre.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Seeger, the folk singer, wrote a ballad about him. Angela Davis,
the '60s radical, raised money for him. A defense committee championed
his cause, casting him as a black man victimized by a racist white
justice system.</TE>
<TE>   People told Tibbs he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. No, he
says, he was the wrong kind of black man--one who was a little full of
himself, who looked white people in the eye, who had grand dreams of
becoming a writer.</TE>
<TE>   "A braggadocios young black man," he says, slowly enunciating each
word.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs, the poet, fancies words, the bigger the better. His
conversations are like flipping through the pages of
Bartlett's--chock-full with quotes, from Thoreau to Kerouac, Jesus to the
Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs, the former theology student, can do a riff on everything from
Krishna, the Hindu god, to the Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism.</TE>
<TE>   His own belief is that "there is a just judge" and that divine powers
rescued him when he got in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   It was in 1974 when a 16-year-old white hitchhiker was raped and her
male companion shot to death in an isolated field near Fort Myers, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs, a Chicagoan in Florida doing farm work, was arrested. It was
his first brush with the law. His defense presented evidence he was 225
miles away the day before and after the crime. No physical evidence
linked him to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   But the rape victim identified him in dramatic testimony, though she
had been high on marijuana the day of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   An all-white jury found Tibbs guilty and he was sentenced to die. But
he never doubted that one day he'd walk free.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew that I was innocent and I knew that I shouldn't be
there," he says. "I always insisted in my own mind and heart that I was
going to get off."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a new trial, citing
doubts about the rape victim's credibility. The case was appealed up to
the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, eight years after the crime, the county state's attorney
dropped the charges, saying the rape victim was too unreliable. Tibbs
says he knows some people still believe he's guilty, but he has one
critical supporter: The prosecutor in his case has since said he has no
doubt that he is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Once his legal troubles were over, Tibbs quickly realized time lost
could not be regained and some things would never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   He had missed precious years with his 7-year-old son. Divorced when he
was arrested, Tibbs never remarried, though he now has three children and
two grandchildren. He took his youngest, a 14-year-old daughter, on a
pilgrimage to his native Mississippi a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs also had a resume that was forever scarred, and even the most
well-intentioned employer might have questions about his story. How, he
asks, do you explain all the legal twists and turns of his case in a few
lines on a job application?</TE>
<TE>   The answer was, you don't. So he abandoned the want ads, and turned to
friends for help in finding work.</TE>
<TE>   He recently worked at Northwestern University's Center on Wrongful
Convictions, where he screened letters for inmates who claimed to be
innocent--people much like himself years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But he had trouble doing computer work, and left after a month.</TE>
<TE>   He now has a temporary job at a government warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Tibbs has also been a car wash manager, school
security guard, youth counselor and a social worker--a job he quit
because it was too traumatic to enter the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Those iron doors have a sound probably like nothing you've ever
heard," he says. "I used to tell myself you have a badge with your photo
on it, you're all good, Delbert, you're cool. But some part of my mind
knew that I was back in jail."</TE>
<TE>   At other times, Tibbs' problem has been getting in the door. Once,
when a priest recommended him for a job, he couldn't get the man doing
the hiring to return his calls.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs leans his 6-foot-3 frame back in his chair, lifts his baseball
cap to scratch his head and in his smoky baritone, explains how he coped
with that rejection:</TE>
<TE>   "How can I say this without sounding vainglorious? If I were not a
steadfast and intrepid sort of fellow, I would have been bowled over. But
I refused to give in."</TE>
<TE>   No, Tibbs says, he has never been agitated by adversity, never been
one to pace, not even when he was behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   He likes to tell a story about a British Army lieutenant cut off from
his troops in a no man's land, then discovered three days later by his
comrades, sitting calmly in his foxhole, reading Sophocles.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Delbert," he says with a contented grin.</TE>
<TE>   But Tibbs also concedes that, yes, he would have more money and more
status if not for prison and the years he fought to stay free.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I tell myself, 'Wow, if they hadn't done this, I could
have been a best-selling author. . . . I could have traveled all over the
world.' But you know, in reality, life isn't like that. Who knows what
might have happened to me? . . . I'm not much of a what-if guy."</TE>
<TE>   But his friend, Jennifer Bishop, head of a national advocacy group for
families of murder victims, can't help but wonder how Tibbs' ordeal
changed him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very healthy person in his soul, in his heart and his mind,"
she says. "But I don't think he's all he could be and I don't think he's
all that he deserves to be. . . . He should be a rich and famous writer."</TE>
<TE>   As for Tibbs, he says there are days when "the sad wind touches me,"
but mostly he is content and at peace.</TE>
<TE>   "They tell me at best that life is unfair," he says. "But I don't
think that. I think life is fair."</TE>
<TE>   He mulls that over for a moment. "You know," he confides, "maybe I say
that because I want to believe it."</TE>

<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Turn off the main road and step into yesterday--past the cramped
greasy spoon, past walls that stood through centuries of emperors, past
crumbling gray-brick homes slathered with one huge painted Chinese
character: "chai"--demolish.</LD>
<LD>   This is Nanchizi, a half-mile from the imperial Forbidden City and one
of the abundant but dwindling warrens of confounding alleys and courtyard
homes that have dotted central Beijing since the 12th-century Mongol
invasion.</LD>
<LD>   Long ago, a prince lived here, and scholars from the Qing court next
door visited Pudu Temple to study. But in recent years, stately
courtyards have grown ramshackle, overcrowded and, the government says,
inadequate for a metropolis striving to be China's showpiece. Plumbing
has collapsed; houses are crumbling; for some residents, toilets are 100
yards away.</LD>
<TE>   Already, most of it is no more. Its modern replacement, designed to
mimic the old houses in outward appearance, will rise with strong
foundations, reliable plumbing and electricity--and far less of the
character that carried the neighborhood through three dynasties and two
republics. Longtime residents will be swept away, relocated; some will
return and pay higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   As Beijing hurtles toward a future brimming with development, foreign
investment and an economy-boosting Olympic Games, a tension plays out
across the city that has been China's capital for much of a millennium.
It's a problem that vexes many of the world's ancient metropolises, from
Jerusalem to Jakarta, as they enter the 21st century: Progress or
preservation?</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many cities, though, Beijing has no master renovation plan for
residents to peruse at City Hall, no open appeals process where
preservationists and residents can lodge objections. For the government,
the answer seems simple--too simple, some say. It is solving matters in
its own way: by giving orders, and by shuffling people around.</TE>
<TE>   "Preservation should always be the priority," says Wang Jianqing, the
deputy director of Beijing's Dongcheng District, where Nanchizi is
located. Moments later, he adds: "Our aim is to improve people's living
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   "The balance," he acknowledges, "is very complicated."</TE>
<TE>   Tourism--and growing national pride in a fascinating history--is
nudging the government toward preservation efforts that will showcase
Beijing as the ancient emblem of an ancient nation.</TE>
<TE>   But China's push toward development runs deep--not only for a new
generation of savvy entrepreneurs but as a staple of Mao Tse-tung's
decades-old party doctrine of "jianguo," a patriotic phrase that means
"build the nation."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, when Asian nations like Singapore and Malaysia were
beginning building booms to coincide with business growth and population
explosions, China was still wrapped in communist insularity and parents
were naming their children Jianguo.</TE>
<TE>   It has spent the past decade playing catch-up. Now it has nabbed the
2008 Olympics and joined the World Trade Organization, and every taxi
sports a local radio station's banner that says, in English and Chinese,
"Build New Beijing, Host Great Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   To preserve the old, the government has designated 25 special
protection areas, where it insists history comes first. Official
newspapers trumpet preservation projects from remnants of the old city
wall to the homes of celebrated writers.</TE>
<TE>   But the government is also keen to ease population density and
quality-of-life problems in the central city, where an estimated 1.17
million residents live in "dangerous and old houses." Some 70,000
households have been "renovated," a term the city won't define. More than
85,000 families have been relocated to ease central Beijing's population
crunch. Hundreds of tons of rubble--including stones possibly dating back
more than seven centuries to Marco Polo's day--have been cleared.</TE>
<TE>   Critics worry that the flurry of ambitious projects--particularly
those that claim old courtyard houses and circuitous honeycombs of alleys
called "hutongs"--are sweeping away Beijing's history.</TE>
<TE>   Fang Yong, a professor at Beijing University's Architecture Institute,
has sounded a note of caution to developers. Even diligent renovation,
Fang says, distorts what the buildings once were.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a paradox, really--preserve the hutongs and courtyard houses, or
improve people's lives and develop the city," Fang said. "In theory, few
people are against preserving hutongs. In reality, it is a difficult
thing to achieve. But if we lose this architecture, we lose it forever."</TE>
<TE>   "The alleys in Beijing are the carrier of history," says the foreword
to a local guidebook of the city's hutongs. Trouble is, history doesn't
always fit easily into the modern world.</TE>
<TE>   The hutongs and their showpieces--quadrangle courtyards--were the
staple of old Beijing. Many were laid out to exacting standards of feng
shui, the ancient Chinese philosophy of designing one's house in
accordance with nature's forces, and housed aristocrats who needed access
to the imperial palace.</TE>
<TE>   Some were named for what was peddled there--Salt Shop Lane, Fresh
Beans Lane, Glutinous Rice Alley. Not all were opulent; many were
hodgepodges of dwellings and shops populated by the "laobaixing," or
common folk.</TE>
<TE>   In the five years after Mao's Communists took power in 1949, Beijing's
population grew from 1 million to 5 million. Housing pressures turned
many alley neighborhoods into slums. Courtyards subdivided until a dozen
families were living where one once did.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey by China Today magazine, Beijing has 360 major
hutongs and more than 4,550 smaller lanes and alleys. But they are
falling, one by one, as land grows more valuable and alley-style
residences seem ever quainter.</TE>
<TE>   The government's method: Move people out of blighted old property,
tear down, rebuild. Months later, residents who want to return are
re-imported--but pay higher prices for the new versions of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   And the displaced? "They go to stay with their relatives or friends,"
says Li Haijun, vice governor of Chongwen District near central Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   In Chongwen, at a place called the Goldfish Pool, workers are
rebuilding a vast swath of dilapidated housing into a gleaming complex
that stretches to the horizon. Nearby, factory worker Ding Guo and his
wife, Yang Yun, rhapsodize about their new home, built atop their
previous one.</TE>
<TE>   Ding, who grew up in an old-style alley house and spent 10 years in
its cinder-block replacement, now sits in a gleaming two-bedroom
apartment in a six-story complex where many childhood friends still live.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we can be in the middle of Beijing and still live well," Ding
says, offering a visitor dried fruit. Watching from nearby is a
government official who picked him to receive foreign guests.</TE>
<TE>   "History and progress?" his wife says. "I think they're balancing it."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, government operatives in sunglasses and leather jackets sit
at the ready. Talk to residents who haven't been approved and they
menacingly shoo you off.</TE>
<TE>   On a crisp Sunday morning in Nanchizi, workers perch on rooftops with
pickaxes, hammers and hands, methodically reducing a neighborhood to
rubble. Kids play in honeycombs of old dwellings, clambering through the
bedrooms of a thousand yesterdays. From atop brick piles, Forbidden City
rooftops are visible beyond the walls.</TE>
<TE>   By December, according to the Beijing Daily, 511 households had been
moved out of 93 courtyards in Nanchizi's pilot project to preserve
historical architecture while fixing what "has degenerated into blocks of
miscellaneous people living together in crowded conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Commercial properties aren't exempt. Xiao Wangfu, a popular restaurant
in an old building in central Beijing, was serving deep-fried pork ribs
one evening and was gutted the next.</TE>
<TE>   "Olympics," explained a passer-by.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone's happy. Blocked from her home in Nanchizi by a pile of
masonry, a woman walking her bicycle weaves around it and curses the
workers on the rooftop above.</TE>
<TE>   "Our neighborhood is coming down around us!" she shouts. She gives
only her surname, Hua. The demolition crew looks on, bemused.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody cares about the common people," she snaps. "Progress? It's not
progress to me."</TE>
<TE>   The government promises to protect Nanchizi's heritage. But scale
models suggest only four old houses and the temple will be spared;
everything else will face the "demolish" order.</TE>
<TE>   In Nanchizi, when a pickax strikes a wall, the masonry bleeds history.
But do residents--and their government--not have a right to basic
improvements in their capital city?</TE>
<TE>   As old structures fall and new ones rise, Beijing's answers to
questions like this will determine just what "building the nation"
means--and what kind of city the world will see when the 2008 Olympics
arrive.</TE>

<HD>Illiteracy Dogs Remote Dominican Village</HD>
<DH>Education: In a town where life revolves around growing coffee,
getting people to come to class is the biggest challenge for teachers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LOS MARRANITOS, Dominican Republic
</DL>
<LD>The teacher produces her test, a handwritten alphabet, and the
student leans toward the paper, straining to identify the letters.</LD>
<LD>   When the pen stops at K, Javier Moronta is unsure: "Q?" he asks. At S,
he first says "C," then corrects himself.</LD>
<LD>   Moronta is 22, and he is learning to read from children's books. Here
in the mountain village of Los Marranitos, life revolves around growing
coffee, and illiteracy is the norm.</LD>
<TE>   It's a persistent problem in the Dominican Republic, a nation of 8.5
million people where nearly one of every five adults cannot read and
write. As in many poor countries, remedies often face resistance,
particularly among poor families that see little need for learning to
read.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest challenge has been trying to get people to come to class,"
says Laura Marlow, a 22-year-old volunteer teacher from the U.S.</TE>
<TE>Lots of Blame to Go Around</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and government officials say poverty is a principal cause of
illiteracy, but they also blame inadequate schools, misguided policies
and social attitudes that put little value on education.</TE>
<TE>   Most adults in Los Marranitos know how to pick coffee but only a third
can read, some at only the most basic level. When they vote, they mark
symbols that represent each party: a rooster, a torch, a star. Even the
60-year-old mayor can't read.</TE>
<TE>   There are no newspapers in the mountains 80 miles northwest of Santo
Domingo, the capital. Although the people here live in the middle of an
island, most have never seen the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Marlow goes door-to-door urging parents to send children to her class.
"So many parents here still see school as absolutely useless," she says.
"They see it as a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   Some see classes as taking away a needed pair of hands. Some children
skip school to wash clothes or baby-sit. Others never go. When they hit
their teens, many drop out to help support relatives.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, Marlow rounds up two dozen children in this community
of 125 people as she walks the dirt road. Some elude her, darting past
playing tag and giggling. Others say they have chores. "I have to clean
up," says a bashful 7-year-old girl, turning into the gate of a simple
wooden home.</TE>
<TE>   Moronta, one of Marlow's few adult students, is an exception who hopes
that learning to read and write will help him find work in Spain, the
former colonial power, or in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I see that if someone knows how to read, life becomes easier," says
Moronta, who works odd jobs.</TE>
<TE>Volunteer Teacher Is College Graduate</TE>
<TE>   Marlow came as a volunteer after graduating from Middlebury College in
Vermont, where she studied Spanish. The Global Education Fund of Boulder,
Colo., helps support her.</TE>
<TE>   She learned of the job through author Julia Alvarez, a
writer-in-residence at the college who owns an organic coffee farm in Los
Marranitos with her husband, Bill Eichner. They call it Alta Gracia, or
High Grace.</TE>
<TE>   "My idea was that once the farm really got going, we would use the
proceeds to fund an arts center," Alvarez says. "Then I realized most of
the people around there didn't even know how to read or write. . . . We
decided first things first."</TE>
<TE>   They began collecting donated books and putting them on shelves in a
shed that serves as a library.</TE>
<TE>   They are needed for the 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds who attend morning
class in the farm's one-room school because, while the government
provides bread and milk each day, it sends no books. Teacher Bolivar
Abreu, who earns $300 a month, says his students still don't know the
whole alphabet, "because we're going letter by letter."</TE>
<TE>   That may be because class lasts as little as 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   At a larger school in nearby Los Dajaos, there is a 17-year-old boy in
third grade. He still can't read.</TE>
<TE>   Few students do homework and few make it to eighth grade, says head
teacher Miriam Bonifacio, who struggles to teach 160 students with two
other teachers and little parental support.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like we're working alone," she says. "So many years here, and
they're always behind."</TE>
<TE>   According to the most recent U.N. estimates, 16.8% of Dominicans 15
and older were illiterate in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is much worse in neighboring Haiti, which shares the
island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. With about 52%
illiterate, Haiti's government has opened thousands of centers to teach
adults to read Creole, with the ambitious goal of reducing illiteracy to
25% by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some countries in the region have all but wiped out the problem: Costa
Rica has 4.5% illiteracy, Barbados only 3%.</TE>
<TE>   After Fidel Castro's 1959 communist revolution, Cuba mobilized nearly
270,000 volunteers in a campaign that reduced illiteracy from 23% to 3%.</TE>
<TE>A Demonstrated Need to Read</TE>
<TE>   The Dominican government now pays small fees to leaders of adult
classes. About 100,000 are enrolled and thousands have learned to read,
says Midalma Lopez, head of the country's adult education directorate.</TE>
<TE>   On Alta Gracia, illiterate coffee workers ask a self-taught co-worker
to write their letters to lovers and friends. The farm's caretaker,
Miguel Antonio Placencia, has a friend write his work reports.</TE>
<TE>   But Placencia and his wife, Carmen Abreu, are studying with Madrelle
Cartwright, a Peace Corps volunteer from Makawao, Hawaii, who lives up
the hill. Three of their four children have learned to read.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to learn so they don't have to live like their father,
working with a machete," Abreu says.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez wrote about Abreu's family in her book "A Cafecito Story," a
fable about coffee, reading and organic farming. By the happy end,
"Miguel and Carmen and their children can read a whole book."</TE>

<HD>Exhibit Lifts Cover Off Female Spies</HD>
<DH>Espionage: Julia Child's shark repellent and Josephine Baker's
secret messages are among the stories highlighted at Arlington cemetery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TABASSUM ZAKARIA</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Julia Child had a hand in concocting a shark repellent that helped
Allied forces blow up German U-boats during World War II, and entertainer
Josephine Baker carried secret messages in sheet music across Europe.</LD>
<LD>   They were among the cloak-and-dagger set honored in a new museum
exhibit on female spies--"Clandestine Women, the Untold Stories of Women
in Espionage"--which opened last week at the women's memorial at
Arlington National Cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   New hires at the CIA are told the legendary stories of female spies to
illustrate that espionage has been around for a long time, said Linda
McCarthy, a former curator of the museum at CIA headquarters, who helped
organize this exhibit.</LD>
<TE>   Child, before she became a famous chef, joined the CIA's predecessor,
the Office of Strategic Services, where she had administrative duties,
worked in Ceylon--now Sri Lanka--and China, and also helped develop the
shark repellent.</TE>
<TE>   The U-boats controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes, so the Americans
and British were sneaking up and attaching explosive devices.</TE>
<TE>   "They were having a problem with sharks," McCarthy said on a tour of
the exhibit. "Sharks are curious animals; they would swim up and dislodge
the thing."</TE>
<TE>   The shark would blow up, revealing that the U-boat had been targeted,
so the Germans would move it. But the shark repellent came to the rescue.
"It was so good it was used throughout World War II," McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who gave up her American citizenship in 1937 and became a
French citizen, used her glamour to hide spies for the French Resistance
among her entourage and transport messages hidden in her sheet music all
over Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "What she would do because she was Josephine Baker and welcomed up and
down the continent of Europe, she would take spies with her review,"
McCarthy said. "On her sheet music in invisible ink were secret messages
and she ferried them all around the European continent."</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Dietrich, who gave up her German citizenship in 1937 to become
an American, at the request of the OSS for its propaganda efforts,
recorded American songs in German that captured a wide audience in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "They revered Marlene Dietrich," McCarthy said. "They knew the instant
they had Marlene Dietrich singing popular American songs in German that
they would have this German audience instantly."</TE>
<TE>   A woman to this day known only as "355"--"lady" in the code used by
the Culper Ring in New York, which gathered intelligence on the British
during the American Revolution--helped expose American traitor Benedict
Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   "People have this notion of spies as James Bond. No, he is an example
of a very bad spy. Why? You even know what he drinks--shaken, not
stirred," McCarthy said, referring to the fictional Bond's martinis.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of 355, we don't even know what she looked like, but
there is historical documentation to what she achieved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy says one of her favorite female spies was Virginia Hall. She
first learned spycraft from the British because the Americans were
initially leery of her wooden leg, the result of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound in a hunting accident. But then America sent her ashore in Normandy
to organize elements of the French Resistance ahead of D-day.</TE>
<TE>   Hall code-named her wooden leg "Cuthbert" and any communication about
it, such as a need for more special socks to cushion the leg from the
wood, would use that reference.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit also displayed some spy gadgets. The "dog doo" transmitter
looks like a piece of excrement that, when activated, would signal to
planes a drop zone for forces or supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Matchbooks distributed by the United States overseas to obtain
information on terror suspects included one with a picture of Ramzi
Yousef, convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and another
showed an open chest with stacks of bills and explained the reward in
Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "SOB" knives, for "small of the back" where they were carried, could
be quickly reached and thrown.</TE>
<TE>   A slim silver bar of a camera could photograph hundreds of secret
documents with one roll of film. It came with an enlarger and a
developing kit for the field, McCarthy said.</TE>

<HD>Billy Graham's Past Conversation a Tough Cross to Bear</HD>
<DH>Religion: Recently released anti-Semitic comments made during a
White House chat with Nixon have roiled his relations with Jews. But some
accept apologies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN G. BREED</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>Billy Graham's birthplace is long gone, hauled off by fallen
televangelist Jim Bakker to his now defunct theme park.</LD>
<LD>   All that remains is a stone marker with a bronze relief of Graham, his
fiery eyes and square jaw leaping off the plaque.</LD>
<LD>   "Billy Graham is one of the giants of our time," reads the 1971
dedication. "Truly a man of God."</LD>
<TE>   It's signed by President Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the great evangelist is haunted by words he said three decades
ago to that same president in the presumed privacy of the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   At 83, the ailing preacher is weathering a controversy over a newly
released tape recording in which he makes disparaging remarks about Jews
in a conversation with Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the comments have all but erased the lifetime of good will
Graham had built.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear, and it's with great sadness, that his legacy will be
tarnished by this permanently," says New York Rabbi James Rudin, past
interreligious director of the American Jewish Committee. "All of that
will be balanced, unfortunately, maybe even overwhelmed, by this legacy
of his clear statements--his anti-Jewish statements.</TE>
<TE>   "And this is a very, very unforgiving . . . society in ways of judging
people."</TE>
<TE>   But while many are disappointed that a man of Graham's stature would
ever utter such words, they feel that the man should be taken for the
whole of his actions and deeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there are people who are so blinded by single-issue
morality that they will say that he is unworthy simply because of that
lapse," says James Dunn, former director of the Baptist Joint Committee
in Washington and a professor at Wake Forest University Divinity School.
"The vast majority of people didn't have him on a ridiculously high
pedestal anyway. Most folks know he was just mortal, and not
immortal--like all the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   On the tapes, Graham's trademark Southern drawl can be clearly heard
agreeing with Nixon that left-wing Jews dominate the American media.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones putting out the pornographic stuff," Graham says,
adding: "This stranglehold has got to be broken or this country's going
down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   "You believe that?" Nixon asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," says Graham.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh boy. So do I," Nixon agrees. "I can't ever say that, but I believe
it."</TE>
<TE>   What surprised many was that Graham didn't just mumble his assent to
his powerful friend's complaints about Jews; he took the conversation a
step further.</TE>
<TE>   "Not all the Jews, but a lot of the Jews are great friends of mine,
they swarm around me and are friendly to me because they know that I'm
friendly with Israel," Graham is heard saying. "But they don't know how I
really feel about what they are doing to this country."</TE>
<TE>   The comments were all the more stinging because Graham had long been
considered a staunch friend of the Jewish people. He lobbied for freer
emigration of Soviet Jews, castigated Southern Baptists for singling out
Jews for conversion and has long supported the state of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When the tapes first surfaced, Graham issued a four-sentence apology
but said he couldn't remember making the comments. Many Jews were
unimpressed, and the head of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham H.
Foxman, urged Graham to return a 1971 award from the National Conference
of Christians and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   But as the controversy grew, Graham realized a more heartfelt apology
was needed, said Larry Ross, his longtime spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Ross says Graham consulted with Jewish and Christian leaders about
what was needed. Then he issued an open apology.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever recall having those feelings about any group, especially
the Jews, and I certainly do not have them now," Graham said. "My remarks
did not reflect my love for the Jewish people. I humbly ask the Jewish
community to reflect on my actions on behalf of Jews over the years that
contradict my words in the Oval Office that day."</TE>
<TE>   When he heard Graham's second apology, Foxman declared, "This is the
Billy Graham we thought we knew."</TE>
<TE>   Ross says Graham made the apology not out of concern for his image or
legacy, but out of fear that outdated views he no longer holds would be
used by some to sow dissent between evangelicals and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin says the comments will hurt Graham in a lasting way "because of
who he was at the time . . . and where he said it."</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte teacher Emily Harris, a Jew who works in a building on the
old Graham farm site, says she worries that Graham only apologized
because he got caught.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think prejudice like that changes that quickly," Harris says,
adding that the controversy is likely to have a lasting effect. "A lot of
people don't let go that easily."</TE>
<TE>   But others feel the revelation only enhances Graham's image.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi James Bennett spoke of the Nixon tapes from his pulpit at
Charlotte's Temple Beth El, the largest reform synagogue in the
Carolinas. Graham has been a role model for piety throughout his life,
Bennett says, and now he can be a role model for repentance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Billy Graham, the legacy of Billy Graham, is perhaps
even stronger for the mature way in which he has finally, appropriately,
dealt with this whole episode," says Bennett. "His actions speak much
louder than his words. He's a great man--a man of faith. And I think that
he will be measured by the whole of his life, and not by any single
period of it."</TE>
<TE>   For most, the greatest tragedy of the episode is that it follows one
of Graham's most memorable sermons, one that many considered a fitting
swan song for a religious leader in the twilight of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Just six months ago, on a national day of prayer after the Sept. 11
attacks, a gaunt, frail Graham was helped to the pulpit of the National
Cathedral in Washington. The ailing evangelist with snow-white hair spoke
in a voice as powerful as ever, reassuring a grieving country with the
words, "This nation will not be defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the nation focused on him again for words of a different
kind, Graham likely does not have the luxury of time to repair his image.
He has been battling Parkinson's disease for years and spent much of the
last year in the hospital with pneumonia and bronchitis.</TE>
<TE>   William Martin of Rice University spent more than five years writing
his biography of Graham. He was working on his latest revisions for a new
edition when the tapes were released, and now he must make changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it were not there, but it obviously cannot be avoided," Martin
says. He said that he was personally saddened by Graham's remarks, but
that they will do little to diminish the preacher in the eyes of those
who view his whole life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the people who have been his supporters will be inclined
to forgive him," Martin says. "And some, delighted to find flaws, even
serious flaws, will be happy to hold it against him. . . . Billy Graham
would be quick to say he's a human being, not a plaster saint."</TE>
<TE>   In Charlotte, the Graham mystique is still powerful. There is the
Billy Graham Parkway, and soon the city will become headquarters to his
worldwide missions. Boosters are even raising money to return his
childhood home to Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Britt, who runs a barber shop near the Graham plaque, hopes that
people can put the Nixon tapes in the context they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us grow," he says. "We should. If we don't, we're in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a dentist's office recently on the former site of the
Graham family farm, Hugh Whitaker was reminded of an auction he attended
not long ago. One of the items for sale was a milk bottle, supposedly
from the Graham dairy.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what that bottle auctioned for?" the 74-year-old retired
salesman asked. "That bottle went for $10,600. They bought it on account
of the name, is why they bought it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Graham name still means a lot."</TE>

<HD>Deer Disease Is Spreading, Scientists Fear</HD>

<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>A wild deer on an elk ranch near Craig has tested positive for
chronic wasting disease, the first time the disease has been found west
of the Continental Divide in Colorado, Gov. Bill Owens said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Owens called the development serious, saying the future of the state's
wild deer herd could be at stake. "Until now, one of our best weapons for
containing the disease was the Continental Divide. Now that barrier has
been broken," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Test results on two other deer killed on the ranch will be available
Monday, Division of Wildlife Director Russell George said. He said he
believes they were infected too.</LD>
<TE>   Chronic wasting disease is a contagious brain ailment that strikes elk
and deer, causing them to grow thin and die. No reliable method exists to
detect the disease in live animals, so they must be killed for testing.</TE>
<TE>   The deer that tested positive was found at the Mother Well Ranch.
State Veterinarian Dr. Wayne Cunningham quarantined the ranch, and
officials plan to kill 10 more wild deer and the 39 captive elk there.</TE>
<TE>   State officials did not release the rancher's name, and no phone
number for the ranch was available.</TE>
<TE>   The infected animal was one of about 300 wild deer inadvertently
penned at the 1,800-acre ranch late last year. Most have been killed. The
infected animal was among a group killed in January and February, George
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rancher and wildlife officials tried for six months to remove the
deer before they resorted to killing them, Agriculture Commissioner Don
Ament said.</TE>
<TE>   All deer killed on the ranch are being tested for the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Officials now plan to kill at least 300 wild deer within five miles of
the ranch to determine whether the disease has spread. "It may be we have
to go to 1,000 before we get some reliable data," George said.</TE>

<HD>Remedy Sought for Vanishing Herbs</HD>
<DH>Preservation: Tribal officials join effort to save traditional
healing plants from extinction.</DH>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Herbal shampoo and medicine makers could learn something from
American Indians about harvesting medicinal and aromatic plants without
endangering some vanishing and valuable species.</LD>
<LD>   American Indians gathering plants for herbal remedies take only those
they need, and utter songs and chants lamenting the sacrifice and
affirming that the plants are being harvested to relieve suffering, said
Tis Mal Crow of Speedwell, Tenn., a Western Band Cherokee healer.</LD>
<LD>   "From any one area we limit the amount taken. They are taken only at
certain times of year," Crow said. That's in contrast with some
commercial harvesters who, he said, "go in there with bulldozers and
clear off whole hillsides."</LD>
<TE>   Crow is one of 10 members of a Native American Elder Circle who take
part in a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Medicinal Plant Working Group
discussing ways to protect threatened plants. The group also includes
representatives from industry, government, academia and environmental
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "Plants that our grandfathers' grandfathers respected and protected
for future generations are no longer available to us," said Crow, author
of "Native Plants, Native Healing." He spoke recently at a symposium the
working group helped organize on Industrial Leadership for the
Preservation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants.</TE>
<TE>   North American environments from alpine tundra to prairie grasslands,
coastal salt marshes and tropical rain forests have some 20,000 plant
species, the working group reported in December 2000. At least 175
species are marketed for use in over-the-counter remedies and supplements
in the $3 billion U.S. medicinal herb market.</TE>
<TE>   Many plants are collected from the wild in large quantities. For
example, about 65 million goldenseal plants and 34 million ginseng plants
a year have been harvested from eastern U.S. forests in recent years,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day symposium included pharmaceutical, cosmetic, vitamin and
herbal product makers, academics, farmers and government representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "We are interested in creating partnerships with as diverse a group as
possible and bringing together as many interest groups as possible," said
Julie Lyke, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist.</TE>
<TE>   Some plants are plentiful enough to harvest without concern, said
Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Assn., a
Silver Spring, Md., trade group.</TE>
<TE>   "Saw palmetto is harvested in the wild, but it's estimated that there
are 4 million acres of it," McGuffin said. "Black cohosh is one we are
concerned about. The root is the part used. End of plant."</TE>
<TE>   One presentation involved some successful efforts to cultivate black
cohosh, an 8-foot perennial with stems and roots used to treat menstrual
and digestive problems and rheumatism.</TE>
<TE>   But plants such as goldenseal root, often used in combination with
vitamin C; American ginseng, marketed as an energizer and immune
stimulant; and echinacea, also sold as an immune stimulant, are
considered at risk of extinction, Crow and McGuffin said.</TE>
<TE>   Herbal product manufacturers' demand for plants can end up preserving
natural habitats, such as rain forests, said Dominique N. Conseil,
president of Aveda, a maker of plant-based shampoos, cleansers and
cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   Conseil said that can be the result if companies show local people how
to harvest herbal products that are more profitable than logging or
clearing the land for other uses.</TE>
<TE>   "Communities need to have a source of revenue. It's about developing a
source of revenue that preserves the wild," Conseil said. "If they can
make a living from the environment without destroying it, when that
works, it's ideal."</TE>
<TE>   For some plants, the effort comes too late. Of 200 species discovered
by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their expedition of 1803 through
1806, it isn't known if 30% still exist, said Ara DerMarderosian, a
professor of pharmacognosy, the study of drugs from natural sources, at
the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   One of the working group's goals is to catalog American plants,
DerMarderosian noted. "We hope they are still there. There's a lot of
places you'll go and find a parking lot."</TE>

<HD>Zoo Woos Barn Owls With Nests</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Effort aims to reverse thinning population and keep
rodent population in check at the same time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY LIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH
</DL>
<LD>Like a real estate agent trying to attract a potential buyer,
zookeepers are hoping to repopulate western Pennsylvania with barn owls
by offering them spacious nests and a good location to breed.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of nesting sites in recent years, primarily due to a lack of
natural habitat and the use of poisons, has practically wiped out the
barn-owl population in Pennsylvania and several other states.</LD>
<LD>   But an effort to reintroduce the nocturnal raptors into the region by
installing nests at the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; Aquarium promises to offer a
rare sight for local bird watchers. Officials hope the birds also will
keep the rodent population around the zoo in check.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty nests were installed around the zoo's 77 acres last August for
screech owls and kestrels, which are also known as sparrow hawks. Another
five nests--2-foot by 2-foot wooden cubes atop 12-foot poles--will be put
up this spring for barn owls.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be bringing barn owls back to an area they can thrive," said
zookeeper Mark Browning, an animal trainer by trade and head of the owl
project. "They're a wonderful predator so we'll also be able to see how
much the barn owls will help us with rodent control."</TE>
<TE>   Barn owls are crow-sized, golden-colored birds found throughout the
world. They once flourished in Pennsylvania, making their nests in large,
dead trees and wooden barns, but development has left the owls with fewer
places to nest.</TE>
<TE>   "They like grassy meadows to hunt mice and we have changed their
habitat," said Sally Conyne, director of citizen science at the National
Audubon Society.</TE>
<TE>   Conyne said the use of pesticides and rodenticides likely killed many
barn owls when they ate their prey.</TE>
<TE>   Ornithologist Dan Brauning of the state Game Commission estimated
there are about 10 nests in any given year across Pennsylvania, a drastic
reduction from reports of 10 to 15 years ago, when there were as many as
150 nests.</TE>
<TE>   "Barn owls tend to be listed as special concerns in many states," he
said. "The state [Pennsylvania] listed it as an at-risk species."</TE>
<TE>   Browning said he proposed the owl project and received about $1,000 in
grants from the zoo's conservation foundation after learning about the
benefits of having owls around.</TE>
<TE>   "I became aware that palm oil nut plantations in Southeast Asia were
using barn owls for rodent control," he said. "So we began a project here
to increase the number of screech owls, kestrels and barn owls."</TE>
<TE>   While the screech owls and kestrels have already begun settling into
their new homes, it's unlikely barn owls will migrate into man-made nests
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the zoo plans to acquire two baby barn owls from the
Moraine Preservation Fund, a breed-and-release foundation in western
Pennsylvania, and teach them to hunt before releasing them into the
nests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been shown in studies by ornithologists that you can increase
natural densities of certain birds by providing nest boxes for them, as
long as there is a sufficient amount of available food," Browning said.</TE>
<TE>   In time, officials hope that the owls will begin to breed and
repopulate the area. Browning plans to track their effectiveness in
controlling the rodent population and teach other zoos to maintain
similar programs.</TE>
<TE>   The National Audubon Society encourages reintroduction programs like
one at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Conyne said similar efforts to put up nests in
Delaware, Florida and New Jersey have had great success.</TE>

<LD>Deep Throat</LD>
<LD>   Still a mystery after 30 years. The identity of the Washington Post's
Watergate informant remains "the best kept secret in the history of the
nation's capital," says John Dean, the White House counsel whose Senate
testimony helped unseat President Nixon. Benjamin C. Bradlee, former Post
executive editor, said he learned the man's name only after Nixon
resigned; before that, he said, reporter Bob Woodward told him only about
Deep Throat's job in the executive branch, his experience and his access.
The world might learn Deep Throat's identity after he dies.</LD>
<LD>   National Security Agency</LD>
<TE>   The NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, stayed a closely held secret
for about a decade, says James Bamford, who wrote two books about the
eavesdroppers. In 1960, two agents defected to Moscow and talked about it
at a Red Square news conference. "That sort of blew it," Bamford said.
Even then, the government was not up front about the snoops who uncovered
Soviet secrets during the Cuban missile crisis and used Berber linguists
to link Libyan agents to the 1986 bombing of a German discotheque that
killed a U.S. soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Greenbrier</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, President Eisenhower authorized construction of an elaborate
hideaway for 1,100 officials, including members of Congress, under the
Greenbrier Resort in White Sulfur Springs, W.Va., a four-hour drive from
Washington. Resort officials denied knowing what was beneath them.
Details came out in the press in 1992 and, with the Cold War over, the
government turned control of the facility over to the resort, which now
takes customers on tours and rents it out for parties. In 2000, voters
defeated a proposal to make the bunker the home of the state's first
casino.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Pony</TE>
<TE>   This bunker near Culpeper, Va., once held several billion dollars
stacked close to the ceiling, meant to revive the economy after a nuclear
attack. It had an indoor shooting range, lead-lined shutters and a
cold-storage area to hold any bodies that could not be buried outdoors
because of radiation. Mount Pony's peacetime purpose was serving as the
central node, or "switch," for the nation's electronic funds transfers.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond sold it in 1998 for use as a Library
of Congress film repository. Thus was born a new secret: What contingency
plans the Fed has now.</TE>

<HD>Shadow Government's Secret Is Out; Officials Want It Back In</HD>

<LD>A SECURE UNDISCLOSED LOCATION--There are secrets here in the
countryside outside Washington, but they are not well kept. In this
verdant land, streams run clear, fish leap and secrets leak.</LD>
<LD>   At undisclosed locations far enough from the capital to survive a
nuclear blast, a hidden federal government is at work, scores of
officials swallowed up by the hills.</LD>
<LD>   They toil in rocky warrens, micro-Washingtons stuffed into tunnels,
with communication links, emergency food rations and stale air.</LD>
<TE>   The government won't say where they are.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, lots of other people are sure they know.</TE>
<TE>   The government kept a tight lid on the locations of its bombproof
emergency centers outside the capital until the Cold War ended and
everyone relaxed. Now facing terrorist threats, Washington is trying to
take these secrets back.</TE>
<TE>   But these installations have neighbors over the barbed-wire fence.
Satellite pictures are available. And how hush-hush can anything be when
motor mouths talk about it online?</TE>
<TE>   "It's simply a matter of connecting the dots," said Steven Aftergood
of the Federation of American Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   An unofficial tour around one such site was provided by a civil
servant who works in an unrelated part of the government. He lives
hereabout and is well-connected to hamlets in the vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   He will be known as Deep Trout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an underground bunker," he says, pointing to a hilltop on a
horizon etched by radio towers. "Everyone knows that. It's like trying to
put the genie back in the bottle."</TE>
<TE>   On Thanksgiving, he took his kids up a nearby hill that also has
communication equipment. Previous outings caused no trouble. This time,
military police confronted them in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   He asked one guard what was going on. "The guy said, 'If I tell you
I'll have to kill you.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was smiling," Deep Trout added.</TE>
<TE>   People grew up here knowing they had a mysterious federal installation
in their midst--the one up the slope where tunnels go straight into rock
and seem never to come out.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the country knows about it," says Bobbi, a homeowner whose yard
borders the federal property down a winding lane.</TE>
<TE>   If not half the country, then surely half the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear more things than normal people up here," says Julie, pausing
in the stockroom of her family's grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   But she's not too nosy when people come in from the mountain. "I don't
think that's fair that I ask them and put them in a predicament which
they shouldn't be in. Their job's secret."</TE>
<TE>   People joke they expect to run into Vice President Dick Cheney, often
said to be hunkered down in secure undisclosed locations after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who were interviewed gave their full names and other
particulars. Those details, like Deep Trout's identity, are not being
reported, to avoid giving away the location.</TE>
<TE>   The White House says as many as 150 officials from every Cabinet
agency work in two sites, staying on the compounds 24 hours a day until
they rotate out and others replace them, under a plan tailored to the
terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   Their basic needs are met. In Deep Trout's territory, there is no call
and perhaps no opportunity to venture to the local restaurant for the
rustic specialty, hog maw.</TE>
<TE>   A citizen who has frequently delivered supplies inside said the
facilities are Spartan, with heavy desks the color of battleships and the
air not country fresh. "Typical '50s decor," the supplier said.</TE>
<TE>   New furniture is being rushed in. The tunnel leading to the multistory
underground offices has a massive door, then another, and the two are
never opened at the same time, the supplier said.</TE>
<TE>   The second site that national security experts believe is also home to
the hidden government is several hours away.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hive of activity at the crest of a hill. A helicopter roars
from the pad, traffic flows past the gate. An officer questions two
people taking pictures by the road, checks their identification and
encourages them to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Among the secure federal facilities arcing around Washington, two have
been documented as primary backups for the Pentagon and a cross-section
of federal agencies. They can house large numbers of officials
indefinitely; declassified plans for one of them, from 1951, called for
office space for 5,400 people.</TE>
<TE>   "By refusing to identify the locations, the government may actually be
creating a mystique around the facilities and encouraging speculation,
curiosity," Aftergood said.</TE>
<TE>   There was once plenty of mystique surrounding an elaborate bunker
secretly built for members of Congress under the Greenbrier resort in
West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   After the Cold War, when the risk of a nuclear attack eased, it came
to be seen as a relic and its functions were detailed in the media. Now
the public can tour it.</TE>
<TE>   In Deep Trout country, Jill steps out of the fragrance of her quilt,
birdhouse and curio store to look out on the secret mountain. "It was a
little scary being here when things went down in September," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, the skies thickened with fighter jets and helicopters,
and that has happened many times since. Roads were blocked and parents
could not immediately reach their kids at school.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis in America's stricken cities had come to the quiet hills.</TE>
<TE>   After that, everyone was jumpy.</TE>
<TE>   When teenage hikers and a teacher on a school field trip drifted off
their trail in October and came too close to the federal site,
camouflaged men with guns stopped them.</TE>
<TE>   Another teacher, watching from a distance, called police to say
somebody was holding his students at gunpoint. Everything was sorted out.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the "white van" incident.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the day they spotted the Arabs," said Bobbi. "We were out of
here in five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Men in a van had raised suspicions, and authorities told residents to
watch for danger. It was apparently a misunderstanding of some sort and
no more was said about it.</TE>
<TE>   "We never find out," Jill said. "We never know the results."</TE>

<LD>Every few months there's another news story: A prison inmate,
sometimes one behind bars for decades, is released when a reexamination
of the case shows he was wrongfully convicted.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes there's new evidence that police were corrupt or that
forensic scientists made mistakes. Sometimes, DNA tests bring
exoneration. Sometimes incompetence by defense lawyers is proved.
Whatever the reason, a growing number of wrongly convicted inmates are
being released.</LD>
<LD>   What then?</LD>
<TE>   Each case is unique, but experts have found some trends: Those
released after shorter incarceration adjust more readily; some ex-inmates
receive compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they do, it is hardly adequate, says Rob Warden, executive
director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern Law
School.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't give you back your life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Many still feel an accusing finger pointed at them, sometimes by
former prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "You practically have to do the Heimlich maneuver to get the words out
of them--'He was innocent,' " says James McCloskey, president of
Centurion Ministries, a New Jersey-based advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press profiles look at the post-release lives of two freed
men, one held for a decade and released in 1977, the other imprisoned for

<DH>Housing: Spurred by patriotic duty as well as bargain prices, a
devastated neighborhood is experiencing a resurgence of residents.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Liz Finn's new one-bedroom apartment has granite counter tops and a
walk-in closet, and the rent is $1,850 a month--a bargain by Manhattan
standards.</LD>
<LD>   It is also three blocks from the wreckage of the World Trade Center,
where workers are still recovering human remains.</LD>
<LD>   But six months-plus after the attack, a combination of reduced rents
and condo prices, proposed government incentives and a public-spirited
desire to participate in the rebirth of downtown is luring new residents
to replace the thousands who left.</LD>
<TE>   Finn, an account executive with Calvin Klein jeans who formerly lived
on Manhattan's Upper West Side, is part of the influx of people into
lower Manhattan. She said she wanted to do "something to help the
community rebuild from 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say they have seen a particular surge in the past month,
since federally funded incentives were proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Given how scarce housing is in New York City, it's almost inevitable
that an area as desirable as downtown New York would be resettled," said
Steven Cohen, director of a public administration master's program at
Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Battery Park City, the single largest downtown
neighborhood, say the occupancy rate at the rental and condo community
has climbed to 76%. Clark Whelton, spokesman for the Battery Park City
Authority, said occupancy had dropped to 60% last fall.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Battery Park City was a ghost town after the Sept. 11 attack.
Residents of all 6,345 apartments were evacuated, and up to a third of
rental tenants chose not to return. Stores and restaurants closed, and
for weeks the area was off-limits to everyone except emergency workers.</TE>
<TE>   Price is drawing people back. At Gateway Plaza, a 1,700-unit rental
complex within Battery Park City, apartments are being advertised as low
as $1,480 for studios and $2,570 for two-bedrooms--20% to 25% less than
before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The LeFrak Organization, which owns the complex, said it has signed
300 new leases in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The condo market has picked up as well.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group real estate
firm, said she is seeing a surge in buyers "who think that this is a
great opportunity to buy something much cheaper than you would normally
be able to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran's Battery Park City listings include a two-bedroom apartment
for $750,000 and a one-bedroom for $329,000--tens of thousands of dollars
lower than before the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed government incentives have boosted interest too. The plan
would award grants of up to $12,000 to people who sign leases or buy
apartments in lower Manhattan and remain there for two years.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of each grant would depend on the proximity of a residence
to the trade center.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate ads already trumpet the grants, even though the program
must still be approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and it could be months before any checks are cut.</TE>
<TE>   But Finn, who is not eligible because she signed only a one-year
lease, said she was motivated by a desire to help--and by an attractive
neighborhood along the Hudson River.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a very friendly, very warm neighborhood," she said as
the movers hauled in her sofa and bookshelves.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited to spread my wings a little bit."</TE>

<HD>Hatchery Salmon Suspected of Muting the Call of the Wild</HD>
<DH>Science: Efforts to prop up natural populations could destroy wild
fish instead, critics warn. And clubbing the 'surplus' is controversial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FOSTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FALL CREEK, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>The forest is cloaked in mist, a chilling gray that drifts through
the mossy tangle of limbs. It is barely dawn, but Ronald Yechout is wide
awake, recounting the day he stumbled across the Fall Creek salmon
massacre.</LD>
<LD>   "Here," says Yechout, striding across a narrow bridge. One day in
November 1998, Yechout stopped at Fall Creek while elk hunting to admire
the annual return of coho salmon from the ocean. "The river was full of
fish, absolutely crawling with them," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Yechout (pronounced YEK-it) was delighted. But then he heard thunks
and thwacks coming from the nearby fish hatchery. Walking over, he found
hatchery workers with baseball bats, clubbing thousands of salmon to
death.</LD>
<TE>   What's going on? he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The answer puzzled him, then outraged him, then launched him on a
crusade that, three years later, has helped throw the Northwest's
salmon-recovery effort into turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Along this creek in the Oregon woods, scientists tried to create a
salmon that equaled the wild fish made by nature--and then, deciding they
had failed, set about erasing their mistake with clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Killing salmon to protect salmon? Yechout, standing by a creek now
bereft of fish, thinks that this is no way to save a species.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1800s, when industrial society arrived in the Pacific
Northwest, the salmon began to disappear. Traps and nets intercepted
millions of fish. Dams blocked rivers. Log drives scoured stream beds
clean of fish eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody wished ill for the fish. The five species of Pacific salmon and
their cousin, the steelhead, were a vital part of the economy. But there
was no political will to stop development or overfishing, so
Northwesterners staked their hopes on hatcheries, which promised to
restore the lost abundance with no need to preserve habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcheries were supposed to take advantage of salmon's nomadic life
cycle, keeping them safe from predators as eggs and young fish, then
letting them fend for themselves during their migration to the sea and
back.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's first salmon hatchery was built in 1877, and many others
followed. For decades, however, few of them worked. It wasn't until the
1960s that hatcheries regularly yielded enough returning adults to supply
the eggs needed for the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   Techniques gradually improved, and hatcheries now prop up salmon
populations all around the Pacific Rim. Hatcheries in Canada, Japan,
Russia and the United States released up to 6 billion salmon annually
during the last decade, accounting for about 25% of all young salmon
entering the North Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   In the Northwest, total salmon numbers are still a fraction of
historic levels, even when hatchery fish are counted, but hatcheries have
been credited with stopping or reversing the decline in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   Although this has given fishermen something to catch, concern has
grown that hatchery salmon are yet another deadly stress for wild salmon,
which have continued to dwindle.</TE>
<TE>   After months of being fed and protected from predators, young hatchery
fish can be three times bigger than wild salmon when released, posing
stiff competition for food. Crowds of hatchery fish can attract
predators, which then gladly devour the wild fish too.</TE>
<TE>   "The hatchery's call is that we can circumvent nature and still have
our fish," says Bill Bakke, founder of the Native Fish Society in Oregon
and a critic of hatcheries. "The big 'but' is that you can't replace the
natural ecosystem with industrial technology. Nature's goal is survival.
Our goal is to produce a commodity."</TE>
<TE>   A hatchery fish, he contends, is more farm animal than wild creature.
From the beginning, hatchery managers couldn't resist the temptation to
tweak their wild stock in pursuit of better fish. They trucked eggs
hundreds of miles from one river to another. They collected eggs from
only the biggest, the brightest-colored or the earliest-returning adults.</TE>
<TE>   Such practices are frowned upon now, but Bakke says that even the most
conscientious hatcheries still steer salmon from their wild state. He
cites studies indicating that hatchery salmon are less efficient
foragers, less territorial, less fearful of predators, and less variable
in size and shape. Some tend to seek food near the surface, waiting for
pellets to fall from the sky as they did in the hatchery.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientists have a name for it: domestication selection," Bakke says.
"A hatchery will always change your salmon population so it doesn't do as
well in a natural environment."</TE>
<TE>   These are not new concerns. Over the past two decades, government
biologists have reached consensus that naturally spawning stocks are
essential to the salmon's survival, regardless of how hatchery fish are
faring.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, the federal government has listed 26 populations of West
Coast salmon and steelhead as endangered or threatened. Coho salmon along
the Oregon coast--the species produced at Fall Creek--were declared
threatened in 1998, despite a vigorous hatchery program.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, the year before the Fall Creek hatchery opened, 80,000 wild
coho swam up the Alsea River, which drains Fall Creek. By 1998, there
were fewer than 300.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the wild coho, commercial fishing off the coast was largely
prohibited for both wild and hatchery salmon, which can be distinguished
from each other only after they're caught. (Hatchery fish have a small
fin clipped at the hatchery.)</TE>
<TE>   With minimal demand for hatchery salmon, Oregon officials stopped
production at Fall Creek. But what to do with hatchery coho already in
the ocean, preparing to swim back to Fall Creek? Biologists didn't want
those fish interbreeding with the few remaining wild coho or competing
with them for spawning sites.</TE>
<TE>   Fall Creek's wild coho return to spawn from December to February, a
staggered migration that hedges the population's bets in case late-winter
storms wash away some young salmon as they emerge from eggs in the stream
bed. The hatchery fish, by contrast, returned mostly in November.</TE>
<TE>   So, in November 1998, hatchery workers trapped and clubbed about 6,600
hatchery-reared coho that swam up Fall Creek.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Yechout, a bank manager in nearby Philomath, entered the
scene. Appalled at the killing of what he considered a fine run of
salmon, he returned with a video camera to record the slaughter. Then he
took his footage on the road, lobbying legislators, Rotary clubs and any
audience he thought might help revive the hatchery program.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he found Wayne Giesy, a former state legislator and
member of the Alsea Valley Alliance, a local property-rights group. The
two men believe that government biologists exaggerate the differences
between hatchery and wild salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "If fish can travel thousands of miles out to the ocean and then come
back to the same river . . . they're pretty darn wild by the time they
get back," Yechout says.</TE>
<TE>   Giesy says straying hatchery fish have bred with salmon in streams for
so long that nearly all supposedly wild salmon in the Northwest have some
hatchery-born ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   Their message--that there'd be no salmon crisis if hatchery fish were
encouraged to spawn rather than whacked on the head--struck a nerve among
rural residents weary of land-use restrictions designed to protect wild
salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Legal Foundation, a California-based property-rights
group, helped the Alsea Valley Alliance press its case, and last
September, U. S. District Judge Michael Hogan handed the groups a
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan threw out the coastal Oregon coho's threatened status, ruling
that hatchery and wild coho were genetically the same. It was a narrow
decision about one stock of fish, but the broader implications--that
hatchery fish can be produced in abundance so there's no need to protect
wild fish--created panic within the region's salmon-recovery effort.</TE>
<TE>   After the judge's order, logging quickly resumed where it had been
blocked by protections for the coho, only to be stopped again in December
when environmentalists appealing Hogan's decision got a temporary stay.
The case could drag on for years.</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Services, meanwhile, was beset by
lawsuits and petitions challenging other salmon listings. The agency has
decided to take another look at 25 of the 26 West Coast salmon and
steelhead populations considered threatened or endangered.</TE>
<TE>   At Fall Creek, the last hatchery coho arrived in the fall of 1999 and
were dispatched, again, by clubbing. Thirty-two wild fish were allowed to
pass upstream to their spawning grounds.</TE>
<TE>   In a low, boxy building a few yards from the stream, hatchery
officials now ponder their next move. How much can you change a wild
creature, they wonder, without destroying its essential wildness, its
ability to survive and thrive on its own?</TE>
<TE>   Biologists at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife are proposing
a research hatchery for Fall Creek, the first in Oregon. While other
hatcheries produce salmon for harvest, this one would try to learn how
wild and hatchery salmon can coexist.</TE>
<TE>   One goal would be to raise hatchery salmon that act more wild, an
infinitely tricky business. Among the proposals: Feed the young fish
less, forcing them to forage. Paint concrete raceways in mottled colors,
simulating a stream bed. Put big, scary fish in a nearby tank to teach
young salmon to fear predators.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Schamber, hatchery manager at Fall Creek, says current wisdom
stresses randomly selecting adult salmon to provide eggs, to maintain
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   But salmon don't mate randomly. A female picks a male after careful
inspection, checking out his hooked snout, breeding colors and ability to
chase off competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "We may learn there are some things we don't want to randomize,"
Schamber says. "There are things we still don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Thinking like a salmon is no easy task.</TE>
<TE>   "We can never mimic nature completely," Schamber says. For the
salmon's sake, he hopes they can come close enough.</TE>

<HD>Support for Salton Sea Is Drying Up</HD>
<DH>Resources: The inland body of water has been imperiled for decades,
but budget-conscious politicians are under pressure to commit money
elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEON DROUIN KEITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SALTON CITY, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Efforts to save the Salton Sea, one of the most important but
endangered habitats in North America, are in jeopardy as California races
a federal deadline to reduce its use of Colorado River water and
lawmakers worry that the cost may be too high.</LD>
<LD>   Warnings about the sea's demise are nothing new, but its supporters
increasingly are striking a downbeat note about the prospects of
restoring the state's largest inland body of water.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know where we're going to get the water" to save the sea,
said Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs), who is continuing restoration
efforts begun by her late husband and congressional predecessor, Sonny
Bono. "I think this year is really crunch time . . . and it's time for
people to work harder than they ever worked on the sea."</LD>
<TE>   The sea, not quite a fifth the size of the Great Salt Lake and 25%
saltier than the Pacific Ocean, is a hugely productive fishery and one of
the most crucial stops for migratory birds in North America. If it were
allowed to shrivel, scientists are concerned that wind storms laden with
its exposed soil could create a pungent health threat.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to save it, however, are caught in the middle of California's
rough-and-tumble water politics, competing against urban, agricultural
and environmental water needs.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the water that feeds the sea, formed by a canal breach in
1905, is bound for urban areas to help end the state's overindulgence at
the Colorado River trough. It is sustained primarily by farm runoff, but
that's not enough to prevent the sea's salinity from rising.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists contend that the salinity levels will kill off fish in
a few decades or sooner. For now, the sea is still brimming with fish,
mostly corvina, croaker and tilapia, although periodic algal blooms and
fish kills have raised concerns about the sea's health.</TE>
<TE>   The fish and other marine creatures have made the sea "virtually an
international airport for migratory birds," said Tim Krantz, a University
of Redlands environmental studies professor.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 bird species have been seen around the sea, which
sometimes attracts millions of individual birds a day. It has hosted an
estimated 90% of the world's population of eared grebes at once and more
than half of its American white pelicans.</TE>
<TE>   The sea is a major stopover along the Pacific flyway, a path for
migratory birds extending from Alaska to the tropics. Records from banded
birds found that avian visitors to the sea have ended up not only all
over North America, but also in South America, Russia and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife is particularly dependent on the sea because development has
destroyed roughly 95% of California's wetlands--a higher percentage than
any other state.</TE>
<TE>   The U. S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Salton Sea Authority, an
entity formed by local governments in 1993, have long studied ways to
control salinity.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot projects are using solar evaporation ponds and modified
snow-making equipment to pull salt out of the sea, and officials are
studying the idea of desalinating sea water using waste energy from the
area's geothermal plants.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts would need to be greatly expanded if Imperial Valley
farmers start reusing more of their water to allow the Imperial
Irrigation District to sell up to 300,000 acre-feet a year to water
agencies in San Diego and the Coachella Valley, which includes Palm
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   An acre-foot of water is about 326,000 gallons, or enough to supply
eight people for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed transfers would cause the sea's elevation to plummet 23
feet--close to half of its 51-foot current maximum depth. That would
shrink bird habitat, cause the sea's salinity to rise more quickly and
expose thousands of acres of shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Those losses will merely hasten the inevitable, said Jim Taylor,
assistant general counsel for the San Diego County Water Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The sea is a hard question," he said. "We have a site that is already
declining. The sea will be too salty for fish in the next 20 years or
so."</TE>
<TE>   The transfers are needed to diversify San Diego's water supply and
meet the terms of a seven-state agreement meant to end decades of
disputes over Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   The other Colorado River states have agreed to give California 15
years to reduce its use of river water from about 5.2 million acre-feet
per year to its legally allotted 4.4 million acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   But if California fails to put adequate conservation measures in place
by year's end, the deal could evaporate and California might be forced to
quickly slash its water use.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kirk, executive director of the Salton Sea Authority, said the
proposal to recycle farm water isn't conservation at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't really conserved water that had been used by crops; we're
conserving water that had been used by the Salton Sea," Kirk said. "What
you're actually saying is that water going to the sea is a waste."</TE>
<TE>   The transfers could take place without affecting runoff to the sea if
the irrigation district reduced water use by fallowing about 15% of the
valley's farmland.</TE>
<TE>   If the irrigation district decides to recycle farm water, Kirk
estimates that the water loss would more than double the cost of
controlling salinity with evaporation ponds to as much as $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Several federal and state officials, including U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), have said there is no prospect for spending so much
on the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The irrigation district's environmental documents propose spending
significantly less on fish ponds intended to replace bird habitat lost
because of the water transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "There may have to be some trade-offs with regard to some
environmental issues," said Andy Horne, a member of the district's board
of directors.</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Surge Holds Mexican Citizens Hostage</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials say the widespread pattern of the abductions is
also hurting business and tourism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA J. ADAMS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Miguel Soriano sat in darkness, wondering whether he would live or
die. Bound and blindfolded, his mind was the only thing allowed to run
free, flashing memories of his life and worst-case scenarios of what
could happen to him, his wife and his children.</LD>
<LD>   "The days became eternal," Soriano said. "I kept thinking the worst,
and 'Why me?' "</LD>
<LD>   Why indeed? This was no millionaire, just the humble owner of five
small graphic arts businesses. But as Mexico endures an epidemic of
kidnaps-for-ransom, no one is safe--neither politicians and business
moguls nor ordinary housewives or even their maids.</LD>
<TE>   Grabbed in the middle of the day just two blocks from his house in
Mexico state, Soriano was held for five days, forced to withdraw $2,630
worth of pesos from automatic teller machines and finally released after
he agreed to pay an additional $14,250 or else his family would be
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the 42-year-old man still lives in fear.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of his story is unusual: He fought through a corrupt
system and his captors are now in prison. But his ordeal is nothing new.
Mexico suffers hundreds of kidnappings a year. By some estimates, it
could be the worst-hit in the world after No. 1 Colombia, where
guerrillas and drug traffickers dominate the abduction business.</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapping first flourished into a major Mexican enterprise in the
early 1990s, dominated by professional criminal organizations that
researched their wealthy victims extensively before abducting them for
days or months and demanding millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Former kidnapping capo Daniel Arizmendi--known as the "ear-lopper" for
his gruesome habit of sending victims' ears to family members--made an
estimated $30 million to $40 million in five years before he was arrested
in 1998, says Max Morales, a lawyer who helped capture him and has
represented several of his victims.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with most of the organized networks broken, experts say most
kidnappings are conducted by loosely organized gangs, drug traffickers
looking for alternative business ventures, common criminals and even
middle-class professionals who see it as a way to make a quick buck
overnight. Ransoms now go as low as a couple hundred dollars.</TE>
<TE>A Dangerous Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</TE>
<TE>   "What makes kidnapping different in Mexico is that it's a crime of
extreme ambition," Morales said. "Many of those responsible already have
a life, a job, a business, but they see this as a way to get rich
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   In December, seven law students--several of whom were doing volunteer
work in the state prosecutor's office--were arrested in Tijuana for
allegedly kidnapping a 12-year-old girl in a marketplace. They planned to
collect $150,000 to cover university fees.</TE>
<TE>   The nephew of a former interior secretary was targeted by two
colleagues who asked for a ride home from the office, then took him
hostage. The nephew escaped by crashing his car in front of a police
station.</TE>
<TE>   Examples of police involvement are legion. It is estimated that 60% to
80% of all kidnappings involve current or former police officials, who
either extort kidnappers or work directly with them.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano's abduction was arranged by a family friend, a former Mexico
City police officer. A bank security camera caught him withdrawing money
from Soriano's account.</TE>
<TE>   The corruption even has infiltrated task forces responsible for
capturing kidnappers: Among the most notorious arrests have been those of
anti-kidnapping chiefs in Mexico City and Morelos state.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a high level of impunity," said Miguel Arroyo, spokesman for
the advocacy group Mexico United Against Crime. "It's a huge business."</TE>
<TE>   So big, in fact, that Mexican diplomats recently warned President
Vicente Fox's government that it threatens foreign investment and
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "There is great concern on the part of foreigners about what is
happening," said Jose Antonio Ortega, a public safety advisor for the
Mexican Employers Confederation. "We feel that it is going to cause major
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Lavender, a 75-year-old Iowan who owns a real estate business in
Acapulco, was kidnapped last June and held for 117 days. At a news
conference after his release in October, he declined to reveal whether
the $2.5-million ransom was paid and said he would not file a criminal
complaint because "there's no point."</TE>
<TE>   New York native Vincent Carrozza, a hotel manager in Acapulco, was
kidnapped by 10 heavily armed men and held for eight days in December
1997. He was released unharmed. State police said they were asked by
Carrozza's family not to get involved and did not know if any ransom was
paid.</TE>
<TE>   The previous year, Mamoru Konno, a top executive of Sanyo Video
Components USA, was kidnapped in Tijuana. His company paid $2 million for
his release eight days later.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, whose election in 2000 was seen as ushering in democracy in
Mexico, has vowed to eliminate corruption and declared 2002 the "year of
public safety." He has replaced the federal judicial police--the most
corrupt of all Mexico's police forces--with a national police force
similar to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the justice department and state prosecutors from around
the country agreed to establish a national office to coordinate the fight
against kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>System in Dire Need of Revamping</TE>
<TE>   The office also will provide services for victims who now face
endless, confusing bureaucracy and investigators who aren't trained to
help them cope with the traumas caused by kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   The few cases that reach the courts are often handled by corrupt
judges who dismiss charges or reduce sentences in exchange for bribes. A
recent government report says judges "operate a slow, repetitive system
prone to corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Soriano says his kidnappers' lawyers offered him 200,000 pesos
($22,200) not to testify. He turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was better to contribute my small grain of sand to
justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge in the case, who could have sentenced the defendants to
50 years in prison, handed down three-year terms. Both sides are
appealing.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican justice department did not respond to repeated requests
for statistics on kidnappings. Statistics reported by security experts
and newspaper columnists range from 400 to more than 550 kidnappings in
2001. Even authorities concede that most victims don't report the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Control Risks Group, a private security company with offices in Mexico
City, says there were between 1,700 and 2,200 kidnappings in Mexico in
2001, compared to 2,000-2,500 in Colombia and 900-1,400 in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Kroll, another security company, estimates the number at 1,200.
Morales, who has represented more than 300 kidnap victims, insists that
on average, there are 10 a day--3,600 a year.</TE>
<TE>   None of those statistics includes "express kidnappings"--abductions in
which the victim is held for several hours or a day, forced to withdraw
money from ATMs or to contact family members for quick ransoms.</TE>
<TE>   Morales and Mark Carlson, managing director of Control Risks, estimate
that 65 to 70 express kidnappings a day in Mexico City and environs.</TE>
<TE>   Such abductions are recorded by police as robberies, not kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a dozen former and active-duty police officers were arrested
for allegedly participating in a gang that kidnapped a 27-year-old New
York University student, Fredy Mc Phail, in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>Calls of Commiseration</TE>
<TE>   The officers allegedly robbed the student and forced him to drink so
much alcohol that he ended up choking to death on his own vomit.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father told news media at the time that he received a dozen
calls from relatives of people who had suffered similar attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the officers drew prison sentences ranging from 68 and 98 years
but would have to serve only 50, the maximum under Mexican law.</TE>
<TE>   But Soriano is doubtful that things will change soon--for Mexico or
for him. More than two years after his kidnapping, he still doesn't go
outside unaccompanied. Neither do his wife or children.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still painful . . . difficult to open up and trust other
people," he said. "After what happened, my family and I, we will never
again be the same."</TE>

<HD>Corruption Is Impeding Fight Against Kidnapping</HD>

<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>If experts are right in saying only one-third of kidnappings in
Mexico are reported to authorities, one reason is the widespread belief
that those authorities are part of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   But despite death threats and corruption in high places, Sulpicio
Armijo soldiers on.</LD>
<LD>   The 63-year-old rancher paid 150,000 pesos ($16,700) to the men who
kidnapped his 23-year-old son in Acapulco in July 1997 and held him for
seven days. The man behind the kidnapping was a neighbor, Diogenes Justo
Herrera, to whom he had refused a loan worth $2,190.</LD>
<TE>   The neighbor also was a friend of top state officials, who would not
arrest him despite the evidence against him.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a state tribunal overturned the 40-year prison
sentences a judge had imposed on the other three defendants. Armijo has
since filed a lawsuit against the tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he got federal authorities to arrest Herrera, only to have
an Acapulco judge throw out the case. Armijo appealed to the same state
tribunal and went to the media.</TE>
<TE>   He persevered: The tribunal sentenced the leader to 40 years, and a
federal judge added 10 years for engaging in organized crime and
illegally possessing weapons. The others received four to eight years on
organized-crime charges.</TE>
<TE>   All are appealing their sentences, and Armijo worries that they could
go free.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he wins, Armijo has lost the life he once knew. Death threats
have forced him to leave Azoyu, his home town of 10,000 people, where he
once owned 300 head of cattle, and move to Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   "If I go back, they will kill me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Armijo said he won't give up, but most are not so brave. Of 20
kidnapping victims he contacted, only four would accompany him to Mexico
City to file complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I, too, am afraid, but I'm not going to be a coward and back down,"
he said. "I'm no longer doing this for myself. I'm doing it for society."</TE>

<HD>Afghan New Year Has New Meaning</HD>
<DH>Holidays: Expatriates in the Bay Area are celebrating the
removal of the Taliban and its restrictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PLEASANTON</DL>
<LD>Friends and relatives have suffered through two decades of war, years
of totalitarian oppression and, last week, deadly earthquakes, but
Afghan expatriates in California's Bay Area say they and their kin
have more to celebrate than ever this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Just miles from Freemont's Little Kabul district--the heart of the
largest Afghan population in this country--celebrants Saturday
observed one of Central Asia's oldest traditions, Now-Ruz, or Afghan
New Year.</LD>
<LD>   Though past celebrations have been punctuated by stories of human
struggle back home, Afghan immigrants said they are unusually hopeful
now that the Taliban and its restrictions have been removed.</LD>
<TE>   They pointed out that this is the first time in years that their
friends and relatives could celebrate the occasion in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as Afghani as it gets," said Arash Obadai, 25. "The fact
that we could only celebrate here in the United States was very sad.
There's something very significant about it this year, because
finally, or hopefully, we have a democratic government.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the world's attention focused on Afghanistan, we're
hoping something good will come out," Obadai said.</TE>
<TE>   Nil Ufar, a 23-year-old Hayward resident and a member of the
Society of Afghan Professionals, agreed. "Now-Ruz is about a new
year, and I really hope this is the start of a new year in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Afghanistan two weeks ago," Obadai said, "and it was
amazing to see hope in people's eyes. After 23 years of war, I
expected to see only trauma and fear, and I saw the exact opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Now-Ruz falls on March 21, but organizers of the event said they
couldn't book space at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton
any earlier than Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The daylong celebration, which is sponsored by the Afghan Center
in Fremont, was expected to draw up to 12,000.</TE>
<TE>   Thick crowds of visitors were greeted by dozens of vendors selling
an array of Afghan delicacies, teas, silver and lapis jewelry, richly
decorated rugs, Afghan music and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, women either wore or purchased brightly colored
Afghan dresses--dresses commonly worn prior to weddings and decorated
with intricate gold embroidery, small mirrors, coins and beads.</TE>
<TE>   As children flew a kite nearby, caterer Farida Rahimi, 25, of
Union City, dipped a long-handled ladle into a steaming caldron of
shurwa kala, or head soup. As she stirred the thick, yellow broth,
large chunks of beef, tongue and stomach rose and sank in the
mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Behind her, children swarmed over an assortment of geeleebee--a
deep-fried and honey-covered confection that resembles a coiled rope
and is eaten with tea. "You need to have a really sweet tooth to eat
those," said Rahimi, who was born in Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Jelani Gholam, 38, a native of Kabul, exhibited carpets,
landscapes and portraits painted by his brother on scraps of
cardboard, drapery and other handy materials.</TE>
<TE>   Gholam said his brother had moved to Pakistan to paint because the
Taliban had banned the display of such artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I think this new year is so important," Gholam said.
"Under the Taliban, you couldn't even display artwork like this. Not
only would you be injured, but the work would be damaged and
destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Among a collection of his brother's paintings was a watercolor on
ragged paper of the statues of Buddha that once stood in a Bamiyan
cliff side before being dynamited by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The event was also a contrast in cultures. As women knelt on
prayer mats behind the music stage and lowered their foreheads to the
ground, boys tossed around a football and argued over downs and
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Near the music stage, Zia Pohyar, 40, a Kabul native who lives in
San Jose, unfurled an expansive wool blanket on a spot of grass. His
wife, children and mother assembled a collection of pillows, mats,
coolers and canteens.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in the long-tailed shirt and pantsuit known as a
parantomban, the warehouse supervisor said the celebration was the
one time of the year he could surround himself with Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so scattered in California, I rarely see another Afghan
during the day," Pohyar said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I do meet one, my face gets bright. It's one of my homeland
boys."</TE>

<HD>Chavez's Legacy Gives Hope to Young Inmates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beto, a 17-year-old from Torrance charged with murder, hasn't had
much hope the last seven months.</LD>
<LD>   He may have found some Saturday while he and other youths at Los
Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey performed in a play about Cesar E.
Chavez, part of the county's Cesar Chavez week celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "These kids were free today," said Eric Chavez, the eldest
grandson of the legendary farm worker and union leader.</LD>
<TE>   "Seeing my grandfather's legacy continued is very touching. His
life brought many people hope. We are bringing this hope to the kids
of Los Padrinos when they need it most."</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers at the facility learned about Chavez's life from
members of Public Allies Los Angeles, a nonprofit group of 18- to
30-year-olds who take leadership training to work in community
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a good experience," said Ruben, a 17-year-old gang
member charged with assault with a deadly weapon. "It gave me the
chance to learn about Cesar Chavez, because I didn't know much about
him. Plus, it also got me out of my room."</TE>
<TE>   Ruben narrated the play, performed by both inmates and members of
Public Allies. Beto played the role of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not in a hopeless situation," said Ashanta Stoner, a
29-year-old member of Public Allies, about the inmates. "They can
find a way out. Many thought Cesar Chavez was in a hopeless
situation, but he found a way to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   After the performance, three boys and two girls helped plant a
tree in the center of Los Padrinos in memory of Chavez's life and
work.</TE>
<TE>   All of the county's 22 juvenile facilities held a celebration
commemorating the life of Chavez. The county also held its first
community service week in his memory, encouraging employees to
volunteer time helping others. A total of 750 county employees signed
up, said Angie Romero, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Gloria Molina.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Padrinos, Rafael Gonzalez, executive director of Public
Allies, said he hoped the play would "impact their lives in a
positive way, so when they are released from juvenile hall they will
have a better sense of what it means to be a leader."</TE>

<HD>Cash Incentive Keeps Commuters Out of Their Cars</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara: Downtown workers get prizes of $200 to use
alternate transportation, but lasting impact of the program is
uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After paying out dozens of $200 daily cash prizes over the last three
months, Santa Barbara city officials say they have driven a modest
number of downtown commuters out of their cars--and to such
alternatives as walking, cycling and skateboarding to work.</LD>
<LD>   The "Try Something New" program, which began in January and ends
in June, has at least begun to address crowding on streets and lack
of parking in the increasingly congested downtown, city officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Each day, an estimated 30 fewer cars are coming to the area and
many others have become more conscious of their driving habits,
according to Mindy Norris, administrator of the program.</LD>
<TE>   But even some workers who have won the $200 prizes said they
believe some workers will simply revert to their cars once the
promotion is over.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara officials launched the unusual program because of
the growing traffic in the shopping district around State Street and,
in particular, fierce competition for parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Exacerbating the problem is a 75-minute limit on street-side
parking, which means that workers who park on the street have to move
their cars several times throughout the day. The routine has come to
be known by workers in the beach city as the "75-minute shuffle."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about taking small steps in reducing the amount of cars to
downtown Santa Barbara," Norris said. "It has brought the issue to
the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   City officials decided they would ask downtown workers to use
alternative modes of transportation to reach their jobs and record
the shifts in a journal. A work supervisor is required to sign the
logs for verification, before it's turned over to Traffic Solutions,
the agency that administers the program.</TE>
<TE>   For each day they use an alternative mode of transportation,
commuters' names are entered into a drawing for $200.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 110 employers and 717 individual employees have signed
up. The three most popular alternative modes are carpooling, walking
and bike riding, although a few participants reported gliding to work
on in-line skates or riding skateboards.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is open to those who took advantage of alternatives
even before the contest began, not every winner represents a new
reduction in motor vehicle use. But Norris expects that to change.</TE>
<TE>   "People are asking, 'How are you winning that money? What can I do
[to win]?'" she said. "So more people who aren't always using
alternative transportation are signing up."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to traffic reduction, George Gerth, Santa Barbara's
manager of downtown parking, said that the program has been
successful in another vital way--collecting information.</TE>
<TE>   "Understanding employee commuting habits will help us plan transit
and parking services in the future," Gerth said. "We can almost
customize services to be more attractive."</TE>
<TE>   Surveys from the contests have taught the city that many workers
live within eight miles of downtown--helping explain the anemic
interest in the city's vanpool program, Gerth said.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Regalado has been vanpooling to her job at Santa Barbara
Bank &amp; Trust from Lompoc for about two years. "I would love to try to
find a better way of commuting," she said. But many options, like
shuttles, don't fit in with her work schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Regalado has won $200 and plans to continue to
participate in the program, she is skeptical that it will have a
lasting effect.</TE>
<TE>   "People want the freedom of their cars," she said. "This is not
going to make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Walkers Face Dearth of Sidewalks</TE>
<TE>   Sarajane Woolf, another winner of the drawing, said that she and
her husband often walk to work in downtown Santa Barbara. Though her
11/2-mile walk is hardly grueling, there are some challenges, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish there were better sidewalks," Woolf complained. At the end
of De La Guerra Street, the route she uses to get to work, there are
no sidewalks and she must walk alongside "crazy" drivers.</TE>
<TE>   But the city is working to improve that, Gerth said, by spending
$800,000 this year on improvements. "The city understands that
sidewalks are important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Better pathways to work won't be enough to inspire everyone, Woolf
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people don't want to walk that far," she said, "not
once you get past a mile and a half."</TE>

<HD>Opera Sets Stage for Its Life or Death Issue</HD>
<DH>Show: Before 'Dead Man Walking' opens, its Santa Ana-based
company holds a capital punishment debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opera Pacific presaged its next production, "Dead Man Walking," with
a sober symposium on the death penalty Saturday at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre on the UC Irvine campus. About 250 people, mostly Opera
Pacific subscribers, attended the event sponsored by the Santa
Ana-based opera house and the University of California Bren Fellows
Program.</LD>
<LD>   The piece, based on the Pulitzer-nominated book by Sister Helen
Prejean, tells of a death row inmate's journey to redemption before
being executed. The book inspired a 1995 movie starring Susan
Sarandon as Prejean, and Sean Penn as the condemned man whom Prejean
befriends.</LD>
<LD>   Prejean, who wrote about her encounters with death row inmates in
Louisiana, advocates abolishing capital punishment.</LD>
<TE>   The opera version of the book debuted in San Francisco two years
ago to critical acclaim. The local production will open at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on April 16.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the emotional movie and the opera, Saturday's
symposium covered the complex moral and legal issues surrounding
capital punishment. Speeches by proponents and critics of the death
penalty were punctuated by performances by the cast of "Dead Man
Walking."</TE>
<TE>   Guest speaker Judge Alex Kozinski, of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals, presented familiar arguments for the death penalty,
saying it brings a "severe and final punishment" for the most
dangerous criminals. He was countered by Hugo Adam Bedau, a Tufts
University philosophy professor, who argued that less harsh
punishment can protect society. If harsh punishments are stronger
deterrents to crime, Bedau said, "you could argue that adding torture
before putting someone to death might be a stronger deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   For David Linnig of Laguna Beach, hearing experts gave him issues
to consider, he said, but he remains strongly opposed to the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been convinced yet," Linnig, 59, said. "I think most
people coming here will leave today with the same position they came
with and a little more understanding of the other side. In the end,
that's all you can hope for."</TE>

<HD>DWP's Spending Comes Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Utility: Target of an audit, agency says parties, other
expenses are part of being a 'good corporate citizen.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a year of strong sales and profits, the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power is coming under new scrutiny, with the city's top
money manager charging that the utility has made a habit of waste and
profligacy.</LD>
<LD>   City Controller Laura Chick has launched a full-scale audit of the
city agency, repeatedly accusing DWP officials of wasting hundreds of
thousands of dollars on lavish parties, community events and staff
perks.</LD>
<LD>   Making matters worse, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has filed a
$60-million claim against the DWP, alleging that the municipal
utility gouged state customers during the energy crisis as part of a
long pattern of overcharging ratepayers.</LD>
<TE>   DWP officials deny any wrongdoing. They say the state got a good
deal during the energy crisis. As for the parties and other extras?
DWP brass say it's just part of being "a good corporate citizen."</TE>
<TE>   The department has long regarded itself more as a private company
than a publicly owned utility, critics say. And that has proved a
chronic source of tension at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Back when Tom Bradley was mayor, financial watchdogs ordered the
DWP to cut the perks. And though the parties were on hold for a
while, it didn't last long. Ten years ago, Controller Rick Tuttle
bashed the agency for its catering bills and travel expenses. Now,
Chick is taking up the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard DWP officials refer to the utility as a giant
company," Chick said. "It's not a company. And if it was, it is being
run in an unaccountable, unbusinesslike way. They are neither
behaving like a Fortune 500 company that is accountable to
shareholders nor like a public utility that is accountable to
ratepayers. They are carving out their own category. I'm afraid it
looks more like Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the questionable expenditures:</TE>
<TE>   * More than $7 million was paid to a Los Angeles public relations
firm in the last 18 months, even though the department employs its
own PR staff.</TE>
<TE>   * More than $600,000 has been spent on parties, luncheons and
corporate sponsorships in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   * Nearly $85,000 was used last year to purchase silver belt
buckles to give to top-performing department employees.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, the DWP has been on a very different track," said
Stephen Erie, a political science professor who is writing a book on
the DWP. "They really see themselves as separate from city
government.... And having saved L.A. from the energy crisis, the DWP
really does have a sense of entitlement."</TE>
<TE>   But DWP officials say their organization--which raises more than
$3 billion in revenue annually--is largely misunderstood by Chick and
other bureaucrats. The parties may seem like unnecessary expenses,
but they are essential for supporting the community and boosting the
morale of DWP employees, said the utility's general manager, David
Wiggs. Nevertheless, he said he will put guidelines in place
dictating how the department should spend its money.</TE>
<TE>   "In the private industry, you use a certain percentage of your
revenue to support your community in sponsorships and things like
that," Wiggs said. "It's good business, and it's the right thing to
do. It's good for economic development and customer relations."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "There was no one wasting money on lavish parties. This
was all going back to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs also disputed Lockyer's claim that the DWP had taken
advantage of the state during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced that the department did not do anything other than
be a good neighbor to the state," said Wiggs, who did not join the
DWP until after the state's power shortage had eased. "We sold power
for less than the maximum but more than cost." He said the markup was
about 25% to 30%, which he called "very reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very comfortable that the department didn't do anything
wrong," Wiggs said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer recently lodged another complaint against the utility,
alleging that the DWP used unauthorized special fees to deliberately
inflate monthly electric bills paid by state government entities
located in the city. He says the utility knowingly overcharged the
state for more than a decade, thus "taking unjust advantage of
government ratepayers."</TE>
<TE>   Though Lockyer and Chick are waging very public battles with the
utility, their complaints do not seem to resonate with its Los
Angeles customers, who enjoy relatively low rates.</TE>
<TE>   The agency ranked highest in customer satisfaction among power
utilities in the western United States in a survey released last week
by J.D. Power and Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Mid-sized businesses in Los Angeles gave the DWP high marks in
power quality and reliability, customer service, price, value and
company image, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs, who took over as head of the department in May after S.
David Freeman left to work for Gov. Gray Davis on state power issues,
said he believes the survey proves that "public servants can provide
excellent customer service and successfully compete with
private-sector entities."</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the DWP, Wiggs worked both in the private and
public sectors.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he served as president of El Paso Electric Co.
And more recently, he worked as the chief energy advisor to former
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks). At the DWP, Wiggs
earns an annual salary of $284,000, plus a $3,500 monthly housing
allowance.</TE>
<TE>   In casual conversation and in speeches, he often refers to the
department as a "company." Chick believes the DWP should see itself
as what it is: a city agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a good member of the city family," Chick said. "They
don't want to be regulated. They don't want to be accountable. That's
part of what this is about."</TE>
<TE>   Chick has made the DWP the focus of her administration, which
began in July. Although she has picked up support from some taxpayer
advocates, others at City Hall have wondered privately why she is
attacking one of the city's more highly regarded agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Bills Will Be Sent to City Council for Review</TE>
<TE>   She launched her initiative several weeks ago, when she held a
news conference in front of the DWP. Dubbing it the "Department of
Wasteful Practices," Chick announced that she is refusing to pay more
than $601,293 in DWP bills, sending them instead to the City Council
for review.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, she has dispatched two of her auditors to the DWP
building to comb through its records full time.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the expenditures Chick takes issue with include $100,000
for a black-tie dinner celebrating the reopening of City Hall and a
$75,000 sponsorship of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. As part of
that deal, the department receives VIP tickets for USC basketball
games, ice shows and the circus. Those tickets are then given to
clients, DWP officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Chick has also refused to pay a $27,000 bill for a private concert
for large business customers in February.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything they do needs to have bang for its buck," Chick said.
"They need to have guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Chick's concerns about the DWP are nothing new at City
Hall. Throughout the 1990s, her predecessor--Tuttle--expressed
similar reservations. In 1993, he issued one of his strongest DWP
audits, criticizing the department for spending $800,000 on catering
for managers during an employee strike.</TE>
<TE>   "They tended to see themselves of a world somewhat apart from the
rest of the city," Tuttle said.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to rein in the DWP, Chick said, she will appear
before council members' government efficiency meeting next week. The
matter will then go before the council's Budget Committee for review.</TE>
<TE>   One key councilman said Friday that although he agrees that the
DWP should give an accounting of how it spends its discretionary
funds, he supports the use of department funds for special events,
sponsorships and other efforts that benefit the community.</TE>
<TE>   "Laura has brought out some good points, but ultimately the DWP
has to be a good citizen like all the rest of corporate America,"
said Nick Pacheco, who heads the council's Budget Committee.
"Basically, the City Council's always squeezing corporations to
support charities. We shouldn't turn a blind eye to DWP just because
it's our corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "They take in $3 billion worth of people's money. Who wouldn't
expect them to give back to the community?"</TE>

<HD>Plans for Base Link Mayor, Irvine Co.</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former opponents find they're 'kindred spirits'
on El Toro's future. Some question the alliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eight-year fight over El Toro has made for some strange
alliances. Among them: retired Marine Col. Bill Kogerman of Laguna
Hills and longtime peace activist Marion Pack of Fullerton, who
joined to battle Orange County's plans to build an airport at the
closed Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The pro-airport quest also allied George Argyros, a billionaire
Republican from Newport Beach, with Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Santa
Ana), who lobbied in Sacramento for an airport. Now, two former
political foes in Irvine are engaged in their own quiet quest for a
mutually beneficial redevelopment of El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the 4,700-acre base links the fortunes of Larry Agran,
once and current mayor of Irvine, with the Irvine Co., which owns
much of the land in Orange County's core and created the city that
bears its name.</LD>
<TE>   Agran built his political career by attacking the monolithic
influence of the powerful company, and accused its executives of
working to oust him from office in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Agran wants El Toro remade into a great urban park to crown
his nearly three decades of slow-growth advocacy in Orange County.
Company owner Donald Bren has never said publicly whether he believes
that a park would fit with the company's plans to build thousands of
homes and 17 million square feet of commercial space around the
base's borders.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance was sealed six months ago, when Irvine Co. Executive
Vice President Joe Davis and Senior Vice President Dan Young set
precedent by soliciting on company letterhead for a fund-raiser for
Agran and City Council ally Chris Mears. The event, at an Irvine
restaurant, raised $42,000, according to campaign reports filed with
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Recent events merged Agran's and the company's fortunes even more.
A day after voters killed the county's plans for an international
airport at El Toro in favor of zoning for a park and limited
development, the Navy announced that it intends to sell all or part
of the base at auction. A final decision on how the Navy will dispose
of the base will be announced April 23.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's news shocked the city, which had hoped to get the land
free. It also surprised officials at the Irvine Co., which hadn't had
to consider buying the property--or the prospect of another developer
buying the land and building something that might compete with an
adjacent development.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's announcement also effectively shifted control of the
base's future from the county to Irvine. The city wants to annex the
land and isn't bound by the countywide vote--providing attractive
flexibility for potential buyers. A majority of supervisors have said
they favor Irvine taking responsibility for the base if it isn't used
for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. has never shared information about its activities
regarding El Toro and declined to do so last week. Company officials
also have never stated support or opposition to the county's airport
plan or the park plan. The property holds special significance
because it sits in the center of the former Irvine Ranch. The company
gave the land to the U.S. government for the base, which opened in
1943.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman John Christensen downplayed the company's relationship
with Agran and Mears, who were elected two years ago along with a
second Agran ally, Beth Krom. He said Irvine Co. executives Davis and
Young "helped sell tickets" for the Sept. 20 fund-raiser but declined
to comment on their use of company letterhead.</TE>
<TE>   Agran said he views the Irvine Co. as a "kindred spirit" because
of their mutual desire to see the base developed in a way that honors
the March 5 countywide vote and reflects good planning. The city and
the company want the Navy to hold off on any El Toro decision to give
the city time to present a different development plan coordinated
with the county and other South County cities, Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the company's involvement may not be crucial, Agran said.
"The company is not indispensable to the resolution of [El Toro]," he
said. "I'd like to resolve it without the need of the company." But
whether it's possible to get the land from the Navy without buying
it, he said, "I can't say because I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   For some in Irvine, the friendliness between Agran and the Irvine
Co. is worrisome, not only for El Toro but because the city is in the
process of approving two huge company projects that will cap the
city's build-out.</TE>
<TE>   Former Agran aide Stephen Smith said Agran might agree to greater
development for the company as an incentive for cash to help build
the park. Other concessions might be made if the company were to buy
the property from the Navy and be in a position to turn over parkland
to the city for free, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Irvine succeeds in annexing the base, the City Council
majority will control the base's future," said Smith, who parted with
Agran two years ago after questioning his political ethics. "Can we
trust their votes after this [fund-raiser]?"</TE>
<TE>   Agran's predecessor as mayor, Christina Shea, questioned his open
alliance with the company, which she said accounts for about 70% of
the business that comes before the city. Orange County voters deserve
assurances that Agran wouldn't trade more intense development at El
Toro for a park that shrinks his original promise of a large park,
university, museum, sports complex and nature preserve, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People should be asking if there are some trade-offs here," said
Shea, who opposes the Irvine Co.'s remaining projects as being too
dense and creating twice as much traffic as an airport. She no longer
holds a council seat.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns about a conflict of interest are unfounded, Agran
said, because the company shares the city's vision for El Toro. In a
vote of confidence, two Lake Forest councilmen this month urged
county supervisors to let Irvine take over control of the base.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Great Park' is absolutely the best thing that happened to
the slow-growth movement in Orange County," Agran said. "We have
seven square miles that otherwise would have been dominated by an
airport or mixed uses, including an extraordinary concentration of
commercialism and traffic."</TE>
<TE>   That shared vision is a recent phenomenon; Agran's tussles with
the company are legendary. In 1990, he labeled mayoral challenger
Sally Ann Sheridan, who defeated Agran that year, a company "puppet,"
saying residents were "uncomfortable with the monopoly power of the
company, whether economic or political." He accused the company of
pressuring its contractors into making contributions--the same folks
Shea said received Davis and Young's solicitation letter last year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, after his reelection to the Irvine council, Agran took on
the company for what he called "whitewashing" potential airport
hazards to prospective homebuyers. However, in the last two years he
has encouraged company development around the base, including
rezoning areas for new homes as a way of fostering potential airport
foes.</TE>
<TE>   Agran said his relationship with the company changed after
Irvine's historic 1988 open-space agreement. Approved by voters, it
gave development rights to the company in exchange for preserving
large swaths of open space. The company is now exercising those
rights, he said. Its projects include transforming vast strawberry
fields into a massive commercial and industrial park, and building
the Northern Sphere, which the city hopes to annex for 12,350 homes
and nearly 11 million square feet of commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been an evolving relationship with the company," he said.
"I'm comfortable with where we are now."</TE>
<TE>   Some see Agran's dealings with the company as the maturation of a
24-year relationship and an acknowledgment that his desired
legacy--building a great urban park--would suffer without the
involvement of Orange County's largest landowner and deepest pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the 'greater good' argument," said Mark Petracca, an
Agran ally who heads UC Irvine's political science department and
serves as a city planning commissioner. "If the company can be an
ally in achieving a greater good for the city--and that was the
killing of the airport--then so be it."</TE>
<TE>   He said the company in recent years has been less interested in
local and political squabbles--Agran and Mears are Democrats, while
Bren is a major Republican donor--and more interested in ensuring
that development of its properties occurs in an acceptable way.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry has become much more pragmatic in seeing the company less
as a useful whipping boy," Petracca said. "That reflects a matured
understanding of how to get what is obtainable given the company's
right to build. Given the airport, he's seeing the company as a
potentially very valuable ally."</TE>
<TE>   Development concessions are likely to happen on the base, he
added, particularly if the company buys the property. "[But] no one's
going to care as long as there are no planes taking off."</TE>
<TE>   "Having a big park is nice, but there was no question what was
going on" with Measure W, the park zoning initiative passed March 5,
he said. "We were killing the airport."</TE>

<DH>Anniversary: Owners of a Compton flower shop, the couple
will get a surprise wedding today put together by friends and
neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been 60 years since Bill Williams met Myrtle Holmes; 60 years
since the couple were struck by Cupid's arrow on an Easter Sunday, at
a nightclub in L.A.'s Little Harlem.</LD>
<LD>   But they have never recovered.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw her walking by with this friend of mine," Bill said as he
reminisced last week about their first encounter. "I said to my
cousin, 'Man, look at that.'"</LD>
<TE>   "Who were you looking at?" asked Myrtle, sitting next to him on
the couch of their Compton home. "You, of course!" he smiled as he
answered her.</TE>
<TE>   "And I said, 'Young lady, you look very, very nice.'"</TE>
<TE>   Myrtle, who's been Myrtle Williams for the last 59 years, glowed.
"When I start thinking back on those first days," she said,
"everything goes back, and I live it all over again. I think we're a
little bit crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Myrtle Williams define what it means to truly belong to
another person. They finish each other's sentences, crave almost
continual physical contact with each other, share the same
cigarettes, drink the same kind of gin, and sing along to Billie
Holiday, Arthur Prysock and other balladeers.</TE>
<TE>   And they flirt. Constantly.</TE>
<TE>   "They are always courting each other," said Wini Jackson, 59, who
dropped by Friday afternoon to check on the couple. "Sometimes I feel
like I'm an intruder to their world. They've got this thing going on.
I'm just watching it."</TE>
<TE>   She calls him "Daddy"; he, in turn, calls her "honey."</TE>
<TE>   The couple never had children, but they joined the PTA groups of
nearby schools so that they could be part of the extended family of
children who lived near their home on 137th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Both born in 1917 ("I'm August, he's December," said Myrtle), the
Williamses have watched as Los Angeles has changed around them, as
friends have passed away and the children they have mentored have
grown up.</TE>
<TE>   The 84-year-olds still work side by side in the business, Bill
Williams Florist, they started in 1958 and still run out of their
Compton home. Myrtle quit her job in the garment industry to work
with her husband; together, they have prepared floral arrangements
for countless events in the life of their community. Many believe
theirs is one of the oldest African American-owned flower shops in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Although flowers have not made them rich, flowers have made them
happy. Blossoms are a constant in their life, as evidenced by the
car-sized walk-in refrigerator that takes up most of their backyard.
Myrtle said that no one had ever given her a flower before Bill
brought her a corsage made of lavender cattleya orchids. "It was the
most gorgeous thing I had ever seen," she said. Since then, the years
have passed in a steady stream of carnations, gladioli and irises,
Myrtle's favorite flower.</TE>
<TE>   When friends cannot afford a flower for a special occasion, said
Jackson, who grew up in the neighborhood, Bill has been known to give
his wares out at a heavy discount. This generosity of spirit is
crucial to who the Williamses are, and why their friends have always
wanted to do something in return.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said that when she learned the couple's wedding had been a
simple ceremony in the home of the neighborhood preacher, with Myrtle
wearing pants and Bill his work clothes, she knew something had to be
made right.</TE>
<TE>   Friends Pitch In to Plan a Formal Ceremony</TE>
<TE>   She and others started calling on friends and strangers, asking
for help in creating the wedding that the Williamses never had.
Howell's Bakery donated a three-tiered wedding cake; Landmark
Limousines offered a chauffeur-driven car; Robbins Bros. provided
matching wedding rings.</TE>
<TE>   At a reception Saturday in the community room of the Willowbrook
Senior Center, Bill shook hands like a politician and Myrtle blew
kisses to the crowd. She clutched an orchid-and-rose bouquet in her
hands, her first bridal bouquet. Despite having made scores of
bouquets for other brides, Myrtle had never had one of her own. So
Jackson ordered two: one for the reception and a second for a
surprise ceremony today at the Wayfarers Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   What the Williamses don't know is that a ride to church today will
actually be a ride across town for a renewal of their vows.</TE>
<TE>   What's their prescription for having made love last so long?</TE>
<TE>   "Don't think about it," said Myrtle. "Just do it. You don't have
to think about being happy and being contented."</TE>
<TE>   "And there's another thing," added Bill. "If you relax, you'll be
surprised what that does."</TE>
<TE>   They don't argue, said Bill: "There's a certain amount of respect,
and I never forget it. Why should I curse at something I love?"</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the compliments. Myrtle said her husband treats
her like a lady; Bill, in turn, said his wife has taught him how to
be a true gentleman.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced that courtliness as his wife got ready for a
photographer to take her picture.</TE>
<TE>   "She still is a beautiful woman at 84," he whispered.</TE>
<TE>   His wife smiled. "Thank you! I think you're cute too."</TE>

<DH>Wildlife: Pair remove fishing line that can snare birds and
chide feeding-ban violators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem, Charles Fernow says, is stray bits of fishing line. And
wheeling, laughing kids who chase frightened ducks and geese across
sun-drenched grass at Fountain Valley's Mile Square Park. Not to
mention the adults who toss botulism-breeding bread chunks in the
pond, despite signs every few hundred feet telling them not to.</LD>
<LD>   So many dangers. And only two people to cluck their tongues and do
something about it.</LD>
<LD>   But that's the lonely plight of the "Bird Protectors."</LD>
<TE>   Each morning, Fernow, 67, and his friend, Eleanor Elmore, 76, arm
themselves with rakes and a duct-taped video camera and make their
way to this tranquil block of green in hopes of making life a little
less risky for the birds that live here.</TE>
<TE>   While Orange County park crews target wind-scattered food wrappers
and empty cups, Fernow and Elmore focus on subtler dangers that
sometimes, they feel, only they care about.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people we talk to are enthusiastic about what we are
doing, but we don't seem to get any help," Fernow says, adding that
fishing line can ensnare unsuspecting birds. "They get that fishing
line wound around their legs and it tightens and cuts off the
circulation and they can lose legs."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday could be the Bird Protectors' busiest day of the year.
Hundreds of children 15 and younger are expected to join the park's
annual Youth Fishing Derby in hopes of snagging trout and catfish
stocked in the pond.</TE>
<TE>   Fernow sees trouble already.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, they had over 3,000 people here," he says, trepidation
creeping into his voice. "The birds were really stressed."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the problem are anglers who cut snagged fishing line
and leave it near the park's two ponds, each a way station for two
dozen varieties of migratory birds and a small permanent population
of geese and ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning up the fishing line is not a high priority for park
crews, who are charged with maintaining the 640-acre spread. Fernow
and Elmore fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had more people like them, our parks would be in better
shape," said Richard Huffnagle, the park's supervising ranger.
"Through their efforts, they probably have prevented a lot of
waterfowl from being hurt."</TE>
<TE>   It takes a certain perseverance to find translucent fishing line
at the water's edge. Fernow cobbled together tools for the task,
cutting round-edged lawn rakes off in a straight edge and attaching
them to the ends of telescoping net poles used by pool tenders.</TE>
<TE>   Pushing the rakes in front of them, Fernow and Elmore wend their
way around the ponds in opposite directions until they meet at the
far side.</TE>
<TE>   Some days they scrape up yards of fishing line. They also gather
floating sticks and other debris that can snag and break anglers'
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the Bird Protectors is shy about chiding people who let
children chase birds (which sometimes injure themselves scampering
away) or who violate the park's feeding ban (uneaten bread breeds
botulism, which has killed scores of birds).</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone appreciates being told they're breaking the law,
which is why Fernow hauls around a video camera to record infractions
and interactions with park-goers. "I hate to do that, but I feel like
I have to," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Fernow, who retired eight years ago from Orange County Vector
Control, has been fishing for line for more than four years. Elmore,
a former worker in the county accounting department and a one-time
long-distance truck driver, joined in about three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Their acts of compassion have turned into compulsion. They fret
over a missed day. And the pair aborted a planned Montana vacation
last summer because they feared the fishing line would pile up back
at the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope we can get some help," Fernow says. "But I feel
directly responsible. Since I'm the only one that realizes this is
going on here, I don't have any choice. A lot of times I'd rather
stay home."</TE>
<TE>   He began the task out of a vague mix of emotions: a Christian
belief that animals were placed on Earth to be cared for by people,
and consternation over seeing birds entangled--sometimes killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see there was a lot of pain and suffering going on with
the animals," he says. "I've always liked animals, but I wasn't what
you'd call a bird fancier. These could be any animal. The pain and
suffering got to me."</TE>
<TE>   Elmore became involved because Fernow was. The two attend a
Baptist church near the park. When Fernow had heart bypass surgery,
Elmore volunteered to drive him around until he was back to normal.
One of the places he needed ferrying to was the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I went around helping him and got involved," says Elmore, who
developed an affinity for animals growing up on an Illinois farm.</TE>
<TE>   Fernow is divorced, Elmore widowed. But they talk like a
long-married couple, finishing each other's sentences and using
shorthand to refer to shared events. Sometimes, though, communication
breaks down.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks earlier, they found a mixed-breed duck with a broken
foot. They named it Cinnamon and took it to the Wetlands and Wildlife
Care Center in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Fernow can't quite come up with the name for the type of
mixed-breed duck they found. "Eleanor, what do they call that mix?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a duck."</TE>
<TE>   "No, what do they call it?"</TE>
<TE>   A pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinnamon?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, the name they use .... "</TE>
<TE>   A longer pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Peking?"</TE>

<HD>Criminal Charges Urged in Crushing of 2 Pupils</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Police say although deaths at Anaheim school
resulted from an accident, the driver could have prevented it. D.A.
will decide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A criminal investigation into the deaths of two Anaheim elementary
schoolchildren crushed by a car as they waited to be picked up from
class this month has concluded that the driver should face
manslaughter charges, police said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Traffic investigators concluded that Maria Juarez, 50, never
intended to plow her car into the two girls, who died after being
pinned against a wall at Centralia Elementary School, said Anaheim
Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   But detectives also determined that Juarez could have prevented
the March 12 accident, so she should be held criminally responsible
for the girls' deaths, Martinez said. "We believe that it was an
accident, tragic as it was, but that it could have been avoided," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez said investigators ruled out mechanical problems as a
factor in the accident. But he said he could not elaborate on how
detectives decided the crash could have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they plan to present their case to the district
attorney's office this week. Though prosecutors usually give special
weight to police recommendations, it is not unusual for them to
reject the advice.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez was picking up her grandchildren from the school when she
lost control of her car. The vehicle jumped a curb and plowed into a
congested pickup and drop-off zone in front of the school. Nidia
"Liz" Curiel, 6, of Anaheim and Bianca Perez, 7, of Buena Park were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The crash prompted calls to improve traffic safety at the school's
entrance, where parents and neighbors long complained about dangerous
traffic jams at the start and end of each school day.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca's aunt, Martha Herrera, said Saturday that she favored
criminal charges against Juarez. A prosecution, she said, would send
a clear message to other drivers that they should be careful around
children. "That's going to be good for other people to think about
when they're behind the wheel," Herrera said. "She should pay for
what she did. They shouldn't let her out free to do it again. I don't
want anyone to go through what we're going through."</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's father, Armando Curiel, 27, agreed: "All we want is
justice for the little girls. They did not deserve to get what they
got."</TE>
<TE>   Curiel said he has hired a lawyer to conduct his own investigation
into the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Police, Martinez said, were aware that relatives and friends of
the bereaved families wanted Juarez prosecuted. But he said
investigators made their decision by focusing on the merits of the
case. "We don't go with public opinion," he said. "We go with what
the law is."</TE>
<TE>   Juarez, who has not been arrested, could not be reached for
comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Her driving history includes a 1999 speeding ticket and two minor
accidents, according to state records.</TE>

<HD>A Home Away From Home</HD>
<DH>Churches Keep Korean Immigrants in Touch With Traditions,
Each Other</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Korean Presbyterian Church of Ventura County is a faded, slightly
scruffy old mansion at the corner of 6th and F streets near downtown
Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, the building seems to list like a ship taking on water.
Floors tilt abruptly. Bare bulbs swing from aging fixtures. And
narrow corridors lead to hidden alcoves.</LD>
<LD>   But every Sunday the 100-year-old house jolts to life.</LD>
<TE>   Young people huddle in back rooms chatting while children scream
and play outside. Women busy themselves in the kitchen shredding
cabbage and boiling rice. In all the bustle, Korean and English blend
seamlessly.</TE>
<TE>   For this county's small Korean community, the church is more than
a place to worship; it's a second home, an outpost of culture,
tradition and stability in an often alien land. Inside, young people
bow to their elders, Korean is spoken, gossip is exchanged and
couples meet and get married.</TE>
<TE>   "The church is very important here, a lot of people feel isolated
from the mainstream because of cultural barriers," said June Lee, 29,
who has attended the church for more than 20 years. "We want our
daughter to know who she is and to speak her language. We want her to
understand her grandmother and grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   John Myoung, 16, moved to Oxnard four years ago from Bellflower,
which has a much larger Korean population. His family immediately
sought out a Korean church.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I kind of felt left out," he said. "I am slowly getting
to know other ethnic groups, but I feel more comfortable in a Korean
church."</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants Quick to Establish Churches</TE>
<TE>   Wherever Korean immigrants have gone, churches have followed.</TE>
<TE>   There are 3,000 Korean churches nationwide, with about 40% of them
in Southern California, experts say. They range from storefront
parishes to mega-churches--one in Torrance has 5,000 members. Los
Angeles has about 800 Korean churches while Ventura County, with just
3,300 Koreans scattered from Oxnard to Thousand Oaks, has 12.</TE>
<TE>   "Churches have been at the center of [immigrant] Korean society
since Day 1," said UCLA professor Timothy Lee, an expert on Korean
Christianity. "Wherever there are 50 Koreans you will likely find a
church."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Samuel Kim oversees Oxnard's Korean Presbyterian Church,
which was founded in 1978 and is one of the oldest in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Every Sunday, he stands surrounded by bouquets of red flowers,
preaching to a congregation that includes everyone from elderly women
in traditional gowns to young men in shaggy hair and sharp suits.</TE>
<TE>   The sermons are in Korean, the prayers are in Korean, the choir
sings in Korean and when it's all over everyone is invited to feast
on beef soup, seaweed and pickled radish. There isn't coffee or a
doughnut in sight.</TE>
<TE>   After a recent service, Kim sat at a long table plucking kimchi
from a small bowl with his chopsticks.</TE>
<TE>   He quizzed a non-Korean visitor about his religious beliefs,
pressing him to join his flock. He tried to sweeten the deal by
promising earphones and English translations of the service.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, 46, keeps a tireless pace. He holds daily services beginning
at 5:30 a.m. and helps new immigrants adjust to America while trying
to keep a second generation from straying from its roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I am first generation," he said, apologizing for his spotty
English. "My brain is Korean. My kids have American minds. In any
Korean church you have two groups: the American cultural group and
the Korean cultural group. Ninety percent of our church is first
generation. They are more comfortable here because the language is in
Korean."</TE>
<TE>   A Religious People Embrace Christianity</TE>
<TE>   There is no simple explanation for why Christianity took root in
Korea, where Buddhism, Confucianism and indigenous religions have
long flourished. The question was so profound that UCLA started an
entire course of study on the subject of Korean Christianity a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Kim says Koreans are by nature deeply religious people. Like Jews
and Christians, Koreans have seen their share of tragedy and
persecution. And in the same way, Kim said, they can readily relate
to Christian notions of justice, equality and love.</TE>
<TE>   "The Koreans have gone through terrible times in their history,"
he said. "Korea was a Japanese colony for 35 years and then they went
through the Korean War. Catastrophes fell on us."</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who identifies himself as a "third-generation Christian,"
said another reason for his faith's popularity may be the generally
relaxed attitude that Buddhists have toward other faiths.</TE>
<TE>   "A Buddhist would permit his kids to go to a church, no problem,"
he said. "But a Christian believes only Jesus is the way to salvation
so they would never let their children attend a Buddhist temple."</TE>
<TE>   The depth of Korean Christianity is apparent when compared to
Asians worldwide. More than 26% of all Koreans are Christians
compared with less than 2% of other Asians, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The first Korean Christians were baptized in 1784 in China, but it
wasn't until the U.S. and Korea opened diplomatic relations in the
late 1800s that missionaries began arriving in force.</TE>
<TE>   Christianity in the nation strengthened in 1910 when Korea became
a Japanese colony. Koreans were forbidden from speaking their own
language and were forced to adopt Japanese names and Japan's Shinto
religion.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came in 1919 after a mass demonstration against
Japanese rule, led by Protestants, sparked a crackdown in which an
estimated 7,500 Koreans were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Christianity grew in Korea partly as a reaction against Japan,"
said George Totten III, an expert on Korean and East Asian history
and professor emeritus of political science at USC. "As an expression
of their own nationalism there came to be ties between Christianity
and their own freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Christianity continued to spread throughout Korea during World War
II and the Korean war. As the nation modernized and became an
economic powerhouse, Christianity also flourished.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the first sizable contingent of Korean
immigrants arrived in the early 1970s. They founded the Ventura
County Korean Tabernacle Church in 1973, which later became the
Oxnard Korean United Methodist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the mother church in this county," said Rev. John Lee,
pastor of that church and president of the Council of Korean Churches
in Ventura County. "We now have about 150 members. Most are first
generation."</TE>
<TE>   County No Longer Just a Melting Pot</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of Korean Christians are Presbyterians, 15% are
Methodists and the rest are Catholic or other denominations,
professor Lee said. There are 10 Protestant, one nondenominational
and one Korean Catholic church in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Many Koreans in Ventura County own businesses--which often include
liquor stores, dry cleaners and doughnut shops. Many, such as John
Kim, left places with larger Korean populations for the safety and
security of Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much better here," said Kim, 54, who moved from Cerritos to
Ventura. "I can leave my garage door open all night and no one will
take anything. But I have no Korean neighbors. I see Koreans once a
week--at church."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those attending Rev. Kim's church have been coming there
for decades. Their children and grandchildren were baptized and
married there.</TE>
<TE>   They have also watched the world change around them. They've seen
an overwhelmingly white county slowly evolve into one in which
different cultures and ethnicities have quietly staked their claims
to the future.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Park, 67, a longtime church member, says he likes this new
world.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of America being a melting pot is no longer true," he
said. "It is now multicultural. This will make the country stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Lee, 32, was one of only two Korean students when he attended
Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard. Now, he said, there are so many
Asians they have formed their own clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel strongly that we need to know our culture. We need to
respect the older generations," said Lee. "The church is a big part
of that, not just for the religion but for the sense of community."</TE>

<HD>Tender Tributes for Queen Mum</HD>
<DH>Eulogy: British expatriates recall her enduring strength
during WWII and her charming presence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How could they ever forget those pastel dresses, white gloves and
feathered hats? A few had been on the receiving end of her impeccable
manners, that charming smile. The lucky ones will forever treasure
that one moment when they shook her white-gloved hand.</LD>
<LD>   But most of all, these British expatriates half a world away in
Los Angeles reflected Saturday on the enduring strength of their
"Queen Mum," who died in her sleep at age 101.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought she would just go forever," said actress Jean Simmons,
who recalled what she meant to the nation in World War II. "She was
my queen during the war, a queen who talked to the people who had
been bombed.... It's very hard for Americans to understand, but one
feels very deeply about her."</LD>
<TE>   From the Hollywood elite to the common folks at a Santa Monica
pub, her subjects in America honored the queen mother's memory by
lowering their British flags to half-staff, raising a toast and
offering effusive recollections of the one royal whom even the feisty
British press treated with gentleness.</TE>
<TE>   Those who lived in Britain during the Nazi bombings were resolute
in their admiration for the queen, who walked through the ruins of
London's East End in high heels.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember well when we were bombed out in London and the queen
and her family were out speaking to the people," said Josephine
Green, who has lived in Beverly Hills since the 1970s. Her husband,
Guy Green, is a noted British cinematographer. "I thought if the
queen and king are around, the Germans aren't going to get them and
we will all be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Clewer, who was 12 when the war started, said that as soon
as the sirens would air the all-clear sound, Queen Elizabeth and King
George VI would visit bomb shelters to boost morale.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been so easy for them to have left the country,"
said Clewer, 74, who owns the British-themed Continental Shop in
Santa Monica and once worked for England's famed J. Arthur Rank
studios and for about 20 years starred in a British radio comedy
called "Cynics Choice." "The fact that the royal family stayed, that
was a reassurance to us."</TE>
<TE>   Guy Green, 87, who won an Academy Award in 1947 for his work on
the film "Great Expectations," remembers how her royal presence
gripped the set of the British war film "In Which We Serve" the day
she and the king visited.</TE>
<TE>   "Production stopped for the day," he said. "And I stayed behind
the camera all day because everyone wanted to be photographed with
her." The director of that same film, Ronald Neame, 91, remembers
''she had a beautiful smile, and you knew it was a genuine smile.''</TE>
<TE>   British Consul-General Peter Hunt, speaking from his Hancock Park
residence, called her "a singular symbol of the spirit of the
nation.... She's been at the heart of the nation for such a long
period."</TE>
<TE>   At the Tudor House tea and gift shop in Santa Monica, owner
Stephen Dulley wrote "Queen Mother In Loving Memory" beneath a photo
he placed on the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the end of an era," said Dulley, 54, who has been
living in Los Angeles since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, Ye Olde King's Head pub manager John Gordon
lowered the British flag to half-staff. Recalling her gin drinking
and horse race betting, Gordon said she was a royal you could relate
to. "It was no secret that she used to drink a little bit," he said.
"And she loved racehorses."</TE>
<TE>   Angus Macdonald Proctor, 66, a retired engineer from Britain,
believed she was the one who kept the royal family together.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the keystone of the family," he said. "That old lady was
a gem. There will never be another one like her."</TE>
<TE>   Actress Jane Seymour learned firsthand of the queen mother's
disdain for the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, whom she apparently
never forgave for damaging the monarchy. Edward VIII abdicated the
throne to marry Simpson, leading to the crowning of King George VI in
1936.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour portrayed Simpson in a movie several years ago and said
the queen mother was "quite disturbed" about the film and refused to
watch it.</TE>
<TE>   "Various members of the royal family told me she still had
tremendous animosity for 'that woman,' that's what she called her,"
Seymour said.</TE>
<TE>   Others recalled her love for theater and a good laugh. Comedian
Barry Humphries said he will never forget how the queen mother agreed
to allow his outrageous comedic character "Dame Edna" to take her box
seat in the theater as part of a skit.</TE>
<TE>   "She took huge pleasure in participating," Humphries recalled
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But what Humphries and others said they remember most was the
awesome feeling of simply being in her presence.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so charming and made such a deep impression," said
actress Anna Lee, 89, of Beverly Hills, who met the queen mother
while heading a British charitable organization. Since the 1970s they
had exchanged Christmas cards.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Caroline Graham, who was formally presented to Queen
Elizabeth II in the 1960s and is now a contributing editor to
Architectural Digest, wondered what will happen to the monarchy
without the strength of the queen mother's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder about today's Brits and who will bring that
kind of strength again," Graham, of Santa Monica, said. "Who else
will ever be like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Daren Briscoe and Kevin Thomas and former
Times film critic Charles Champlin contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>For 'Uncle Miltie's' Generation, Television Just Isn't What
It Used to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now and then, according to informed sources, residents of Hollywood's
DanMar Retirement Villa argue about what shows to watch on the
big-screen TV in the lounge.</LD>
<LD>   Some insist the television should stay on ABC all the time so
there's no switching necessary when "Wheel of Fortune" and
"Jeopardy!" come on. Others prefer more variety. There does seem to
be a consensus, however, on one thing.</LD>
<LD>   TV ain't what it used to be.</LD>
<TE>   Sid Balkin throws his hands up when I ask if anyone wants to talk
about Milton Berle, TV's first superstar, who moved into another kind
of old folks home last week at the age of 93.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the TV business," says Sid, who is the youngest 90
you'll ever see. "We couldn't get enough TVs into the shop when his
show was on."</TE>
<TE>   Sid is talking about Berle's "Texaco Star Theater," which
premiered in 1948 and created a mad demand for this new invention
called the television.</TE>
<TE>   The salesman from Motorola would come by Sid's New Jersey store
and promise a greenback or two for every set Sid sold, so he pushed
Motorolas and pocketed a nice buck.</TE>
<TE>   When he went home on Tuesday nights, the streets were empty and
houses were aglow, families gathered around the miracle of projected
light.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Wilder followed Milton Berle out of town last week at age
95, giving DanMar residents another marker by which to chart their
own journey.</TE>
<TE>   "'Some Like It Hot,' 'Double Indemnity,' all his movies were
remarkable," Sid says, drifting back on black-and-white memories.
"But look, we all get older. We get older and then we gotta go. We
got appointments."</TE>
<TE>   Sid offers to escort me upstairs, where the trivia class is about
to give way to an exercise class. I grab a copy of a newspaper called
Not Born Yesterday off a table and see a story on a piano teacher who
retired at the age of 100. A Page 1 headline announces: "Lawrence
Welk Alumna Jo Ann Castle Boogie-Woogies at Palm Springs Follies."</TE>
<TE>   The trivia query of the moment concerns the date of D-day. Two men
who might have landed at Normandy are of no help--they're fast
asleep. But a dozen players, seated in a semicircle, are hot to drop
the game in favor of sharing memories of Berle and the appliance that
changed their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Ziegler, who grew up in Inglewood, raises her hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the first one on my block to have a television," she says,
as excited as if it were yesterday. Sandy says they got the TV just
to see Milton Berle.</TE>
<TE>   Same here, says Eva Zipperman, who grew up in a two-bedroom
apartment on Guthrie Avenue in West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the neighborhood came over to watch because they didn't
have televisions yet," Eva says. They brought their own candy with
them sometimes because it was like being at the movies. "It was a
crowded house, and that was fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   Anne Levinson raises her hand and says she has something to share
about Berle. She begins by describing bitter cold winters in upstate
New York, and a mother who toiled her entire life. And then she says
of Berle:</TE>
<TE>   "I felt very sad that he died. Life was hard, but he helped us
through it with his humor, and it drew out the sense of humor in us."</TE>
<TE>   Mathilde Bachrach now leads us on a stroll through the Hollywood
cemetery, rattling off the names on all the fresh headstones: Berle,
Wilder, Jack Lemmon. When she gets to the last one, a woman gasps.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack Lemmon is gone? I loved him!"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yes, he died," Mathilde says. "Last year, or maybe last
month."</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget Dudley Moore, another woman says.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be any replacements for some of these people," Eva
says, and everyone's on board with that notion. "Milton Berle was a
hell of an entertainer as far as I'm concerned. Let's put it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   The question of just what Milton Berle started will of course be
dissected long after all of us are in the ground. Has television made
us smarter or dumber? Has it piqued our imagination or anesthetized
it? Has it brought families together or driven them into silence? Has
it wrought violence or merely reflected it?</TE>
<TE>   But when I ask if anyone in the room has any regrets about how
many days of their lives were spent on television, the answer is
unanimous. Everyone says no.</TE>
<TE>   "It was thrilling," Mathilde says, especially at first. "It was
such a big change in our lives. We became aware of many things we
didn't know about. I watched FDR's funeral on television."</TE>
<TE>   As for Milton Berle, not everyone in the room loved his
vaudevillian, cornball slapstick, but they loved the innocence. It
was clean, honest fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they've got trashy shows that are bad for children and
unentertaining," says Mathilde, who wishes the ABC crowd in the
lounge would quit being so selfish. "Can't we just watch A&amp;E once in
a while?"</TE>
<TE>   "They're giving more money away now on 'Wheel of Fortune,'" Eva
says, explaining the unshakable ABC support.</TE>
<TE>   Mathilde says parents used to write to "Uncle Miltie," complaining
that their children refused to go to sleep when his show was on.
"'Children,' he would say, 'listen to your parents. Go to sleep.'"</TE>
<TE>   Milton, listen to your fans at DanMar Retirement Villa in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, and sleep tight.</TE>

<HD>Parkland Is Home to Planned Community</HD>
<DH>Development: Mini- mansions rise on private holdings at a
federal monument. The project is unlikely to be the last,
environmentalists fear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine peninsular bighorn sheep strolling up to your backyard fence
as you pull into the four-car garage. Or dipping into a custom
swimming pool and then freshening up in marble bathrooms overlooking
thousands of acres of protected wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   Such is life at Mirada, a slice of Beverly Hills in a wildlife
refuge. The designer desert development is inside the gates of the
rugged Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument near
Palm Springs.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, inside the monument.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the equivalent of living on the floor of Yosemite," said
project director Chuck Strother, sitting behind the wheel of the
company's giant four-wheel drive as construction crews around him
carve out more multimillion-dollar plots.</TE>
<TE>   Mirada, developed by MCO Properties of Arizona, is an island of
densely packed mini-mansions in the wildlife sanctuary. It is the
only master-planned community in the country built entirely within
the borders of federal parkland.</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of environmentalists, it is unlikely to be the last.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're going to see this more often as the pressures of
suburbanization surround these lands,'' said David Barna, spokesman
for the National Parks Service. "We're scrambling to buy up as much
of this property as we can."</TE>
<TE>   More than 4.3 million acres of privately held inholdings are
inside national parks and monuments, 200,000 acres of which federal
officials estimate are threatened by development at any given time.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists grudgingly accept the Mirada development, but
only because its approval predates the monument's creation in October
2000. MCO also agreed to provide more than 1,400 acres and millions
of dollars to help save the endangered sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Park watchdogs warn that with the precedent set, other high-end
homebuilders will want to elbow their way inside preserves. Real
estate companies increasingly view parks, monuments and protected
forests from the California desert to Civil War battlefields in
Tennessee as prime places to plant modern subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   They need not wait for preserves to be created around land they
own, as happened at Mirada. Instead, they can snatch up privately
owned parcels surrounded by public land. "People assume the land
inside these parks is protected," said Robin Pritchard, spokesperson
for the National Park Trust in Washington. "These areas are private
and they can be subdivided."</TE>
<TE>   When the federal government creates parks and monuments, it isn't
always able to acquire all the privately owned land within the new
park's boundaries. In some cases, private owners aren't ready to
sell; in others, the funds aren't there.</TE>
<TE>   The government tries to buy these parcels, called inholdings, as
they come on the market. But that's becoming increasingly difficult
because landowners often find that they can make more money selling
to a developer.</TE>
<TE>   The trophy homes at Mirada in Rancho Mirage offer a glimpse at
what some inholdings could look like.</TE>
<TE>   "It's paradise," said Doug Robinson, a security company president
who owns a 4,500-square-foot ranch-style home in Mirada with a view
from every room. Bighorn sheep gathered at the fountain on his
property daily until they were fenced out last year. "We've had 16 of
them here at once," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring Lodge at Mirada Hotel offers room service to the
private homes, so Robinson and his wife can enjoy a catered breakfast
poolside while watching wildlife. "It doesn't get any better," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Project director Strother points out the 4-mile fence that keeps
the sheep out of the development. On the other side are steep, rocky
mountains that are the animals' home. The lots average three-quarters
of an acre and sell for as much as $2.1 million. Forty-six homes and
the hotel are already there. Another 63 plots for single-family
houses are being released into the market, and 128 townhomes and
two-story "hotel villas" are planned.</TE>
<TE>   "For the guy who wants to be close to Mother Earth, this is the
perfect backdrop," Strother said, pulling the truck onto a parcel
with a 360-degree view of the desert landscape, the snowcapped
mountains, and the Palm Springs Airport hundreds of feet below. The
airport view is a prime selling point for residents who like to build
their lounges so they can watch the planes come and go.</TE>
<TE>   "See this house," Strother said, pointing at a space age-looking
number down the road. "They had 22 interior designers work on it."
Another homeowner is building a 23-foot retaining wall, which will
also hold in the swimming pool. Water from the pool will cascade over
the top, creating a waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists tending to the bighorn sheep say they regret that the
development encroached on the animals' habitat and don't want to see
such construction again, but they are pleased at the attention MCO is
paying to its environmental obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,400-plus acres of open space MCO donated amounts to 10 acres
for every acre it developed. The company also set up the Mirada
Habitat Foundation, which is providing $1.5 million to fund
conservation mandates from the federal government. Every homeowner at
Mirada becomes a trustee of the foundation and must contribute
monthly dues toward preservation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs) is on an advisory board to the
foundation and will be at Mirada on Thursday when the organization's
plans are unveiled. .</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is a selling point at Mirada. "It makes buyers feel
fuzzy that they are contributing to the habitat," said marketing
director Chris Gilfillen.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists appreciate the help, but they are hoping Mirada
is the last subdivision of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   That may be wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Inholding controversies are not new. Preservationists have long
battled landowners seeking to log, mine, graze cattle or extract oil
and gas. There are occasional fights over proposals to build a lodge
or country home.</TE>
<TE>   George Nickas, executive director of Wilderness Watch, a
Montana-based nonprofit group that keeps track of inholdings, says
sprawl is rapidly approaching many of the borders of the parks,
making the inholdings attractive to builders who want to subdivide.
"They are like ticking time bombs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 505,000 acres checkered in large parcels among the lava
fields, sand dunes and mesas in and around Mojave National Preserve
were threatened with residential development when landowner Catellus
Corp. began courting real estate companies to purchase the land in
the mid-1990s. To buy it themselves, private donors and the federal
government came up with $56.1 million and a generous tax break for
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, more than 1,000 privately owned parcels remain inside the
preserve, according to Jay Watson, regional director of the
Wilderness Society, a national preservation group. That includes 16
40-acre parcels where residential units have been proposed by a Las
Vegas developer, and a 640-acre site near the volcanic rock
formations of Hole in the Wall, where plans for a golf course have
been submitted.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer those parcels sit there, the more likely people are
going to come forward with proposals to build condos on them," Watson
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the subdivision threat to parkland is most imminent in the
East.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of residents and war buffs around Valley Forge National
Historic Park outside Philadelphia revolted in January after learning
of a plan by Toll Bros. to put 62 single-family houses inside the
park where George Washington spent a grueling winter with his troops.
The company wants to turn 80 acres of the park into a development
called Valley Forge Overlook.</TE>
<TE>   The park service is trying to buy the parcel, valued at $10
million.</TE>
<TE>   Civil War sites are also under siege, with real estate companies
looking at privately held family farms scattered inside such parks as
Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga National Military Park on the
Tennessee-Georgia border.</TE>
<TE>   "We just acquired a 30-acre parcel last year that developers would
have loved to get," said Bobby Davenport of the Trust for Public
Land.</TE>
<TE>   There are 42 privately held parcels within protected areas in and
around Gettysburg, Pa., most of them family farms that developers are
eager to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Development pressure in the area is tremendous, and park officials
fear that prices for the properties could skyrocket on hitting the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Land management officials in California say the situation is less
pressing here because inholdings tend to be remote. But remote
parcels haven't always thwarted building. In Colorado, one developer
flew in construction materials by helicopter in 1992, calling the
federal government's bluff. He ultimately negotiated a deal to trade
the land, worth an estimated $240,000, for a public property near the
ski resort of Telluride, which he then sold for millions.</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Reversed in Parole Dispute</HD>
<DH>Court: A judge says there's no evidence to support the
governor's denial of freedom to a man who has served 17 years for a
drug killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a second slap at Gov. Gray Davis' practice of blocking parole for
convicted murderers, a judge has ordered the release of a Los Angeles
man who has served 17 years for a drug-related killing.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the California Supreme Court agrees to delay the release
while Davis appeals, inmate Mark Smith--who suffers from AIDS, cancer
and heart disease--could be freed as early as Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 46, was ruled suitable for parole by the state Board of
Prison Terms in June 2000. But Davis overturned the decision, calling
Smith a "person with little regard for human life."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Keith L. Schwartz, ruling earlier
this month, said there was no evidence to support the governor's
action. He also said Davis had wrongly labeled Smith as one of the
killers, rather than an accomplice, and had exaggerated his criminal
history.</TE>
<TE>   "This court is keenly aware of the fact that it is being asked to
second-guess the governor of this great state," Schwartz wrote. But
though "reasonable minds can differ" over whether a prisoner is ready
to be paroled, the board clearly made the correct decision on Smith,
the judge concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Davis' parole record praised Schwartz for stepping in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming more and more apparent that when it comes to
homicide, Gov. Davis has a policy of no parole that completely
disregards the law," said Peter Keane, dean of Golden Gate University
Law School. "The courts are not going to look away from this."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Diann Sokoloff, who is handling the Smith case,
said Davis was within his authority in blocking the inmate's parole.
She said Judge Schwartz's decision, if upheld, would undermine the
parole review power granted to governors under Proposition 89, an
initiative passed by voters in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   After taking office, Davis suggested that no murderers would go
free on his watch, no matter the circumstances of their crimes: "If
you take someone else's life, forget it," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, the parole board--composed of Davis
appointees--has recommended the release of 82 murderers, or about 1%
of all cases that have come before it. Davis has approved parole for
just one--a woman who shot her abusive boyfriend and, the governor
concluded, might never have been convicted had the battered-women's
legal defense been available at the time of her trial.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Davis insisted he does not have a
blanket policy against parole, an approach that would violate an
inmate's right to an individualized review.</TE>
<TE>   "We did parole [one]," Davis said, referring to the single release
he sanctioned, that of Rose Ann Parker in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who advocate for inmates said that by blocking the release
of 81 of the 82 killers he has considered, Davis has proved that he
has a no-parole policy when it comes to murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has taken a sentence that provides for the
possibility of parole and just eliminated it in California," said
Donald Specter, an attorney for the nonprofit Prison Law Office.
"It's hard not to conclude that he's a cold-hearted person who
doesn't believe in redemption."</TE>
<TE>   The Smith case is the second in which a court has rebuked Davis
for vetoing an inmate's release. The first involved Robert
Rosenkrantz, convicted of second-degree murder for the 1985 killing
of a Calabasas schoolmate who exposed him as a homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   The governor called Rosenkrantz a "significant risk to society"
and kept him behind bars. But in January, the 2nd District Court of
Appeal said Davis had exceeded his authority to decide paroles, which
it said is not "absolute."</TE>
<TE>   Ruling in Second Case Is Expected</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the state Supreme Court will decide whether to review
Davis' appeal in the Rosenkrantz case. If the court declines,
Rosenkrantz would probably be freed immediately, Specter said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was convicted of second-degree murder in the 1985 killing of
Rick Diamonon, who was shot and then drowned in a creek in Topanga
Canyon, apparently after an argument over cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   At a June 2000 hearing, the parole board found that Smith would
not pose a threat to society if released. Board members praised his
exemplary prison record and noted that the sentencing judge had
written to request his release, indicating that Smith was the least
culpable party in the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing transcript shows that Smith was diagnosed with
terminal AIDS in 1994, has been treated for two types of head and
neck cancers, and suffers from dementia. He had trouble following the
proceedings, and a prison psychologist concluded that "since his
dementia is progressive, it is unrealistic to expect any
improvement." The state classifies him as totally disabled and unable
to work.</TE>
<TE>   In overruling the board's grant of parole, Davis said Smith had a
"significant criminal record" and noted that the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department--which concluded that Smith fired the fatal
shots--opposed parole.</TE>
<TE>   "Smith committed a wanton and violent act against another ... for
something as inconsequential as an unsatisfactory drug deal," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Schwartz said the conclusion that Smith was the shooter
is "completely unsupported by the record."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he said the judge who sentenced Smith had concluded
that the weight of the evidence pointed toward his accomplice as the
gunman.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz also said that contrary to Davis' assertion, Smith's
prior record was minor--including a trespass, attempted burglary and
two misdemeanor petty thefts--and noted that the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office did not oppose parole.</TE>
<TE>   "All the evidence clearly supports ... granting a parole date,"
Schwartz wrote.</TE>
<TE>   If Smith's release is ultimately sanctioned by a higher court, he
plans to return home to live with his parents in suburban Los
Angeles. He has several job offers and hopes to continue painting, a
hobby he developed in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's mother, Dolores Padilla, said she has been praying for her
son's return for years, and hopes he has some life left to live if he
is paroled. In addition to cancer and AIDS, Smith had a heart attack
a few years ago, and was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been ill for quite awhile now, but he's so hopeful," Padilla
said. "Of course, we don't know how long he has."</TE>

<LD>There's a small patio outside my back door. In one corner of it is a
freshly sprouted lily. In another, a rotting lemon.</LD>
<LD>   Kind of sums things up, doesn't it? Life offers a bit of both, eh?</LD>
<LD>   Sure, I could dispose of the lemon, but then there goes the
metaphor.</LD>
<TE>   And we're badly in need of one today, because another baseball
season is upon us.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball probably has spawned more bad metaphors, empty cliches
and sappy sentiments than any subject this side of romance.</TE>
<TE>   And why not? Baseball and romance both can make you jump for joy,
break your heart, test your nerves, order a drink, throw a fit, test
your patience, phone a friend, or ... give someone his or her
unconditional release. Neither game is for sissies.</TE>
<TE>   For today, though, let's concentrate on our national pastime
(baseball, that is).</TE>
<TE>   Tonight at 5, the Angels take on Cleveland at Edison Field in the
first game of the 2002 season. Early reports are that the game may
not be a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, baseball fans in Orange County have been put
through the wringer. The Angels have asked a lot of us, and what have
they given in return?</TE>
<TE>   How about no pennants since joining the American League in 1961?
No playoffs since 1986? Let's hear it for ridiculous parking fees.
What kind of organization would deprive us of Nolan Ryan and subject
us to Ken Hill?</TE>
<TE>   Are you mad? Are you fed up? Can't take any more?</TE>
<TE>   If we were real baseball fans, we'd ...</TE>
<TE>   Fill the stadium tonight and then come back for the rest of the
series Tuesday and Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   You heard me. Let's give these lunkheads a chance. Let's give them
a chance and see how they respond.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you think they don't deserve it; I disagree. Angels
management was very good in the off-season and put together a team we
can rally around, even without a monkey on the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   The front office brought in two new starting pitchers. They've
done that before, but the difference is that these guys might
actually know how to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   One of them came in a trade for Mo Vaughn. How was Angels
management to know when they signed Vaughn three years ago that he
disliked Southern California more than Woody Allen?</TE>
<TE>   The Angels made a few other moves too that suggest they're serious
about making up.</TE>
<TE>   The next move is up to us. We shouldn't point out all of
management's faults and, when they try to correct them, stiff them.</TE>
<TE>   I've got a weird feeling this is the year of second chances
between fans and Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Community and team need to get together, and the sooner the
better.</TE>
<TE>   I have some baseball buddies who think it'll never happen, that
Orange County won't perennially embrace a team the way some other
cities do--even cities that don't win pennants.</TE>
<TE>   Call me a silly old fool, but I'd like to see that change. I'm a
Pittsburgh Pirates fan for life, but since they play in the other
league, I can give the hometown Angels some affection. I've got
plenty of love to spread around. So do you.</TE>
<TE>   This team may well deserve fan support. Yes, the tickets cost too
much and so do the concessions, but since when does a meaningful
relationship come without cost?</TE>
<TE>   With this team, I sense the chance for us to get something back.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered aloud last November, after coming back from Game 7 of
the World Series in Phoenix, whether Angels management wanted to make
the same commitment as Arizona in trying to bring home a winner.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney people aren't spending Arizona dollars, but the Angels
still might have a better team this season than the defending champs.</TE>
<TE>   With baseball, especially in the spring, there's always the chance
of falling in love all over again.</TE>
<TE>   It could happen.</TE>
<TE>   Lily or lemon?</TE>
<TE>   With this Angels team, I see lilies in the field.</TE>

<HD>Morris Polan, 78; Cal State L.A. Librarian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few librarians fit the musty stereotypes of their profession, but
none defied them more than Morris Polan.</LD>
<LD>   The university librarian of Cal State L.A. for more than two
decades, he cherished books, of course, and was an omnivorous reader.</LD>
<LD>   But how many librarians would sit outside in a booth, a la the
Lucy character in the "Peanuts" strip, with a sign that says
"Librarian Is In"? Or could work a room like a pol? Or print up
buttons supporting the late California Chief Justice Rose Bird when
she was battling for confirmation? Or flaunt a bow tie collection as
impressive as Imelda Marcos' cache of shoes?</LD>
<TE>   How many librarians have wanted to retire on Bastille Day, the
holiday commemorating the fall of the French monarchy, because it was
funny?</TE>
<TE>   Morrie Polan, who died of heart failure March 23 in Los Angeles at
age 78, did all that and more.</TE>
<TE>   Once described by a colleague as a "man of mystery" because of his
many sides, Polan was, in addition to being a librarian, a political
junkie, bon vivant, aggressive defender of the English language and
sartorial wonder.</TE>
<TE>   For 23 years, he was university librarian at the sprawling,
monochromatic commuter campus above the San Bernardino Freeway on the
Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   During that time he oversaw the construction of the John F.
Kennedy Memorial Library and tripled the size of its collection. He
later supervised its restoration after the calamitous 1987 Whittier
earthquake, which collapsed a bridge between the library's wings and
unshelved half of its nearly 1 million volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Although he managed to reopen the facility within four months, the
closure seemed an eternity to students whose term papers were due
yesterday. As a stopgap measure, Polan launched the Hemingway
Express, a van that shuttled to other libraries daily, borrowing
copies of books buried in the disorderly mounds left by the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   He named the van not for the obvious reason--books, famous writer,
Hemingway!--but because Polan was fond of the famous scene in the
author's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" in which the besotted lovers feel
the earth move.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, Polan printed plastic bags for borrowers to use on
rainy days. The outside of each bag was decorated with the faces of
memorable characters, from Humpty Dumpty to Albert Einstein. In the
middle was the smiling Morrie Polan.</TE>
<TE>   "He had [an attitude of] let's change the world through
librarianship, through reading, through intellectual life.... He had
an extraordinary joyousness that made him a leader in our
profession," said state Librarian Kevin Starr, who puts Polan in the
same league as the great Lawrence Clark Powell of UCLA's Powell
Library and Althea Hester Warren of the Los Angeles Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly the same breath, Starr seems compelled to note that
Polan also was "the bow tie champion of Southern California," known
for his assortment of neckwear and overall panache.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man who liked to be out and about," Starr added. "He
liked the glamour of the night, the reception, the people, the waving
across the room to someone he knew. He had this festive social
quality. He carried the flag for our profession that way."</TE>
<TE>   The native of East St. Louis, Ill., who earned a bachelor's degree
in political science from UCLA and a master's in library science from
USC, was as likely to be found at a fund-raiser swimming with
political hacks as at a gathering of academics. He was a devoted
Democrat who could work a room with the verve of an officeholder
facing reelection, and he was a friend of two governors named Brown.</TE>
<TE>   He met former Gov. Jerry Brown at Lucy's El Adobe Cafe, a Melrose
Avenue hangout that attracted an unusual array of thinkers, doers and
glitterati.</TE>
<TE>   Polan loved to sit with owners Frank and Lucy Casado and talk
politics and philosophy. He was the short, natty gentleman with the
carefully groomed beard and weakness for Savile Row suits and
Turnbull &amp; Asser shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Dress British and think Yiddish," he often said.</TE>
<TE>   Polan had a stern side too.</TE>
<TE>   Heaven help the public figure who regularly corrupted the phrase
"in regard to" by adding an "s" to the end of "regard." Such
transgressors were bound to meet Morrie Polan, self-appointed
guardian of the English language.</TE>
<TE>   "What is essential to say about Morrie is he had such an
incredibly deep love for the English language and good writing," said
Ann Bradley, the associate director of media relations for the Music
Center, who met Polan when she was an undergraduate at Cal State L.A.
in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Polan once was a guest at an affair attended by many notables. He
saw a jurist who at the time was probably the most famous judge in
America. He introduced himself by handing the judge a card that said
he belonged to a group devoted to obliterating poor spelling and
other illiterate behavior. The judge apparently had repeatedly made
the error that most fired Polan's rockets: He had said "in regards
to" numerous times, on national television.</TE>
<TE>   Polan corrected the judge. According to a mortally embarrassed
bystander and mutual friend, the judge not only took the criticism in
stride but cleaned up his speech. Polan was so pleased, the friend
recalled, that he "sent [the judge] a letter of commendation."</TE>
<TE>   The librarian was also a man known for "acts of selected
kindnesses," said folklorist Norine Dresser, a former Cal State
colleague. She barely knew him when, in casual conversation, she
mentioned the problems she was having on a research project involving
anti-Semitism. She had heard a story about a yearbook for the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis that put the picture of a Jewish cadet on
a page that was perforated so it could be torn out if anyone found it
offensive. But she could not find the proof.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, she received a phone message from Polan saying
he had a book for her. It was a copy of the 1926 edition of The Lucky
Bag, the Annapolis annual. "It was a key artifact," said Dresser, who
was able to prove her thesis. It also launched a 30-year friendship.</TE>
<TE>   When Polan decided to retire, he announced it in characteristic
style: He chose as his farewell date the 200th anniversary of the end
of the French monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "Timing is everything," he wrote in a staff memo, rendered partly
in French, some months before Bastille Day on July 14, 1989. He wound
up leaving early, at the end of 1988. But he did not remain retired
long.</TE>
<TE>   Before stepping down as university librarian he had instigated the
move onto campus of the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Institute of Public
Affairs, a nonprofit public policy group named after the former
governor. In 1992, Polan became the institute's public affairs
coordinator, a position he held until his death.</TE>
<TE>   The job allowed him to freely indulge in policy wonking, to banter
with the press, and generally to "be Morrie, the bon vivant he wanted
to be all these years," said Jaime Regalado, the institute's
director. Polan hit the dinner circuit with glee, broadening his
already vast network of contacts.</TE>
<TE>   His daughters, Ruth and Miriam (who survive him, along with a
grandson), said that if you used Venn diagrams to map their father's
relationships, you would draw some circles that do not touch, others
with tiny overlaps and others with huge common areas. "He loved 'Six
Degrees of Separation,'" Ruth said, referring to the movie whose
title suggests that almost everyone can be connected to everyone else
by way of people they know who know someone else who know someone
else, etc.</TE>
<TE>   What the movie overlooked was that in many social chains, Polan
probably was the first link.</TE>
<TE>   At a function one night, Regalado and Polan listened to a stirring
keynote speech by Norman Mineta, President Bush's transportation
secretary, who was then a senior Democratic congressman from
California. Polan did not know Mineta but was "hellbent on making the
connection."</TE>
<TE>   A short while later Regalado noticed his associate beckoning him
from across the room, while pulling the congressman by the arm.
Discussions ensued, and at the institute's gala dinner a few years
later, the recipient of the Pat Brown Legacy Award was none other
than Mineta.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day we have a great relationship with Norm in the new
administration," said Regalado. "That was classic Morrie: down on the
floor, making it happen."</TE>

<LD>A former U.S. Forest Service firefighter in northern San Diego County
has been sentenced to 30 months in custody after pleading guilty to
setting two fires in Cleveland National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   James R. King, 26, a firefighter for three years, also was ordered
Friday to pay $101,747 in restitution by U.S. District Judge Thomas
Whelan. The amount is the cost of fighting five fires that King is
suspected of setting.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm extremely remorseful," King said. "I was a firefighter. I
blew that because I was stupid."</LD>
<TE>   No structures or vehicles were burned in any of the fires. Other
firefighters became suspicious of King when he claimed to have
spotted the fires well before others could report them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 28-year-old man is on life support after contracting a rare case of
rabies, health officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The virus attacks the nervous system and is ''invariably fatal,''
said Dennis Galvon, a Glenn County health officer. He said one to
three cases are reported each year in the United States. Galvon said
the state Department of Health Services diagnosed the disease Friday.
Results of a second test were expected from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention late today.</LD>
<LD>   The Willows resident arrived March 19 at Enloe Medical Center, the
doctor said. The man was dehydrated and vomiting, began having
seizures and was put on life support.</LD>
<TE>   Galvon said most cases of rabies in humans come from contact with
bats. The incubation period ranges from three weeks to three months.</TE>

<HD>A Cozier Vision of Cityhood</HD>
<DH>Politics: Small-town dreams fuel secession movement in
L.A.'s harbor area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right next to the bakery where they make Wonder Bread, in a quiet
business park on the site of San Pedro's old drive-in movie theater,
a group of church volunteers, retired teachers and union members are
plotting revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Mardesich, an earnest nonstop talker who sometimes garbles
quotes from the Founding Fathers, lays out for the gathering his
vision of a community so small, so intimate that the mayor is your
brother-in-law and your city councilman is the local dentist.</LD>
<LD>   On this cool spring evening, Mardesich has called together the
faithful, hoping to persuade 100 harbor area residents to run for
office in a city that does not yet exist. Never mind that the
proposed city council would have only five seats.</LD>
<TE>   Together, he promises, they will help break San Pedro, Wilmington
and Harbor City away from Los Angeles and make the dense, blue-collar
communities into a classic American town: population, 141,000.</TE>
<TE>   Such dreams are finding unprecedented sympathy throughout Los
Angeles, and fueling secession movements in the harbor area,
Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley that, if successful, could cut
the city's population in half.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month a Los Angeles Times poll found that 46% of the
city's population favored letting the San Fernando Valley form its
own city, and breakaway proposals for all three areas appear to be
making their way toward the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In San Pedro, in the metal and glass building near where Home
Depot displaced the beloved Big C hardware store, Mardesich hopes
that his recruits--who at this point number about 40--will run for
the five-member city council that would be created if the region's
drive to secede is successful.</TE>
<TE>   Mardesich plans to run, as does Emil Erdelez, a respiratory
therapist who grew up here, and so does union electrician and
environmental activist Jesse N. Marquez Jr., who hails from
Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mendez wouldn't run because he recently moved to Torrance. But
his ex-wife, Delia, plans to. She couldn't attend the meeting, so
he's here making sure her name is on the list.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all community people coming up to the table," said
Marquez, who hopes a new city will support redevelopment projects in
Wilmington. "There are no political dynasties controlling this."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are moved by a long list of grievances about life
in the nation's second-largest city: Los Angeles does little to
control blight and graffiti in Wilmington. It is difficult to get the
city's attention for services such as tree trimming and paving roads.
The expansionist Port of Los Angeles is strangling San Pedro and
polluting the air and water. Local officials are unresponsive and
hard to reach.</TE>
<TE>   They are concerns echoed throughout Los Angeles. And here in the
harbor area, as in Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, supporters
of secession believe that local control will provide the means to
solve them.</TE>
<TE>   The recent meeting was the first of several aimed at potential
candidates for the proposed harbor area city council. The idea is
part Jeffersonian democracy and part election strategy. It will take
a majority vote in the harbor area, plus a majority citywide, for the
region to secede from Los Angeles. Voters will decide on a city
council and mayor for the proposed city on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   So if 100 people run for those offices, Mardesich figures, their
friends and neighbors will turn out to vote, so there will be more
people to cast ballots in favor of secession.</TE>
<TE>   And that, he hopes, will make it easier to defeat another San
Pedro resident, Mayor James K. Hahn, and his high-powered
anti-secession crusaders, who say they will raise $5 million to
squash breakaway efforts in the harbor area, Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area joined Los Angeles in 1909, lured by promises of
better services from a big city hungry for the region's port.</TE>
<TE>   But it has always maintained its own identity. Generations of
Italian, Slavic and Latino immigrants settled here, working as
fishermen or at the port. Their descendants remain here, some
becoming affluent and moving to the increasingly expensive hillside
neighborhoods, joined over the years by members of other ethnic
groups and social classes.</TE>
<TE>   The area is unabashedly pro-union, with residents who go back
generations in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union and other collective bargaining groups.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, it is much like the rest of Los Angeles: this is a city
of neighborhoods, after all. Angelenos say they are from Mar Vista,
Studio City or some other urban pocket. Even the mail gets delivered
that way.</TE>
<TE>   People throughout Los Angeles frequently settle near where they
grew up. The rabbi and cantor of the San Fernando Valley's oldest
synagogue, Temple Beth Hillel of Valley Village, were both confirmed
there. The photos in the temple's hallways show Rabbi James Kaufman
there as a preschooler.</TE>
<TE>   This sense of identity is powerful and, in an ironic twist, it
defines Los Angeles as a city and provides much of the fuel behind
the various secession movements.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who argues that small-town government will not solve the
city's problems, said the very fact that Los Angeles is a string of
separate, cohesive communities guarantees the access to local
officials sought by Mardesich and other secession supporters.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro is the best example, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "They already have the mayor and the City Council member as
neighbors," said Hahn, who lives around the corner from Mardesich in
north San Pedro. Hahn's sister, Councilwoman Janice Hahn, lives a few
blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "We shop in the stores and eat in the restaurants," he said. "They
have access to us."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Viewed as a Huge and Distant Bureaucracy</TE>
<TE>   The current mayor may live nearby, but Los Angeles always seemed
like a huge and distant city to Roxanne Lawrence, a San Pedro
resident whose planned bid for the proposed new city council would
mark her first run for office.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is just too big," said Lawrence, a retired teacher who moved
to San Pedro, as she says, "from Los Angeles" when she was 2 years
old. "It's like the federal government," she said of the city's
bureaucracy. "You just can't get a good response from it."</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, several of the candidates already looked like
politicians, with fresh haircuts and dark suits and red ties.</TE>
<TE>   But most in attendance wore their work clothes, and looked as if
they were tired after a long day. In their laps were reports
detailing the latest rulings on harbor area secession by the Local
Agency Formation Commission, which is overseeing the process.</TE>
<TE>   The room itself was pure low-level politics: drab, with folding
chairs and little decoration. Mardesich sat at the front in a
checkered shirt and squarish wire-rimmed glasses next to Andrew
Rafkin, also in shirt sleeves and glasses, who co-chaired the meeting
and helps run the harbor secession effort.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion ranged from union loyalties to pollution by the
massive Port of Los Angeles, which is run by Los Angeles under a
contract with the state Lands Commission.</TE>
<TE>   One woman wanted to know what to tell potential constituents if
they asked whether the new city would keep revenue from the port, the
nation's second busiest. The question has not yet been answered by
the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Mardesich suggested telling voters that the new city would get
money from the port because it is likely to pick up at least some
business tax revenue, if not the whole pot.</TE>
<TE>   Another asked how, in a union town like San Pedro, people felt
about Los Angeles' large municipal unions opposing secession.</TE>
<TE>   This caused some stir, and prompted Mardesich to disparage the
Service Employees International Union, which represents 8,500 city
employees, as a "pink-collar" union, representing secretaries and
clerks rather than industrial workers.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't even talk union," he said. "They don't say 'brother'
and 'sister' like we do down here."</TE>
<TE>   "Ohhhh," several in the audience responded.</TE>
<TE>   Not, somebody said, like the Teamsters or the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, to which Marquez belongs.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilmington electrician and production manager seemed to be
trying out his stump speech.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up poor," he said. "There were seven of us in a
one-bedroom house.... "</TE>
<TE>   "He's campaigning already!" cried Rafkin, who co-chaired the
meeting with Mardesich."</TE>
<TE>   "Ya-a-ay!" the audience yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Hermosillo, a former chief of staff to two harbor area
assemblymen and himself an intended candidate, said the group's
vision of grass-roots democracy for the area is not so far-fetched.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta understand," he said. "We're different down here."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the room, he said, had known each other all their lives.
So had many of the town's business leaders. "My lawyer, my banker and
my doctor are all people I went to high school with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last New Year's Eve, Hermosillo said, he and his wife were driving
home about 10 p.m. when they decided they wanted some old-fashioned
cooking. So they called the owner of Ante's, the venerable
Serb-Croatian place in town, even though they knew he was closing up
for the night.</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon down," the owner told them. "We'll celebrate together."</TE>
<TE>   So the Hermosillos went down to Ante's. Tony, the proprietor (the
original Ante's son) opened up for them, and by the end of the night
the place was packed.</TE>
<TE>   "When Andy [Mardesich] talks about a small town," Hermosillo said,
"it is possible--because we already are that way."</TE>

<HD>Low-Paid Care Workers Focus of Union Drive</HD>
<DH>Labor: SEIU in Ventura County targets those who assist
elderly and infirm clients in homes. They earn just above minimum
wage.</DH>

<LD>Caprice Kelton doesn't consider herself a labor activist.</LD>
<LD>   Even though she's on the front lines of a countywide campaign to
unionize low-paid home-care aides like herself, hers is a labor of
love rather than a working-class crusade.</LD>
<LD>   Kelton provides full-time care to her 63-year-old mother, who
decades ago was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Kelton gets her
mother up in the morning and puts her to bed each night. In between,
she cooks for her, bathes her, dresses her and reads to her to pass
the hours in their cramped Camarillo home.</LD>
<TE>   And she does it all for pennies above minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   So when Ventura County's largest labor union came calling, talking
up the need for better wages and benefits, Kelton was among the first
to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   "I basically made this my career choice," said Kelton, 40, who has
been her mother's paid caretaker for nearly two decades. "That's a
long time with no sick leave, no vacation, no retirement benefits. I
just thought there had to be a better way."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment appears to be picking up steam. There are more than
1,700 home-care aides across the county, people who cook and clean
and provide other day-to-day help to low-income elderly and disabled
clients for wages often insufficient to keep them out of poverty or
off public assistance.</TE>
<TE>   They work from a few hours a day to 40 hours a week, often caring
for family members or friends under a state program launched in 1973
to keep the elderly and infirm living safely and independently in
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say the program saves the state millions of dollars a
year by keeping indigent clients out of more costly care facilities.
But they say it also has created a vast low-wage work force across
the state, one that has become a ready target for unionization
efforts from San Francisco to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Now it is Ventura County's turn.</TE>
<TE>   The Service Employees International Union, which has negotiated
wage increases and health-care benefits for home-care providers in
several California counties, is in the midst of an all-out blitz.</TE>
<TE>   Going door-to-door, organizers have signed up about 200 workers
and hope to bring another 600 into the fold by early summer. An
election could then be held to allow SEIU to start negotiating for
better wages and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The effort could take an important step forward this week, when
the Board of Supervisors considers designating an employer of
record--as required under a 1999 state law--to be responsible for
screening, training and negotiating with home-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   Those workers are now considered independent contractors and have
no official employer with which they can bargain for wages and
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say their goal for the next fiscal year is to bump
home-care workers up to $9.50 an hour--a $2.39 increase from their
current wage--and supply them with medical coverage, either through
the county health-care system or another provider.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulk of [these workers] are struggling to get by," said Barry
Hammitt, chief of the SEIU local in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be pretty heartless not to do more for the people who
care for those in our society who aren't able to fend for
themselves," he said. "Our goal is to expose people to the union and
convince them that there is something better coming for them."</TE>
<TE>   Some days it's an easy sell.</TE>
<TE>   After a long walk down a dusty alley, scarred by graffiti and
guarded by friendly dogs and a frisky lamb, SEIU organizer Danny
Carrillo made his way last week to the modest El Rio home of Rosa
Chairez.</TE>
<TE>   Although she has looked after her 92-year-old mother for many
years, Chairez quit her jobs as a packinghouse worker and celery
harvester only a couple of years ago to join the state assistance
program, which is funded by a mix of federal, state and county
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was my obligation," Chairez said. "I didn't want to
get paid."</TE>
<TE>   In the politest terms possible, Carrillo was determined to make
his point. He told Chairez that it was her mother's desire to live at
home, and that by looking after her at home, Chairez would be saving
the state the money it would cost to pay for public nursing-home
care.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wins," he told her. "And now we want to make sure you
have the money you need to live. Nine dollars and 50 cents an hour
isn't a lot of money either, but it's a beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Chairez was hooked. She signed a card authorizing SEIU to
immediately deduct $10 a month from her paycheck for union dues.
Carrillo handed her a fistful of union leaflets and sped off to his
next appointment.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't always go as well.</TE>
<TE>   Racing against a self-imposed summer deadline, Carrillo and SEIU
organizer Victoria Guajardo are visiting dozens of home-care workers
each week, pitching the benefits of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   They hold regular meetings to bring new recruits up to speed on
the organizing effort. And they are encouraging as many home-care
workers as possible to attend Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting,
where county leaders are set to discuss the issue at 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   They get their share of rejection. But just as often they get
people eager to sign up, especially in poorer households where
home-care work is often a sole source of income and an extra dollar
an hour can mean all the difference in making ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gaining momentum," Carrillo said. "We're headed in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Count Mary Campos among the converted.</TE>
<TE>   The Piru resident quit her bus-driving job a few years ago to care
for her 96-year-old mother. But she had already been part of the
home-care program, joining in 1989 to look after her adult son,
crippled by childhood illness and now, at 32, a quadriplegic.</TE>
<TE>   She's got them both under her roof 24 hours a day, though the
state pays her to care for each of them only 60 hours a month. At the
current rate of $7.11 an hour, she clears less than $800 a month--not
even enough, she said, to enroll in a health-care plan of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't afford it, so I don't do it," said Campos, who at age 60
has a pile of medical bills and plenty of medical needs of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are people who believe we are not worthy of being
paid more," she said. "But they need to do this job for a while to
see how hard it is."</TE>
<TE>   There is little debate about the value of the work that home-care
aides provide.</TE>
<TE>   But in these tough economic times, when both the state and county
governments are staring down the barrel of budget deficits, there are
serious issues to consider when talk turns to pay raises and adding
benefits packages.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the state budget bill crafted for fiscal 2000-01, Gov.
Gray Davis agreed to annual pay hikes of $1 an hour for California's
more than 200,000 home-care providers--up to $11.50 an hour by fiscal
2004-05--as long as certain revenue targets were met.</TE>
<TE>   Under that formula, hourly pay should rise to $9.50 an hour next
fiscal year. But Davis is yet to commit to next year's pay raise,
only including enough money in his preliminary budget to keep pace
with a boost this year in the state minimum wage to $6.75 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the governor earmarks the money for the wage increase,
individual counties also must commit to paying a share of those
costs. Ventura County pays on average 22.4% of the home-care wage,
and for the hourly wage to increase to $9.50 next year, county
leaders would have to agree to pick up that same percentage share.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these issues are expected to be discussed Tuesday, when
supervisors consider a recommendation to establish a public authority
to serve as the official employer for the county's home-care aides.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to taking responsibility for the workers' pay and
benefits, the authority would be responsible for conducting
background checks on home-care aides and creating a registry and
referral service for the program's more than 1,800 clients.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn, the board chairman, said he supports
creation of a public authority and the idea of pay raises and
benefits for the home-care workers--if the money can be found.</TE>
<TE>   "Minimum wage is not enough--they should be lifted economically;
that is a moral imperative," Flynn said. "I know times are tough, but
we need to do everything we can to get them to where they want to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Caprice Kelton knows all about tough times.</TE>
<TE>   Each month, when her paychecks roll in for full-time care of her
mother, she walks a financial tightrope frayed by shifting
priorities. Kelton clears about $1,100 a month for the 283 care hours
allotted her mother by the state. She pays for her own health
insurance, at $280 a month. And she scrapes together her share of the
monthly mortgage payment for the home shared by herself, her daughter
and her mother, Judy Bonham.</TE>
<TE>   She takes no trips, takes no vacations. Haircuts are a luxury. And
while retirement is still years away, she hasn't saved one penny for
what are supposed to be her golden years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy, and I wouldn't recommend it for the faint of
heart," said Kelton, who also has a part-time job as a campus
supervisor at a Camarillo intermediate school. "But you really can't
put a price on it. We're talking about my mother, so you just wake up
in the morning and do whatever is on your plate for that day."</TE>
<TE>   The days are long and often difficult. Multiple sclerosis is a
degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system and can
cause speech defects and loss of muscular coordination. Bonham was
first diagnosed about 30 years ago, and her body has been slowly
shutting down since.</TE>
<TE>   She has lost use of her legs and her left hand, and has little
control over the right. She used to love to paint, but doesn't do it
much now. She still loves to read but can't really hold a book, so
Kelton reads aloud from murder mysteries and other favorites.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonham's mind is still sharp--active enough that when SEIU
came calling a few years ago, she urged her daughter to join. "You
can't get a decent care provider for minimum wage," Bonham said last
week</TE>
<TE>   "People shouldn't think that [care providers] are just some lowly
nobodies."</TE>

<LD>   Not by choice, they say, but by necessity.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to around here," said Ukrainian-born Mike Starikov, 41,
at Crest Loan &amp; Jewelry Co. as he buzzes a customer through the
security gates of his brother's store near the San Fernando Gardens
housing project. "I'd say 90% of the clientele speaks Spanish only."</LD>
<TE>   Down the street, at L.A. Donut Cafe, owners Rathna Chi and his
wife, Ling, sit at a table on a slow business day. He rattles off
some Spanish to prove his linguistic skill.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't speak Spanish, [many customers] don't understand
anything," said Chi, who immigrated to the U.S. from Cambodia in
1981. He nodded toward Ling. "My wife doesn't know much English, but
she knows a lot of Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   The couple and their children not only try to accommodate local
residents by learning their language, but they also appeal to their
appetites by serving Mexican food.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom's been making tamales for years," said Heang Chi, 16,
leaning against a counter filled with maple bars and cinnamon rolls.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the StylesVille Barber Shop, which his African
American family has owned since 1956, Gregory Faucett talked about
communication.</TE>
<TE>   "Spanish is the main thing 'round and it's cool to learn their
language," he said, adding that his Spanish is not very good. "A lot
of people on both ends, blacks included, they don't learn, don't try.
Them and us. But if you want to be a businessman here, you're going
to have to learn at least some of it."</TE>
<TE>   Many praise Faucett for reaching out to the community, among them
Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla, who grew up in
Pacoima, the product of Spanish-speaking parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly makes good business sense in this area," Padilla
said. "I would venture to say that most people are trying to learn
English. But it comes with necessity and the reality that there are
many places in Los Angeles, like Pacoima, where you can live and shop
without any difficulty at all without knowing English."</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 census backs that up. Three census tracts along Van Nuys
Boulevard are at least 90% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   At Crest Loan, Starikov is playing with his 2-month-old
Rottweiler, Sleepy, when customer George Garcia from El Salvador
walks in. Starikov, who grew up in the Black Sea port of Odessa,
speaks to him in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garcia speaks respectable English, he defends the
thousands who come here but don't pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them just don't have the time to learn," said Garcia, who
came to California 22 years ago. "They are just so busy working and
taking care of their wives and kids."</TE>
<TE>   But others are not so understanding. At another pawnshop, a
Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican customer from Sylmar takes a hard line
against the non-English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these people have been here 20 years, don't know 10
English words and still have this big old accent," Yazmin Linares
said. "They just don't try. Why should they? There is no incentive to
learn English. Everything they need in Pacoima is in Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pacoima Pawn Center and Jewelry, Harout Artinian, who grew
up in Armenia, said 99% of his business is with Spanish speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "My Spanish is getting better every day, but not by choice," he
said. "If I demand [they speak] English, they turn around and walk
out. It happens."</TE>
<TE>   Artinian, who rates his Spanish as "decent," praised his customers
as "polite, hard-working and good people."</TE>
<TE>   Just about the only time he speaks English at work is with his
employees. But they often revert to their native Armenian.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a good deal of my life learning English, knowing I would
need it to succeed, but now I don't even get a chance to use it at
work," Artinian said.</TE>

<HD>Home to Man on Cutting Edge of Shaving</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is an estate as remarkable as the architect who built it and the
razor-blade king who commissioned it, and as unusual as the tenants
who would inhabit it thereafter, from a cult priestess to an
Oscar-nominated film director and, now, Soka University.</LD>
<LD>   Tucked into the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu Creek State
Park, at the center of a tranquil 580-acre Calabasas oasis, is a
Mediterranean mansion built by King Camp Gillette, the mustachioed
man who created a razor blade and an empire.</LD>
<LD>   In the summer of 1895, an eccentric 40-year-old traveling
bottle-cap salesman and tinkerer from Fond du Lac, Wis., was on the
lookout for a sure-fire product that would make him a fortune.
Standing in front of the hotel-room mirror with a lathered face and a
dull razor that constantly needed sharpening, he had a revelation: a
razor that used disposable blades.</LD>
<TE>   "I have got it; our fortune is made," he wrote his wife. He was
right.</TE>
<TE>   It was an era when beards and mustaches were a sign of manhood, in
part because beard removal was a hazardous undertaking. As one
Russian proverb--obviously coined by a man--put it: "It is easier to
bear a child once a year than to shave every day."</TE>
<TE>   By 1901, Gillette had perfected his blade and opened a razor
business in Boston with $5,000. But war against whiskers was off to a
slow start. In 1903, the company reported sales of 51 razors and 168
blades. The following year, sales jumped to 91,000 razors and 12.4
million blades, with Gillette's picture on every wrapper. A
revolution was underway in the shaving industry.</TE>
<TE>   World War I was a boon for Gillette; he supplied 3.5 million
razors and 36 million blades to recruits. The Gillette razor became a
standard issue, along with a uniform and gun.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he began changing the shaving habits of the nation
with a blade that did away with the ritual of honing and stropping a
straight razor, Gillette thought competitiveness was evil.</TE>
<TE>   "If people really need to buy goods, it is quite unnecessary to
lure them.... Advertising is part of the game of beating your
neighbor," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   His politics were not unusual at the time; Gaylord Wilshire, for
whom Wilshire Boulevard was named, was among California's silk-hat
socialists.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette dreamed of a utopian society, to be run by Theodore
Roosevelt with a yearly salary of $250,000, in which 60 million
people would live in mammoth, glass-domed apartment complexes with
great central kitchens powered by Niagara Falls.</TE>
<TE>   His political views and visions--summed up in his books, including
"The Human Drift," "World Corporation," "Gillette's Social
Redemption" and "People's Corporation," edited by muckraker Upton
Sinclair--would never equal the success of his invention.</TE>
<TE>   Like a double-edged sword, his idealistic views were in constant
conflict with his business success. He had competitors who adapted
his blade long before Gillette's patent ran out. He spent much of his
time in court battling them. Ultimately, instead of a better world,
he had to settle for a better shave as the money poured in.</TE>
<TE>   Buying $6 Million Worth of Land in 1920s Dollars</TE>
<TE>   After Gillette retired at 58, in 1913, still remaining president
of the company, he and his wife, Atlanta Ella "Lantie" Gaines, and
their son, King Gaines Gillette, moved to Beverly Hills and began
buying up California real estate, a total of $6 million worth in
1920s dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gillette continued to write and split political
hairs over economics and social policies with social reformers such
as Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis. Upton Sinclair and Gillette
once met with auto magnate Henry Ford, unsuccessfully trying to bring
him around to their ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The Gillettes moved from Beverly Hills to Pacific Palisades and,
in 1926, bought a working ranch in Calabasas, near a canyon still
known as Stokes Canyon, for its former owner.</TE>
<TE>   The Gillettes traveled and collected art--jet-setters before the
days of jets--and, in 1928, set off for Europe. They left behind a
commission for Wallace Neff, known as the "architect to the stars,"
to design a ranch house and left the particulars up to him.</TE>
<TE>   On a knoll overlooking a lake he created by damming Stokes Creek,
Neff built a 25-room, two-story Mediterranean-style hacienda of
adoblar brick, obtained from the soil he excavated for the lake.</TE>
<TE>   One year later, the globe-trotting Gillettes returned to a
finished, furnished and fully staffed mansion. Neff even arranged to
have dinner waiting for the weary travelers. The $500,000 house and
stables had arched entrances, fountains, hand-painted tiles, a patio
mural and even a black-tiled bathroom for Gillette's light-sensitive
eyes. When Gillette saw his new home, Neff later recalled, he broke
down and wept.</TE>
<TE>   To ornament this palace, Gillette planted hundreds of varieties of
trees, flowers and shrubs he brought back from his travels. It was
there that he died in 1932, at 77, having lost most of his fortune in
the stock market crash.</TE>
<TE>   His widow did not sell the estate, but depended on the charity of
friends. At last, her lawyer demanded that the still-prosperous
Gillette Co. come to the aid of its founder's widow.</TE>
<TE>   The company said no, then reconsidered and gave her a $200 monthly
pension until her death in 1951. Her son died four years later at his
Newport Beach home.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, piece by piece, mother and son had auctioned off
their valuable art collection, jewels and property. In 1935, their
Tudor-style Pacific Palisades home overlooking the Riviera Country
Club went for $68,000. Their beloved Calabasas estate was sold to
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer director Clarence Brown for less than $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had been an automobile engineer and World War I aviator
before he became a prolific film director. He enhanced the careers of
such stars as Rudolph Valentino, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Norma
Shearer and Elizabeth Taylor in such film vehicles as "The Eagle,"
"Flesh and the Devil" and "The Human Comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Among the ranch's rolling hills and peaceful lake, Brown tore down
the Stokes adobe, raised horses and crops, hosted MGM company picnics
and built a private airstrip for himself and his "fly-in parties."</TE>
<TE>   The site later became the backdrop for such films as "Ah,
Wilderness!" (1935), "Campus Confessions" (1938), "White Cliffs of
Dover" (1944) and, most famously, "National Velvet" (1944).</TE>
<TE>   A Catholic order, the Claretian Fathers, with a faith as firm as
the surrounding oaks, bought the property in 1953, built a seminary
and called it Claretville.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 25, 1970, Father Pat McPolin watched a Malibu wildfire
whip giant fireballs onto the hills surrounding the Claretians'
cattle and ranch, which remained unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we were untouched; God must have put his protecting hand
over us," he said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Ten people died in the fire that blackened more than 435,000 acres
and destroyed more than 400 buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the Claretians moved to the 17-acre Dominguez Ranch Adobe,
and the property was briefly leased to Thomas Aquinas College, a
Catholic school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, the Church Universal and Triumphant, a religious sect
known for its members' daily spiritually therapeutic enemas and
controversial leader, Elizabeth Clare "Guru Ma" Prophet, bought the
property for $5.8 million. She called the place Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't paradise to one follower, who left the fold and sued her
in 1986 for allegedly destroying his personal life and health. She
took the witness stand and claimed that the late Pope John XXIII had
become an "ascended master" in her cult, had transferred the power of
the church to her and named her Vicar of Christ, one of the pope's
titles. She lost the suit.</TE>
<TE>   A New Life as Soka University</TE>
<TE>   That same year, she and more than 100 followers retreated from
Camelot to settle in Montana to build their "New Jerusalem," leaving
behind the Wallace Neff tower, where she said God passed along
messages.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Prophet followers left, Soka University had bought
the property and moved in. The campus is one of four in the
Japan-based university system and is home to 200 students.</TE>
<TE>   The Wallace Neff house still stands, and is used for guests.</TE>
<TE>   In the decade since, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy,
politicians, homeowners and environmentalists have waged a costly
battle with Soka over expanding the university's buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the state Supreme Court denied the university's request
for review of a lower court ruling that stopped expansion of the
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Although the man Gillette is all but forgotten, the name Gillette
is still associated with a clean, close shave.</TE>
<TE>   His exotic plants survive him, and Soka and its Botanical Research
Center and Nursery host nature walks in this kingdom fit for a King.</TE>

<LD>* Gates open: Parking lots at 3 p.m.; stadium turnstiles at 3:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   * Ceremonial first pitch: Brad Burlingame at 5:20 p.m. He is the
brother of Capt. Charles "Chick" Burlingame, who was the pilot of the
American Airlines plane that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11.
Charles Burlingame was a graduate of Anaheim High.</LD>
<LD>   * Military presence: The first-pitch ball will be delivered by the
"Leap Frogs," a group of Navy SEALs, who will parachute into the
stadium.</LD>
<TE>   * National anthem: Lou Rawls, whose 40-some years as a recording
artist include 60-plus albums and three Grammys. No stranger to
ballparks, Rawls opened for the Beatles at Cincinnati's Crosley Field
in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   * Other ceremonies: After player introductions at 4:45 p.m.,
Robbie Britt will perform "God Bless America" while a 300-foot U.S.
flag is unfurled in the outfield. This will be followed by a ceremony
to honor American heroes, including speedskater Derek Parra,
gold-medal winner in the 1,500 meters at Salt Lake City; astronaut
Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, and Wally Schirra,
one of NASA's original seven astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   * Something new: The seventh uniform change in franchise history
features what the Angels are calling a "back-to-basics flair." For
the first time, red will be the dominant uniform color. Even the Big
A in the parking lot has been painted red. Also, no more player
photos on the outfield walls.</TE>
<TE>   * Opening-day memories: Ken McBride and Julio Navarro combined to
pitch a one-hitter for the Angels on opening day in Washington in
1964, beating the Senators, 4-0. ... In 1978, Frank Tanana opened the
season with a 1-0 victory over the visiting Athletics. He was the
first major leaguer to win five games that year, finishing April with
a 5-0 record. An All-Star selection that season, he finished with an
18-12 record.... In 1998, Chuck Finley beat the visiting AL champion
Yankees, 4-1. Finley went on to finish 4-0 that April, but he would
go 7-9 the remainder of the season.... Last year, the Angels opened
in Texas, where Scott Schoeneweis lost to the Rangers, 3-2.... Mike
Witt was the starting pitcher for five consecutive opening days
(1985-89), with his only victory coming in 1987, a 7-1 win over the
Mariners in Anaheim.... The Angels have been rained out of only one
home opener, against in Cleveland in 1965 at Dodger Stadium. The
Indians eventually won, 7-1.... Today's game will mark the 10th
consecutive opener in which Tim Salmon has appeared in the Angels'
starting lineup. The club record is 11 seasons by Brian Downing
(1979-89).</TE>

<KH>BASEBALL SEASON OPENER /  CLEVELAND AT ANGELS TONIGHT, 5,
ESPN2</KH>
<HD>Angels Finally Have Ace Showing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>He was the conscience of the clubhouse and the pitcher to whom the
team entrusted its most critical games. For so many years, and by
definitions of the word that extend beyond the mound, Chuck Finley
was the Angels' ace.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, the torch is officially passed to Jarrod Washburn. After
two years of post-Finley uncertainty, after two years of the
on-the-job training for a young starting rotation, the Angels are
pleased and proud to show off their new ace tonight, before a
national television audience.</LD>
<LD>   In an unexpectedly lavish commitment to winning, over two days in
December, the Angels earmarked $56 million for veteran starters Kevin
Appier and Aaron Sele. Tonight, as the Angels face the Cleveland
Indians, Appier and Sele will watch from the Angel bench--and Finley
from the Cleveland bench--as Washburn throws the first pitch of the
major league season.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't bother me if they want to call me an ace," Washburn
said. "I don't know if you can do that with this staff, because we
have five guys that are worthy. If I'm tabbed as the guy, I'll look
forward to the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The first challenge comes tonight, in his first opening night
assignment. Finley, who started four openers and won a club-record
165 games for the Angels before signing with the Indians as a free
agent, believes Washburn will be up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a real tenacity about him," Finley said. "He has a real
businesslike approach. He's not overly excitable out there. You don't
see him jumping around."</TE>
<TE>   The bigger the game, the more the Angel players wanted Finley to
pitch. "Fin to win," Chili Davis loved to say. Give the horse the
ball and ride him to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Maddon, the only holdover on the coaching staff from Finley's
tenure with the Angels, describes Washburn as something of a Finley
for the new generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Jarrod's got broad shoulders. He's got the personality to do it,"
Maddon said. "I think Washburn can be that kind of figure for our
pitching staff, not only because of his ability but because of what's
inside him."</TE>
<TE>   Finley and Washburn are left-handed, but the comparisons just
begin there. Neither is the crafty lefty of baseball lore, the Jamie
Moyer type who survives on breaking balls thrown at three
speeds--slow, slower and slowest.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, in his prime, seldom needed more than his fastball to get
ahead of hitters and his split-finger to strike them out. Washburn
can thrive on his fastball alone, thanks to its lively movement and
his ability to throw it at various speeds.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a gift," Angel pitcher Scott Schoeneweis said. "Very few
people can throw 120 fastballs a game and win. He's got a real good
idea of how to use his fastball and change speeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are batters that walk back and shake their heads
like, how did that guy get me out? He has such confidence that he
doesn't care. He's not afraid. He's coming with his No. 1 pitch. He
knows it. The hitter knows it. Everybody in the ballpark knows it.
He's still successful. That says a lot for him."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Finley nor Washburn is the dominant sort, the Roger
Clemens or Pedro Martinez type always a threat to throw a two-hit
shutout and strike out 12. But the Angels don't give up if Washburn
gives up four runs in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a lot like Fin that way," closer Troy Percival said. "If he
gets into trouble early, he'll pitch his way out of it, and the next
thing you know it's the seventh inning and he's still out there.
That's a big benefit for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the mentality to go out there and be a No. 1 pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 27, went 7-2 with a 3.74 earned-run average in 2000, a
season interrupted by three stints on the disabled list. He went
11-10 with a 3.77 ERA last season; in the last 10 years, no Angel
pitcher besides Finley and Mark Langston started 30 games and posted
a lower ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an ace last year," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Washburn started 14 consecutive games without a
loss. He won eight consecutive decisions, the longest streak by an
Angel since Finley set the club record of 14 in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Said Finley: "I'm glad to see he's doing well and staying healthy.
He always had pretty good stuff, and he wasn't afraid to work, but it
was a matter of staying healthy. He threw a game against us in
Cleveland last year [a 4-1 victory over tonight's opponent, Bartolo
Colon] where it looked like he had really turned the corner."</TE>
<TE>   That success bred the confidence that allowed Washburn to emerge
as a clubhouse leader. Teams tend to follow position players like
Darin Erstad, who play every day, but teammates respect pitchers who
work hard even on days they do not pitch and never blame a 2-1 loss
on the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, like Finley, does not retreat to the security of the
pitchers' side of the locker room. He works the room--he organized
the Angels' NCAA tournament pools--and he speaks his mind. He earned
the admiration of teammates last year when he said that, after a game
was overwhelmed by rally monkey festivities, "maybe if they worked
this hard promoting the team as they did the monkey, we wouldn't play
in front of 15,000 fans."</TE>
<TE>   Said pitching coach Bud Black: "He's a stand-up guy. He's very
personable. He's genuine. In a lot of ways, he's a position player
who pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "If you equate it to football, there's offensive linemen who like
their quarterback and there's offensive linemen who don't like their
quarterback. Our offensive line loves Washburn."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, the new ace, wouldn't say that he has replaced Finley,
the old ace.</TE>
<TE>   "But, if I become that guy, that would be great," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the kind of guy you want to be compared to. He's a
hard-working man, but he's very easy to talk to. He was a universally
respected man on our team. He was a good teammate and a good guy to
have on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "When I retire, that's what I want guys to say about me: 'He was a
great guy to have on your team.' That's what everybody who played
with Fin says about him."</TE>

<HD>Scioscia: 'We're Ready'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is always the most optimistic time of the year for the Angels.
The season has yet to start.</LD>
<LD>   No one has been injured falling into a dugout. Knees, shoulders
and arms are fine. Bizarre twists of fate haven't struck. Their 25
losses in 31 games to end last season is merely a statistic in the
media guide. There is hope.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes the hard part. The Angels open the season against the
Cleveland Indians tonight at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels concluded their exhibition season with an 8-3 victory
over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday. Gary Johnson broke a 3-3 tie
with a run-scoring double in a five-run sixth inning in front of
12,201.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready to start the season," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons for such eagerness.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn is gone, having been traded to the New York Mets,
although last week he finally provided a leadership-like moment for
the Angels, with an obscenity-heavy tirade that unified the players
in a single cause ... their disdain for Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Scott Spiezio does not have as big a bat as Vaughn.
Nor is he as big a problem. Spiezio had two hits, drove in a run,
scored a run and offended no one Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Vaughn deal was one of a several key moves.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Tavares left as team president. So Troy Percival remained as
team closer.</TE>
<TE>   The starting rotation gained experience beyond Ramon Ortiz's
miraculous three-year aging process after his birth certificate was
examined. Aaron Sele signed as a free agent. Kevin Appier came in the
Vaughn trade. Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn and Scott Schoeneweis are coming
off quality seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn gets the opening-night assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have put those five names into a hat and picked an
opening-night starter that way," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia can feel good about the offense, too, as long as Tim
Salmon and Darin Erstad continue to feel good. They were slowed by
injuries last season, but are sound, at least for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our success is going to be contingent on Salmon and
Erstad bouncing back and having career years," Scioscia said. "We
need them to bounce back and have their normal years."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer was acquired from Toronto, giving the Angels their
first regular designated hitter since Chili Davis in 1996. Troy Glaus
has had consecutive 40 home run seasons. Garret Anderson has hit 63
home runs in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Our lineup is deep enough in bats where we can put pressure on
clubs every inning," Scioscia said. "We have upgraded in some key
areas. I'm optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels made their final roster moves after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Jeff DaVanon, who had a two-run single in the sixth
inning Saturday, won the last spot on the bench. Left-handed pitcher
Mark Lukasiewicz won the last bullpen spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels optioned pitchers Brendan Donnelly, Scot Shields and
Matt Wise, and catcher Jose Molina to triple-A Salt Lake City. Also
sent to Salt Lake City were first baseman Larry Barnes, infielder
Clay Bellinger and catcher Jamie Burke, all nonroster invitees to
spring training.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis threw three solid innings before leaving with a blood
blister on the middle finger of his left hand. Scioscia said he would
still start Friday at Texas.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Bell to Start Season on DL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Bell, the leading candidate to replace injured Matt Williams at
third base for the Arizona Diamondbacks, will start the season on the
15-day disabled list because of a slight tear in his right calf
muscle.</LD>
<LD>   Bell was one of five players put on the 15-day DL Saturday as the
defending World Series champions announced their season-opening
25-man roster.</LD>
<LD>   The others on the injured list are pinch hitter-first baseman Greg
Colbrunn, first baseman Erubiel Durazo and pitchers Todd Stottlemyre
and Greg Swindell.</LD>
<TE>   Williams and pitchers Matt Mantei and Armando Reynoso were put on
the 60-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Bell last played Wednesday, when he came out of the game against
the Chicago Cubs in Mesa because of pain in the calf.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a no-brainer," Manager Bob Brenly said of the decision to
put the 36-year-old Bell on the disabled list. "He needs to let that
thing heal up. He wasn't going to be able to do that playing every
day, playing part-time or pinch-hitting or anything. It's something
that needs to be shut down and treated."</TE>
<TE>   Brenly said he believes Bell will be ready to play at the end of
the 15 days, which are retroactive to Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell will shift from second to third for the season
opener on Monday against San Diego, with Junior Spivey starting at
second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Padre rookie third baseman Sean Burroughs is expected to
miss the season opener at Arizona because of a sprained right thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs was held out of the lineup against the Seattle Mariners
in Saturday's exhibition game. The Mariners won, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Very doubtful," Padre Manager Bruce Bochy said after the game
about Burroughs' status. "It looks like a couple days."</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs was injured when he fell while running the bases Friday
in a game against the Mariners at Portland, Ore. He had to leave the
game. He has hit .407 with one home run and 11 runs batted in in 19
games this spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi left Saturday's game
against Philadelphia because of cramping in his left calf.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi is expected to be ready for Monday's regular-season opener
at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in the lineup," said Manager Joe Torre after the Yankees
defeated the Phillies, 8-5. "It's a matter of DH or first base. He
didn't think it was serious."</TE>
<TE>   Giambi flied out in the first inning as the designated hitter,
then was replaced by Juan Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no big deal," Giambi said. "It feels tight, but no pain."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Athletic outfielder Jermaine Dye, still recovering from a
foul ball off his leg last year, will begin the season on the 15-day
disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Dye broke his left leg with a foul ball Oct. 14 in the fourth game
of the American League division series against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, he's improving every day," Manager Art Howe said. "But
he still hasn't run the bases full out or made a slide. In his mind
he's almost ready, but we think it will take some more time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Dean Palmer, who had season-ending shoulder surgery
last July, will start the season on the 15-day disabled list for the
Detroit Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Paquette will open the season as the Tiger third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Pittsburgh Pirates released outfielder Derek
Bell, who had one year left on a $9.75-million, two-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by phone, Bell said, "I'm sorry it didn't work out with
the Pirates." He also said he wasn't sure if he would stay in
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the Pirates' free-agent disappointments, infielder Pat
Meares, was put on the 15-day disabled list. He will have his damaged
left hand examined next week by a specialist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Satoru Komiyama, a seven-time All-Star in Japan, will
be a 36-year-old rookie for the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Komiyama was 1-1 with a 3.44 earned-run average in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Komiyama, a 12-year veteran in the Japan, will be the fifth
Japanese player to play for the Mets.</TE>

<HD>Chicago Fingers Its Bullpen Acquisition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Cubs' acquisition of pitcher Antonio Alfonseca from the
Florida Marlins "gives the Cubs a historical monopoly," said ABC
radio's Keith Olbermann. "The pitching ace of their last world
champions (1908) was Mordecai 'Three Finger' Brown. Alfonseca has six
fingers."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Alfonseca has six toes on each foot and six fingers on
each hand. His nickname is "Pulpo," Spanish for octopus.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Chicago Sun-Times, former Marlin Manager Jim
Leyland coined a memorable phrase: "Hey, Pulpo, give me six!"</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Final Four two-game record for
rebounds?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Was it worth it? Aileen Voisin of the Sacramento Bee commenting on
Michael Jordan's latest comeback with the Washington Wizards: "[It]
made terrific sense, were Jordan returning to the Lakers, Kings,
Spurs, Blazers or even the Jazz, where his minutes would be limited
and the club's championship prospects enhanced....</TE>
<TE>   "Yet here are the Wizards today. Injured. Outmanned. Unlikely to
reach the playoffs. And here is Jordan today. He has a bum knee and a
bruised marriage. He has a lousy team. He needs this?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Jordan did score 34 points Friday night against
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's up doc? Cincinnati Red pitcher Jose Rijo, when asked about
power-hitting teammate Adam Dunn: "He might be like Bugs Bunny
someday. He might hit a ball and break it in half."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bearing up: After months of research, Memphis' NBA team has a
permanent nickname: Grizzlies. Officials assumed fans would want a
new nickname after the club's relocation from Vancouver, but no other
name came close to the support enjoyed by the Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Did he do it? On the basketball court, 40-year-old John Stockton
is all business. Off it, he can be a joker. Sean Deveney of the
Sporting News said when the Utah Jazz was still flying commercial, an
airport security guard pulled Stockton aside while the team was
boarding a plane and said, "Hey, look, there's Karl Malone."</TE>
<TE>   Replied Stockton: "Think I should get an autograph?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Easy to do: Buffalo Bill quarterback Alex Van Pelt, picking the
Oscar winners for buffalobills.com, said of Will Smith's performance
in "Ali:" "Smith got a lot of credit for putting on 30 pounds. Big
deal, Will, I do that every off-season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1975, UCLA defeated Kentucky, 92-85,
at San Diego for the men's NCAA championship. Retiring John Wooden
coached his final game, leaving with a record 10 NCAA titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bill Russell of the University of San Francisco,
50, in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Reuters reports that an Australian firm has unveiled
an electronic shark repellent that attaches to a swimmer's ankle and
emits an electronic field to ward off sharks. The anti-shark unit
weighs one pound and has a battery life of two hours.</TE>
<TE>   The electric field affects the shark's nervous system through
sensitive receptors near its snout. An initial mild discomfort
increases as the shark approaches until it causes intolerable muscle
spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Does the shark sneeze?</TE>

<LD>Well, that was fun while it lasted. The Clippers' season came to a
figurative end, although not a literal one, with a 105-92 loss
Saturday to the Utah Jazz before a sellout crowd of 19,513 at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Mathematically, the Clippers are still alive in their quest for a
Western Conference playoff berth. There are eight games left on their
schedule, including a rematch Wednesday with the Jazz at the Delta
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Realistically, though, they're history after Saturday's loss left
them 41/2 games behind the Jazz in the battle for the eighth and
final spot.</LD>
<TE>   Predictably, no one waved a white towel in surrender in the
Clipper camp at game's end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mostly mental at this point," point guard Jeff McInnis said.
"We've got to get it out of our minds. The season is not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   Said power forward Elton Brand: "We have to be prepared for
Wednesday. We're not giving up."</TE>
<TE>   Added Coach Alvin Gentry: "Until we're mathematically eliminated,
we're going to play as if we have a chance to make the playoffs
because we do."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers faced an 80-71 deficit by the end of the third
quarter. It could have been worse, but the way things had been going
to that point, it was far from a workable deficit going into the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made one strong run at the Jazz, drawing within 89-84
when Earl Boykins made two free throws after John Stockton picked up
his fifth foul with 5:26 remaining. Stockton stayed in the game and
the Jazz maintained the lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it wasn't so much that the Clippers failed. Utah
simply excelled, particularly when it came to putting the ball in the
basket. The Jazz made 41 of 75 shots (54.7%) and 20 of 21 free throws
(95.2%).</TE>
<TE>   When the need arose late, Stockton scored on a backdoor cut to the
hoop, fed Greg Ostertag for a layup and hit a perimeter jump shot to
hold off the Clippers. Stockton would score 16 points, one of six
Utah players to have 10 or more points.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi led the Clippers with 28 points and Brand had
17 points and 11 rebounds for his 52nd double-double this season, two
shy of Swen Nater's franchise record set in 1980-81.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a tough team to play against," Gentry said after the
Clippers' 13th consecutive loss to the Jazz. "They don't make very
many mistakes. They're very efficient at what they do. They've been
like that for 10 or 12 years. Stockton made plays down the stretch.
Every time we got close, he made a big play.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can learn anything from tonight, it's that if you execute,
if you do your job ... I mean, they're an efficient team, very
efficient."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers faced a halftime deficit for the second consecutive
night. Friday, they erased a 43-32 halftime deficit (after trailing
by 18 in the second quarter) and defeated the Phoenix Suns, 96-94, on
McInnis' buzzer-beating jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   Utah did what it always does when Stockton and Karl Malone are at
their best, moving the ball around the court with remarkable speed
and creating open shots.</TE>
<TE>   After all these years, nobody has been able to stop them for any
length of time. They bamboozled the Clippers repeatedly with the pick
and roll, helping the Jazz build a 53-45 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Stockton and Malone have played 1,000 games together," Gentry
said. "They probably know each other better than their wives. They
are great players. They're guys who will be in the Hall of Fame."</TE>
<TE>   Utah played with poise and precision, slowing the tempo and
keeping the Clippers from getting the crowd revved up with the sort
of highlight-reel plays the fans have grown accustomed to seeing at
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles did provide one such moment, catching a lob pass from
McInnis and, with his back to the basket, slamming it through the
hoop to give the Clippers a 35-30 lead early in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper lead was short-lived, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz outscored the Clippers, 23-10, the rest of the quarter.
As part of that surge, the Jazz had runs of 7-0 and 9-0. The Clippers
were blanked in the final 2:28.</TE>
<TE>   "With eight games to go we're in a tough situation," Gentry said.
"We have to fly to Utah and find a way to win the game. It doesn't
matter what happens, though. We're not going to write off our
season."</TE>

<HD>Odom Is Done for Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said some weeks ago that small forward
Lamar Odom probably would not play again this season because of a
sprained right wrist and ankle. He said it again Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Lamar is not going to play again, guys," Gentry told reporters
before the Clippers played the Utah Jazz at Staples Center.
"Regardless of what he says ... I mean, he's still walking with
crutches. He'd have to be playing tonight to be able to finish out
the regular season. It doesn't make sense. He could do more damage to
his wrist."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers plan to schedule surgery for Odom's wrist, which was
injured when he fell in a Dec. 16 game against the Detroit Pistons.</LD>
<TE>   Odom played several games after the injury, but has been on the
injured list since Jan. 24. He sprained his ankle when he stepped on
a loose ball while attempting a dunk during a team workout after the
All-Star break in mid-February.</TE>
<TE>   Odom has played only 29 games this season because of the injuries
and an eight-game drug suspension handed down by the NBA at the start
of the season. He averaged 13.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "We can look at it two ways," Gentry said. "One, he was lost for
the year. Two, it's like adding a guy, like a top guy in the draft,
to our team next season. We have not had Lamar, really, for the whole
season. At most, he played 10 to 15 games for us when he was
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry added that he was looking forward to seeing a healthy Odom
playing next season alongside vastly improved center Michael
Olowokandi and maturing power forward Elton Brand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry sounded defiant during his pregame session with reporters.
Asked if he was ready to make a concession speech with his team
trailing the Jazz by 31/2 games for the eighth and final playoff spot
in the Western Conference, he said he would not.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, we've got to find a way to make the playoffs," he said.
"Obviously, we have zero margin for error. It's to the point where
any combination of seven of their wins and our losses and we're
done."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers needed to defeat the Jazz on Saturday and again
Wednesday at Salt Lake City to improve their chances of advancing to
the postseason for the first time since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   "These games count as two," Gentry said. "I think we probably have
to win them both. Mathematically, we would still be alive, but we
would only have seven games left."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers won't practice today, but will have workouts Monday
and Tuesday to get ready for Wednesday's rematch in Utah. They play
the Mavericks at Dallas the next night.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough [healthy] guys to practice," Gentry said.
"We've just got to try to gut it out for the rest of the season."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>It's Goodbye Goodwin, Trombley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger careers of outfielder Tom Goodwin and relief pitcher Mike
Trombley came to an end Saturday as the club designated both veterans
for assignment--moves that could force the club to eat as much as $6
million in guaranteed contracts. The Dodgers announced the moves
after a 6-2 exhibition victory over the Cleveland Indians that was
played before an announced crowd of 18,112 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers also optioned pitcher Guillermo Mota to triple-A Las
Vegas as they prepared to submit their 25-man roster to major league
baseball by Saturday's 9 p.m. deadline. General Manager Dan Evans,
however, said the roster will be altered before the Dodgers play the
San Francisco Giants in the season opener Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "We're following the rules to a T, but once we submit that note we
can amend it any time," Evans said. "It doesn't mean it's our 25 two
days from now."</LD>
<TE>   Goodwin is owed $3.75 million. His contract calls for him to make
$3.25 million this season with a $500,000 buyout of next season's
$3.5-million option. Trombley is owed $2.25 million. He will earn $2
million for this season and it will cost $250,000 to buy out his
$3-million option for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin was selected by the Dodgers in the first round of the 1989
draft and was reacquired in a trade with Colorado on July 31, 2000.
He batted .231 with four homers and 22 RBIs in 105 games last season,
but had 58 strikeouts and drew only 23 walks in 286 at-bats. Goodwin
was eight for 37 (.216) with eight strikeouts, three walks and two
stolen bases this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Trombley was acquired in a trade with the Baltimore Orioles last
July 31. He was 0-4 with a 6.56 earned-run average in 231/3 innings
for the Dodgers last season. He gave up four earned runs and 13 hits
in 11 innings this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Evans is hoping to work out trades for Goodwin and Trombley, but
that scenario is unlikely because other teams can sign the players
without picking up their contracts or giving up prospects if the
Dodgers are forced to release them in 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin strongly intimated that he would refuse a minor league
assignment if he was put on waivers and went unclaimed by other
teams. Trombley said he wouldn't accept a minor league assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be released and go where I want to go," Trombley said.
"I think at this point it would be hard for somebody to trade for me.
Why buy it when you can get it for free in a couple days?"</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy named Dave Roberts the
starting center fielder and Marquis Grissom the primary back-up,
making Goodwin expendable.</TE>
<TE>   "What's done is done," Goodwin said. "They know how I feel. I told
them and they are the only ones that needed to know. We're just going
to move on from there."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder McKay Christensen, 26, is not sure where he will end
up. He is on the Dodger roster for now, but he described himself as
"insurance" that the club will use for the next few days as it
explores trades and delays putting him on waivers. In the unlikely
event Christensen went unclaimed, he could be sent to triple-A.</TE>
<TE>   As non-roster players, reliever Jesse Orosco and utility man Mike
Kinkade were not immediately affected by Saturday's moves. But they
and others could be before Tuesday's opener.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have as much flexibility and maneuverability as some
other organizations have so we have to create it," Evans said. "In a
way, we've created some additional time here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby was impressive in his final exhibition start, giving up
one run and five hits in six innings. He walked one and struck out
three. Ashby, who is coming off surgery on his right elbow,
surrendered a third-inning solo home run to Brady Anderson. He will
start Friday against the Colorado Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii, who has appeared jittery on
the mound this spring, will start today against Seattle Mariners at
Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want him to go out and compete," Tracy said. "Our intent
is to give him an opportunity to see what the environment is like in
a major league stadium. The added bonus is the place is going to be
full."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii said he has faced Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki five
times during their careers in Japan. Ishii said he has given up one
hit and twice walked the 2001 American League MVP.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Could Write Book on Fun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Bob Knight and Indiana--funny how they ended up in the same area code
again-- arrived at this year's Final Four on different missions.
Knight is here to sell his book, while Indiana is quickly moving on
to the next chapter.</LD>
<LD>   The gap between Knight and the program he once coached edged a bit
more Cumberland on Saturday night when Indiana upset Oklahoma in the
first national semifinal game with a thoroughly storybook and joyful
display of basketball.</LD>
<LD>   These have not always been terms attached with Indiana basketball.</LD>
<TE>   Knight's best teams always had passion, but his Hoosiers played
less for fun than for fear of reprisal.</TE>
<TE>   What has transpired during Indiana's magical five-game run to
Monday's national title game against Maryland has been a basketball
glasnost. The new Hoosiers come with openness--and an open locker
room!</TE>
<TE>   They are glib and revealing. You could almost hug them.</TE>
<TE>   At what point during the Knight reign would the following scene
have been imaginable: (Here's a clue: The answer is "never.")</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, knowing victory was near, Indiana Coach Mike Davis
buried his head in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Hoosier guard Dane Fife, who had done a masterful defensive job on
Oklahoma guard Hollis Price, went over to comfort his coach.</TE>
<TE>   Fife put his hands on Davis' head.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was crying," Fife said. "I said, 'Get your head up,
we're in the national championship game!' Then I said, 'Man, you put
too much lotion on your hair.'"</TE>
<TE>   With Indiana tethered to Knight, there were always battle lines.
Knight made you admire his teams, whether you liked him, or them, or
not. Along the way to three national titles, there were few laughs
and almost no middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   These Hoosiers are a hoot. With all the underdog talk going
around, you'd think it was Valparaiso making this run, not one of
basketball's most storied programs.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the story of Knight-less Indiana is quickly tumbling toward
myth.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game featured a career performance from a reserve, Jeff
Newton, who scored 19 points. It featured a clutch performance from a
freshman guard, Donald Perry, who scored 10 points in 11 minutes and
knocked down important free throws in the end.</TE>
<TE>   It included a straitjacket job from Fife, a player accused of
sharpening his elbows before games, who held the Sooners' Price to a
one-for-11 shooting night.</TE>
<TE>   And, inspirationally, it featured a courageous performance from
guard Tom Coverdale, who joins the annals of players who have crawled
off a trainer's table into the starting lineup</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so much what Coverdale did Saturday as it was the fact
he did it at all.</TE>
<TE>   If Indiana wins the national title, expect a song written about
Coverdale to the tune of "Davy Crockett," ending with the verse,
"king of the Hoosier Frontier."</TE>
<TE>   In last week's regional final victory, Coverdale badly wrenched
his left ankle against Kent State. He writhed on the floor and
watched postgame ceremonies from a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come a long way in a week," Coverdale said. "Right after the
game, even the doctors said there was no way I could play."</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale played 29 minutes Saturday. He limped up and down the
court like a 45-year-old rec-league player. His ankle was taped and
braced.</TE>
<TE>   You know what? Coverdale didn't play all that well. He finished
with more turnovers, five, than points, three, but that wasn't the
point, right?</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the point when Willis Reed limped out to defeat the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to have Cov on the floor," Hoosier forward Kyle Hornsby
said. "He's our on-the-floor leader. You could see he was in obvious
pain."</TE>
<TE>   News of Coverdale's condition was front-page news last week in the
Bloomington papers.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale said Davis informed him he would start after Friday's
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was going to play this week, no matter how bad it was,"
Coverdale said</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale is a bit young to rank his performance with others on
the inspirational front burner.</TE>
<TE>   He does not recall in real time the night in 1988 the Dodgers'
Kirk Gibson hobbled to the plate and arm-poked a limp-off,
game-winning homer in the World Series against Oakland. More than the
act itself--it was Gibson's only at-bat of the series--the moment
invigorated the underdog Dodgers and inspired an upset series win.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen that replay a lot," Coverdale said of Gibson's homer.
"But this doesn't compare to that unless we win a championship."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Coverdale wishes he could have done more.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, as he sat near his locker, his left foot submerged
in an ice bucket, Coverdale almost savagely criticized his own game.</TE>
<TE>   "The leadership was good, except for me," Coverdale said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought my timing was off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I wore down in the end," he said. "I made turnover after
turnover in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale even said Davis made the right decision in benching him
in the closing minutes in favor of the freshman Perry.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I was being stupid out there," Coverdale said. "Without
Donald Perry, we would not have won tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale wanted to go back in the game in the end but had the
sense to realize, "They didn't need to put me back in."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Coverdale would not have missed the game for anything.
He will now do anything to get back on the floor Monday. He said his
ankle got worse the more he played, to the point it hurt every time
he cut.</TE>
<TE>   But how do you limp away from this moment? To etch your name into
Hoosier basketball lore? To be part of the team with a chance to win
a national title two years after Knight was fired and the program
supposedly was left a shambles?</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing in sports is when you prove people wrong,"
Coverdale said. "And show people you can do it."</TE>
<TE>   In this tournament, Indiana has replaced Missouri as the show-me
state.</TE>
<TE>   As Knight peddles his wares, the Hoosiers peddle on.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people always say, 'I'm ready to play the next game right
now,'" Coverdale said. "I'm not. I need the whole day and a half to
get ready."</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, he'll be ready.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Markus Naslund had a goal and an assist as the Vancouver Canucks beat
the Mighty Ducks, 4-1, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Henrik Sedin, Andrew Cassels and Trevor Letowski also scored for
the Canucks, who won for the eighth time in the last 10 games.</LD>
<LD>   Jason York scored the only Anaheim goal during a five-on-three
power play.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver outshot the Ducks, 17-4, in the first period, using four
consecutive power plays. But the Canucks failed to score on the man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Sedin, who opened the scoring at 15:16 of the first period,
extended his goal scoring streak to three games. After Duck goalie
Steve Shields stopped a shot from close range by Todd Warriner, the
puck appeared to get caught in the goalie's equipment. Most of the
players skated away after a lengthy delay, but the whistle never blew
and Sedin poked the puck past Shields after he shook it free of his
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   After Sedin's goal, Naslund made it 2-0 only 1:37 later with the
teams playing four on four. After two Duck defenders collided trying
to catch a high puck, Naslund collected it and snapped a long wrist
shot past Shields for his 33rd goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   York made it 2-1 with a one-timer from the point midway through
the second.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks played without defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who missed
his third consecutive game because of a groin injury.</TE>

<LD>NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP GAME</LD>
<LD>   Indiana vs. Maryland</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   STORY LINE</TE>
<TE>   It's a classic David vs. Goliath tale, and No. 5-seeded Indiana
has already proven accurate with its trusty slingshot, knocking off a
No. 1 (Duke) and a No. 2 (Oklahoma). However, the Hoosiers have the
tradition: Maryland is seeking its first NCAA title while Indiana is
after its sixth. And the Terrapins are winless in four games against
the Hoosiers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW THEY ADVANCED</TE>
<TE>   Indiana upset Duke in the South Regional, propelling the Hoosiers
to victories over upstart Kent State and West Regional champion
Oklahoma. Maryland's toughest test before beating Kansas in a
semifinal came against No. 2-seeded Connecticut in the East Regional
final.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COMMON OPPONENTS</TE>
<TE>   Maryland lost to Oklahoma by 16 points in December and to Duke by
21 in January. The Terrapins also beat Duke convincingly in February
and defeated Illinois in November. Indiana split with Illinois in Big
Ten Conference play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STYLE OF PLAY</TE>
<TE>   Indiana will slow the pace, run the ball through All-American
forward Jared Jeffries, then kick it out for three-point shots.
Maryland will try to use its superior athleticism in transition and
will work the ball inside to center Lonny Baxter and forwards Byron
Mouton and Chris Wilcox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   X FACTORS</TE>
<TE>   Indiana guard Dane Fife shut down Oklahoma's Hollis Price. Can he
do the same to Terrapin guard Juan Dixon, who scored 33 points
against Kansas? The effectiveness of Hoosier point guard Tom
Coverdale will be difficult to predict. He played 29 minutes on his
sprained ankle against Oklahoma and will stay off it until game time.
This will be game No. 2002 in Maryland history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHAT TO EXPECT</TE>
<TE>   Maryland will be a big favorite, and deservedly so. The starting
five of Baxter, Wilcox, Mouton, Dixon and point guard Steve Blake
(who had 11 assists against Kansas) is battle-tested and supremely
talented. But Indiana appears to be a team of destiny and could pull
out a victory by staying close and making plays in the last few
minutes.</TE>

<HD>It's a Day of Rest for the Hoosiers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What can Indiana players expect to do at today's practice?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Nothing. Indiana has a policy of not practicing on Sunday.
Especially on Easter Sunday. Coach Mike Davis, a religious man, says
he will stay with his plan.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to stick with our same routine that we've been doing
since I've been here," Davis said. "The guys have a day to rest. It's
Easter, they can go to church if they want to."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey, what's this, an athlete who has put a victory in its proper
context?</TE>
<TE>   Indiana sophomore guard A.J. Moye was asked if the Hoosiers have
"shocked the world," with their tournament performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that we shocked the world," Moye said. "We may have
shocked some sports analysts, but I don't think that we shocked the
world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No way Indiana beats Oklahoma with two of its top scorers, Tom
Coverdale and Jared Jeffries, combing for only 11 points, right?</TE>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale finished with only three points and Jeffries had eight.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone told me that was what those guys would score, I would
have thought our chances were pretty slim," forward Kyle Hornsby
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows the depth of this team. I thought Coverdale was
about 75% to 80% tonight and he was missing a lot of his
explosiveness."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma senior Daryan Selvy  said Indiana reminded him of Big 12
Conference-rival Texas Tech, which shouldn't be surprising with
former Hoosier coach Bob Knight coaching the Red Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana goes harder than Texas Tech," Selvy said, "and has better
players too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana had to feel good about its chances when Jeffries  banked
in a three-point shot from the top of the key at the start of the
second half. Before the game, the Hoosiers were 16-1 this season and
22-4 over the last two seasons when the sophomore forward made a
three-pointer.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>After a disappointing Final Four, Kansas forward Drew Gooden might
think longer about whether to declare for the NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be a tough decision," the junior All-American said. "No
one wants their college career to end like this. I will have to look
at it and deal with it and make a decision later."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Point guard Aaron Miles--one of three freshmen who played a key
role for Kansas--recorded a double-double with 12 rebounds and 10
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck of a game for a freshman," Coach Roy Williams said. "I
am--needless to say--going to enjoy coaching him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This will be Maryland's first appearance in the NCAA title game,
but nothing new for the Atlantic Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   It's the eighth time in the last 13 years an ACC team has played
for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In four previous meetings between Maryland and Indiana, the
Terrapins have never won.</TE>
<TE>   The last meeting was in a second-round NCAA tournament game in
1981, a 99-64 Indiana victory.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland Coach Gary Williams is 0-7 against Indiana--0-6 at Ohio
State and 0-1 at Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lavin isn't seeking a better gig, like so many other coaches
prowling around Atlanta this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA coach decided not to come to the Final Four and
accompanying National Basketball Coaches convention because he is
sick. Bruin assistant Jim Saia is in Atlanta and Saturday interviewed
for the head coaching vacancy at Fresno State.</TE>

<HD>Singh Is Humming With 18 Holes to Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vijay Singh made it clear that the Shell Houston Open is his to win
or lose.</LD>
<LD>   "They have to catch me. I'm not going to back off," Singh said.</LD>
<LD>   He has put together the best opening three rounds ever at the TPC
at The Woodlands, shooting a six-under-par 66 Saturday for a
three-stroke lead over Darren Clarke.</LD>
<TE>   At 18-under 198, Singh matched the tournament record for relation
to par set by Curtis Strange in his 1980 victory at the par-71
Woodlands Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Vijay's tournament to lose," Jose Maria Olazabal said after
a 64 left him in third place, five shots back. "If he keeps on
playing the way he's doing at the moment, I don't think we have much
of a chance to beat him."</TE>
<TE>   Singh, looking for his first PGA Tour victory since the 2000
Masters, was nearly flawless for a third consecutive day.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Ireland's Clarke, who trailed Singh by two shots going
into Saturday's play, had a 67, but lost ground to the leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Vijay kept flagging it," he said. "I'm quite pleased to have a
chance. I think with the way Vijay's playing, if he keeps playing
like that, he's going to be very, very difficult to catch."</TE>
<TE>   Olazabal was next at 203. He had nine birdies in his 64, his best
round of the year and the lowest round of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Other international players in contention included Japan's Shigeki
Maruyama at 11 under after a 66. That was one shot better than South
Africa's Rory Sabbatini, who also had a 66, and Australia's Greg
Norman, whose second consecutive 68 left him eight shots off the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Brandt Jobe, who lives near Dallas, had a 69 and was tied with
Maruyama. His 205 made him the lowest-scoring American-born player.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Eichelberger shot his second consecutive five-under 65 to
take a two-stroke lead over Doug Tewell in the Senior Tour's Emerald
Coast Classic at Milton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we could start right now," said Eichelberger, winless
since the 1999 U.S. Senior Open. "I would feel quite comfortable with
another 65."</TE>
<TE>   Tewell shot a 63, attacking the course early and keeping the ball
down when the wind doubled to 20 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Wadkins (63) was third, four strokes back at 134. Hubert
Green (66) was at 135, and Dale Douglass (63), Tom Jenkins (68) and
first-round leader Dana Quigley (73) followed at 136.</TE>
<TE>   Douglass, 66, became the second-youngest pro to better his age
with his 63. Joe Jimenez was 65 when he shot a 63 in the 1991 GTE
Northwest Classic.</TE>

<LD>Winning the Potrero Grande Breeders' Cup Handicap is becoming a
yearly ritual for Bruce Headley.</LD>
<LD>   The trainer won the Grade II for the third time in a row and for
the fourth time in five years Saturday when favored Kalookan Queen
held off 5-1 second choice Ceeband to win by half a length in 1:152/5
for the 61/2 furlongs at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   In becoming the first female to win the Potrero Grande since its
inception in 1983, Kalookan Queen, the 7-10 favorite coupled with
Rapidough, gave jockey Alex Solis his third consecutive win in the
race. He had been aboard Kona Gold the past two years.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Luis Asistio, the 6-year-old Lost Code mare has won nine
of 20 and the $130,620 she earned Saturday pushed her career bankroll
to $760,629.</TE>
<TE>   Last out of the gate in the field of eight, Kalookan Queen moved
up quickly to prompt Alyzig, took over after about a half-mile, then
withstood challenges from Elaborate, who finished third at 14-1, and
Ceeband.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave her a real test today and she answered back," Solis
said. "She was really game today. When she got to the five-sixteenths
pole, she started waiting a bit, and I said, 'mama, don't do that,'
but the last part I really got down on her and she responded nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Ceeband, who has always done his best running at Hollywood Park,
which opens April 24, finished a neck in front of Elaborate. Then
came Reba's Gold, Rapidough, Pie N Burger, Romanzo and Alyzig.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected her to win today and she did her work," said Headley,
who won the first of his five Potrero Grandes with Halo Folks in
1986. "She's a real game mare and she showed her class again today."</TE>

<TE>   Mayakovsky will be a participant in the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby
on Saturday while Royal Gem, who is unbeaten in two races on the
turf, will not.</TE>
<TE>   Mayakovsky won the Gotham Stakes at Aqueduct earlier in the month
in his first start of 2002, and his handlers had been considering the
Wood Memorial in New York for his next race, but trainer Patrick
Biancone decided to remain here. His rider is likely to be Pat
Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to run," Biancone said. "He'll work a half-mile
Tuesday morning."</TE>
<TE>   Royal Gem, trained by Bobby Frankel, is going to miss the Derby
because of a quarter crack on his right foreleg. It would have been
Royal Gem's first start on the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, eight are considered probable for the Derby, including
likely favorite Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   The others, besides Mayakovsky, are Danthebluegrassman, Easy
Grades, Jack's Silver, Lusty Latin, Tracemark and U S S Tinosa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hal's Hope, the second longest shot in the field at 6-1, led all
the way through a very slow pace and captured the $300,000 Gulfstream
Park Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The Grade I was supposed to be a showcase for Red Bullet. But the
2000 Preakness winner, the 1-2 favorite under jockey Jerry Bailey,
finished last in the field of five, beaten more than nine lengths.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-year-old bred, owned and trained by Hal Rose, Hal's Hope
completed the 11/4 miles in 2:024/5 in beating 5-2 second choice
Mongoose by a half-length. Winning for the fifth time in eight starts
at Gulfstream, Hal's Hope was ridden by Roger Velez, who was also
aboard for the horse's victory in the 2000 Florida Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Now nine for 31 in his career, Hal's Hope earned $180,000 and went
past $1 million in earnings. He has banked $1,070,922.</TE>
<TE>   It was Red Bullet's sixth loss in seven races since he surprised
Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness. "He felt horrible," Bailey said.
"He was hitting the ground really bad. He's gone through this before
and snapped out of it, but he never extended himself in this race
today."</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Sir Bear was third, nearly six lengths behind
Mongoose. American Halo, a 60-1 shot, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Mark Hennig and owner Ed Evans made it back-to-back stakes
wins at Aqueduct when Raging Fever led all the way in the $142,300
Distaff Breeders' Cup Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   A day after With Ability won the Next Move, Raging Fever, the 6-5
favorite, rolled to a 33/4-length win over 14-1 shot Prized Stamp in
1:213/5 for the seven furlongs. John Velasquez rode the winner.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last six years, trainers Ron McAnally and John Shirreffs have
combined to win four Santa Lucia handicaps.</LD>
<LD>   McAnally won the restricted race with Printemps last year and
Victory Stripes in 1999. Shirreffs had back-to-back victories with
Borodislew (1996) and Radu Cool (1997).</LD>
<LD>   Both trainers are back for this afternoon's 24th running of the
Santa Lucia.</LD>
<TE>   Kalatiara, an Australian-bred who will be making her first start
on the dirt, is McAnally's representative. Shirreffs will send out
Cashmina, a Cherokee Run filly who has won two of three.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Robert and Janice McNair's Stonerside Stable, Kalatiara
will break from the rail in the field of eight and she figures to
show speed under leading rider Alex Solis.</TE>
<TE>   She has won eight of 16 on the grass, including a Group II victory
in her native country.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss, Cashmina was a troubled third in
her sprint debut Dec. 12 at Hollywood Park, broke her maiden at the
same six-furlong distance as the 11-10 favorite, then stretched out
to the Santa Lucia distance (11/16 miles) and won by 31/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   A $325,000 purchase at Keeneland in September 1999, Cashmina will
again be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Golden Gate Fields ends its meet today and the
main event is an interesting sprint, the $55,000 Emeryville Stakes.
Among the 3-year-old fillies who will run six furlongs are Fertile,
Rich Musique and Yourfinalanswer.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Frank Alvarado and Jason Lumpkins. The two jockeys
combined to win seven of the eight races Friday at Golden Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Kevin Mangold. The apprentice jockey is winless at the
Santa Anita meet and doesn't figure to end his drought today when he
rides longshots Shanes Treasure in the third and Lotta Pay in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the fourth using Manly
Valentine, Buzzword and Cellular Call.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/191. Money: Previous day/meet
Total: $11.80/$1,126. Total money bet: $1,184.</TE>

<LD>Riverside's Todd Burns needed 17 laps to jump into the lead and win
the 50-lap Southern California Auto Club Late Model series feature
race Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway before 4,498. It was Burns'
21st career late model win.</LD>
<LD>   "I got a good run off of [Turn] 4 and I wasn't sure I could get
Tim [Huddleston], but I tried it," Burns said.</LD>
<LD>   Burns pulled ahead of Agoura Hills' Huddleston on Lap 17.
Huddleston, who had taken the lead on Lap 7 from Kevin Wood, could
not stay with Burns after Lap 25. Burns had as much as a three-second
lead going into the final laps of the race, and won by 2.293 seconds
over Huddleston. Wood, who led the first seven laps, finished third.</LD>
<TE>   In the 50-lap Ultra Wheel Super Truck series feature, Chino's
Michael Brusco survived a spin out early in the race to win the
regional series' second race of the season, beating Joe Herold and
Dan Moore.</TE>
<TE>   In the 30-lap King Taco Legends series feature, 16 year-old Ricky
Wildman of Yorba Linda won the first race of the season, holding off
the defending series champion, Alta Loma's Tom Landreth, and
Fontana's Bill Everett.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Limberopoulos grabbed his second consecutive victory in the
35-lap Modified 4's series feature, beating Guy Tripp and Greg
Tucker.</TE>

<HD>Belanger Not Close to Return</HD>

<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Eric Belanger, whose recovery from wrist surgery is still not
complete, might not be available to the Kings until the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we're looking at any time in the next few weeks,"
Coach Andy Murray said of a return to the lineup for the second-year
center. "I don't know if we'll see him before the end of the regular
season."</LD>
<LD>   Left wing Craig Johnson, who underwent surgery on his right eye
March 19, is expected to resume practicing this week.</LD>
<TE>   Belanger, who has not played since Jan. 15, was expected to be
sidelined eight weeks after undergoing surgery on his left wrist Jan.
29. But after returning to practice March 22, he reported pain in the
wrist and was left home while the Kings made a four-game trip that
ended Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   His outlook was brighter than Murray's, but he made no promises.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going the right way," he said. "I'm pretty optimistic for
[this] week, but I don't want to set any time frame. I want to take
it day by day....</TE>
<TE>   "I have to make a full practice and see how it goes. But I'm
feeling pretty confident. I hope it's going to be before the end of
the regular season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray opted for a more conventional lineup Saturday night,
replacing defenseman Andreas Lilja with rookie left wing Jaroslav
Bednar after using 11 forwards and seven defensemen Thursday against
the Edmonton Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see how hard Bednar is going to play," Murray said.
"If he's not going to be playing hard then we're back to 11 forwards
because I won't use him. He's got a lot of ability, but he's got to
play hard....</TE>
<TE>   "There's one way to play the game, and that's to play it hard. And
he's been a lot better [since being recalled from the minors]. He
played three or four real solid games, and then he had a couple that
were below par.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be a top-six forward for us, skillwise, but if you don't
fight to get the puck, it doesn't matter how much skill you've got."</TE>

<HD>Kings Can't Handle Hot Flames, 5-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>The Kings said it would be like this. They said the Calgary Flames,
long out of the playoff picture, would put up a fight.</LD>
<LD>   And fight the Flames did Saturday night, scoring three goals in
the third period of a 5-3 victory over the Kings in front of 17,046
in the Pengrowth Saddledome and sending the visitors home winless
from a four-game trip.</LD>
<LD>   League scoring leader Jarome Iginla scored his 45th and 46th goals
for the Flames, his sixth and seventh against the Kings, who managed
only a tie in four games against the Flames this season, losing the
other three.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't expect anything less than what they gave us," said King
defenseman Mattias Norstrom, whose second-period goal was only his
second of the season and ninth in 521 NHL games. "We can't just match
that in spurts, though, against a team like that with nothing to
lose."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who fell to seventh in the Western Conference playoff
race, also wasted a goal by Cliff Ronning, his first point in seven
games with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   To add injury to insult, they played the last two periods without
defenseman Aaron Miller, who suffered a right rib strain when hit
from behind late in the first period, and the last few minutes
without winger Kelly Buchberger, who suffered a bruised right
quadriceps when he blocked a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Both will be reevaluated today.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, however, all King Coach Andy Murray wanted to talk
about was a questionable elbowing penalty against King center Jason
Allison with 1:46 to play, an infraction that led to the Flames'
third power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who gave up as many as three power-play goals only once
in their first 72 games, gave up three in two of their last three
games on an 0-3-1 trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," Murray said of the call against Allison, whose
goal with 2:57 to play had trimmed the Flames' lead to 4-3. "It's
totally ridiculous for this time of the year. The guy's trying to
line him up and because he knocks the guy down [he gets a penalty]?
His elbow never does come up. They just collide.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point in the game, that [call] shouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Murray suggested that Andy VanHellemond, the league's director of
officiating, should challenge the work of referees Stephane Auger and
Mike Leggo.</TE>
<TE>   VanHellemond attended the game, and Murray sought him out
afterward, describing VanHellemond as a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously my job to look at my guys when they don't perform,
question what they do and challenge them to be better," Murray said.
"I want to see if Andy does the same with his guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Flames, led by Iginla and goaltender Roman Turek, had been one
of the NHL's most surprising success stories in the first two months
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But since their 13-2-2-2 start catapulted them into second place
in the Western Conference, a position they last held Nov. 27, they
are 16-29-10-1 and have fallen to 11th, out of the playoff picture
for the sixth consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   They were 1-6-3 in their last 10 games before Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time of year, players are fighting for jobs," Norstrom
said before the game. "You see it in Minnesota going 6-2-1-1 in its
last 10 games [before Friday]. You see Columbus knocking some teams
off....</TE>
<TE>   "We've all got something to fight for, and if you're on a team
that's out of the playoffs, you know changes are going to be made and
you don't want to be one of the guys they get rid of, so you want to
leave a good impression."</TE>
<TE>   The Flames opened a 2-0 lead on an even-strength goal by Chris
Clark with 52 seconds to play in the first period and a power-play
goal by Iginla with 16:08 to play in the second.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings answered with second-period goals by Ronning and
Norstrom, the goal by Ronning giving the veteran left wing his 11th
50-point season.</TE>
<TE>   But third-period goals by Rob Niedermeyer and Dean McAmmond gave
the Flames a 4-2 lead with 3:54 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we made some mistakes we shouldn't have and we didn't
kill our penalties," Murray said. "You do that and you're going to
lose to teams that work hard."</TE>

<HD>Fox: Spurs Are Still Scared</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Antonio Spurs thought they made a statement when they
handed the Lakers an 18-point defeat 11 days ago at the Alamodome,
they should know better.</LD>
<LD>   "Wash that down, it's gone down the drain," said Laker Coach Phil
Jackson about the March 20 game, which ended the Spurs' six-game
losing streak against the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping their focus has been a challenge for the Lakers, but that
shouldn't be a problem today when they face the Spurs in a key
Western Conference matchup at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We talked this morning about needing the stimulation of important
games to bring meaning to the ball games," Jackson said after the
Lakers' practice Saturday. "This one certainly has it. We anticipate
a good effort. Whether we win or lose is not the question, it's the
effort that we put out there."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Lakers played the Spurs, they were playing their
second road game in as many nights and San Antonio was coming off a
four-day break. The setting for today's game is a little different.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are coming off an impressive 12-point home victory over
Portland on Friday, while the Spurs are playing the final game of a
four-game West Coast trip. San Antonio is also on a two-game losing
streak. After winning 13 games in a row, the Spurs averaged 84.5
points in consecutive losses at Portland and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still scared," Laker forward Rick Fox said of the Spurs.
"They've been on the road for most of the week here now and we're
coming off a nice victory. And I don't know what our record is on
NBC, but as Phil always tells us, we'll try and make our mothers
proud."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant provide most of the
scoring for the Lakers may have been an issue early in the season,
but it doesn't seem to be one now for Jackson with the playoffs right
around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't bother me at all," Jackson said. "Whatever a team

<HD>A Predictable Pick Six Pack</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot of pick six players left Los Alamitos--or one of its
satellites--with a smile late Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Not rich, but happy.</LD>
<LD>   On an evening when the highest-priced winner in the nine races was
Ryans Ridge at $5.20 in the seventh, there figured to be a lot of
perfect pick six tickets.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to victories by favorites Vising ($2.80), Seperate Lanes
($4.60), Kg Jim Dandy ($4.60), Ryans Ridge, Texas Classy ($3.40) and
A Big Shot of Brandy ($3.60), the pick six was worth only $74.80 and
consolations were only $4.</TE>
<TE>   Players will be hoping for a bit more variety tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The main event is the eighth, a $12,300 allowance race for
3-year-olds at 350 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Heza Hot Hit, a winner of five of eight for trainer Donna
McArthur, is the 9-5 morning line favorite, but Tiny Rocket Dash, who
will leave from the rail, has won seven of eight as he makes his
California debut for owner-trainer Roberto Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lanes Fortune. 2. Leav'em Speechless. 3. Kooba Dash.
4. Lost Pirate. 5. Lotsalack. 6. Zoras. 7. Cam Goes Native. 8. Tiny
Rocket Dash. 9. Bobbin Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the opener, we'll use both of trainer Blane
Schvaneveldt's maidens Lanes Fortune and Crocodile Hunter, Leav'em
Speechless and Noorooma in the second, single Kooba Dash in the third
and Lost Pirate, Run Cielo Run, Call Seattle and Synner Or Saint in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Total cost: $16.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Noorooma adds Lasix for her third career start,
so improvement is possible in tonight's second, and Dancingbuterfly
was hampered by a slow start in her first race of the year on March 7
and could move forward for hot trainer Christopher O'Dell.</TE>

<HD>Three on Major Match for LPGA's Best</HD>
<DH>Golf: Sorenstam and Webb are tied with Neumann and will
play in the final group at Mission Hills today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>All we need today is Don King at the first tee and a guy in a tuxedo
who says "Let's get ready to birdie!"</LD>
<LD>   It's what LPGA Commissioner Ty Votaw dreams about when he hits the
hay every night: No. 1 vs. No. 2 going head to head in the last group
on the last day of a major.</LD>
<LD>   That's the big programming note for this day, at least for the
only hour the final round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship is
broadcast on ABC from Mission Hills Country Club, where Annika
Sorenstam and Karrie Webb start the day dead even.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Sorenstam made the whole thing sound more like a buffet
line than a showdown of LPGA heavyweights. "Everyone is hungry," she
said. "We'll see who is the most hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Webb navigated the tricky greens and played the four par-fives in
three under Saturday during her five-under-par 67. That was enough to
catch Sorenstam, who didn't have a birdie the last seven holes on her
way to a 71.</TE>
<TE>   It's about as good a matchup as anyone could have wanted, and not
only that, it's the first time Sorenstam and Webb have ever found
each other in the last group of a major.</TE>
<TE>   However, they're not the only ones who have a chance to
win--they're not even the only ones in the lead. Liselotte Neumann
birdied the last hole for a one-over 73 and worked her way into the
final threesome with a 54-hole total of four-under 212. Neumann, who
led by two shots after 36 holes, had trouble keeping her tee shots on
the fairway and was clearly amazed she hadn't dropped out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going everywhere," she said. "I was spending more time
with the crowd than I was inside the ropes. I guess I was being fan
friendly. Good thing the rough wasn't thick. If it were, I would
probably be sitting here with an 80."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she birdied two of the last three holes, including a
seeing-eye sand wedge that left her ball five inches from the hole at
the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Paired with Sorenstam and Webb, Neumann says she expects to be
nervous, but she has a plan. "I'm going to do some deep breathing and
try to stay calm," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably a fine tactic for anyone who has a shot today, and
there are quite a few in that category. Becky Iverson and Rosie Jones
are only one shot back and Dorothy Delasin and Cristie Kerr are two
shots behind the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   There are 11 players who begin the day within four shots of the
tri-leaders and Webb cautioned against making too much of a
two-person charge to the finish line between herself and Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   Webb did say that Sorenstam seems to bring out the best in her
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not that happens, I'm hoping that I can just play the
golf I played today," Webb said. "But it's going to be a good finish.
You know, I think we'll leave it all out there. I think Annika is not
going to lay down too easily either. And not only her, but ...
there's a lot of good players [who] have got a good chance as well."</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, amateur Lorena Ochoa and Lori Kane, who
aced the eighth hole with a five-iron, trail the leaders by three
shots. Se Ri Pak heads a group at even-par 216 that includes Beth
Daniel, Kris Tschetter and Leta Lindley.</TE>
<TE>   Webb began the day six shots behind Neumann and had two goals for
Saturday's round--shoot in the 60s and play the par-fives better. She
accomplished both. Webb was looking for a score of two or three under
and finished two shots better than that. And after playing the
par-fives in even par the first two days, she birdied three of the
four.</TE>
<TE>   At the second, Webb hit a sand wedge to 10 feet. At the 11th, her
three-wood second shot was just short of the green and she chipped to
four feet. Then at the 18th, Webb hit a nine-iron to 20 feet and made
her putt, despite being distracted when a spectator's cell phone rang
while she was setting up.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, those pesky cell phones," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Sorenstam, she might be thinking about that pesky Webb.
Only last month, they were tied after 72 holes at the Australian
Ladies Masters, where Sorenstam won on the fourth playoff hole. "I
guess I'm 1-up," Sorenstam said. "I hope she remembers that."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam and Webb have finished first and second in the same LPGA
event 10 times since 1995 and both have won five. The last time was
the 2000 Evian Masters, where Sorenstam beat Webb in a one-hole
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   The last group also features the last two winners of this
event--Sorenstam is the defending champion and Webb won in 2000. Webb
also won a major last year and has five, two more than Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what it's going to take," Sorenstam said. "Karrie has won
here before. She has won majors. She has won tournaments. I'm sure
she feels the same way as I do, and that she's in the position she
wants to be.</TE>
<TE>   "She has won her share, I've won my share. I think our games are
very similar. We have a similar attitude on the golf course. So I
think we are both going to push each other. If one makes a birdie,
I'm going to try and top that. And then I'm going to try to make a
birdie on the next hole. I just want to be a step ahead of her
tomorrow. That's what it's going to take."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam probably would like to forget two three-putt bogeys, at
the sixth and the 16th. When it was over, her husband, David Esch,
was reminding her of the importance of focus for today's final round.
Judging from the look on her face, it didn't appear that Sorenstam
needed much reminding.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Portland Trail Blazers talk of fatigue as the season winds
down, the Seattle SuperSonics keep forging ahead and grinding out
victories.</LD>
<LD>   Brent Barry scored 22 points and Gary Payton drove for the
go-ahead layup with 2:11 left as the Seattle defeated Portland,
92-87, Saturday night at Portland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   "This is when we're supposed to click, when it's almost time for
the playoffs," said Payton, who had 18 points. "We're making a
statement that we're a playoff-caliber team, and we want everybody to
understand that when we get to the playoffs, we're going to be a team
to reckon with."</LD>
<TE>   Jerome James had 10 rebounds and made a key defensive play late
for the SuperSonics, who have won four consecutive games and have
defeated two of the Western Conference's better teams on successive
nights. They defeated San Antonio in Seattle on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is in the seventh spot in the Western Conference, but the
SuperSonics have moved within one game of the Trail Blazers, who have
gone only 6-5 since their 12-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the time of the year where everybody's kind of tired, but
we've got to start playing better," said Derek Anderson, who led
Portland with 24 points. "We can't lose our position, we can't lose
our aggressiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Dale Davis had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Shawn Kemp had 13
points and 16 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who played without
Rasheed Wallace for the third time in four games because of his sore
back. Portland has lost all three of those games.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think that right now we've lost a little bit of rhythm
this week, with 'Sheed stepping out of the lineup," Scottie Pippen
said. "Shawn has stepped in and did a great job for us, but it's not
the same out there when we get in tough situations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 90, Houston 88--Shawn Marion scored 26 points, including
two free throws with five seconds to play, to lead the Suns at
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Houston, which shot a franchise record-low 29.9% percent from the
field in a loss Thursday against Sacramento, shot five of 23 (23.2%)
in the first quarter Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 102, Philadelphia 92--Jason Kidd had 19 points and 17
assists at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Nets defeated the 76ers to
stretch their home winning streak to 11 games,</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin returned from a two-game suspension and had 18
points, including a huge three-pointer in the fourth quarter as the
Nets beat the defending conference champions for the second time in
four days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 93, Cleveland 85--Baron Davis had 20 points and a
career-high 17 assists at Cleveland as the Hornets moved into a tie
with Philadelphia for sixth place in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Nailon scored seven points of his 10 points in a 16-4 run that
turned a 72-69 deficit into an 85-76 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 105, Golden State 99--Pau Gasol had 26 points and 12
rebounds and Jason Williams had 22 points and a career-high 19
assists to lead the Grizzlies at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol was 12 of 18 from the field, scoring 20 points in the second
half. Williams was nine of 21 from the field and his assists were a
franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 100, Chicago 84--Juwan Howard scored 23 points and reserve
Zendon Hamilton had a career-high 20 at Chicago to lead the Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Voshon Lenard had 17 points and Calbert Cheaney had 16 for
the Nuggets, who had lost 11 of their previous 12 road games.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State Warrior forward Danny Fortson was suspended for two
games without pay by the NBA for a flagrant foul against Detroit on
Friday night. Fortson, who fouled the Pistons' Ben Wallace in the
third quarter of the Warriors' 110-103 road loss, has accumulated
eight flagrant foul penalty points this season, three more than
allowed.</TE>

<LD>Further adventures and divergences in marketing and real life:</LD>
<LD>   Love it live?</LD>
<LD>   That's the NBA's new slogan, minus the question mark, of course, a
takeoff on the old "I love this game" that served so well in the
halcyon '90s.</LD>
<TE>   "I love this game" was great, with TV spots showing players doing
all kinds of artistic, joyous, zany things on the floor, capturing
the intimacy that is the game's great selling point.</TE>
<TE>   "Love it live," on the other hand, combines the old slogan with a
tacit admission there's a problem --falling attendance--making it a
downer, like the NFL's recent "Play Football" commercials or
baseball's "Rebuilding Baseball in the Inner Cities."</TE>
<TE>   If you're reduced to asking kids to play your game, which used to
be a given, all your ads do is alert the nation to your predicament.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even marketing savants get the blues. At a recent
Orlando Magic game, owner and Amway founder Rich DeVos, hailed as a
savior for taking the team off the market, took advantage of his new
cachet by coming right out and asking fans to buy more tickets.</TE>
<TE>   What a great idea! Let's go see a game because: 1) Maybe the Magic
will win! 2) We can see Tracy McGrady! 3) Some billionaire whose
asset appreciates $10 million a year and who wants the city to build
him a new arena, needs our money in the meantime for better cash
flow!</TE>
<TE>   Then there was David Stern, who taught the other commissioners how
to market, at least in the '90s. Stern appeared at one of SuperSonic
owner Howard (Starbucks) Schultz's management seminars last week, and
noted, "We have a product that the newspapers are doing a very bad
job telling you about."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, we don't have happy-news features like "Inside Stuff,"
but there's a reason for that. Stern is partners with several TV
networks, who donate the air time for sappy stories (Rasheed Wallace
is a DJ when he's not going after referees or running off reporters)
but the NBA has no business arrangement with any newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, our approach to covering the NBA was the same in the
'90s when everyone was calling Stern a genius, so one thing is clear:
Either we're in a slump or Stern is.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he should tell it to his TV audience, or the 60% of it
that remains from peak levels.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps deconstructing his triumphs would help Stern see what he
did right--and what he had nothing to do with. The '90s weren't just
Michael Jordan, the Bulls' dynasty and Stern's marketing savvy, but
the zenith of an arena-building boom that provided an additional,
widespread but ultimately only a short-term boost.</TE>
<TE>   There's an advertising slogan--sell the sizzle, not the
steak--which may work in the short term (not to mention the ad biz,
where sizzle is what they sell), but in the end, what counts is the
product.</TE>
<TE>   Without compelling games, it doesn't matter if "Monday Night
Football" has Hank Williams Jr., the entire Country Music Hall of
Fame, John Madden, Dennis Miller or Dennis Rodman.</TE>
<TE>   Without compelling games, it doesn't matter what Stern thinks
about the media, the new rules (which he took years to address) or
the state of his game.</TE>
<TE>   Stern now has the prospect of two exciting sets of playoffs, the
problem being they're on different levels. The little East winner
must ultimately play the big West winner with the odds again in favor
of another short Finals with a downbeat rating.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, stuff happens no one could predict. For Stern's sake,
it had better.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   West</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, I had four West teams tied for No. 1, but that was
wrong. It should have been five:</TE>
<TE>   Lakers--They keep insisting no one can beat them but them, they'll
be fine in the playoffs when Shaquille O'Neal has time between games
to rest his toe, etc. There's a point where confidence becomes
dangerous; if they're not there, they're close.</TE>
<TE>   Spurs--With nine new players, including a 19-year-old rookie point
guard, it took longer than usual to launch their annual second-half
run. In the meantime, Coach Gregg Popovich called them soft weekly,
owner Peter Holt said they were "in transition" and everyone wrote
off David Robinson. Now they're back and looking firmer.</TE>
<TE>   They'll have plenty of cap space in '03, so if it doesn't happen
for them this season, don't expect them to go away.</TE>
<TE>   Kings--Best record in the NBA, on a 60-win pace. They'll look
formidable in any series they have home-court but less so in any
series they don't.</TE>
<TE>   Mavericks--Hard to believe they'll stay afloat in the playoffs
when the games slow down and the opponents will be a lot bigger than
they are, but this is Firepower Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Trail Blazers--It's really hard to believe, but soft-spoken Mo
Cheeks, an afterthought hire for General Manager Bob Whitsitt, who
couldn't get Jeff Van Gundy or Flip Saunders, started 13-18 and then
turned this asylum back into a team. As another West coach noted:
"These guys would have run Dean Smith out of coaching."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers are no longer physically imposing, but they're
still the game's most versatile team, with five players (Wallace,
Bonzi Wells, Damon Stouadmire, Scottie Pippen, Ruben Patterson)
capable of scoring 20 points any night, three (Wallace, Wells,
Patterson) whom Cheeks can post up and four (Wallace, Pippen,
Patterson, Dale Davis) capable of getting 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   East</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry about picking a favorite here, there isn't one.</TE>
<TE>   Nets--They were 32-15 at the All-Star break, 15-11 since, leading
voters to consider more MVP candidates than Jason Kidd. Kenyon
Martin, now their second-best player, is a special problem, convinced
as he is that he gets all those flagrant fouls because everyone picks
on him. This season won't be long enough to fit in all the personal
growth he needs.</TE>
<TE>   Hornets--Bummed out by exit politics, hampered by injuries to
Jamal Mashburn and David Wesley, they went nowhere until this month.
With Baron Davis taking over, they're also the East's biggest,
deepest and most talented team, but hardly its steadiest.</TE>
<TE>   Pistons--Gritty, tenacious, small, with a deep bench that makes
them tougher than they look. Should be in over their heads in elite
competition, but if they keep overachieving, more power to them.</TE>
<TE>   Celtics--If I see one more reference to a return to their glory
days when they won actual titles, I'm going to be ill. They're
three-point crazy and could be gone in a flash, but their Dick
Harter-devised defense is legit.</TE>
<TE>   76ers--Allen Iverson hopes to be back by the playoffs, Derrick
Coleman has a sore knee that will require off-season surgery and
Larry Brown is where he usually is in his fifth season, assuming he
lasted that long.</TE>
<TE>   Bucks--George Karl, one of the brightest but most insecure men,
even in coaching, found himself in a dream gig, with a doting owner,
Herb Kohl, who raised his pay to $7 million a year and didn't even
expect much. Of course, this made George wackier than ever. Ray Allen
and Sam Cassell have nagging injuries and Anthony Mason is there--at
Karl's insistence--in case any shred of happiness remains.</TE>
<TE>   Magic--Another season (this makes three) in which Doc Rivers ducks
the bullet with his name on it, but postseasons are something else.
Great as he is, McGrady can't pull this wagon long in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Pacers--Promising but still unformed team. Isiah Thomas,
fascinating guy, is still looking for his niche, has yet to prove it
should be in coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Wizards--This season is over and next season hangs by a thread.
Coach Doug Collins spilled the beans, saying he'd be "surprised" if
Jordan returns and Mike sounds skeptical too: "I've been saying all
along, if I'm not feeling good physically, I won't play."</TE>
<TE>   It's not a good sign when he starts saying this is what he's been
saying all along.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they're desperate, but the story on the Wizards' Web site
said: "Jordan addressed the media following practice Thursday and
remained adamant about his commitment to the team."</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's all go out there and love it live! The fortunes you're
saving might be ours.</TE>

<KH>INDIANA 73, OKLAHOMA 64</KH>
<HD>The Turtles vs. the Heir</HD>
<DH>Davis Keeps Hoosiers Alive for a Big Night</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>This book was not for sale, unlike the stacks of Bob Knight
autobiographies the former Indiana coach signed at a local bookstore
as part of Final Four festivities.</LD>
<LD>   This was the Hoosiers' book on Oklahoma, penned by Coach Mike
Davis, and it was as engrossing as Dane Fife's defense on Hollis
Price, as inspiring as hometown hero Jeff Newton's play off the
bench.</LD>
<LD>   And it leads right into a sequel, a national championship game for
Indiana, the team so many said didn't belong here, the team that
ignored the ambivalence of Knight-loving legions, the team that
outmaneuvered Oklahoma, 73-64, Saturday in a semifinal before 53,378
at the Georgia Dome.</LD>
<TE>   The book went like this: Work the ball inside against Oklahoma's
extended man-to-man defense and put Sooner big men in foul trouble.
Then, when Oklahoma falls into a matchup zone, unleash a torrent of
three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our game plan went exactly according to script," Fife said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Indiana (25-11) trailed by four at halftime, the Hoosiers
forced Oklahoma (31-5) to abandon its man-to-man defense by
penetrating into the key, making four layups, two dunks and three
short jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner center Jabahri Brown picked up three fouls in the first
half and forward Aaron McGhee, who scored a game-high 22 points,
picked up two quick fouls in the first two minutes of the second half
and fouled out with 4:40 to play.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Oklahoma went to a zone and the Hoosiers
responded by making six of six three-point shots--all by different
players--calling to mind the eight in a row they made at the
beginning of their Elite Eight victory over Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   "We loosened up and relaxed after a while, when we realized we
could win this game," forward Jared Jeffries said.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma, in contrast, was as tightly wound as the tape on Tom
Coverdale's ankle. The Hoosier guard was questionable because of a
severe sprain, but he played 29 minutes and made a three-point basket
that gave Indiana its first second-half lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners shot only 36.4% and missed all but two of their 18
three-point shots. Nobody was colder than Price, the most valuable
player of the West Regional and the Big 12 Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Fife, Indiana's 6-foot-4 senior bulldog defender, made like a
human Price tag, forcing the All-Big 12 guard to miss 10 of 11 shots
and score only six points, matching his season low.</TE>
<TE>   "Fife did a great job," Price said. "He was so physical. I usually
get around that, but I just didn't overcome it."</TE>
<TE>   Others took Fife's cue, especially Hoosier reserves, who combined
for 41 points.</TE>
<TE>   Newton, a 6-10 junior from Mays High in Atlanta, had a career-high
19 points, grabbed six rebounds and blocked four shots. Thirteen
points came in the second half when he took advantage of the timidity
of the foul-plagued Brown and McGhee.</TE>
<TE>   The play of Newton and Leach (two blocked shots and a dunk off a
pass from Coverdale in the first half) was especially important
because Jeffries, Indiana's best player, sat out the last 12 minutes
of the first half after picking up his second foul.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries, who averages 15.4 points, scored only eight.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Moye, another reserve with Atlanta roots, made four of six
shots for nine points before leaving because of a pulled hamstring
with 8:20 to play.</TE>
<TE>   And freshman reserve point guard Donald Perry scored 10 points,
boldly driving through the Oklahoma defense for a layup that extended
Indiana's lead to 64-60 with two minutes left and coolly making five
free throws in the last 1:04.</TE>
<TE>   Perry was in the game only because Coverdale lost his temper after
getting pulled to the floor and turning the ball over with three
minutes to play and the score knotted, 60-60. Oklahoma had just
scored seven points in a row, and when Coverdale verbally sparred
with the officials and Sooner Daryan Selvy, Davis replaced him with
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   "It really wasn't time for that, it was a time for calmness,"
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Newton scored, then Perry scored, then Newton made two free throws
and the Hoosiers were on their way to their first final since 1987,
their last national championship season.</TE>
<TE>   And no one appeared calmer than Davis, a former Knight assistant
who replaced the volatile Hoosier legend 18 months ago amid turmoil
and questions of loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   With about a minute to play, Fife noticed Davis on the bench with
his head buried in his hands, and he said, "Coach, get your head up,
man, we're going to the national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was counting his blessings, reflecting on the difficulties
of replacing the enormously popular and controversial Knight, who now
coaches Texas Tech when not signing his autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   "I handled things poorly at the beginning because I took things
personally," Davis said. "And it's not about me. It's about Indiana,
a great basketball program, and it's bigger than anyone or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Hoosiers can become the first fifth-seeded team to win a
championship. This is his book, and there is still a chapter to be
written.</TE>

<KH>MARYLAND 97, KANSAS 88</KH>
<HD>The Turtles vs. the Heir</HD>
<DH>Terrapins Don't Let This One Get Away</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Even in the best of circumstances, Maryland Coach Gary Williams is
rarely calm. He is a man dripping sweat, a walking illustration of
stress.</LD>
<LD>   Down by 11 points four minutes into the Terrapins' NCAA semifinal
against Kansas on Saturday, he was livid in the Maryland huddle.</LD>
<LD>   "He was telling us that we were [sissies]," forward Chris Wilcox
said.</LD>
<TE>   "That was intense," guard Drew Nicholas said.</TE>
<TE>   So were the Terrapins after that. They roared back to lead by as
many as 20 in their 97-88 victory, only to have to hold off the
Jayhawks when Kansas got as close as four with 20 seconds left in
front of 53,378 at the Georgia Dome.</TE>
<TE>   It was a topsy-turvy semifinal of dizzying fastbreaks and
dagger-like three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   But no one was more phenomenal than Maryland guard Juan Dixon, who
scored a career-high 33 points and made five of 11 three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   He'll carry the Terrapins (31-4) into the school's first national
championship game Monday against Indiana--a year after Duke
eliminated Maryland in the semifinals by coming from 22 points behind
to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll forget last year until we finally win the
national championship," said center Lonny Baxter, whose early foul
trouble limited him to 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't give up, same as Duke last year," Dixon said. "Great
teams never give up. Kansas didn't give up either."</TE>
<TE>   Down by 83-63 after a Dixon three-pointer with a little more than
six minutes to play, Kansas (33-4) clawed its way back.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Gooden, the Jayhawk forward who was a candidate for national
player of the year but fizzled at the Final Four, converted a
three-point play as the rally began, and made a three-point shot that
cut it to 14.</TE>
<TE>   But Gooden scored only 15 points--four in the first half--as
Maryland's athleticism and stable of physical defenders shut him
down. (Kansas was led by Nick Collison's 21 points and 10 rebounds.)</TE>
<TE>   "Like Coach talked about in the scouting report, Kansas doesn't
like people in their space," Baxter said. "We played up on them
tight. Didn't allow them to get free runs at the basket, just stayed
physical with them."</TE>
<TE>   No one displayed more breathtaking athleticism than Wilcox, the
sophomore who had 18 points, nine rebounds, four blocked shots and
two particularly ferocious dunks.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Chris is going to be a great junior next year for us,"
Williams began, as if trying to will him not to turn pro. "Chris is
special."</TE>
<TE>   The game seemed decided, but Kansas kept pecking away. The
Jayhawks got the lead down to five on a three-pointer by Jeff Boschee
with 2:05 left--and all anyone watching could think was ... Duke.
Again?</TE>
<TE>   "That Duke game popped into my head for just a second," Maryland
guard Steve Blake said. "But it made me focus that much more. We
weren't going to let that happen again."</TE>
<TE>   After Kansas guard Aaron Miles stumbled and turned the ball over,
Maryland ran the shot clock down to seven seconds and then Dixon
drove the baseline and floated a shot into the basket for a
seven-point lead with 1:14 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been saying that the whole week, if we ever got in that
position again where we were up 22 points, we were going to find a
way to pull the game out," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   "We did. It's just out of experience. We grew a lot over the last
year or so."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas allowed the Terrapins to keep running time off the clock
without fouling quickly, but a three-pointer by Gooden with 20
seconds left suddenly cut the lead to four, 92-88.</TE>
<TE>   Several Jayhawk players had the same instinct at once--time
out!--but Kansas already had used its last.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon--a 91% free-throw shooter--went to the line after the
technical foul call and missed, but made his next free throw for a
five-point lead with 19 seconds left, and Kansas didn't score again.</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins started the game looking as if they were going to
have another Final Four disaster, with four turnovers in the first
five possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Then Williams got ahold of them in a tirade during a TV timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "He says a lot of things we just try to take in stride," Wilcox
said. "I appreciated him getting on us like that. It got us going."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas is just plain gone, knocked out of the Final Four without
winning a championship for the third time in Coach Roy Williams'
three trips.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just sad that I'm not going to get to coach this bunch right
now," Roy Williams said. "And yeah, it hurts not to be playing Monday
night, but it doesn't hurt one iota or one ounce for Roy Williams
over any record or championship. It just hurts because I'm not going
to get a chance to coach them in the national championship game, not
going to get a chance to coach them any more."</TE>
<TE>   So Maryland has one more game. Indiana will be trying to win its
sixth national championship. Maryland is after its first.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana is a very good basketball team," Gary Williams said. "I
think people have to stop saying there were three really good teams
here, and Indiana. I think that's done now. I think they've proven
themselves with the Duke win and the win against Oklahoma."</TE>

<HD>He Had the Inside Stuff on Gooden</HD>
<DH>Maryland: Wilcox had all the incentive he needed after
claim of greatness by Kansas' star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Chris Wilcox took offense to a television report he saw Saturday
afternoon in which Kansas All-American forward Drew Gooden proclaimed
himself and teammate Nick Collison the best big men in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The Maryland sophomore, who would be guarding Gooden in the
Terrapins' national semifinal game against the Jayhawks, used
Gooden's boast as motivation.</LD>
<LD>   So when the 6-foot-10, 230-pound Gooden went up for his first
shot, the 6-10, 220-pound Wilcox promptly swatted the ball away.</LD>
<TE>   And when Gooden went up for his next shot, Wilcox and his massive
wingspan replayed the event as he coolly rejected the Jayhawk again.</TE>
<TE>   Same thing happened a few minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Wilcox had blocked Gooden's first three shot attempts in
the game's first 4:33. It was a good thing for Maryland, too.</TE>
<TE>   Without Wilcox's block party, and had Gooden's first three shots
gone in, Kansas would have run out to a 19-4 lead. Instead, Maryland
was able to claw back from an early 11-point deficit to pull out a
97-88 victory that propelled the Terrapins into Monday night's title
game against surprising Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to show [Gooden] that anything can happen on any
given night," Wilcox said. "I outplayed him and I wish him the best.
I just played hard and great defense on him."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said he was with Maryland center Lonny Baxter at the team
hotel earlier in the day when they saw Gooden's claim on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   "After seeing that TV show, we just had to show them who the two
best big men were," Wilcox said. "It just shows you that you
shouldn't take anyone lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Gary Williams said that Wilcox's emotional spark kept the
Terrapins in the game early.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything good that you can get when you're down 13-2 is
definitely a good thing," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Wilcox] really picked us up emotionally with those
blocks. He does those types of things for us."</TE>
<TE>   Besides blocking shots, and with Maryland trailing 13-2, Wilcox
also kick-started the Terrapins offensively with a thunderous dunk at
the 15:48 mark. The basket ignited a 24-12 Maryland rally that ended
with a Juan Dixon three-point basket, giving the Terrapins their
first lead at 26-25 with 7:22 remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland would never trail again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that set the tone," said Wilcox, who had 18 points, nine
rebounds and four blocks in 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great motivation for our team."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates agreed, especially Baxter, whose slack down low was
picked up by Wilcox.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris came up big defensively," said Baxter, who fouled out and
finished with only four points in 14 minutes. "When he takes over
like that, he can't be stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox limited Gooden to four first-half points.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden, who finished with 15 points but didn't get going until the
Jayhawks trailed by 17 points, professed his innocence in inciting
Wilcox.</TE>
<TE>   "I was misquoted on that," he said. "I said that ... but earlier,
before the season. It's not something I said [recently]."</TE>
<TE>   Gooden also claimed that Wilcox blocking his shot early and often
did not alter his mind-set or his game plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't affect me," he said. "I was still aggressive and going
after him but I didn't get the ball where I wanted, didn't get in a
groove."</TE>
<TE>   Credit Wilcox and his pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what he was thinking," Wilcox said of Gooden. "I
would think that getting your shot blocked would intimidate you. But
whatever it takes to get my team motivated, I'll do it."</TE>

<LD>Louisiana State University athletes had tutors write, rewrite and
type papers, read books, and look up test answers for them in
violation of NCAA and school rules, according to a university memo.</LD>
<LD>   The Jan. 22 memo from Roger Grooters, director of LSU's Academic
Center for Student-Athletes, to the athletic department's NCAA
compliance officer listed seven alleged violations.</LD>
<LD>   LSU released the memo after blacking out names and anything else
that might identify the people involved. LSU has been investigating
the allegations since January.</LD>
<TE>   Southeastern Conference Commissioner Roy Kramer will decide if the
NCAA should get involved.</TE>
<TE>   LSU Athletic Director Skip Bertman has said the investigation
centers on five to 10 student-athletes, including football players.
LSU has notified the NCAA of its investigation, associate athletic
director David Bahnsen said recently.</TE>

<LD>   Kolanos scored the game-winner on a penalty shot 8:20 into the
third period, enraging Patrick Roy so much that he was ejected, and

<TE>   After Kolanos gave Phoenix a 4-3 lead, Roy smashed his stick
against a goal post, splintering it, and then threw a piece at
Kolanos, who beat him high on the glove side. Roy then charged
referee Dan Marouelli, drawing 10-minute misconduct and game
misconduct penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Roy, who had 16 saves, was upset that the penalty shot was awarded
after Marouelli ruled he threw his stick across the crease to stop
Kolanos from scoring.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The soccer field is a stage for senior Jill Oakes of Harvard-Westlake
High.</LD>
<LD>   Her coach believes that someday, the world will be her audience.</LD>
<LD>   "She embodies everything that women's professional players aspire
to be," said Stacy Schwartz, the Wolverines' first-year coach and
former Olympic Development Program under-17 player.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of refining everything."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes, 17, is the best player at Harvard-Westlake (23-1-2), which
won its second consecutive section title this season. She recorded 21
goals and 13 assists from her center midfielder position.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, she was selected the Gatorade national girls'
soccer player of the year. Now, she has been chosen The Times' girls'
soccer player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Oakes, a member of the women's under-19 national team, has signed
a letter of intent to play at UCLA. She earned the national honor
after a season she began with doubts about whether she would play
high school soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, that was a big decision for me," Oakes said. "You have
to sacrifice a lot to play soccer at the level I'm at now and I
wanted to spend my senior year doing the things I always wanted to do
but couldn't because of soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Among those things was dance, a life-long passion she indulged
recreationally with hip-hop and street-dancing routines.</TE>
<TE>   But Oakes, a West Hills resident, enrolled in an advanced dance
class at Harvard-Westlake that required her to help choreograph and
participate in a concert performance staged last month.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for the show, she missed several soccer practices,
with Schwartz's permission. Such concession and compromise was a key
factor in Oakes' decision to play for the Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   Oakes' presence in the lineup helped the Wolverines (23-1-2)
repeat as Southern Section Division IV co-champions. She scored off a
corner kick by Kim LaVere in the 45th minute and Harvard-Westlake
tied La Verne Bonita, 1-1, in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines' second consecutive title--they tied Louisville,
2-2, last season--made Oakes' return for her senior season worth the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Oakes, who played her freshman season at Van Nuys Birmingham, made
an immediate impact after transferring to Harvard-Westlake as a
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows she's good, but she's constantly saying she doesn't do
it alone," Schwartz said. "She's one of those players that's playing
with teammates who might not all be as good as she is. She could play
down to their level.</TE>
<TE>   "But she doesn't. She lifts their level instead. She has a
confidence, a presence, on the field that makes everybody better, and
it gives the whole team more confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes' self-assurance has been boosted by being part of the
under-19 national team player pool. The under-19 team will play in
World Cup competition in Canada this summer.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't hurt by playing on the under-21 national team that
won the Nordic Cup for the fifth time in six years in Dokka, Norway,
in July.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was Oakes' goal from 12 yards in the 76th minute of a
semifinal match against Germany that gave the U.S. a 1-1 tie it
needed to advance to the championship match.</TE>
<TE>   "I was playing with players who were that much faster, stronger
and played smarter in a game that I thought I had down pretty well,"
she said. "So the fact that I was able to do well was good, and very
satisfying, for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it made me realize that I am actually a good player. I'm
a good player, and I know I'm that much closer to them--but I also
know I have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   She won't get there by driving. Oakes has yet to try to obtain her
license.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that bad?" she says with a laugh. "I've just been very
busy, and I've never gotten to the point where I haven't been able to
get a ride, so I haven't been forced to do it."</TE>
<TE>   No matter. She's already in the fast lane to success.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Bookie Says Fix Would Be Easy</HD>

<LD>They are college kids playing basketball for nothing more shining
than the moment.</LD>
<LD>   They are easy targets.</LD>
<LD>   The Fixable Four.</LD>
<TE>   "It's much easier to fix a tournament game than a regular game,"
says convicted sports bribery felon Benny Silman. "There's so much
money bet on these games, who would know the difference?"</TE>
<TE>   Enjoy this weekend's spectacle in Atlanta. Embrace its emotion.
But listen to this man.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from a phone in his mother's New York apartment, Silman
spins a frightening tale about the tenuous integrity of a sport in
which everyone makes millions but the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is saying those bad passes were anything but mistakes,
those lost dribbles anything but slips.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Silman knows that in any college basketball game, anything is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Silman knows, because he ordered those sorts of plays at Arizona
State in 1994 in one of the most recent college gambling scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The former campus bookie conspired with star guards Stevin
"Hedake" Smith and Isaac Burton to fix four games that landed all of
them in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in print for the first time since being released from a
halfway house after 31/2 years in federal custody, the 30-year-old
Silman still marvels at the ease of the scam.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, because of the importance of these games, and the whole
atmosphere at this level, it's less likely that any Final Four
athletes would ever be involved," he says. "But if they were, it
would be easier to hide."</TE>
<TE>   He says look for the players who don't have certain NBA careers.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys know that this is the only time they can make the
money," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He says look not for balls thrown into the stands, but balls that
bounce off the front of the rims, or off feet, or on the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never anything big, and it can only be one person doing it,
but that's enough," Silman said. "That's why college basketball is
probably the best sport for this."</TE>
<TE>   He warns that as long as the sport contains billion-dollar TV
contracts and million-dollar coaching deals while the players make
nothing beyond the same scholarships given chemistry or music
prodigies, it remains a gambler's dream.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball players at this level, they are considered people of
great stature, but they don't have any of that money themselves," he
says. "Gamblers can give them that money. It becomes easy for them to
accept it."</TE>
<TE>   As easy as one student doing a little dorm business with another
student, which was the innocent setting for Silman's complicated
crime.</TE>
<TE>   He was simply one of the campus bookies.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was just another player who was broke.</TE>
<TE>   They met at a keg party. Smith wondered what every big-time
college basketball player eventually wonders: How come everybody was
making money off his jump shot but him?</TE>
<TE>   "Hedake was watching me count my money one day, and he said, 'How
can I get me some of that?'" Silman recalls. "I just looked at him.
He looked back. For the longest time, we just stared at each other."</TE>
<TE>   Then, Silman recalls, Smith gave the subtle approval to make the
deal that would ruin both of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not going to lose any games," Smith told Silman.</TE>
<TE>   Once he started fixing, though, it was a promise he couldn't keep.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Smith scored a career-high 39 points, but
Burton missed a couple of big shots and the Sun Devils didn't cover
the 15-point spread in a six-point victory over Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of days later, Smith went just cold enough for the Sun
Devils to defeat Oregon by six points in a game with a 12-point
spread.</TE>
<TE>   The third game, Smith found fixing so easy, he missed 13 of 20
shots as the Sun Devils lost to USC despite being favored.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Smith and Burton were sharing $20,000 per game while
Silman was getting rich.</TE>
<TE>   The scam finally ended when word leaked and gamblers swarmed over
a late-season game against Washington. After watching the line change
more than 40 times because of all the action, bookmakers from Las
Vegas warned the Pacific 10 Conference of a possible fix.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sun Devils missed their first 14 shots, the players were
warned of suspicions at halftime. In the second half, everybody was
forced to try hard, and the Sun Devils won in a romp, and all the
gamblers lost.</TE>
<TE>   None as much as Silman, who lost much of his young adulthood while
spending three years in a federal prison in Yankton, S.D.</TE>
<TE>   His story is the topic of tonight's FX movie, "Big Shot:
Confessions of a Campus Bookie." But he no longer feels like a big
shot.</TE>
<TE>   While he says the movie is true, he seems embarrassed about it,
and wouldn't allow a movie publicist to be present on the phone
during this interview.</TE>
<TE>   When the movie's star visited him in New York for research,
Silman's mother threw him out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm making no money, this is hard on everybody, it's awful for my
parents to relive it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He works as an assistant manager at a restaurant. He no longer
gambles. He no longer even watches college basketball. Especially not
the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't get in any pools, so the tournament isn't that
interesting to me," he says. "I think it's the same for a lot of
people."</TE>
<TE>   It is, isn't it? We worry about players gambling on tournament
games, but aren't many of us gambling on the same games? And if we
couldn't gamble, would we still watch?</TE>
<TE>   We think basketball players--despite working what is essentially a
full-time job that prohibits other employment--should be happy with
their scholarships and keep quiet about being paid.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when we're betting on them.</TE>

<HD>North's Howard a Triple Record Breaker at Pasadena Games</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chaunte Howard of Riverside North High began the week as the best
girls' high jumper in the state and one of the top triple jumpers.</LD>
<LD>   She ended it Saturday in the Pasadena Games at Pasadena City
College with one of the greatest jump triples turned in by a U.S.
high school girl.</LD>
<LD>   Howard, the defending state champion in the high jump, won that
event at 6 feet, won the long jump at 19-73/4 and the triple jump at
41-3. All three marks were meet records.</LD>
<TE>   The high jump and triple jump were the best outdoor performances
in the state this year, and the triple jump topped Howard's previous
best by more than 18 inches.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Howard's victories in the long jump and triple jump
came against junior Michelle Sanford of Irvine Woodbridge, the top
returning performer in the state in those events.</TE>
<TE>   "I never focus on the competition, but I was excited to be jumping
against her," said Howard, who was competing in the long jump and
triple jump for the first time this season. "I wanted to break 40
feet in the triple jump, but I never expected to jump 41-3."</TE>
<TE>   Howard, who has signed with Georgia Tech, had never long-jumped
before last week. But she focused on the event in practice Wednesday,
leaped a state-leading 19-8 against Riverside Poly on Thursday and
then hit her 19-73/4 jump Saturday on the first of four attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was one of three girls who won two or more individual
events.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist, defending state
champion in the 100, won the event in a state-leading 11.56 while
running into a wind of 2.8 meters-per-second. Felix took the 200 in a
state-leading 23.62 while running with an aiding wind of 2.0, the
maximum allowed for record purposes. Felix also ran a superb anchor
leg in the 400 relay to help her team finish third in a school-record
47.93.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Ashley Freeman of Long Beach Wilson won the 400 in 54.85
and the 800 in 2:13.94. She also ran on teams that won the 400 relay
in 47.11 and the 1,600 relay in a state-leading 3:42.74.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Noah Smith of Woodland Hills Taft had the best single
performance in the boys' meet. He won the 200 in a career-best and
state-leading 21.38.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a baseball game:</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth 13, Las Vegas Palo Verde 8--Jared Halpert had three
hits and drove in three runs and Brian Lee had three hits and scored
four runs for Chatsworth (13-0) in the Las Vegas Bishop Gorman
tournament Star division championship game.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine Woodbridge softball tournament first-round games:</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills 2, Anaheim Esperanza 1--Margo Pineda hit a game-winning
single with two out in the bottom of the eighth in an upset of No. 19
Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest El Toro 2, Lakewood 1--Robyn Ford-Feite singled in the
go-ahead run in the sixth inning for No. 12 El Toro (12-4). Lakewood,
ranked No. 14, drops to 9-3.</TE>

<HD>Two for 1</HD>
<DH>Connecticut's Bird and Taurasi Might Be the Best Collegiate
Women's Backcourt Tandem Ever</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Sue Bird is the best player in women's college basketball today.
Diana Taurasi may end up being the best ever.</LD>
<LD>   They are the guards for undefeated and top-ranked Connecticut and
they make up the best backcourt ever.</LD>
<LD>   If only the UCLA men had a point guard who could pull up on the
fastbreak and make that 12-foot jump shot 90% of the time the way
Bird does.</LD>
<TE>   If only the USC men had a two-guard who could grab a left-handed,
one-handed rebound, take it the length of the court, dribbling with
his left hand with a defender on his right, and score a one-handed
layup the way Taurasi can. Or post up with his back to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   No guard tandem in the history of women's basketball has offered
the combination of size, strength, power, athleticism, court savvy,
shooting ability and creativity as Bird, a 5-foot-9 senior from
Syosset, N.Y., and Taurasi, a 6-foot sophomore from Chino.</TE>
<TE>   "From the days of the AIAW through the time of the NCAA," Nancy
Lieberman says, "no two guards have been as good at playing defense,
with the pull-up game, were as physical, were so good at reading
plays, both offensively and defensively, as Bird and Taurasi."</TE>
<TE>   That is high praise. Lieberman was a pretty good guard herself at
Old Dominion and had a good backcourt companion in Rhonda Rompola.
Both were 5-9, both were strong and could shoot, both had played with
men and were fearless. "But you can't even compare us to Bird and
Taurasi," Lieberman says.</TE>
<TE>   It is dangerous to compare past with present. More women play now;
more big, strong women play now. Coaching is better, from grade
school to college. Facilities are better, opportunities are greater.</TE>
<TE>   So who can honestly say whether 4-11 Debbie Brock and sharpshooter
Cornelia Ward of Delta State would star now? Or if USC's Cynthia
Cooper and Rhonda Wyndham could take Taurasi and Bird?</TE>
<TE>   But, as Ann Meyers noted, "You can remember Dawn Staley, but who
played with her? You remember Sheryl Swoopes but not her partner.
Cynthia Cooper was not the player in college that she became later.
When you do this, trying to think of great backcourts, it's hard to
argue against Bird and Taurasi."</TE>
<TE>   Bird and Taurasi are an unlikely couple. Bird says Bobby Hurley
was her favorite point guard. She is the ultimate old-school player.
Fundamentally sound, mentally unperturbable, Bird has a secure shot
from everywhere, the ability to square up with textbook form. She
rarely makes a bad pass or takes an off-balance shot.</TE>
<TE>   Taurasi's favorite guard is Magic Johnson. She is flamboyant and
loudly confident. Opponents grumble at her unshakable belief in
herself, but Taurasi is just a jock. Her hands are huge, the size of
her face. She can easily palm the ball with either hand and shoot it
or pass it or dribble it, behind her back or up the sideline. She is
Oscar Robertson, inventing new limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a kid [Taurasi] who I think has a chance to be maybe the
best guard, maybe the best player, ever in college," Connecticut
Coach Geno Auriemma says. "There's so much I want to teach her.
There's so much she has to learn. And I don't want to take away any
of her exuberance or flair or spirit. I'm walking a real fine line
here. If she does it right and I do it right, she's going to be the
best player ever."</TE>
<TE>   Bird is what Brock and Lieberman, Jamila Wideman and Staley,
Teresa Edwards and Ukari Figgs were leading up to. What Auriemma has
in Taurasi is the next generation. The guard who can rebound. The
forward who can make the blind pass. The strong banger who can shoot
the three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Bird and Taurasi start everything for the 38-0 Huskies.
Both are point guards, both are shooting guards. If Bird is hot,
Taurasi dishes. "When Diana is on fire," Bird says, "I am constantly
looking for her because she is the type of player that has so much
talent that on any given night she can dump 40 points on you."</TE>
<TE>   They also look for their teammates. "Both Sue and Diana can make
passes that I haven't seen anyone else in college make," center Asjha
Jones says. "Both of them are so unselfish. Both of them understand
the game to perfection. They can see the court so well. That's why
you hardly ever see any of us take bad shots."</TE>
<TE>   Meyers cautions against saying Bird and Taurasi are the best
anything. "They haven't won a championship together," Meyers says.
"If you want to say they are the best ever, they need to win a
championship."</TE>
<TE>   That would be nice and an affirmation. But it's not necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Bird and Taurasi have changed the game. Taurasi will change it
more. Bird and Taurasi have shown there are no limits to what female
players can do with the basketball and the inside game. The joy of
basketball is in its inventiveness. The fun is in creativity. The
beauty is in five players creating angles, considering spacing,
finding openings, outwitting five opponents. It takes good guards to
make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Auriemma] said it," Taurasi says. "To have a great team
you have to have great guards that understand the game."</TE>
<TE>   And if you have the greatest team, you need to have the greatest
guards. One more game will tell us if Connecticut has the greatest
team, in addition to the greatest guards.</TE>

<HD>Hard to Tell Which Team Has a Sterling Reputation</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We begin this feel-good story with a depressing reminder to Dodger
supporters just how far their team has fallen: The Clippers have four
more playoff victories than the Dodgers over the last 13 years.</LD>
<LD>   "No way," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "I'd have put everything I got
down on that and would have said the Dodgers had those playoff wins,"
and yes, those were the days--decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   And how about this interesting question: Who has the best chance
to record the next playoff victory--the Dodgers or the Clippers?</LD>
<TE>   Keep in mind the Clippers' season is probably over, one spot
removed from the playoffs, and the Dodgers will be starting fresh
Tuesday, and I'd still take the Clippers to burst into the playoffs
next season before the Dodgers play another meaningful game.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the Clippers are already providing the most
entertainment in town, Darius Miles taking a lofted pass from Jeff
McInnis Saturday night against Utah and doing a behind-his-head slam
that was almost worth the price of admission--except we're talking
about the price of admission to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had never had more than 11 sellouts in a season while
in L.A., but Saturday they were playing in front of their 12th
consecutive sellout crowd--21st of the season--in a game with playoff
implications. It's difficult to think of any bigger turnaround in
sports--other than a three-game winning streak by the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TWO YEARS ago I was standing in the Marina Beach Marriott for the
ho-hum announcement that the Clippers had "settled" for Gentry as
their coach, asking him: "Didn't you have any friends to dissuade you
from committing professional suicide?"</TE>
<TE>   Gentry took over a Donald Sterling disaster (is that redundant?)
that had won 15 games the previous season, ran that victory total to
31 in his first year, and now, without a healthy and exciting Lamar
Odom in the lineup for much of the season, he has still managed to
make the Clippers into a legitimate entertainment option in the
entertainment capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, tight-fisted with the money, provided an incentive
clause in Gentry's contract calling for him to receive a bonus if the
team won 36 games this season. This is known in Clipperland as a "fat
chance and no chance" clause.</TE>
<TE>   Only three times in the last 20 years has a Clipper team posted 36
wins, so Sterling's money seemed safe, but Gentry not only passed the
36-win mark, he now gets an additional cash bonus for each victory
beyond 36.</TE>
<TE>   With extra money on the line, however, it kind of makes you wonder
why the guy was playing Sean Rooks and Doug Overton against the Jazz
in the biggest game of the season, instead of shortening the bench
and playing with the kids who got him this far. The guy who manages
the Dodgers knows better than that. But we'll save that kind of
criticism for next year, when folks will be expecting so much more
from Gentry &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, we'll probably look upon the Dodgers the way we
used to look upon the Clippers, hoping that a loss against the Giants
on opening day won't drop the guys into last place for the rest of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I PAID $284 for four tickets for the wife, two daughters and the
grocery store bagger to go to the Clipper game. Everyone in
attendance received a number--1 through 4--with those holding the
winning number receiving one of 5,000 available Darius Miles
bobblehead dolls. The winning number was 1, the bagger's number, of
course, which means now I have to hope he marries my kid so the doll
stays in the family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT HAS become apparent in the past few weeks that Laker guard
Lindsey Hunter can't shoot, so I was encouraged to see him taking the
court early the other night for some extra work, throwing passes to
Kurt Rambis so Rambis could practice his shooting. I'm pretty sure
Rambis will be ready for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICK HEARN returned to Staples Center Friday night and told
everyone he was happy to see them, "even you," he said, while shaking
my hand. I was touched.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SHAQUILLE O'NEAL planted his size-22 shoe on the ear of fan Jay
Jackson while trying to leap the front row of fans at Staples Center
Friday, and you can forgive my suspicion for thinking this was some
kind of commercial being shot to draw more attention to Shaq's shoes
because Jackson works for his father, Steve, who owns ACI
International, the company that makes Shaq's shoes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE PUBLIC is invited to join Shaq at the new Palm restaurant
across from Staples Center April 12 to raise money for charity. As
part of an auction, Norm Pattiz, chairman of Westwood One and a Laker
fan, will fly two people on his plane to a Laker playoff game. I'd
think this would be something Michael Olowokandi would want to bid
on, because it's the only way any of the Clippers will get to the
playoffs this year. Tickets for the event cost $1,000 for a
couple--which is probably cheaper than a meal for two at Staples.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BASEBALL COMMISSIONER Bud Selig said nine teams made money last
year, while Forbes magazine reported 20. Both agree, however, the
Dodgers are losers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from M. Pitt:</TE>
<TE>   "Your response to that kid you inspired [and who was sent to the
principal's office] was juvenile and irresponsible. I'll never read
you again."</TE>

<HD>A Loss to Germany Points to Major Problems for U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. national team's miserable performance in a 4-2 loss to
Germany Wednesday will have quite a few repercussions in Major League
Soccer in the coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   To begin with, Jovan Kirovski, of Crystal Palace in England,
failed utterly when filling in for injured Columbus Crew striker
Brian McBride. The result is that the forward probably won't be going
to the World Cup in Japan and South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   That means the Chicago Fire can count on losing Josh Wolff for all
of May and half of June. Wolff is a logical off-the-bench choice as
backup to the twin strike force of McBride and Clint Mathis, although
U.S. Coach Bruce Arena also will give Wolff's Fire teammate, Ante
Razov, another look.</LD>
<TE>   Wolff didn't make the trip to Germany and, beforehand, Arena
explained why.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern right now is his health," he said. "If he's healthy,
I think Josh understands where he fits in with this team. But having
said that, we have a number of forwards that I have to make some hard
decisions about."</TE>
<TE>   Wolff, a standout on the U.S. team at the Sydney Olympics, knows
what it will take to secure one of those spots.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done some things to help this team and certainly have put
myself in good position to be there," he said. "I need to continue to
do things for Chicago and, when given the chance, for the national
team."</TE>
<TE>   Wolff scored in Chicago's season-opening victory over the Crew in
Columbus and, if McBride remains sidelined by a turned ankle, could
be teamed with Mathis when the United States plays Mexico in Denver
on Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis and Wolff combined to beat Mexico, 2-0, in a World Cup
qualifier last spring, shortly before both were felled by injuries
that knocked them out for much of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis is almost back in top form. Now, Wolff is at the door, or
at least on the doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rising Fortunes</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, who scored twice against the Germans, was one of only two
U.S. players whose stock rose in Rostock. It is very likely that his
play has caught the eye of a few Bundesliga coaches, and the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars can expect to be asked how many dollars it
will take to lure him to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The other player who held his own in a game to forget was
goalkeeper Kasey Keller. He might be on the bench at Tottenham
Hotspur in England, but there could be Bundesliga clubs inquiring
about him too.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the New England Revolution's Carlos Llamosa and the
Colorado Rapids' Pablo Mastroeni. Neither was chosen to go to
Germany, but after the way the U.S. defense folded, both players look
like much better bets for the World Cup than, say, Steve Cherundolo
of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Cherundolo, who plays for Hannover 96 in the German second
division, was completely out of his depth in what was likely his last
opportunity to make the World Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   But Llamosa brings a calming influence that was painfully absent
against Germany, where U.S. defenders chased around like the
proverbial headless chickens. There were several times when two or
three of them would close on one attacking player and leave another
completely unmarked with Keller at his mercy.</TE>
<TE>   No one on the starting back line was without blame, although D.C.
United's Eddie Pope showed a bit more composure than the
rest--perhaps to make up for being burned by the Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz
at the Rose Bowl a few</TE>
<TE>   days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Height of Absurdity</TE>
<TE>   One weakness in the American game that was exploited several times
by the Germans was the lack of stature of U.S. defensive midfielder
Chris Armas.</TE>
<TE>   Armas, another Fire player, has been the most consistent at his
position of any U.S. field player over the past few years, but
against Germany he was constantly beaten to high balls crossed into
the penalty area and was directly at fault on two German goals.</TE>
<TE>   Armas is 5 feet 7 on a tall day, but is it asking too much of him
to get into the air and at least try to battle larger and stronger
forwards?</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that there is no logical replacement for Armas. Not
this late, anyway. Arena's "solution" has been to have D.C. United's
Richie Williams as the backup, but Williams is generously listed as
5-5 in the U.S. media guide, so the problem gets worse rather than
better.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is about skill, not size, but for a defensive midfielder it
doesn't hurt to have both.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arena Reacts</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's match against Mexico will be the final home game for
the U.S. before the 23-man World Cup team is selected. Arena is using
it to give a few players one last look.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more interesting selections on the 18-man roster he
announced Friday is former Galaxy defender Greg Vanney, who is being
brought in from his French club, Bastia, to see if he can do better
than David Regis in the left back position.</TE>
<TE>   Arena also chose defenders Llamosa and Mastroeni for the squad,
along with Pope, Carlos Bocanegra and Frankie Hejduk, with the latter
still in the running for the right back slot.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the game offers the opportunity to the Earthquakes'
Richard Mulrooney and the Crew's Brian Maisonneuve to show what they
can do in place of Armas, who gets a rest.</TE>
<TE>   If the Germany game did nothing else, it inched the door open
again for MLS players with World Cup aspirations, and that's not a
bad thing.</TE>

<HD>Ethics Are Moving Back to the Forefront</HD>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheaters in high school sports, beware. The tide is turning. Your
protectors are dwindling.</LD>
<LD>   Across the state, men and women of principle are rising up to
challenge those who violate rules.</LD>
<LD>   Coaches who illegally recruit athletes are being fired. Students
who falsify addresses are being declared ineligible. Teams that use
ineligible players are forfeiting games.</LD>
<TE>   Superintendents, principals and athletic directors are feeling
empowered because programs such as Michael Josephson's "Pursuing
Victory With Honor" are inspiring them to take action.</TE>
<TE>   "This is stuff my parents and grandparents tried to teach," said
football Coach Richard Fong of North Hills L.A. Baptist High. "We got
away from it. I'm glad the pendulum may be swinging back."</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section, City Section and Catholic Athletic Assn. are
moving toward imposing a one-year varsity eligibility restriction on
athletes who transfer without moving, a critical component to
convincing parents that their main focus should be on education and
not sports.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer restrictions aren't going to reduce the influence of club
coaches and private coaches determined to steer pupils to programs
they prefer, but it's a step toward restoring a semblance of
integrity to high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   Since 2000, there have been 906 high schools in California that
have signed on to "Pursuing Victory With Honor." It's a program
designed to promote sportsmanship, build character and restore
ethics.</TE>
<TE>   At first, there was skepticism. There's more to teaching
sportsmanship than having T-ball players chant, "Two, four, six,
eight, who do we appreciate."</TE>
<TE>   High school sports participants have already been hardened in
their beliefs through years of experiences--positive and negative.</TE>
<TE>   People with good intentions, though, have used Josephson's
initiative to strengthen their sense of right and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Ambassador Christian, a small private school in
Fontana, dismissed its baseball coaching staff for alleged recruiting
violations. The school's athletic director briefly resigned when he
thought no action would be taken against the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was an ethical question and a matter of doing what was
right," Athletic Director Don McAllister Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   There's an unspoken rule between many administrators and coaches:
Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.</TE>
<TE>   That often causes people to look the other way when questionable
behavior occurs, whether it's repeated use of profanity or a coach
encouraging team members to recruit athletes from other schools.</TE>
<TE>   But Josephson is leading a campaign to apply positive peer
pressure to reverse the tide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a chance to put the cheaters on the run," he said. "I
absolutely see a sea change. It's not nearly complete or reached
every quarter, but the momentum has grown and is building, and it's
right. People want to take sports back."</TE>
<TE>   Interscholastic athletics were never intended to serve solely as a
vehicle for developing elite athletes and big-name coaches.</TE>
<TE>   High schools devote large sums of money and resources to field
teams for the purpose of offering educational experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "How you play the game and how many kids get to play the game is a
central core for education," Josephson said.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes and coaches should aspire to become champions, but
courage needs to be summoned to not let the intoxication of victory
blind those in authority from taking action against cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are fed up and tired of seeing people who don't
follow the rules get away with it," Fong said. "There has to be a
culture to where we agree what's right, what's wrong and have to live
up to it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, which Williams were you pulling for?</LD>
<LD>   Roy, Gary, Venus or Serena?</LD>
<LD>   It was a big week for Williams versus Williams. First, there were
the top-10 tennis sisters, Venus and Serena, teeing it up on a hard
court in Key Biscayne, Fla. A few days later, it was Roy and Gary,
brothers in Final Four frustration, wiping flop sweat from their
brows on the hardwood in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Say this much for college basketball: When its marquee matches a
Williams against a Williams, you can be reasonably assured both
competitors are doing whatever they can not to lose.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Roy, who lost Saturday night to Gary, was probably guilty
of trying too hard to win. Again. With Roy's Kansas Jayhawks trailing
Gary's Maryland Terrapins by 19 points late in the second half of
their NCAA semifinal, CBS' Jim Nantz and Billy Packer began
discussing Roy's ongoing search for the right way to prepare a team
to go 2-0 at the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   Nantz: "I think Coach has really grappled with exactly how [his
team is] supposed to handle all of this."</TE>
<TE>   Packer: "You know what the problem is, Jim. [It's] when you think
so much about that. There is no formula. You've seen everything. Hey,
Al McGuire's Final Four here, he never was even around his team. You
say, 'Oh, that's the formula that works.'</TE>
<TE>   "I just think you have to do what you're comfortable with.
Eventually that night will come, if it's in the cards for you to win
a national championship."</TE>
<TE>   So Roy went out again, 97-88, leaving him 0 for 3 in trips to the
Final Four in 14 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   And in the same arena a few hours earlier, Indiana's Mike Davis
reached the national title game in his first trip to the Final Four
in his second season as Hoosier coach.</TE>
<TE>   College basketball in March may be mad, but no one ever said it
was fair.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, if you take a closer look at Roy Williams' latest
stopover at the Final Four, you will find him to be a very lucky man.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have to sit through four hours on "Final Four Friday"
listening to Dick Vitale narrate practice. Yes, for those scoring at
home, the decision-makers at ESPN have lost it. Reduced to a
wallflower while watching CBS run off with the Big Dance, ESPN, so
desperate for a piece of anything stamped with the Final Four brand,
devoted four hours of its ESPN2 broadcasting schedule Friday to bring
you--live!--the pre-semifinal practice sessions of Indiana, Oklahoma,
Kansas and Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "The Terps! The Terps! Here they come! The Terps are here!" Vitale
shrieked as Maryland's players jogged onto the floor of the Georgia
Dome for their hour's worth of free throws and layup drills.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours of players in colored practice bibs.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours of players with hands on their hips.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours of Vitale unfettered but not unplugged, with not only
the proper credential but also express instructions to fill it up, to
keep it coming, to go end to end, coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   My MVP for Final Four Friday?</TE>
<TE>   My remote control.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was a cruel experiment: Turn Vitale loose for four
straight hours, just to see what happens, to see--longshot hope
here--that he might eventually run out of things to say.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Vitale couldn't talk basketball for four straight
hours. But Vitale on baseball? Well why hadn't anyone thought of that
before?</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's practice was starting to drag a little, so Vitale and
Digger Phelps started talking about the upcoming Devil Ray- Tiger
season opener--don't ask--before Vitale caught a glimpse of a graphic
plugging ESPN2's telecast of the Angel-Indian opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I know one thing!" Vitale shrieked. "The Indians made a major
mistake getting rid of Alomar! Didn't sign Juan Gonzalez! Burba's
gone to Texas! Are you KIDDING ME?!?"</TE>
<TE>   Vitale then informed us all, "I love baseball," yet another reason
why football has overtaken the grand old game as the national
pastime.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of baseball talk, Vitale and crew sent it over to sideline
reporter Andy Katz, who collared Jim Harrick for a discussion about
great moments in the history of Final Four Friday. Three days before
Harrick's UCLA Bruins won the title in 1995, Oklahoma State's Bryant
Reeves brought down the backboard with a monstrous dunk during a
practice session at the Kingdome.</TE>
<TE>   Katz asked Harrick for his personal recollection of that one
shining moment. Harrick said he had only seen clips of it.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness, then, for Final Four Saturday, which featured
actual games to televise and talk about. Did those four practice
sessions yield anything of educational importance? Well, you'll
notice very few CBS and ESPN talking heads had any clue about this
one: Indiana 73, Oklahoma 64.</TE>
<TE>   Big upset, that one. Surpassed only by Nantz breaking away from
CBS' pro-Bob Knight policy by noting that, "Bob Knight had a huge
hand in a lot of these kids coming to Indiana and they, according to
Indiana officials, have not heard from him on this run to the Final
Four. Not a congratulatory call or anything. And I find that
regrettable."</TE>
<TE>   Knight must have been too busy. He had four hours of basketball
practice to watch.</TE>

<HD>Serena a Real Trail Blazer</HD>
<DH>Tennis: At her best when behind, Williams saves seven set
points and outlasts Capriati, 7-5, 7-6 (4), for her first Key
Biscayne title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Serena Williams trailed in the first set, and again in the second,
and once more in the tiebreaker, confronting seven set points along
the way.</LD>
<LD>   Yet at the end it was Williams hopping to the net with glee, index
finger aloft.</LD>
<LD>   She's not No. 1, but she beat No. 1 on Saturday, rallying
repeatedly to edge Jennifer Capriati, 7-5, 7-6 (4), for the
Nasdaq-100 Open championship.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, seeded eighth, won her first Key Biscayne title by
beating the world's top three players in consecutive matches. She
eliminated No. 3 Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals, then advanced
to the final with a breakthrough victory over her older sister,
three-time champion Venus Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I had beaten Venus, I felt it was my duty to take this
title, because Venus would have taken it herself, I believe,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati has never won a tournament in her native state, and for
the second consecutive year at Key Biscayne, she could only lament
missed opportunities. Last year she failed to convert eight match
points and lost in the final to Venus Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little disappointing," Capriati said. "I feel like I was
kind of ahead and pretty much in control the whole match."</TE>
<TE>   Her consolation was a $200,000 check. Williams received $385,000.</TE>
<TE>   On the men's side, Andre Agassi bids for his fifth Key Biscayne
title today against 20-year-old Roger Federer of Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati and Williams engaged in two hours of high-risk tennis,
producing moments of brilliance among a flurry of errors. Capriati
had 38, Williams 59.</TE>
<TE>   "How many errors did I make--59?" Williams said. "That is
unbelievable. That's way too high. That's sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   Many of her mistakes came on easy potential putaways as she moved
toward the net.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the hardest part about playing her--you just never know
what's going to happen," Capriati said. "It's a little difficult to
get a rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati's biggest problem was a tentative second serve. Williams
feasted on it, and five times Capriati double-faulted, each coming at
a critical moment.</TE>
<TE>   But while the play was erratic, the slugfest was always close, and
Capriati was usually ahead. She led, 5-4, in the first set, 5-3 in
the second and 3-1 in the tiebreaker. She had two set points at 5-3
in the second set, and five more serving at 6-5, but Williams won
them all.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it could have been me who won in two sets, you know?"
Capriati said. "But it's not like I gave it away. She really earned
it."</TE>
<TE>   Williams erased the first two set points with service winners,
overcame two more with thunderous strokes from the baseline and
solved the fifth with an overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati double-faulted into the net to squander a sixth set-point
chance, sailed a lob long on set point No. 7, and Williams then
closed a 22-point game with an overhead to reach 6-6. Capriati let
the tiebreaker slip away by committing errors on five of the final
seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing, Capriati will retain the No. 1 ranking until at
least April 15, ahead of No. 2 Venus Williams. Serena Williams will
go from ninth to seventh next week.</TE>

<DH>Women's basketball: Tonight's NCAA final will produce a
team for the ages, Connecticut, or an upset for the ages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Something historic will happen here tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The undefeated Connecticut Huskies will pounce on Oklahoma as if
it were a favorite rawhide chew toy, drag it around for 40 minutes
and toss it in the pile with their other 38 victims this season.
Then, having won the NCAA tournament, the Huskies will be proclaimed
one of the best women's basketball teams ever, maybe the best.</LD>
<LD>   Or, the Sooners, who have won 32 of 35 games and battled through
the toughest conference in the country--the Big 12--to get here, will
pull off one of the biggest upsets the women's game has seen.</LD>
<TE>   Few give the second scenario a chance.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the Huskies have already beaten the Sooners this
season, although the game was closer than the 86-72 score would
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, though, is that Connecticut, which embarrassed
Tennessee, 79-56, in a semifinal game Friday, seems to play a game
this season that no one else is familiar with.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that complicated," Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said.
"The cliche is we have really good players. But there's a lot of
really good players out there playing college basketball. We have a
unique group of kids whose talents mesh together really well."</TE>
<TE>   That's what makes the task facing Oklahoma, which defeated Duke,
86-71, Friday, so daunting.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do the Huskies pass with precision and defend with
passion, they also understand the place in history that awaits them.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma grew wistful Saturday talking about his decorated
seniors, Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams. That
group has won a national championship, appeared in three Final Fours
and has a 135-9 record in four years at Connecticut. Each has scored
at least 1,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Their first practice I left the gym," Auriemma said. "I'm going,
'Here are five of the top 15 [high school] players in America and
they stink.' And that first week of practice they couldn't do
anything right compared to the kids we already had. They looked
awful.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go out there today [for their last practice], the first 40
minutes I won't have to say a word, and we'll get more done in that
40 minutes than they got done in their first week. That's the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut averages 87.2 points and has won its games by an
average of 36.1. Every starter, including brilliant sophomore Diana
Taurasi, score in double figures but no one is averaging 15 points or
more.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have tried to get them in foul trouble, played them
physically, tried a cerebral approach.</TE>
<TE>   So far, nothing has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no secrets," Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale said of the
Huskies. "It's not like you have to unlock a code.</TE>
<TE>   "Geno will tell you what he's going to do. 'We're going to go to
the right, set a screen, [a player's] going to come off it, now guard
it.' It's up to you to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take the floor, you have to make sure the [Connecticut]
mystique doesn't beat you. Make the players beat you."</TE>
<TE>   Coale has some ideas, such as using four guards--Stacey Dales,
LaNeishea Caufield, Rosalind Ross and Dionnah Jackson--to either
disrupt the Bird-Taurasi tandem or try to create matchup problems for
Cash, Jones and Williams.</TE>
<TE>   But other things have to happen, according to her players.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about the guard play," Oklahoma forward Caton Hill
said. "But me and Jamie [Talbert] have a huge responsibility to
rebound. If the other players are doing their jobs but [Connecticut]
keeps getting second shots, it's demoralizing."</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies have to guard against complacency. The fact they've
never beaten Connecticut doesn't make the Sooners less dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has averaged 80 points in the tournament, so it can keep
up with the Huskies on the scoreboard. On a given night, Dales and
Caufield might equal Bird and Taurasi.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing against them the first time," said Connecticut's
Williams, "Stacey threw the most awesome pass I've ever seen and it
was against me.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that she got behind me or Swin; she knew exactly how to
thread the needle. I call her Pistol Pete."</TE>
<TE>   With six seniors, Oklahoma is a veteran team that shouldn't panic
if Connecticut bolts to a big early lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've learned how to overcome in a big game if Stacey
doesn't have her 'A' game," Auriemma said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so well balanced, so confident in each other and their
abilities. They play loosey-goosey, carefree basketball. I don't
think they're affected by much; that's why they are here."</TE>

<HD>Slate Mailers Need Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Politicians have embraced slate mailers for decades because the mass
mailings are effective. The ubiquitous mailers that spotlight four or
more candidates or issues usually appear in voters' mailboxes with
little fanfare. But what happened in one Orange County race this
month should prompt state election officials to keep an eye out for
potential abuses that eventually might require new restrictions on
what in effect are campaign contributions.</LD>
<LD>   Mailers made news when Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad alleged that
victorious opponent Chris Norby got an illegal boost from a flurry of
mailings. The supervisor argues that the mailings were subsidized by
supporters of Measure W, the successful initiative that rezoned the
El Toro Marine base for a park. Norby has friends in the anti-airport
camp, but his campaign managers are adamant that he paid fair-market
value for space in the mailers.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy turns on how the contested mailers were funded.
Those who've studied the content of the mailers say the pieces
probably fit the letter, if not the spirit, of state and county
election law. However, they suspect that a significant new loophole
has appeared in Orange County's political contributions limits.</LD>
<TE>   Mailers are produced by political consultants who generate profits
by collecting fees from candidates and ballot issue groups.
Candidates can spend as much money as they want on mailers.
Organizations also are free to make donations to mailers, but, unlike
political contributions, donations for mailers aren't subject to
Orange County's contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no legal requirement to disclose exactly how
mailers are financed, it is difficult to determine whether Norby
received what's tantamount to an unreported campaign donation.</TE>
<TE>   If a group with deep pockets did find a loophole, other
politicians in Orange County will quickly connect the dots and
regulators will be hard-pressed to determine whether candidates are
skirting donation limits by encouraging cash-flush supporters to make
donations to friendly mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign reform is like an amoeba: Push in at one point and a
corresponding bulge is likely to appear somewhere else. The Norby
case provides food for thought: The state may have to eventually
require disclosure on who donated, restrict organizations' donations
to slate mailers or, perhaps, force mailers to publish--and stick
to--rate cards.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Free speech is a constitutional right. But the South Orange County
Community College District has an unfortunate history of trying to
limit how, where and when students can speak.</LD>
<LD>   The district that operates Irvine Valley College and Saddleback
College in effect wants students to raise their hands and ask to be
recognized before speaking in settings outside the classroom on
campus. A court this month struck down four provisions in the
recently modified district policy governing when and where students
can gather, the use of public address systems and access to buildings
on campus.</LD>
<LD>   The district knows it is heading down the wrong path because it
now has lost two court challenges. The most recent rejection came
March 18 when U.S. District Judge Audrey B. Collins sided with
students who went to court to challenge district restrictions.
Collins in 1999 sank another version of the policy because it wrongly
limited the "time, place and manner of speech." The district also
withdrew its policy on two other occasions before a judge could rule.</LD>
<TE>   The district also has had its knuckles rapped for trying to rein
in free speech by faculty members. Irvine Valley College professor
Roy Bauer in August won another round in a long-running court fight
sparked by a faculty newsletter that takes district officials to
task. The court ruled that district officials acted
unconstitutionally by reprimanding Bauer for the content in his
newsletters.</TE>
<TE>   Pourya Khademi, one of the students who filed the most recent
lawsuit, knows firsthand the dangers of heavy-handed regulation. As a
child in Iran, Khademi saw his parents jailed for reading a banned
newspaper. Khademi's attorney complains that the board keeps banging
its head against the constitutional right to free speech because it
is "either getting bad advice [from its lawyers] or else the advice
they want." But the board should understand instinctively the value
of spirited debate in an academic community.</TE>
<TE>   The district maintains it simply wants to protect students from
unnecessary noise, reduce litter and ensure that college lawns and
parking lots are well-maintained. Those are logical goals for
administrators, but universities have an obligation to balance
important real-world concerns against the overriding right to free
speech.</TE>
<TE>   At least, that's what students are being taught during
introductory political science classes at Irvine Valley College.
"Politics in America," the approved textbook sold at the college
bookstore, underscores that "universities have a very special
responsibility to protect freedom of expression.... A free and
unfettered exchange of views is essential to the advancement of
knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The district should go back to school and practice what it
teaches.</TE>

<HD>End the Tustin Base Dispute</HD>

<LD>The city of Tustin and the Santa Ana Unified School District must
find a way to resolve their continuing differences over land the
district would get at the closed Tustin Marine base to build schools.</LD>
<LD>   This is an ugly controversy that has gone on long enough. Earlier
concerns about the exclusion of the district from a share of
available base real estate gave way to alarm about potential
contamination of land the district might get, and whether an
alternative that would have Tustin giving the district money to buy
school land elsewhere would provide sufficient funds.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, there is litigation on several fronts: a lawsuit filed
by the city to win judicial approval for a homeless housing project,
and one filed by the district over Tustin's failure to release
acreage in accordance with a state law signed by the governor. There
is also a federal suit filed by the district charging a civil rights
violation.</LD>
<TE>   There is an important principle here that must be affirmed. Since
land is going to neighboring school districts and for community
colleges, an agreeable way must be found to accommodate Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   All parties should see the continuing controversy at nearby El
Toro, and the Navy Department's announcement that it will put the
larger base up for bid, as signs of urgency after years of conflict
over what will become of closed military bases. The federal
government, previously inclined to defer to the proposals of local
redevelopment authorities, now grows increasingly impatient with
local disputes, and it wants to unload surplus properties. It may not
be patient indefinitely with the Tustin situation.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials came to the area recently and supported the city,
after previously giving it an ultimatum to reach agreement with
various educational districts wanting a piece of the base. The Navy
approved giving much of the base to Tustin, and kept some land to
sell. But Santa Ana Unified has a state law in its corner requiring
Tustin to give it 100 acres before the city can get on with other
development, and if the dispute drags on, who knows what will happen?
Because the federal government holds all the cards in base closures,
both the city and the district would be best advised not to defer
resolution any longer. At the very least, this debate can drag on and
waste valuable time working its way through the courts.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that El Toro was the troubled base closing, and
Tustin appeared to be on track with a plan. But now Tustin's dispute
with the Santa Ana district has dragged out and become a significant
obstacle.What's happened is that the city and the district have
become embroiled in a test of wills. The problem seems to originate
at least in part with the city's revision of its 1994 redevelopment
plan, which derailed the allocation of land to five school districts,
including Santa Ana Unified. The city was concerned that it would not
be able to pay for redevelopment if so much went to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   But the result of that decision seems to have led to the
disenfranchisement of that needy district, even as others were
getting something from the reuse plan. The new plan gave land to the
Tustin and Irvine school districts, as well as to the South Orange
County Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Rancho Santiago Community College District came to
terms to get 15 acres. There is a hearing scheduled for late May on a
lawsuit filed by Santa Ana Unified over the land the Legislature had
authorized it to get. Meanwhile, in yet another lawsuit, the district
has filed federal litigation charging that Tustin's plan violates the
civil rights of minority students.</TE>
<TE>   The city and district both need to reassess positions that
increasingly have hardened. To avoid the endless cycle of litigation,
get the parties working together for an agreement all can be proud
of.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Camp Pendleton contains a major commuting and recreational bike route
between Orange County and San Diego County. The route has been closed
to bikes since Sept. 11, and the Marines are saying, "Now is not the
time to have droves of bicyclists on the base."</LD>
<LD>   In general, bicyclists are ardent supporters of the war on terror,
and they help decrease congestion and our dependence on foreign oil.
Maybe it's exactly the time to have droves of bicyclists.</LD>
<LD>   If the usual few bicyclists are an inconvenience to the Marines,
the Marines can close the base to the cyclists, as they've done. But
the Marines should do their best to shorten the closure and minimize
the impact. Hurting supportive Americans without a good reason is not
the best way to fight terror.</LD>

<LD>Re "Vietnamese Voters Fault Sample Ballot," March 21:</LD>
<LD>   May I offer a simple solution to Chuyen V. Nguyen and his
organization's complaints about the translation problems with
ballots? Learn English. That is the primary language of this country.</LD>
<LD>   It is really appalling that California prints ballots in at least
six languages. When the European wave of immigrants flooded our
shores in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, immigrants learned
the language of their new home. Recent immigrants seem to think that
we are to learn their language and accommodate them. As I understand
it, in order to become a citizen, one must have a basic understanding
of our Constitution and take the oath of citizenship in English.</LD>
<TE>   I am unaware of any other country that bends over so far backward
as the U.S. in dealing with new citizens. It should be incumbent upon
newly arrived immigrants to learn English.</TE>

<LD>   It is my understanding that if the land outside the school
district's boundaries is, in fact, contaminated, a school will not be
built on the soil. A homeless shelter would be erected at this
location instead.</LD>
<LD>   The health of those without homes in our society is as important
as the health of those with homes. Our world is corrupt enough, and
when we pawn off contaminated land to the less fortunate, we taint
the American idea of equality.</LD>
<TE>   It is a shame to think that the people who make these decisions
value one set of humans over another. It makes me question the
American policy that we are so proud of--equality for all.</TE>

<LD>Re "Retirees' Pet Rule Unleashes Rebels," March 17:</LD>
<LD>   The recent article about the conflict between residents and the
powers-that-be at Leisure World Seal Beach could lead readers to
believe the same rule applies at Leisure World Laguna Woods. Quite
the opposite is true.</LD>
<LD>   Our dog lovers are a very happy lot. One can observe residents
walking dogs of all sizes at any time of the day and evening. We have
a popular dog club that meets monthly to share experiences or listen
to a knowledgeable speaker. I suggest that mistreated dog lovers join
us.</LD>

<TE>   Leisure World, for the most part, is a peaceful, happy community
where people look out for their neighbors and feel safe to go out for
a walk at 9 p.m. When the law was changed to allow pets, rules were
put into effect for the safety and comfort of all 8,400 people. Now
we have 40 dogs here, and we are expected to change the rules to
please some of the owners of those 40 dogs.</TE>
<TE>   It is suggested in your last article that we should all vote on
every change that comes from the board. If that should happen,
nothing would get done. There would be constant bickering and
infighting. Every dissenter would want to get into the act, and those
who have access to someone who writes for The Times or any other
paper would ensure that only the negative is printed.</TE>

<LD>Re "County Still Has Plenty of Airport Fight Left in It, Smith Says,"
March 20:</LD>
<LD>   As a longtime resident of South County, I am continually amazed by
the head-in-the-sand attitude of the pro-airport supervisors. Two
election votes against an airport at El Toro, and Supervisor Chuck
Smith still won't let it go the way of the Edsel.</LD>
<LD>   It's understandable that there's more support in North County for
an airport because it does not impact their quality of life, property
values, etc. South County, on the other hand, realized how bad this
idea was and was willing to fight it with money out of our own
pockets. North County did not see fit to [fight it with money], with
the exception of George Argyros and all his millions.</LD>
<TE>   Those of us who will be around in 20 years can enjoy the fact that
we stood up for our rights and voted against the El Toro airport, a
bad idea that never was cleared for takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   G. Ray</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since Chuck Smith seemed to be in such a chuckling mood when he
sat down with Dana Parsons to talk about the El Toro airport, I only
hope he laughed as loud as we all did when he said the outcome of
Measure W was determined by "a few very passionate people with a lot
of money." Substitute "greedy developers" for "passionate people" and
you have a perfect description of the road leading to the proposed
airport at El Toro. A few greedy developers (George Argyros and
friends) freely handed out their money to clueless supervisors (Chuck
Smith, Jim Silva and Cynthia P. Coad) and, in every conceivable way,
tried to ram an airport down the throats of the citizens of Orange
County. Although I know that Argyros is busily learning Spanish in
Madrid, don't be surprised if he again throws the weight of his
millions into the new legal battle to toss out Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Smith laughs and says that in 20 years he "won't care" whether an
airport is built at El Toro. The happy supervisor should know that in
five, 10, 15 or 20 years, there will still be "passionate people"
who, with or without a lot of money, care about the quality of life
in Orange County.</TE>

<LD>My daughter is a registered nurse with the biomedical services branch

<LD>   The biomedical services branch collects blood for lifesaving
transfusions; the chapter services branch collects monetary donations
for disaster relief and other humanitarian services. Although we
agree that chapter services needs restructuring, the negative
publicity has caused a significant decrease in blood donations.</LD>
<LD>   Professionals like my daughter, who could be earning a much larger

impact: Blood donors stay home, and patients suffer.</LD>

<LD>Re "OCTA to Pay Tollway for Right to Add Freeway Lanes," March 12:</LD>
<LD>   Having to pay tollway operators $40,000 a year for the right to
make freeway improvements is unfortunate, but I wonder what it would
cost us to improve the Laguna Freeway between the San Diego Freeway
and the San Joaquin Hills toll road. The Laguna Freeway is one of
California's 10 most dangerous roads, and its improvement would
certainly save lives.</LD>
<LD>   This proposal is already on the books, and even environmentalists
are supportive since realigning the highway would reunite two small,
natural lakes. But this would siphon off many paying customers, so I
suspect tollway accountants would demand an extremely high
compensation price. That would be a shame, pitting the interests of
toll-road bondholders against lives saved from a safer highway.</LD>

<TE>   How can we continue to permit OCTA to be held up? It is certainly
highway robbery when the authority must pay $40,000 a year for the
right to improve the San Diego Freeway--immediately after agreeing to
pay $4 million to add a 1,000-yard westbound access lane on the
Riverside Freeway. When will taxpayers be forced to pay Federal
Express for the right to improve the Postal Service?</TE>

<LD>Re "Soto Urges Anaheim to Restore the Trust of Latino Residents,"
March 21:</LD>
<LD>   As a disillusioned and nonpracticing Catholic, I am livid that the
church once again is sticking its nose into affairs of the state and
federal governments. Rather than trying to change the laws of our
country, perhaps Bishop [Jaime] Soto should encourage others to obey
the laws of our country.</LD>
<LD>   Americans are sick and tired of importing more people who cause
the American taxpayer to foot the bills for education and medical
treatment. There is absolutely no incentive for these countries to
improve conditions and educate their own people if America continues
to do the job for them.</LD>

<LD>Re "2 Girls Killed When Car Jumps Curb at O.C. School," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   In all the letters and articles that I've seen since the tragic
death of two schoolgirls at Centralia Elementary School, there's been
no mention of school populations.</LD>
<LD>   Most Anaheim elementary schools were built to hold 650 students,
yet more than double that number now attend at each site. For many
years, "Notice of Severe Overcrowding" signs were posted in school
offices because Anaheim didn't build a new school in over 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   As a parent and a homeowner in Anaheim, I was thrilled to see the
passage of elementary and high school district bond issues on March
5. I hope that some of the money will help alleviate the tremendous
crowds at our schools and, perhaps, more traffic tragedies can be
averted.</TE>

<LD>Re "Development Would at Least Bring High School," Letters, March 24:</LD>
<LD>   Frank Weirath's comments on negotiations between the Capistrano
Unified School District and the Capistrano Unified Education Assn.
left out a significant fact. During the 2000-01 school year, the
board of trustees granted teachers a 13% raise in addition to the
automatic 2% hike teachers receive for each year of service.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's settlement was the highest salary increase granted to
teachers in any of Orange County's 28 school districts. Trustees were
happy to grant such an increase because it demonstrates the respect
the district has for teachers.</LD>
<TE>   We are asking our teachers to understand that times are different.
The economy is not what it was a year ago. We are asking that
teachers bear with us and have more reasonable expectations in this
time of great fiscal challenge.</TE>

<HD>End District's Secondary Water Treatment Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Water District, City Oppose Sewage Waiver," March 14:</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District has a waiver allowing it to
avoid full secondary treatment of 240 million gallons per day of
waste water. All other districts its size have given up the waiver
and gone to full secondary treatment. Secondary treatment removes 90%
or more of live bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. Dumping this
filth into the ocean does not make sense, given our large, growing
population.</LD>
<LD>   AB 1892 would allow diversion of urban runoff into the outfall
without full secondary treatment. But first, AB 1969 must be passed,
forcing the Sanitation District to give up its waiver and fully treat
sewage to at least the secondary level, the bare minimum of every
other discharger its size.</LD>
<TE>   The conditions under which the waiver was granted included no harm
to fisheries, recreation or habitat. We now have evidence that there
is bacterial contamination that leads to beach closures.</TE>
<TE>   Please support AB 1969 so the district will be forced to give up
its waiver and move to full secondary treatment.</TE>

<LD>Re "District Is Muzzling Free Speech, Judge Rules," March 19:</LD>
<LD>   Your article about the South Orange County Community College
District Speech and Advocacy Policy neglected certain basic facts.
Irvine Valley College and Saddleback College have the most liberal
speech policy of any Orange County community college. The policy is
far more permissive than those at UC Irvine and Cal State campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The district policy does not infringe on free speech. Like all
college speech policies, it establishes parameters to ensure a proper
learning environment, avoid chaos and violence and ensure that
individual rights are not infringed.</LD>
<TE>   The policy was written in part to respond to some
faculty-sponsored activities that were disruptive or
life-threatening. One event called for students to smash a car with a
sledgehammer as a "blow" against the administration. Students were
hospitalized as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Another protest activity involved amplified music playing all day
outside classrooms. That's why the speech policy included a
limitation on music amplification during class time.</TE>
<TE>   Some faculty newsletters attack ethnic background, integrity,
families, religion and the gender orientation of district employees.
Such activity encourages workplace violence and creates a hostile
work environment. However, the district policy permits such "free
speech."</TE>

I commend Raghu Mathur for four years of superb service to the

<TE>   The Times' article failed to mention that, in the past, rebel
faculty members and a small number of students have tried to make our
campus a war zone by using hate literature, ear-splitting music
outside classrooms, threats and insults, as well as attacks on
teachers who are simply trying to do their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how to establish a speech policy responding to this
case. What I do know is that Mathur always did everything possible to
make peace on campus and to establish a calm, harmonious climate. The
students and teachers who have fought him only seem to want chaos and
hatred.</TE>

restraint, despite claiming to be fiscally conservative. Costs to

<HD>El Toro Decision Was Only the Beginning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As executive director of the El Toro Local Redevelopment Authority, I
would like to respond to your editorial of March 24 headlined "New
Leadership for El Toro."</LD>
<LD>   This is a pivotal time for the El Toro reuse process. In just 30
days we have seen three significant events.</LD>
<LD>   First, passage of Measure W by a 57% margin. Second, the Navy
proposal to sell the base to the highest bidder. Third, the
possibility that the Marines may come back.</LD>
<TE>   The concept of allowing the Marine Corps to return and use base
assets for training purposes may have some merit. Our nation is at
war. And if there is one thing we all can probably agree upon it is
that enhancing the military readiness of our nation is a priority.</TE>
<TE>   After years of divisive debate, all parties are starting to come
together. Immediately after the passage of Measure W, Supervisor
Chuck Smith (pro-airport) and Supervisor Tom Wilson (anti-airport)
jointly toured a number of closed military bases in Northern
California. And they will be traveling to Washington next week for
talks at the Pentagon. Last week, the LRA and the El Toro Reuse
Planning Authority met to discuss common goals. Planners from the
city of Irvine and the county met to discuss the impacts of Measure
W. The point is, pro-airport and anti-airport leaders and staff are
communicating and working together. These are remarkable and
encouraging steps forward. The necessary bridges are beginning to be
built. I hope this trend continues.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake, there is a long road ahead, and there are
important policy decisions to be made by the Board of Supervisors in
the weeks to come. These decisions include moving ahead with the
planning process as defined by Measure W in a manner that includes
all stakeholders; continuing current base operations given the
operating losses; considering the possible annexation of the base by
Irvine; and holding the federal government responsible for the
environmental cleanup of the site.</TE>
<TE>   The current LRA team of staff and consultants has an extraordinary
bank of knowledge to draw upon. We have been working on this project
for eight years, and the intellectual investment is immeasurable.</TE>
<TE>   The LRA team has performed extraordinarily well under what
everyone agrees have been very difficult and challenging
circumstances. Yes, we embraced and pushed forward the former
aviation reuse plan because we were directed to do so by the board.
It is important to keep in mind that the Board of Supervisors make
policy--and county staff and consultants then implement that policy.
The lines often get blurred, especially when it comes to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   With the passage of Measure W, the voters have spoken. The demand
for air travel in our county and region will not go away, and other
aviation capacity solutions must be found, but Measure W is now the
law of the land. It has always been our goal to develop a reuse plan
for El Toro that meets the needs of all Orange County citizens--and
that remains our mission today.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Lawsuit Targets El Toro Use Vote," March 19:</TE>
<TE>   So the pro-El Toro airport crowd is filing a lawsuit against the
public's will again. No surprise. Since they haven't won an election
on the issue since 1996, they really have no other recourse. They
claim that since no North County cities had a majority of voters
support Measure W, those voters were obviously supporting the
county's unneeded, unwanted airport plan. A stretch at best.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas K. Blaul</TE>
<TE>   Trabuco Canyon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In explaining his decision to spend the taxpayers' money in a
lawsuit to invalidate Measure W, Garden Grove City Councilman Mark
Rosen said "my city voted over 60% against Measure W, so I think
residents perceive the importance of an airport." On March 5, only
28% of Garden Grove voters voted. Less than 17% of registered voters
voted against Measure W, while 11% voted in favor. Similar results
can be found in other cities joining this lawsuit. Rosen is
obligating his city to spend perhaps several hundred thousand dollars
of its money to upend the will of the county as a whole and in
support of just 17% of its own voters. That hardly seems like the
sort of mandate required for such a financial commitment.</TE>
<TE>   If the citizens of Garden Grove had felt as passionate about an
airport at El Toro as Rosen seems to, they would have turned out at
the polls.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Like 'Jaws,' El Toro Kept O.C.'s Other Issues Out of the
Water," March 11:</TE>
<TE>   Your "news analysis" of El Toro's impact on county politics would
have had much more credibility if you had chosen to highlight the
views of individuals who had some expertise in regional affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But to build your story around the suspect opinions of Costa
Mesa's ex-city councilman Peter Buffa and Costa Mesa's ex-mayor
Sandra Genis undermines the seriousness of your subject.</TE>
<TE>   Next time you want to analyze the politics of Orange County,
assign the task to someone with more than a passing knowledge of
local affairs and recent history, someone who won't be sucked into
the orbit of egregious and embarrassing grandstanders.</TE>

<HD>Term Limits Keep Competition Alive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. PITNEY JR.</AU>
<BD>John J. Pitney Jr. is professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics of California's term limits have made persuasive arguments.
Because no member can stay long enough to develop genuine expertise,
they say, the state Legislature suffers from unseasoned lawmakers and
short institutional memory. Political turmoil is constant, for as
soon as one legislative leader takes the helm, would-be successors
are already elbowing to get next in line.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the citizen legislators that term-limit proponents had
promised, we have ambitious politicians who see service in one
chamber mainly as a path to election in the other, or to higher
office.</LD>
<LD>   But for all their shortcomings, we still need term limits. Without
them, races for the Legislature would feature only slightly more
competition than elections for the Supreme People's Assembly of North
Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Consider the circumstances. In the latest round of redistricting,
legislators essentially guaranteed each party a certain share of
seats, locking in Democratic majorities of 50-30 in the Assembly and
26-14 in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats might have tried to extend their majorities even
further, but such a maneuver would have created a number of districts
where Democratic margins were fairly narrow. Instead, they
consolidated their gains, redrawing boundaries to add more Democrats
to their weaker districts.</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, the good news was that the remaining districts
were safer for their party. The bad news was that they would have
little chance of gaining any more seats. For voters, there will be no
suspense in November because few if any seats will change partisan
hands.</TE>
<TE>   If there is going to be any competition under these district
lines, it will take place not in the general election but in the
party primaries. Here is where term limits are crucial, since
incumbents have an overwhelming edge in primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 49 Assembly members who sought renomination in the 2002
primaries, 46 ran unopposed. (That figure includes Tom Harman
[R-Huntington Beach] and Lynn Daucher [R-Brea], whose primary
victories two years ago were controversial in Orange County GOP
circles.) Of the remaining three, two had only token opposition and
won with more than 85%. Only one, Republican Phil Wyman, went down to
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Even more striking are the numbers for the 20 Senate seats up for
election this year. (California senators serve staggered four-year
terms.) Of the 13 senators who sought reelection, including Joe Dunn
(D-Garden Grove), not one had any primary opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, there were open seats without primary contests. In the
71st District, for instance, Supervisor Todd Spitzer was unopposed
for the GOP nomination and thus near-certain election in the fall.
But to the extent that there was competition, it nearly all took
place in open seats.</TE>
<TE>   If not for term limits, there would be far fewer open seats. Some
long-serving members eventually might face challenges from younger
politicians tired of waiting their turn, but most incumbents would
remain unopposed. The advantages of incumbency are so daunting that
potential challengers reckon that resistance is futile. Thousands of
years ago, the Chinese warrior Sun Tzu grasped the point: "To subdue
the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill."</TE>
<TE>   Several historical developments have contributed to the power of
incumbency. The first was the professionalization of the Legislature
in the 1960s. The rationale was that full-time lawmakers with strong
staff support could better deliberate on the merits of public policy.
But they were also better equipped to burnish their own images and
use public spending to build political support.</TE>
<TE>   The second was population growth. In the decades after World War
II, California gained millions of people, but the size of each
legislative chamber remained constant. A single state Senate district
now has 847,000 souls, which is greater than the population of South
Dakota. In such large constituencies, which often cross city and
county lines, just about the only local figure with any significant
name identification is the incumbent. Challengers can sometimes build
up their own names, but only if they can match the incumbent's
campaign spending.</TE>
<TE>   And that brings us to the third source of incumbency power. It
takes large sums of money to run in such large districts. Thanks to
campaign finance "reforms" such as California's Proposition 34,
amassing such sums requires complex fund-raising operations under the
management of professional consultants. Who has the most access to
this expertise? The incumbents, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits are a clumsy answer to this problem, but at very least
they give primary voters an occasional chance to cast a meaningful
ballot. A few weeks ago, voters rejected a deeply cynical ballot
proposition that aimed to undermine term limits. If they value even a
tiny bit of competition, they need to guard against such efforts in
the future.</TE>

<HD>Unity on El Toro Now Key</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD SPITZER</AU>
<BD>Todd Spitzer represents the 3rd District on the Orange
County Board of Supervisors.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Progress? Maybe. Hopefully. Within six hours of our election results
being declared in the wee hours of March 6, the Navy released a
statement promising to honor Measure W's new non-aviation zoning
requirements but declaring its new intent to begin a sale of the
base.</LD>
<LD>   This action has provided a sense of urgency to resolve our local
conflicts or suffer a disposal process that bypasses our normal
decision-making authority. If we fail to work together as a county
now that Measure W is law, if the county turns its back on its
land-use oversight responsibility, if we hold hidden agendas to
continue to fight for an aviation use in spite of Measure W, then we
risk allowing the Navy to dispose of parcels of the base in an
irresponsible manner that could cost the county taxpayer for years to
come.</LD>
<LD>   To avoid this outcome, the Board of Supervisors, in its role as
the federally designated Local Reuse Authority (LRA), must focus on
three major policy objectives.</LD>
<TE>   First, we must protect the county general fund. Since the passage
of Measure A in 1994, the county has spent in excess of $40million
planning aviation at El Toro using revenue from the John Wayne
Airport enterprise fund. Under Measure W, aviation reuse has been
killed and all John Wayne funds have been severed forcibly. They can
be legally used only to plan an aviation system, which included El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   However, the general fund is now vulnerable on two fronts. To
continue servicing the master lease agreement between the Navy and
the county, the general fund will have to absorb the loss, which is
$7million a year through 2005. Also, the board must decide whether to
commence using general fund dollars to plan for any non-aviation
reuses at the base.</TE>
<TE>   In order to stop the bleeding of the general fund, Supervisor Jim
Silva and I recently met with top Navy officials and insisted that if
the county is to continue to work with the Navy in its disposal
efforts, the federal government will have to reassume the caretaker
functions of the base while honoring all of our tenant agreements. If
the Navy agrees, it will save the general fund nearly $25 million.
Their risk in not doing so is having the Local Reuse Authority walk
away, which could cause three years of delay to the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   The county should not now expend funds to plan a non-aviation
reuse. Instead, the county should encourage the city of Irvine to
fund a non-aviation master plan consistent with Measure W and submit
it to review by the LRA. Irvine has earned its credibility in
planning non-aviation at the base. Our county planners can review
these plans and advise the LRA without additional general fund costs.
This is the process that has worked well for years as with any other
development project. We should not have a double standard review
process just because the development happens to be El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Second, we must keep our commitment to appropriate land-use
planning and the intent of Measure W. As the Navy begins selling off
either the whole base or parcels, there is a great risk that good
land-use planning will suffer as individual developers eye
opportunities that are not overseen by a local government. By joining
with the city of Irvine to oversee the disposal process, the county
will be meeting two strong goals: first, making sure the use itself
generates sufficient taxes to pay for services such as sewer and
roads; and second, to encourage land uses consistent with Measure W
that will give incentive to Irvine to annex the base.</TE>
<TE>   If the county fails to engage in this process, it is cutting its
own throat--it is guaranteeing a disposal process that creates an
unincorporated county island in perpetuity without sufficient tax
dollars to cover expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Third, we must regain the credibility lost during the El Toro
reuse debate by expanding the voices of those most affected by
prospective reuses. Prior to Measure A, the LRA consisted of both the
county and the cities of Lake Forest and Irvine. A task force is
needed to bring these cities back to the table. We need the good
thinking of those cities, which have spent years planning for
non-aviation and whose ideas changed county opinion in favor of
non-aviation.</TE>
<TE>   On April 16, the board again will discuss El Toro's future. The
Navy has committed to work closely with the LRA if the LRA delivers
on a local master plan, which honors Measure W and brings warring
factions together. By now it is obvious that the Navy will dispose of
the base with or without us. Under federal law, the Navy gets to
decide what it believes is the highest and best use for the base.
They are turning to us for our input. Now is not the time to walk
away.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Appeals for Help as Israel Presses Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A U.N. Security Council resolution calls for the army to
withdraw from Ramallah as a suicide attack in Tel Aviv injures 32 people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>A besieged Yasser Arafat appealed to the world for help Saturday
against Israeli forces that have destroyed and occupied most of the
compound where the Palestinian Authority president lives and works.</LD>
<LD>   Huddled in hallways and confined to two floors of his headquarters,
Arafat and about 100 of his die-hard supporters erected a barricade and
stacked desks against windows in anticipation of a final Israeli assault,
according to people who visited.</LD>
<LD>   Israel ignored international pleas to reverse its invasion of this
West Bank city and instead expanded its punishing military offensive and
tightened its siege of Arafat. Israeli forces rounded up hundreds of
Palestinian men--including emergency medics and police--in what the
government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has described as a hunt for
terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon declared Arafat an enemy last week, dispatched scores of tanks
into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and mobilized 20,000 reservists for a
"long and complicated war" against the Palestinian chief and the suicide
bombers and other extremists who have attacked Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive followed a suicide bombing Wednesday that killed 23
people--the deadliest such attack in 18 months of violence. Two more
suicide attacks have occurred since, including one in Tel Aviv on
Saturday that injured 32 people but killed only the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks that already hold sway in Ramallah moved into position Saturday
around the sprawling U.S.-built headquarters of Arafat's West Bank
security chief, Col. Jibril Rajoub, and demanded the surrender of key
militants thought to be hiding there. Tanks also roared into the town of
Beit Jala, next to the biblical city of Bethlehem, where Christians are
observing Easter weekend.</TE>
<TE>   One of Arafat's bodyguards and an intelligence officer were killed in
sporadic gun battles around the Palestinian leader's compound.</TE>
<TE>   And the bodies of five Palestinian policemen were found in a building
seized and then abandoned by Israeli forces. Palestinians said the men
were executed in cold blood; the army said their deaths resulted from a
firefight.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, said to be following the news on a small radio, may have taken
comfort from the United Nations Security Council's call for Israel to
leave Ramallah. The resolution passed 14 to 0 around dawn Saturday, after
marathon discussions and, unusually, with U.S. support.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Arafat's compound, guards and supporters were eating boiled
potatoes and pita bread, using candles and cigarette lighters as
illumination, and sleeping on floors. Adam Shapiro, a New York-born
pro-Palestinian peace activist, spent Friday night and much of Saturday
there. He said supplies of water and food were dwindling, electricity was
cut and the power generators were running low. Telephone lines also were
cut.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro said Arafat's guards had turned a luggage scanner, usually
used for security checks of visitors, sideways across the entrance facing
Israeli forces just 15 yards from the front door. Men with rifles guarded
that position.</TE>
<TE>   The International Committee of the Red Cross was enlisted Saturday to
ferry bread, milk and cheese to Arafat and his associates.</TE>
<TE>   "I am appealing to the whole international world to stop this
aggression against our people, this military escalation day [and] night,
this killing," the Palestinian leader told a camera crew from Reuters
television that Israel allowed to enter the compound. The interview was
conducted by candlelight.</TE>
<TE>Men, Boys Ordered to Detention Centers</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers using megaphones swept through Ramallah
ordering all men ages 16 to 45 to report to detention centers. In the Al
Bireh neighborhood, young men approached the tanks and armored troop
carriers surrounding the Mogtaribeen School. A soldier ordered each to
lift his coat, then his shirt, to expose bare bellies and the absence of
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the walls of the school, several hundred Palestinian men and
boys sat cross-legged in the concrete courtyard under heavy guard. A few
said their noon prayers, using their jackets as prayer mats. Snipers
occupied the second floor of the school, looking down on the men.</TE>
<TE>   The army lieutenant colonel in charge said the men and boys would be
required to present their identification numbers, which would be checked
for terrorist connections. Most would wait for hours and, in the end,
only about 1% would be formally arrested, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people here are innocent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, ground forces backed by tanks, other armor and German
shepherds raided houses, businesses and the private Arab Care Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked them what they wanted," said Dr. Shawki Harb, a surgeon at
the 30-bed hospital. "All they said was 'Sheket!' "--"Quiet!" in Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and nurses were ordered to remain where they were and not move
about during the search, which lasted about an hour. No one was taken
away or questioned, and the doctors were puzzled about what the soldiers
were looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the soldiers told me: 'I'm from [the Israeli advocacy group]
Peace Now. I'm against this,' " Harb said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the patients at the hospital was Riphi Kobaari, a freelance
Palestinian cameraman who said he was beaten by soldiers who had seized
and destroyed his tapes after he took photos near Arafat's compound.</TE>
<TE>   Another was 14-year-old Suleiman Zaloum, who was shot in the abdomen,
legs and lower chest in the early hours of the Israeli invasion. Doctors
said the boy lost so much blood that he didn't have a pulse when he
reached the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Arafat's compound, eight members of two ambulance crews, plus
two of their wounded patients, were arrested by soldiers and held for
hours, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. Three other medics also
were arrested, their associates said.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it had arrested 145 people from throughout Ramallah in
the last two days.</TE>
<TE>5 Policemen Found Slain in a Building</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the five Palestinian policemen were found on the third
floor of a building near downtown Ramallah. Israeli troops had occupied
the building and then abandoned it early Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The men, in their 40s or 50s, appeared to have been shot in the head
or neck at close range. The room where they were found--an office called
the Center for Dissemination of Democracy and Community Development--was
splattered with blood and pocked with bullet or shrapnel holes. A string
of bloodstains was sprayed across the wall at what would have been about
head level if the men had been sitting when shot. The Israeli army said
in a statement that the officers had been killed in a close-quarter
firefight.</TE>
<TE>   Maher Shaladi, bureau chief for Dubai Television, has offices on the
top floor of the building. He said that a large number of Palestinian
police armed with Kalashnikovs had entered the building ahead of the
Israeli forces and that intense gunfire could be heard. But the position
of the five bodies and the nature of the wounds raised questions about
whether the men had died in a gun battle.</TE>
<TE>   The army also displayed dozens of automatic rifles, handguns and more
than 30 rocket-propelled grenades Saturday that it said had been seized
from Arafat's compound.</TE>

<HD>No Happy Ever After for ABC in Disney Saga</HD>
<DH>Media: The acquisition of the network seemed like a perfect match.
But now, with ratings down, there's little to celebrate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a marriage roundly toasted in Hollywood and on Wall Street,
the jaw-dropping union of a major studio and a top-rated television
network.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co.'s acquisition of the ABC network seemed like a perfect
match. But six years later, the storybook romance that paired Disney's
production factory with ABC's pipeline into American homes has yet to
blossom.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's recent failure to lure David Letterman to replace Ted
Koppel's "Nightline" is just the latest setback for ABC, which has fallen
to fourth place in the prime-time ratings among the key demographics
sought by advertisers. ABC was ranked No. 1 in 1995, when Disney Chairman
Michael Eisner announced the $19.5-billion acquisition of the network's
parent company, Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "Michael and I don't sleep at night, knowing where the network is,"
said Disney President Robert Iger. "It's a priority for the company and
the No. 1 issue right now."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's prime-time audience has declined 24% this season--one of the
steepest year-to-year plunges in network history. Ratings have dropped so
sharply that ABC is compensating advertisers with additional spots. In
some cases, ABC is giving advertisers cash payments, a highly unusual
move that networks use only when they have depleted their commercial
inventories.</TE>
<TE>   As viewers taper off, so do the rates advertisers are willing to pay.
As a result, the ABC network made less money last year than in 1996.
Merrill Lynch analysts project a record loss of $500 million for ABC this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Disney and ABC executives said the problems stemmed
mostly from the cyclical nature of the hit-driven network TV business, in
which one or two blockbuster shows can bring ratings riches. Now,
however, senior managers acknowledge that strategic mistakes also were
made.</TE>
<TE>   During the last six years, ABC has hatched only a few prime-time hits,
foremost among them the quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." But
instead of using the show as a springboard, Disney cut back production, a
strategy critics said mortgaged the network's future for short-term
profit.</TE>
<TE>   The network is just a fragment of Disney's vast empire, accounting for
about 5% of the operating income generated last year by the company's
theme parks, sports teams, cable channels, TV and radio stations and
movie studios, according to Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   But the network is among the company's most visible properties, and
its performance has given investors another reason to gripe about
Disney's idle stock price. Iger, 51, said a rejuvenated ABC could add $5
to $10 to the price of Disney's shares.</TE>
<TE>   The stock rose 19 cents on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, to
$23.08, the most recent day of trading because of Good Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Iger, who ran ABC Inc. for six years before becoming Disney president
in 2000, acknowledged that he took his eye off the network after the
acquisition. He said he was distracted by new responsibilities and the
task of orchestrating what was then the second-largest merger in history.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a clash of cultures," Iger said. "I spent two full years
managing the merger process. . . . I got less and less involved instead
of wanting to become more involved. . . . I didn't have the time or the
ability to focus during those years because I was given so much more to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as he did when ratings sank in 1997, Iger is pledging to roll up
his sleeves to fix ABC in prime time, which generates about 60% of a
network's advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Iger and other studio executives said the solution can be found by
looking back to the early and mid-1990s, when ABC dominated prime time
with the family comedies "Roseanne" and "Home Improvement" and dramas
including "NYPD Blue."</TE>
<TE>   Recently appointed ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne, 51, said
the network's programming had "gotten too narrow" by focusing on edgier,
adult fare.</TE>
<TE>   "We really needed to embrace what had made ABC a strong network in the
past," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilding process partly began last weekend, when ABC used the
Academy Awards as a showcase to promote four new prime-time series that
premiered this week--including a comedy about a struggling TV network.</TE>
<TE>   In the months ahead, the network will unveil its all-important fall
lineup. To improve its chances of a hit, Lyne said, ABC is spending more
money developing pilots and is opening its arms to outside suppliers
rather than relying so heavily on its own TV studio.</TE>
<TE>   So far, analysts support Disney's steps to fix the network, especially
the hiring of Lyne, a respected ABC executive. But it is too early to
evaluate the strategy, they cautioned, and a quick turnaround at the
network appears unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beginning step," said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Gerard
Klauer Mattison in Los Angeles. "Needless to say, what they have been
doing hasn't been working. . . . They are trying something new to break
out of the rut, and that's good. . . . It may succeed, and it may not."</TE>
<TE>   Still, former ABC and Disney executives said the network's problems
run much deeper than its programming. They said the last six years have
revealed as much about Disney's management performance as about viewer
preferences.</TE>
<TE>   Almost uniformly, the executives blame the network's troubles on a
clash of the merged companies' cultures and high-level power struggles
that resulted in an exodus of senior executives.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Entertainment, the division responsible for the network's
prime-time schedule, has had six management teams in as many years.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's top-down management style was jarring to many at Capital
Cities, which was known for a decentralized approach and for pushing
authority down the line, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other media moguls, industry sources said, Eisner has involved
himself in programming at ABC, including setting the prime-time schedule,
pursuing Letterman and signing off on the airing of "Millionaire" four
nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   Iger said Eisner's involvement is exaggerated. Others at Disney said
it's natural for Eisner, an ABC executive during the 1970s, to lend his
expertise. Former Disney TV chief Richard Frank said his old boss' advice
often was on point.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped me many, many times by sticking his nose in on a project
creatively or forcing me to think about a project in a different way,"
Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner's move to buy Capital Cities was aimed largely at making sure
there would be a continuing market for programs made by Disney's studios.
A relaxation of federal rules in the early 1990s made it possible for TV
networks to produce shows in-house instead of relying on outside studios.</TE>
<TE>   This set off a chain reaction among nervous entertainment giants,
which scrambled to buy networks or start their own as venues for their
production divisions. Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc. started broadcast
networks UPN and the WB, respectively. Disney, though, outdid them both.</TE>
<TE>   The multibillion-dollar acquisition of Capital Cities catapulted
Disney over Time Warner to become the world's entertainment leader, at
least for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner promised remarkable synergy from the teaming of the two
companies--"a 1-plus-1-equals-4" equation, he called it. Wall Street
embraced the deal, calling it a model for the future.</TE>
<TE>   ABC was considered the Cadillac of networks, with a prized TV station
group and a tradition of strong prime-time network ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But within weeks of the announcement, Iger said it was clear that ABC
would soon be in a dogfight with NBC, which had assembled a ratings
powerhouse on Thursday nights with a hip, urban-oriented mix of comedies
such as "Seinfeld" and "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, under pressure to name a president to manage the expanding
company, turned to one of Hollywood's most powerful players, agent
Michael Ovitz, who represented an array of the industry's top stars and
had hooks into the leading studios.</TE>
<TE>   One of Ovitz's first acts was to recruit a hotshot executive from NBC
to head ABC Entertainment. Jamie Tarses, who at 32 became one of the
youngest presidents in network history, had overseen the creation of
"Friends" and "Frasier" at NBC. To free Tarses from her contract, Ovitz
went to war, threatening to raise allegations of sexual harassment
against an NBC executive.</TE>
<TE>   Once Tarses arrived, ABC quickly changed. Her hiring ushered in an era
of management instability and programming decisions that led the network
away from its loyal family audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We entered into a pretty dark period where we had management
upheaval, a merger we were focusing on, a whole new set of rules and a
business that was changing dramatically, so the results, I think, speak
for themselves," Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarses tried to duplicate NBC's success with similarly provocative
dramas, including "Nothing Sacred," a series about a young priest.</TE>
<TE>   Iger then was president of ABC Inc., overseeing the network as well as
the company's cable unit and its television and radio stations. He said
neither he nor Eisner opposed the programming initiative, because family
comedies were then considered out of step.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of trying to be different, we tried to be the same," Iger
said, adding: "We got off our game."</TE>
<TE>   One of the earliest conflicts to engulf Tarses' tumultuous tenure was
her reluctance to use programs generated by Disney's TV studio,
undercutting the company's reason for acquiring ABC. She wanted to buy
elsewhere because she did not like what Disney was pushing.</TE>
<TE>   Other tensions between Tarses and her colleagues became so bad that a
peacemaker was flown in from the company's New York office. The
executive, longtime Iger lieutenant Stu Bloomberg, was made Tarses' boss.
This left people in Hollywood's creative community confused about whom to
call with their ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Disney folded its studio into the network, saving money while
making it abundantly clear where ABC would get its new shows. Within a
month, in August 1999, Tarses resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new structure, Bloomberg shared the title of co-chairman of
ABC Entertainment with the previous head of Disney's TV studio, Lloyd
Braun. The cumbersome structure slowed the production process.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have two [people] picking shows and choosing scripts,"
Frank said. "In a creative process, one person has to be boss."</TE>
<TE>   The merger of the studio and network brought its own unanticipated
pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   By tying its fortunes to ABC, Disney's production studio limited its
ability to create shows for sale to other networks.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable, Disney's Touchstone Television gave ABC first crack at a
show it was producing called "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." After ABC
passed, CBS picked up the one-hour drama for the 2000 season, and
Touchstone gave up its ownership position, unwilling to finance an
expensive show for a competitor. The show became a big hit for CBS.</TE>
<TE>   The year Disney's TV studio was merged with the network, ABC hit
bottom, losing $60 million. But luck struck with "Millionaire," reversing
ABC's fortunes the following season.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Millionaire" provided a huge windfall for the network,
critics said Disney prematurely exhausted the show's earning power by
running it four nights a week. The show raked in a record profit for ABC
of $518 million in 2000, the height of a raging bull advertising market.</TE>
<TE>   "Millionaire" producer Michael Davies said: "I sort of understand why
ABC ran it the way they did, because they made great revenue during an
incredible ad market on a show that was very cheap to make."</TE>
<TE>   But the show flamed out a year later, in 2001, driving down profit at
the network to $218 million. Television executives said the mistake
Disney made was not investing the largess of "Millionaire" in the
development of new shows.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Fox, which spent $100 million in 1996 to lock up marquee
talent, Disney was reluctant to spend on top writers and producers,
industry observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "They put too much faith in 'Millionaire' and didn't put enough shows
around it," said Peggy Green, president of national broadcasting for
Zenith Media, a major advertising buyer.</TE>
<TE>   ABC today is taking a new tack.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Disney ousted Bloomberg and promoted Lyne, a former
journalist and relative newcomer to TV, to president of ABC
Entertainment. Lyne caught the attention of Eisner and Iger as head of
ABC's movies and miniseries.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said the structure has been streamlined and Lyne is spending
more freely on fall pilots, ordering twice as many as the network did two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Lyne acknowledged, ABC may have limited its success by
depending too heavily on Disney productions. Still, only four or five of
the 30 new pilots come from outside studios.</TE>
<TE>   "Was I doing this again, I would probably be more aware of the message
that sends to the community," Lyne said of the limited relations with
other studios. "It's obviously in my interest to be able to work with
everybody in town."</TE>
<TE>   ABC also has hired Fred Silverman--who was president of CBS, ABC and
NBC in the 1970s and early 1980s--as a consultant. Eisner once worked for
Silverman, who brings a historical perspective that Lyne lacks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney says ABC, to some degree, can lean on its other strengths to
boost prime time. The network has been No. 1 in daytime programming for
25 years, its news programs are second to NBC News in most time slots,
and it has one of the strongest network sports lineups.</TE>
<TE>   Sports programming is unprofitable, but it is an unmatched vehicle for
promoting programs. ABC owns broadcast rights to the National Football
League, the National Basketball Assn. starting next year, the National
Hockey League and college football and basketball. The network recently
signed Fox commentator John Madden in an attempt to improve ratings for
"Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   Although the network's prime-time programming and profit have been
erratic since the merger, Disney has enjoyed substantial benefits from
its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC. ABC's stations, for example,
continue to rank No. 1 or No. 2 in the local ratings--a testament,
analysts said, to the legacy of Capital Cities, which had maintained
strong leads in local news since the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch forecasts that the ABC stations will make $310 million
this year, even as the network loses money.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest bonus for Disney was landing ESPN, the sports cable
channel today worth an estimated $25 billion--about four times its value
when Disney acquired it as part of the Capital Cities/ABC deal in 1996.
ESPN is the world's most profitable network and by far Disney's best
performer.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN also will pick up the estimated cost of $400 million a year for
the NBA contract even though ABC will get 15 of the best games, including
the finals.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC has certainly experienced disappointment," said Steven Bornstein,
49, president of the ABC Television Group, which oversees the network,
ABC's 10 TV stations and its 53 radio stations. "But I have to say,
there's so much right about ABC."</TE>

<CX>   ABC/Disney--A March 31 story in the A section about ABC's
performance under the Walt Disney Co. mistakenly stated that ABC had been
No. 1 in daytime programming for years. Although ABC has been first among
younger female demographics, CBS is the overall ratings leader. The story
also mistakenly stated that Fred Silverman had been a president at CBS.
He was a vice president there.</CX>

<KH>QUEEN ELIZABETH / 1900 - 2002</KH>
<HD>Queen Mother, Britain's Link to an Empire, Dies at 101</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Queen Elizabeth the queen mother, whose relentless charm and iron
will steered the British monarchy through a world war and an abdication
crisis and into a modern age where its robes were sullied by embarrassing
marital antics, died Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   She was 101, the oldest member of Britain's millennium-old monarchy,
which has a history of short-lived men and long-lived women. Each
successive birthday further exalted the "queen mum" as an ageless British
fixture--the Rock of Gibraltar upholstered in pastel silk and crowned
with a feathery hat.</LD>
<LD>   As her husband, King George VI, did 50 years before, she died in her
sleep. Her daughter, the queen, was with her "beloved mother" when she
died at Royal Lodge, Windsor, at 3:15 on an English spring afternoon.
Since Christmas, her health was complicated by a cough and chest
infection, and her younger daughter, Margaret, had died seven weeks ago.
A palace spokesman said her condition deteriorated suddenly Saturday. "It
was a very moving and very sad moment, but luckily it was very peaceful,"
Margaret Rhodes, the queen mother's niece, told BBC television.</LD>
<TE>   Prince Charles, said to be her favorite grandchild, was said to be
"devastated" at the news. He and his sons, Princes William and Harry,
were returning to London today from a ski holiday in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   As with all senior royals, plans for the queen mother's
funeral--code-named "Tay Bridge" after a bridge in her Scottish
homeland--have been in place for a long time, but her robust health kept
defying the preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Her body is to be taken to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor
Great Park early today, where it is to lie in state for three days. The
funeral will be held at Westminster Abbey, and she will be buried at
Windsor. No precise schedule has been announced.</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother's life spanned the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.
Born in the reign of Queen Victoria, she married one of Victoria's
great-grandsons, before a soap opera drama made her queen of England and
the last empress of India. She outlived her husband by half a century and
lived to witness her elder daughter celebrate 50 years on the throne of
an England much diminished in the queen mother's lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   News of the "queen mum's" death spread on a quiet Easter weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of mourners, some bringing flowers, gathered outside Windsor
Castle, about 20 miles west of London. The bells of a church nearby
tolled to mark her death.</TE>
<TE>   Small crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace, where a death notice
was posted on the black iron gates. The Union Jack flew at half-staff. As
was done for Princess Margaret's death in February and Princess Diana's
death in 1997, condolence books are to be opened for signing at St.
James's Palace today.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair called her "a symbol of Britain's decency
and courage," a woman possessed of "a profound sense of duty and service.
She had this selfless devotion to duty. That's what she believed in.
That's how she lived her life. And that's how I hope she will be
remembered."</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said of her, "I loved her
sense of fun and her interest in people. She had the common touch."</TE>
<TE>   The death of this living relic of an empire brought forth a wistful
sorrow that lacked the shock of Diana's death but instead arose from a
country that seemed to be mourning not just the "queen mum" but the glory
days of Britain itself.</TE>
<TE>Wartime Resolve Helped Unite Nation</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother's own Elizabethan Age spanned the 15 years that she
was queen consort to King George VI. It began on the December day in 1936
that her husband's elder brother, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne
to marry an American divorcee named Wallis Simpson. It ended in February
1952, when her husband died and her elder daughter, Elizabeth, became
queen.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the queen mother was handled with kid gloves even by
the fickle British tabloid press, which can be fawning and carnivorous by
turns, but her greatest compliment came from Adolf Hitler. The German
Fuehrer, watching newsreels of her morale-building visits with bombed-out
Britons during World War II, called her "the most dangerous woman in
Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Her own wartime "charm offensive" is remembered in remarks of almost
Churchillian resonance. When the Nazis added Buckingham Palace to their
bombing targets, she was quoted as saying, "I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the [blitzed] East End in the face." And when
thousands of London children were evacuated to safety in Canada and
elsewhere, she declared famously, "The children won't go without me, I
won't leave without the king, and the king will never leave." (The
children, the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister, Princess
Margaret, spent much of the war just outside London, at Windsor Castle,
hidden away along with the crown jewels.)</TE>
<TE>   She was diagnosed last year with anemia and had taken a number of
falls over the years, in part from failing eyesight and perhaps in part
because she insisted on wearing high heels to boost her 5-feet-nothing
height. She had two hip replacements and cataract surgery, and underwent
a colostomy in 1966--something the palace characterized delicately only
as "major abdominal surgery." When she choked on a fish bone in her 80s,
the dedicated fisherwoman was quoted as calling the episode "the salmon's
revenge."</TE>
<TE>   If royal tombs had epitaphs, "charming" would be chiseled deep on
Elizabeth's. In her youth, platoons of men had fallen for her decorously
flirtatious sex appeal. She was as delectably plump and fluffily attired
as a bonbon in a frilled paper cup.</TE>
<TE>   She was the life of the party, accomplished at singing, dancing and
charades, and through her long public life as a royal, whether planting
trees or cutting ribbons, she appeared to be enjoying herself enormously.
All the more remarkable in the royal family, she had some modest
intellectual interests, going to the theater, befriending the poetic
Sitwells and hanging on her walls fairly modern paintings that had
nothing to do with dead aristocrats.</TE>
<TE>   To her people, she became the embodiment of great British virtues and
small British vices. Had she been the grandmother down the street, as her
humbler countrymen liked to think of her, her fondness for liquor and
chocolates, for racetrack betting and horse breeding and for racy jokes
would have gotten her labeled a bawdy old lady. People loved the tale of
her calling down from an upper floor of her palace, wanting help from a
doting household whose numbers included many homosexuals: "Are there any
old queens down there who'll fetch a gin and tonic for an old queen up
here?"</TE>
<TE>   A servant reported finding half-bitten chocolates in wastebaskets,
where Elizabeth tossed them if the filling was not to her liking. On a
tour of Manchester, a constable staring at her chewing something was
startled when she opened her window and tossed him a caramel.</TE>
<TE>Loyalists Defended Her Against Critics</TE>
<TE>   Long before Princess Diana, Elizabeth was the royal star, pioneer of
the "royal common touch" and the now-standard "royal walkabout," her
magical chemistry elevating the ordinary to the regal. It was, a
biographer wrote, "a splendid collusion, hoaxed and hoaxters
indistinguishable from each other."</TE>
<TE>   Her critics, few but fierce, mocked her extravagances. Royal
biographer Anthony Holden faulted her as "a woman who has never done a
day's work in her life, who has blithely run up eight-figure overdrafts
of the taxpayers' money on racehorses, had four palatial residences, 50
full-time servants and the pampered life of a latter-day Marie
Antoinette." Writer Will Self ridiculed the doting masses who loved her
as one of them: "No, she hasn't been 'with us'; she's been in the royal
enclosure at Ascot."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, legions of loyalists volunteered to horsewhip these cads.
Taxpaying Britons who deplored the cut-ups of junior Windsors found their
matriarch's failings trivial and even adorable. When word leaked that
this rich old lady had overdrawn her account by millions, people on
pensions sent her checks. Her birthdays were elaborately celebrated; on
her 80th, a squadron of jets flew overhead forming the letter "E," and on
her 100th, model Jerry Hall, garbed as a goddess, joined thousands of
performers for a gala broadcast carried live and commercial-free.</TE>
<TE>   If Southern women are steel magnolias, Scottish-born Elizabeth was
steel heather. She was deeply traditional, and wished the royal genie
could be put back in the bottle of privacy. Royal embarrassments were
nothing new--one of her princely brothers-in-law was a drug addict and
bisexual, and two of her nieces long listed as dead turned up alive in
the 1980s, stashed in a mental asylum. But letting private matters become
public, as Princess Diana regularly did, was regarded as at least an
equal offense.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth was born Aug. 4, 1900, and this youngest daughter of an earl
spent part of her charmed childhood in the Macbeth-haunted castle of
Glamis. During the world war that ravaged her generation, Glamis set up a
military hospital for convalescing officers, who fell for the small,
sweet-natured earl's daughter who wrote their letters and kept them
amused.</TE>
<TE>   She was quite a catch. A newspaper coyly and wrongly reported her
engagement to the dashing Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. But it was
the second-born prince who never expected or wanted to be king who
persisted in courting Elizabeth until she agreed to marry him. She could
not have known that the marriage that made her "Her Royal Highness the
Duchess of York" would also make her the first commoner queen since Henry
VIII's last wife. ("Commoner" is a relative term; on England's tight
little island, it means only that Elizabeth was not born royal, but she
was certainly a member in high standing of the even tighter little circle
of the rank-and-titled.)</TE>
<TE>   Possessed of that brilliant something--instinct or talent or
both--that a PR firm would pay millions to own, Elizabeth knew unerringly
how to fill the royal slippers. On her wedding day, she went to the altar
without a bouquet; on her way up the aisle in Westminster Abbey, she laid
her roses and white heather on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. She was
quick with a diplomatic quip to defuse difficult moments. On a South
Africa visit, a Boer told her, "I'm sorry, but I really hate the
English." The queen of England zinged back, "I do sympathize. You see,
I'm Scots."</TE>
<TE>   Her prince was hot-tempered, nervous and knock-kneed, and she took him
in hand. His stuttering, probably from being switched from left-handed to
right, made courtiers regard him as poorly suited to public life.
Elizabeth's decision to take him to a speech therapist was as radical in
the 1920s as Diana's to seek out astrologers was 60 years later, to less
happy results.</TE>
<TE>   And what could not be changed could be ignored or avoided; the
unofficial royal slogan was "Never complain, never explain." Good timing
found her stuck in bed with the flu during the chaos of Abdication Week,
in December 1936, when her brother-in-law, King Edward VIII, gave up
crown and empire for "the woman I love." Elizabeth's husband was king,
and she was queen.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth sailed grandly into the role, managing to be simultaneously
regal and cozy. Lifelong acclaim did not blunt her implacable dislike for
Wallis Simpson and those who took her side. Elizabeth regarded Simpson as
a greedy adventuress whose ambitions had besmirched royal repute and
forced the weight of kingship on Elizabeth's own husband, killing him in
his 50s. Against all custom and law, it was Elizabeth who is said to have
insisted that Simpson not share her new husband's royal status. In later
years Elizabeth sent flowers to the ailing Simpson, but in 1986 she might
have gleaned some satisfaction from seeing Simpson buried without the
word "royal" on her gravestone.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Elizabeth's daughter Margaret, who was pressured not to marry
her first love, a divorced man, ended up divorcing the man she did marry.
So would three of Elizabeth's six grandchildren. She refused to meet
Prince Charles' lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, and was said to have been
promised that Charles would not marry her while the queen mother lived.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's royal family survived where other royal families failed by
pulling off the knife-edge act of seeming like a nice middle-class family
that just happens to wear diamonds and dine from gold plate. World War II
was the proving of it. The king and queen, who had at first favored
appeasing Hitler, led the British empire to war. Steel-shuttered
Buckingham Palace famously went on the same fuel and food cutbacks as
Yorkshire cottages (although royal forests and farms and cellars
supplemented the meagerness).</TE>
<TE>Public's Love Bordered on Idolatry</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth endeared herself with such gestures as stopping on her way
to a bomb shelter to pet a cat, and turning around the camera for a child
who was holding it the wrong way. Her reward was love bordering on
idolatry, beginning with her husband, who regarded her as "the most
marvelous person."</TE>
<TE>   At a maternity ward visit, the queen asked anxiously about one patient
in obvious distress, and was told, "She's in advanced labor, but she will
not go into the labor ward until she has seen the queen." Only rarely was
there a break in the smile, such as the brief newsreel footage of an
"expression of distaste" as she moved through what a biographer described
as "a group of dejected and no doubt smelly citizens" after an air raid.</TE>
<TE>   In marriage, Elizabeth wanted to replicate her own happy family life,
and her husband wanted to enjoy one that he had never had. Bookish they
were not. Both indulged their daughters, especially their academic
chores, and one nobleman observed, "I do not think she has altogether
brought up her daughters in a way that has fitted them for the job they
have to do."</TE>
<TE>   King George VI died of lung cancer in February 1952. Widowhood demoted
her from the throne, but she was not upstaged, not even by her shy
daughter, who was now the queen.</TE>
<TE>   The royal equivalent of work--ribbon-cuttings, dedications,
unveilings--brought her back to public life from deep mourning, and
Elizabeth soon turned her sunrise smile on every besuited official, every
little girl with a clutch of posies.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and '60s, as the sun set with regularity on a shrinking
British realm, she became her daughter's most personable ambassador,
journeying to political hot spots such as Rhodesia, the Middle East,
Northern Ireland, and less perilous destinations such as the United
States and the Caribbean. Like a brilliant one-woman theatrical show, her
meticulously choreographed appearances left behind eternally uncritical
admirers.</TE>
<TE>   At her own private dinners, the widowed queen could cut loose,
instituting "anti-toasts" to those she disliked: a left-wing politician,
Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, and former President Carter, reportedly
"because he is the only man, since my dear husband died, to have had the
effrontery to kiss me on the lips."</TE>
<TE>   As her age crept toward 100, her relatives, friends and courtiers
began dying around her. When a lady-in-waiting pleaded that she felt too
old for the job, Elizabeth demanded of her, "What about me?"</TE>

<LD>   Deputy Chief Maurice Moore, 66, retired in January as investigators
from the LAPD and FBI probed his financial ties to his son, Kevin Moore,
a convicted cocaine trafficker.</LD>
<LD>   Maurice Moore, through his attorney, denied any wrongdoing. He
declined to comment further on the advice of his lawyer, who also
declined to discuss the matter in detail.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD officials have been looking into allegations against Moore for
well over a year, and at least some members of the Police Commission have
been briefed about it.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, a longtime friend and special assistant to Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks, was allowed to continue in his job while the investigation was
underway. Under Parks, LAPD officers accused of crimes or serious
misconduct often have been ordered to remain at home during working hours
until the cases against them have been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Parks declined to discuss specifics of the Moore case on Friday, but
said the LAPD was continuing to probe the allegations against him. "At
the conclusion," Parks said, "we will determine if there's anything he is
culpable of."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Moore, long regarded as a friendly, approachable LAPD
supervisor, has retired from the LAPD, officially winding up his service
on Jan. 26. A message in Parks' monthly newsletter said Moore's long
career was "distinguished by his remarkable commitment to continuous
public service," adding that the deputy chief had gone for more than 30
years without taking a single day off due to illness.</TE>
<TE>   According to public documents and interviews with witnesses who have
been questioned by investigators, authorities are scrutinizing at least
two real estate transactions involving Maurice Moore to determine whether
he sought to hide assets generated by his son's Detroit-based cocaine
dealing.</TE>
<TE>   At the time both real estate transactions occurred, in 1992, Kevin
Moore was serving time in federal prison. He had been sentenced after
pleading guilty to smuggling 1,000 pounds of cocaine into the country in
1989. His drug dealing continued for nearly a decade from inside the
walls of federal prisons in Texas and California, according to court
records and law enforcement sources.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the real estate transactions involving Maurice Moore, the
elder Moore purchased an apartment building on 6th Avenue in Los Angeles
in 1992, county records show. Seven years later, as his son was about to
plead guilty to money laundering in connection with drug dealing
orchestrated from inside prison, Kevin Moore claimed in court papers that
the 6th Avenue apartment building belonged to him, even though real
estate records still showed it in Maurice Moore's name.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Moore at that time turned over $1 million in drug profits to the
government; in return, prosecutors agreed not to seize the apartment
building.</TE>
<TE>Authorities Scrutinize Real Estate Deals</TE>
<TE>   That set of facts has caught the attention of authorities, who are
questioning whether Maurice Moore was the real owner in 1992 or whether
he put the property in his name to keep it from being identified as his
son's. The property later was valued at $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth House, who owned the building and sold it to Maurice Moore in
1992, said in an interview with The Times that he was recently questioned
by LAPD Internal Affairs detectives about the transaction and whether he
had any ties to Maurice or Kevin Moore or any members of the Moore
family. House said he told the detectives that he did not, though he did
recall someone mentioning at the time that the buyer was a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   The other deal under scrutiny involves a four-bedroom house with a
swimming pool on Troon Avenue in Cheviot Hills that was transferred into
Maurice Moore's name on July 7, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The person deeding him the property, according to county records, was
Cheryl Frazier. Frazier's sister, Anna Moore, was married to Kevin Moore
and was a participant in his narcotics and money-laundering organization.
Anna Moore's name also appears on the document deeding the property to
Maurice Moore, as the person to whom the recorded deed and tax statements
were to be sent.</TE>
<TE>   Although the records do not indicate how much Maurice Moore paid for
that property, other documents suggest that it was worth roughly
$725,000.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Moore and Frazier said they were visited by LAPD detectives in
recent weeks, and that the detectives were asking questions about Maurice
Moore.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview with The Times, Anna Moore said she refused to
cooperate with the police, telling them she had nothing to say. She also
declined to answer a reporter's question about why the Troon Avenue
property was transferred into Maurice Moore's name.</TE>
<TE>   Frazier, after examining property records regarding the Troon Avenue
house shown to her by reporters, said the signature on at least one of
the documents was not hers. She said she never owned the property, and
had no idea why it would have been transferred into Maurice Moore's name.
Frazier said she barely knew the elder Moore.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, three years after the Troon property was transferred into
Moore's name, Frazier and Anna Moore were indicted for distributing
cocaine and laundering money.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents and property records, Maurice Moore put
up the 6th Avenue apartment building as collateral to bail Frazier out of
jail in that case, which ultimately was dismissed. In the recent
interview with The Times, Frazier said she had no recollection of Moore
having done so.</TE>
<TE>   The first overt indication that Kevin Moore was involved in
large-scale drug trafficking came in November 1989 when he, Anna Moore
and another man were detained by federal Drug Enforcement Administration
agents at Los Angeles International Airport. The agents seized about
$57,000 in suspected drug money that was later forfeited to the
government, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Kevin Moore was arrested in Las Cruces, N.M., while
smuggling 1,000 pounds of cocaine across the border. He pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to 13 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Kevin Moore had accumulated substantial riches from his
enterprise. According to a former associate and law enforcement sources,
Moore owned expensive cars and luxurious homes, and he lavished gifts on
friends and family. One jeweler, who was also recently interviewed by
LAPD Internal Affairs investigators, recalled making expensive designer
pieces especially for Kevin Moore's mother and father, Maurice and Donna
Moore. Donna Moore said she did not recall receiving any jewelry directly
from her son, Kevin. She declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was incarcerated in 1989, Kevin Moore continued to be a
major narcotics dealer, according to court records and law enforcement
sources. He maintained ties with a supplier named Jose
Echegollen-Barrueta, who told the FBI that he supplied Kevin and Anna
Moore with roughly 3 tons of cocaine over a 10-year period beginning in
1987, according to a copy of his statement to the FBI, which was obtained
by The Times. Echegollen-Barrueta was convicted of drug trafficking in
1997 and was sentenced to life in prison, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>16 Convicted in Widespread Drug Ring</TE>
<TE>   IRS Special Agent Kevin Boudreau, the lead investigator in the case
against Kevin Moore, described Moore as entrepreneurial and resourceful.
"He was charismatic," Boudreau said. "He was clever enough to accomplish
what most drug dealers only dream of, which is to establish a direct
connection with a member of a Mexican cartel."</TE>
<TE>   Once Kevin Moore was confined to prison, authorities said, he used his
wife, Anna, and, later, a subsequent wife, Teresa, to help him run the
operation. The three were indicted in 1998 as part of wide-ranging drug
network suspected of dumping thousands of kilos of cocaine on city
streets from Detroit to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   To date, 16 people have been convicted, including a well-known NFL
agent, a Detroit area banker and a South Carolina businessman with a
Harvard MBA who was convicted of laundering the ring's drug money.</TE>
<TE>   One man charged in the case shot himself in the head during a standoff
with authorities in Missouri. Two other members of the ring who were
caught with a carload of cocaine and began cooperating with authorities
disappeared. They are presumed to have been killed to keep them from
testifying in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Moore first came to the attention of authorities in the
mid-1990s as they were investigating his son's prison-based drug
operation. He was not a target of the investigation, however, according
to law enforcement sources familiar with case.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators' suspicions were aroused in part by the real estate
transactions involving Maurice Moore. Agents were also intrigued by a
collection of photos of expensive automobiles thought to be owned by
Kevin Moore; in one photo, a smiling Maurice Moore was seated behind the
wheel of an antique Mercedes-Benz Gullwing, a car that can sell for more
than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1999, Kevin, Anna and Teresa Moore had each entered into plea
agreements with the government, all three agreeing to plead guilty to
money laundering, according to court documents. Anna Moore was sentenced
to four years in prison. Teresa was sentenced to a year. Kevin Moore was
sentenced to seven years to be served after he finished serving the
13-year term he received in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   It was in Kevin Moore's plea agreement that he cited both the 6th
Avenue apartment building and the Troon Avenue house as properties the
government could not attempt to seize if he turned over $1 million. He
did that even though records indicate that neither of those properties
was actually his.</TE>
<TE>   That was important because federal law gives authorities the ability
to seize property purchased with drug proceeds or used to facilitate drug
transactions. That law, known as asset forfeiture, is often used to take
homes, cars and other valuables from convicted or even suspected drug
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, all three plea agreements also called for the full
cooperation of each defendant.</TE>
<TE>Cash Allegedly Hidden in Ladera Heights Home</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Moore later testified as a government witness in the
money-laundering trial of the Detroit banker that she had personally
stored hundreds of thousands of dollars in drug money at a Ladera Heights
home owned by Maurice Moore and his ex-wife, Donna, as recently as 1996.
Maurice Moore did not live in the home at the time. It is unclear whether
Teresa Moore ever lived at the address. Donna Moore declined to comment
on Teresa Moore's allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Bruce Judge, who prosecuted Kevin Moore and his
co-defendants in Detroit, said in an interview last week that any
information regarding money laundering in California by Kevin Moore or
his associates was referred to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles
in 1999. Judge declined to characterize the information his office
forwarded to prosecutors in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Boudreau, the IRS agent, also declined to discuss any aspect of the
investigation that might have involved Maurice Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Although many facts of the case have been known to authorities here
for years, there are many signs of recent interest in it. One LAPD
official said the federal government played the lead role in the case for
years, and that the LAPD became more heavily involved in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD detectives recently traveled to Detroit to meet with
investigators who worked on the Kevin Moore cocaine case, as well as
interviewing several potential witnesses in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Two sources said there was some concern as to whether Maurice Moore's
alleged activity falls outside the statute of limitations governing the
prosecution of a money-laundering case, since the two transactions date
back to 1992. Another source, however, said he did not think that would
pose a problem.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations come just as Moore concludes a long and, for the most
part, respected career with the LAPD. An African American, Moore joined
the department in 1961 just as black officers were being integrated into
the force. He worked his way up through the ranks, receiving assignments
with many of the department's more noted divisions, including Metro,
Organized Crime and Vice, and Internal Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   He was promoted to deputy chief by Parks in December 1998, serving as
special assistant to the chief until his retirement in January. As deputy
chief, Moore's responsibilities included coordinating the department's
preparations for the Democratic National Convention in 2000, and serving
as an associate member of the LAPD's board of inquiry into the Rampart
corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD newsletter article announcing his retirement praised Moore's
work in various positions, particularly citing his performance during the
Democratic convention.</TE>
<TE>   "His leadership and constant presence on the streets of the city
helped show the world that the Los Angeles Police Department was capable
of ensuring public safety," it said, "while suppressing the disruptive,
lawless efforts of anarchists who came to Los Angeles from areas
throughout the country."</TE>
<TE>   Moore's lawyer, Albert DeBlanc Jr., said the former deputy chief is
"extremely proud" of his 40 years with the LAPD: "It concerns him deeply
that these accusations are being made at the end of a sparkling career."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YANRAKYNNOT, Russia
</DL>
<LD>The native elders have no explanation. Scientists are perplexed as
well. The icy realm of the Eskimo--the tundra and ice of Russia, Alaska,
Canada and Greenland--has started to thaw.</LD>
<LD>   Strange portents are everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Thunder and lightning, once rare, have become commonplace. An eerie
warm wind now blows in from the south. Hunters who prided themselves on
their ability to read the sky say they no longer can predict the sudden
blizzards. "The Earth," one hunter concluded, "is turning faster."</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, seabirds have washed up dead by the thousands and
deformed seal pups have become a common sight. Whales appear sick and
undernourished. The walrus, a mainstay of the local diet, is becoming
scarce, as are tundra rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   The elders, who keep thousands of years of history and legend without
ever writing it down, have long told children this story: If the ice that
freezes thick over the sea each winter breaks up before summer, the
entire village could perish.</TE>
<TE>   The children always laugh. Here in the Russian Arctic, the ground is
frozen nearly year-round. The ice blanketing the winter seas around the
Bering Strait is thick enough to support men dragging sleds loaded with
whale carcasses.</TE>
<TE>   Even Zoya Telpina, the schoolteacher in this outpost of 350 Chukchi
reindeer herders and marine mammal hunters, said that a winter sea
without ice seemed like "a fairy tale."</TE>
<TE>   But last winter, when Telpina looked from her kitchen window toward
the Bering Sea, she saw something she'd never seen in her 38 years: The
dark swell of the open ocean. Water where there had always been ice.</TE>
<TE>   Telpina's husband Mikhail, a 38-year-old dog-sled musher, has seen
mushrooms on the tundra shrivel and whole herds of reindeer starve. He
has cut open the bellies of salmon to find strange insects inside. He has
seen willows rise where he has never seen trees before.</TE>
<TE>   The changes are so widespread that they have spawned changes in the
Eskimo languages that so precisely describe ice and snow. In Chukotka,
where the natives speak Siberian Yupik, they use new words such as
misullijuq--rainy snow--and are less likely to use words like
umughagek--ice that is safe to walk on. In Nunavet, Canada, the Inuit
people say the weather is uggianaqtuq--like a familiar friend acting
strangely.</TE>
<TE>   What the residents of the Arctic are reporting fits convincingly with
powerful computer models, satellite images and recently declassified ice
measurements taken by Russian submarines.</TE>
<TE>   In the last century, parts of the Arctic have warmed by 10 degrees
Fahrenheit--10 times the global average. Sea ice covers 15% less of the
Arctic Ocean than it did 20 years ago, and that ice has thinned from an
average of 10 feet to less than 6.</TE>
<TE>   A group of scientists who spent a year aboard an icebreaker concluded
that the year-round sea ice that sustains marine mammals and those who
hunt them could vanish altogether in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy, already planning for an ice-free Arctic, is exploring
ways to defend the previously ice-clogged Northwest Passage from attack
by sea.</TE>
<TE>   Without the stabilizing effect of great land masses, the Earth's
watery north is exquisitely sensitive to warming. A few degrees of warmth
can mean the difference between ice and water, permafrost or mud, hunger
or even starvation for the inhabitants of these remote lands.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, explaining the quick thaw and determining its cause--whether
human or natural--has so far eluded the experts.</TE>
<TE>   There are few long-term climate observations from the Arctic: Weather
stations in the Far North are just 50 years old. And there is almost no
data from places like Russia's Chukotka Peninsula, only 55 miles from
Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   In their search for information, Western scientists are turning to
sources they once disparaged. In a rare convergence of science and
folklore, a group of scientists is mining the memories of native elders,
counting animal pelts collected by hunters and documenting the collective
knowledge of entire villages.</TE>
<TE>   These threads, which stretch back generations, may be the only way to
trace the outlines of the half-century of change that has resculpted the
Arctic and to figure out its cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all these people paying very close attention to the animals
they hunt and the sea ice they travel on," said Henry Huntington, a
scientific consultant in Alaska. "It's often extremely accurate and far
better than anything science has come up with."</TE>
<TE>   Native observations that at first don't seem consistent with the
warming--such as snowier winters and colder summers--also fit the
scientists' models. Warmer air is expected to usher more storms and
precipitation into the Arctic. Melting sea ice in summer can lower the
water temperature and lead to cooler temperatures on adjacent land.</TE>
<TE>   Despite parallel observations, Western researchers and Arctic dwellers
still look at each other suspiciously across a cultural divide. Many
scientists remain uncomfortable with any information that is not backed
by numbers and measurements. Many native elders resent scientists who
come ashore with their strange machines thinking they know more about the
place than those who live there.</TE>
<TE>   Others mistrust Western scientists who come to gather data and never
send back word of their findings. They still recall a group of
toxicologists who came to remote villages here several years ago to
collect women's breast milk to measure pollution levels. The scientists
detected organic pollutants such as dioxin and PCBs in the breast milk.
But the women say they were never contacted about the results.</TE>
<TE>   For scientists, the facts are mostly a matter of academic, and
sometimes political, interest. But for the natives, they may be a matter
of life and death.</TE>
<TE>   The subsistence hunters of Chukotka live in small villages without
pickup trucks or snowmobiles, without supply ships or supermarkets. They
have 19th century harpoons, small boats and limited fuel for their hunts.</TE>
<TE>   These villagers, almost entirely dependent on the icy sea for their
food, may be witnessing the demise of their ancient way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Caleb Pungowiyi, an Eskimo who works with scientists to record the
observations of his elders and peers, put it this way: "When this Earth
starts to be destroyed, we feel it."</TE>
<TE>   Ice is a second home for Gennady Inankeuyas, a 42-year-old hunter
considered the best harpooner on the Chukotka Peninsula. For years,
Inankeuyas has prowled the ice for seals and walrus, dragging heavy sleds
and animal carcasses over the frozen ocean. While he was butchering a
bearded seal last November, the thin ice cracked open beneath him.
Inankeuyas was pulled out of the frigid water, cut from his frozen
sealskin pants and revived. He was lucky: He did not lose any limbs to
frostbite.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Inankeuyas returned to the uncertain ice. He had to. "Of
course it's dangerous," he said. "But the village needs the food."</TE>
<TE>   That food is not as easy to come by now that the weather has changed.
"The south wind is a bad wind. It moves the walrus to another place,"
said a 42-year-old Eskimo hunter named Igor Macotrik. "The walrus is hard
to find."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists understand such observations. Their data show that the
walrus are declining, possibly because they also have to work harder to
find food. Walrus mothers nurse their babies on sea-ice floes. As melting
ice recedes, the walrus do too. Far from the coast, the mothers must dive
longer and deeper from the ice to the sea floor to find clams.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Eskimo hunters have also noticed that gray whales
have become extremely skinny. The meat of some freshly killed whales
smells rancid, "like medicine," said 28-year-old hunter Maxim Agnagisyak.
The sled dogs won't eat it. Some hunters fear the flesh is rotting
because the leviathans aren't getting enough to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are beginning to analyze samples of whale blubber from the
region to seek an explanation. For several years, record numbers of gray
whales have washed up dead and emaciated as they migrate to their winter
calving grounds in Baja California. This year's whale count is still
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Land animals are also under stress. Reindeer herds plummeted after the
Soviet Union collapsed and the government subsidies that helped sustain
the herds were cut off. The animals began starving, and their numbers
continue to decline, perhaps because they cannot forage beneath the
strange, brittle snow that the natives call misullijuq.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have not studied the reindeer herds of Chukotka, but they
have seen similar starvation in Canadian caribou. The grazing animals
normally survive the winter by nosing through soft, dry snow to feed on
the tundra vegetation insulated below. In recent warm years, winter rains
have alternated with snow, leaving an icy crust that is difficult to
penetrate and lacerates the animals' legs.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are only beginning to catch up with native observations on
many other aspects of the Arctic environment, such as tundra vegetation.
They are monitoring a tree line that is advancing north as the Arctic
warms. And scientists from  Russia, Delaware and Ohio have just started a
large-scale project to study the ground under the Eskimos' feet--the
permafrost--as it thaws.</TE>
<TE>   The stalwart Arctic people have survived for many centuries alongside
polar bears, seals and whales in conditions too harsh for other human
settlement. Their hold on the land is so tenuous and so subject to
disruption from the outside that anthropologists have predicted their
demise for two centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the Eskimos have defied the doomsayers. Nature has always
provided. But now nature itself has gone awry.</TE>
<TE>   Archeological evidence is scant, but it suggests that today's Siberian
Eskimos arrived in Chukotka from central Asia about 2,500 years ago. That
settlement would not have been possible without the massive global
warming that took place more than 10,000 years ago at the end of the last
great Ice Age.</TE>
<TE>   Melting ice submerged the Bering land bridge that the first Americans
had walked across some 13,000 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The waters that surround the Chukotka Peninsula today are among the
richest in the world. They teem with 25 species of marine mammals; 450
species of fish, mollusks and crustaceans; vast numbers of summering
seabirds; and innumerable krill and plankton that provide food for many
whales.</TE>
<TE>   The early Eskimos followed their prey. They lived in underground
houses insulated from the cold and moved among seasonal hunting camps.
They collected eggs from seabirds and salmon and plucked greens, berries
and mushrooms from the tundra. They hunted walrus, seal and whale. The
flesh of marine mammals, particularly maktak, the blubbery skin of the
whale, is still preferred by many to "European" macaroni and canned
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Ludmilla Ainana, a 66-year-old Eskimo, was educated by the Soviets in
St. Petersburg and now lives in an apartment in Chukotka's biggest town,
Providenya. Though she can now buy chicken and noodles and exotic
ingredients like soy sauce at a grocery, she still prefers the food of a
childhood spent at a coastal camp in a single yaranga, or reindeer hide
tent. "Walrus flippers with sea cabbage," she said. "It's delicious
food."</TE>
<TE>   When American whalers began arriving in the 1840s, they praised the
natives for their ingenuity and hired the men to kill whales. The whalers
left behind a taste for imported trade goods, decimated whale stocks and
a native population ravaged by measles, smallpox and flu.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, anthropologists warned that the native way of life was
doomed. But the Eskimos took to the whalers' improved harpoons and became
even better hunters. Still, the hunger for manufactured goods marked the
beginning of a long, slow shift from the old ways.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, the Soviets accelerated the process, introducing the
Eskimo hunters and Chukchi herders to jobs, wages and a steady diet of
imported food. They provided houses, schools, clinics and coal for heat.</TE>
<TE>   Families like Ainana's who had lived in scattered settlements were
relocated by the hundreds into villages such as Yanrakynnot. In a village
that once recorded 26 inhabitants in five households, the population
would swell to nearly 500, even though the land could not support so
many.</TE>
<TE>   "These were convenient for supply ships," Ainana said, "but the
hunting was very poor."</TE>
<TE>   For the Eskimo, food, livelihood and an animistic religion had always
been intertwined. They not only hunted the whale, they worshiped it.</TE>
<TE>   But the Soviets jailed the shamans and outlawed native whaling.
Instead, big Russian whaling ships caught the beasts and towed them to
shore. The job of the natives was to slice up the carcasses and feed the
meat to caged foxes being raised for their fur on the outskirts of
Yanrakynnot. There were no more ceremonies, no chanting by the elders, no
heroes returning from the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "People stopped hunting and they became butchers," said Igor Krupnik,
a Smithsonian Institution ethnologist and expert on the native people of
Chukotka. "This was a tremendous blow to their culture and their
self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   The young began to embrace Soviet imports, including vodka and
cigarettes. Many began marrying ethnic Russians. Their children received
Russian lessons and Russian names. They forgot how to hunt.</TE>
<TE>   That modernization came to an abrupt end along with the Soviet Union
in 1991. Almost overnight, there were no supply ships. No food. No coal.
No heat.</TE>
<TE>   Ainana spent years struggling to preserve the Eskimo culture, but now
watches from an upper-story gray concrete-block apartment as it
evaporates.</TE>
<TE>   The warming of the Arctic, coupled with years of intense social
stress, she said, has had "a terrible effect on lifestyle and health."</TE>
<TE>   Villages shrank as families moved to the cities to find work and food.
Infant mortality, suicide, disease and alcoholism all took a toll.</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of the Russian Arctic, life expectancy dropped to about
37 years. A 1989 census found 1,400 Eskimos in Chukotka. The population
is now estimated to be 700. Yanrakynnot's population in 1989 was 448;
today it has 100 fewer residents.</TE>
<TE>   Those who remained tried to resurrect subsistence hunting--even though
no one really knew how.</TE>
<TE>   Macotrik, the hunter from the relocated Eskimo settlement of Novoye
Chaplino, filled two small boats with young men and bravely headed out to
chase 50,000-pound whales. There were accidents and deaths. Some were the
fault of storms and rough seas; others were caused by inexperience.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the old generation passed away--the ones that knew how
to approach the whale, how to use the darting gun," said Macotrik as he
sat in a dank hunting cabin cleaning the Kalishnikov rifle he would use
in the next day's whale hunt. "We started from zero."</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Alaskan cousins who provided boats, gear and even
hunting lessons, the Russian Eskimo once again surprised the doomsayers.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched with amazement as these people restored their whaling,"
said anthropologist Krupnik. "We were wrong to say the Soviet Union had
dealt them a mortal blow."</TE>
<TE>   Macotrik and his young crew have been bringing in whales since 1997,
helping feed their impoverished village and salvaging some of their
ancient pride.</TE>
<TE>   "Walrus, seal and whale," Macotrik said. "It's not just our food. It's
our history and tradition."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear if the changing climate will let them. With scientists
still debating the trajectory of change in the Arctic, the fate of the
Siberian Eskimo remains as uncertain as the Arctic ice in late spring.</TE>
<TE>   Hunters with tiny boats and little fuel must now go much farther out
to sea for food. Sometimes they return empty-handed. Sometimes they
return with prey unusual for the season, or fish native to warmer waters.
Sometimes, when the seas are rough, they do not return at all.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of the plight of the Arctic people by environmental
activists hoping to draw attention to the issue of global warming.</TE>
<TE>   But Eskimo leaders, who repeatedly ask foreign visitors "Are you a
Greenpeace?" are wary of that attention and of Western environmentalists,
who often oppose their whaling.</TE>
<TE>   The hunters willingly talk about the many changes they see around
them. But they don't spend much time worrying about climate change.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, they have more pressing concerns: gathering enough
ammo for the spring hunt and stretching their limited supply of stored
whale meat.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that the Eskimo will once again adapt--to new food
species that could move north with the shifting temperatures, and to a
new economy that could bring tourism, jobs, and enough money for faster
boats and better weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The Eskimos have a haunting reminder of the instability of Arctic
life--one that still spooks hunters from Yanrakynnot as they pass it on
their way to the open sea. It is an island called Yttygran. On the beach
lie 60 massive bowhead whale skulls arranged geometrically. Huge whale
jawbones stand upright among them like sentries.</TE>
<TE>   This is "Whalebone Allee," a shrine to the whale, built in the 13th or
14th century. It is the abandoned construction of a relatively large and
organized civilization, with an amphitheater and 120 stone meat lockers
that still contain mummified whale meat.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Eskimos have no connection with the people who built this,
said Krupnik, the Smithsonian anthropologist who helped excavate the site
in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   That society simply vanished, much like the Viking settlements in
Greenland that flourished for several hundred years only to disappear
when the Arctic climate cooled in the 15th century.</TE>
<TE>   Why did the builders depart? Where did they go? "We don't have a
clue," Krupnik said. "It's an example of how precarious life is in the
Arctic."</TE>
<TE>   It is also an example of what climate change can do. For hundreds of
years, the skulls of Whalebone Allee stood undisturbed in precise rows.</TE>
<TE>   But last winter, a massive ridge of ice, warmed and weakened by an
early thaw, pushed ashore and rammed the line of whale bones. After more
than 700 years of perfect alignment, the relics now lie askew.</TE>

<HD>Some in S. Korea Opt for a Trim When English Trips the Tongue</HD>
<DH>Asia: Parents are turning to specialty preschool and even surgery
to give their children a linguistic advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>In a swank neighborhood renowned for designer boutiques and plastic
surgery clinics, anxious parents drag frightened toddlers into Dr. Nam Il
Woo's office and demand that he operate on the children's tongues.</LD>
<LD>   It is a simple procedure: Just a snip on a membrane and the tongue is
supposedly longer, more flexible and--some South Koreans believe--better
able to pronounce such notorious tongue-teasers for Asians as the English
word "rice" so it does not sound like "lice."</LD>
<LD>   "Parents are eager to have their children speak English, and so they
want to have them get the operation," said Nam, who performs about 10
procedures a month, almost all on children younger than 5, in his
well-appointed offices in the Apkujong district here. "It is not cosmetic
surgery. In some cases, it really is essential to speak English
properly."</LD>
<TE>   In this competitive and education-obsessed society, fluent and
unaccented English is the top goal of language study and is pursued with
fervor. It is not unusual for 6-month-old infants to be put in front of
the television for as long as five hours a day to watch instruction
videos, or for 7-year-olds to be sent out after dinner for English cram
courses.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean parents will spend the equivalent of a month's salary
here on monthly tuition at English-language kindergartens and up to $50
an hour for tutors. Between the after-school courses, flashcards, books
and videos, English instruction is estimated to be a $3-billion-a-year
industry--and that doesn't include the thousands of children sent abroad
to hone their skills.</TE>
<TE>'National Religion'</TE>
<TE>   In another display of linguistic zeal, the Seoul city government
recently set up a hotline for citizens to call if they see English
spelling or grammar mistakes on public signs.</TE>
<TE>   "Learning English is almost the national religion," said Jonathan
Hilts, the host of a popular English-language talk show on South Korea's
Educational Broadcasting System.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, a backlash is developing against the mania.
Linguists warn that children pushed too early or too hard to learn the
language might end up in linguistic limbo, speaking neither English nor
Korean with skill. Child psychiatrists report cases of preschoolers
suffering anxiety from too much pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "English makes children's lives hell!" declared a recent cover story
in the weekly magazine Dong-A.</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial aspect of the English craze is the tongue
surgery, which critics say is unnecessary. The procedure, known as
frenectomy, has been used for years to correct a condition popularly
known as "tongue-tie," in which the thin band of tissue under the
tongue--the frenulum--extends to the tip. If the tongue can't easily
touch the roof of the mouth, it is difficult to pronounce some sounds.</TE>
<TE>   No statistics exist in South Korea about the number of such
operations, which usually are done in private clinics. However, doctors
say the procedure's popularity has soared with the boom in English
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a recent phenomenon," said Jung Do Kwang, an ear, nose and
throat specialist at the Hana Nose Institute in Seoul. "Korean mothers
have a fervor for education. They think it will make their children
fluent in English."</TE>
<TE>   Jung said the operation involves a simple cut in the frenulum, which
takes as few as 10 minutes and can be done as outpatient surgery with
local anesthetic. It usually costs between $230 and $400.</TE>
<TE>   Jung said it helps pronunciation in English and Korean if the
procedure is performed on a child younger than 5 and if the patient has a
tongue that is genuinely too short or inflexible.</TE>
<TE>   "If the tongue is really short, you can't pronounce Rs and Ls
properly," Jung said. "But this condition is relatively uncommon, and you
get 10 times as many parents who want the operation as children who
really need it."</TE>
<TE>   A study published in 2000 of 37 children who had undergone the
operation was inconclusive because young people usually cannot pronounce
words properly until about age 9, according to Koh Joong Wha, a throat
specialist who wrote the study.</TE>
<TE>   "This operation is taking place more than in the past. The reason
being that the younger generation is affluent and having no more than two
children, they pay a lot of attention to each child and their
expectations of their children are getting higher," Koh said. "And, of
course, there is the income these operations generate, so doctors are
reluctant to say no."</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, the operation is most often performed in the fashionable
Apkujong neighborhood, especially near a strip known as Rodeo Street.
Interspersed among designer stores such as Gucci and Jil Sander are
dozens of clinics specializing in plastic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Nam, a former professor at Seoul National University who specializes
in jaw reconstruction, runs the Cleo Plastic &amp; Dental Clinic in a sleek
new building, upstairs from a chic cafe aptly called Plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the parents who bring their children in for surgery, he said,
were themselves frustrated by an inability to learn English and want
their children to have an easier time. "Some people blame the length of
the tongue instead of recognizing how difficult it is to learn a foreign
language," he added.</TE>
<TE>Language Differences</TE>
<TE>   Linguists also sneer at the idea that South Koreans' tongues are too
short to speak English properly, pointing to the unaccented speech of
hundreds of thousands of Korean Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, since Westerners are taller they might have longer tongues. But
this operation lengthens the tongue by only a millimeter or two and that
has nothing to do with it," said linguist Lee Ho Young at Seoul National
University. The real problem for South Koreans, as for Japanese, is that
their own languages make no distinction between Ls and Rs, so their ears
cannot detect the difference, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Although English has long been the most popular second language here,
people say enthusiasm picked up after the Asian financial crisis of 1997,
when hundreds of thousands lost their jobs and South Korea turned to the
International Monetary Fund for a bailout. That episode brought home for
South Koreans just how vulnerable they are to the international economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The 21st century globalization school" is the slogan of the Phillip
School, painted on the side of its shiny bus, although many students
arrive in chauffeur-driven foreign cars.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which opened last year in Apkujong, was the first English
preschool in Seoul aimed at South Koreans. The students, as young as 18
months, are taught exclusively in English, except for two hours a week
when they have Chinese lessons. Although tuition runs to nearly $800 a
month, a steep price by South Korean standards, there is a waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Child psychiatrists do not dispute the importance of English, but they
warn that South Koreans might be going too far.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents are very competitive here," said Shin Yee Yin, a psychiatrist
at Yonsei University. "They feel the only way to enhance social class is
to educate the children well, and if the children can speak English like
a native they are guaranteed success. But the children, they lose hair,
they bite their nails, they have sleep terrors. There is too much
pressure from the mothers and teachers to learn English."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Shin has treated two patients--ages 4 and 2--who had
the tongue operation and a larger number who have what psychiatrists here
have identified as a syndrome caused by spending too much time watching
language-training videos. Shin, who has lectured about this syndrome at
international conferences, said it has been reported in only two
countries: South Korea and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "These children watch videos maybe five hours a day," Shin said. "They
know a lot of words in English, like 'chair' and 'table,' but they speak
like robots in a monotonous accent and cannot communicate properly."</TE>
<TE>   All this is bewildering to parents struggling to do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole society is going for English," said Kim Yeon Ju, a
34-year-old homemaker whose 6-year-old son has studied the language for
three years and now attends English-language kindergarten. "My children
will learn Korean at home, so they can go to school in English."</TE>
<TE>   Another mother, Kim Young Pun, a fashion designer in her early 40s, is
conflicted about whether to get a tongue operation for her 14-month-old
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so difficult to know what to do," Kim said. "At first when I
heard about this operation, I was shocked by the idea. But a mother's
ambition for her child is unlimited. You don't want them to miss any
opportunity."</TE>

<DH>India: Suspected Islamic militants toss grenades at Hindu temple.
Twenty people are injured.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India
</DL>
<LD>Suspected Islamic militants threw several grenades and exchanged
gunfire with police Saturday at a 150-year-old Hindu temple in the
Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, police said. Ten people were killed
and 20 were injured.</LD>
<LD>   The Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front, a rebel group whose leadership is
based in Pakistan, later claimed responsibility in a telephone call to
the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   "We have done this because of violence against Muslims in India," said
a caller who identified himself as an aide of Bilal Beg, the group's
leader. "This is just the beginning."</LD>
<TE>   Police said two attackers got out of a white van at the temple, which
is in a crowded shopping district in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu
and Kashmir state, and began launching the grenades.</TE>
<TE>   One man carried a gun into the temple, and a shootout with security
forces followed, authorities said. The man was later found dead inside
the building.</TE>
<TE>   A second suspect was killed before he could enter the shrine, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four policemen and four civilians also were killed, officials said.
Most of the injured were civilians. Doctors at Government Medical College
Hospital in Jammu said five of those hurt were in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were searching for the driver of the van.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the temple, which honors the god-king Ram, the floor was
littered with cartridges and stained with blood. Shops and businesses in
the city closed after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan released a
statement condemning terrorism "anywhere and in all its forms and
manifestations."</TE>
<TE>   The Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front is one of more than a dozen
Islamic groups fighting for the Kashmir region's independence from mainly
Hindu India.</TE>
<TE>   In another assault Saturday, suspected guerrillas ambushed and killed
two army soldiers in Baramulla, a town 35 miles north of the state's
summer capital, Srinagar, said M. Amin Shah, deputy inspector general of
police.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, a Pakistani military spokesman said a boy, 4, was
killed and five people were wounded during gunfire and shelling by India
across the frontier in the northern Bhimber area of Kashmir.</TE>

<HD>Kabul Peacekeepers Come Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Asia: Shots reportedly are from Afghan force's site. No one is
hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>For the first time in a month, international peacekeepers came
under fire while patrolling in the Afghan capital, the multinational
force said Saturday. The gunfire was believed to have come from a
compound housing militiamen from the Afghan alliance that helped the
United States oust the Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   No one was hurt when the burst of more than 10 rounds struck the
ground and a wall just 30 yards from an armored patrol of German
peacekeepers, said spokesmen for the multinational force charged with
keeping order in Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred Friday afternoon near a compound of the Northern
Alliance, a militia composed largely of ethnic Tajiks and other northern
Afghan minorities that was aligned with the U.S.-led coalition in the
war.</LD>
<TE>   The shots, fired in a district of eastern Kabul, appeared to be
intended to draw the attention of peacekeepers but were not aimed to hit
them, said Lt. Col. Ludwig Gedicke, a spokesman for the German contingent
in the force.</TE>
<TE>   Flight Lt. Tony Marshall, a British spokesman for the peacekeeping
force, said the gunfire was believed to have come from the compound.</TE>
<TE>   After the shots were fired, the peacekeepers jumped from their
vehicles and searched the rooms of the nearby compound but found only an
elderly man, Gedicke said.</TE>
<TE>   In two earlier incidents, in late February, British peacekeepers

<HD>Bin Laden Aide May Be in Custody</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Authorities are trying to determine whether man seized in
raid is Al Qaeda official.</DH>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. and Pakistani authorities are trying to determine whether an
Arab arrested in raids here last week is a key lieutenant of Osama bin
Laden, a senior police official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The man bears a strong resemblance to Abu Zubeida, Bin Laden's senior
field commander, who is believed to be trying to reorganize the Al Qaeda
terrorist network after the collapse of Taliban rule in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "We are trying to confirm the identity of one Arab who is believed to
be Abu Zubeida," said Javed Iqbal Cheema, a senior Interior Ministry
official.</LD>
<TE>   The man is among 60 people, including 25 Arabs and four Afghans, who
were arrested Thursday in raids by Pakistani and American agents in
Faisalabad, Lahore and Multan.</TE>
<TE>   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
authorities were waiting for information from the United States to help
in determining the man's identity.</TE>
<TE>   If the man is Abu Zubeida, he would be the most important Al Qaeda
official captured by the U.S.-led coalition since military operations
began in Afghanistan on Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida, 30, is believed to have been born in Saudi Arabia but to
have strong ties to Jordan and the Palestinian territories. He has been
sentenced to death in Jordan and is believed to be connected to many of
Al Qaeda's operations against U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani newspapers and witnesses said the raids were carried out by
mixed teams of Pakistani and American agents who seized weapons,
computers and documents. One suspect was killed and five people,
including a police officer, were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The raids appeared to be linked to the investigation into a March 17
grenade attack on a Protestant church in Islamabad in which five people,
including two Americans and the assailant, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   President Pervez Musharraf's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi,
denied that Americans participated in the raids. U.S. officials have
refused to discuss the operation.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A convoy of 50 Sputnik-era trucks labors along the desert highway,
unable to keep pace with the dust ghosts whipped up from the scabbed soil
by the wind. Inside are several hundred tons of wheat, seeds and
household goods, as well as 1,293 refugees from drought, headed back to
the land that rejected them.</LD>
<LD>   They are two hours behind schedule. It is past noon, and Ondrej
Zapletal, a Czech aid worker leading this ragtag exodus, watches his
best-laid plans wisp away like those dust bowl specters. Already the
trucks are wheezing to a halt by the side of the road. Wheels are off,
hoods creak open, hammers clang against metal.</LD>
<LD>   "These are not trucks; this is debris," Zapletal says.</LD>
<TE>   This is the ground war on drought and hunger in Afghanistan. In three
hours since leaving the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the
trucks have covered just 45 miles. And this is over flat, paved road. In
10 more miles, Zapletal knows, they'll hit the sinuous 50-mile track that
climbs through ravines and gulches to the 6,000-foot-high tablelands
where these peasants once made a living. If darkness beats them, it will
be hard to make out the red paint splashed on roadside rocks to mark
minefields. After dark, Afghanistan is a land of surly militias, roving
bandits and things that go boom in the night.</TE>
<TE>   Zapletal heads local operations for People in Need Foundation, a
shoestring nongovernmental group from the Czech Republic that is leading
the effort to return the first of Afghanistan's estimated 1.2 million
internally displaced people--IDPs in aid parlance--to their homes in time
to plant for the fall harvest.</TE>
<TE>   By month's end, the IDPs and about 6 million other hungry Afghans
would no longer get free food from international aid organizations such
as the World Food Program, or WFP, which was struggling to switch to
food-for-work programs.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the convoy crawls east, the WFP, the top food provider, is
spending much of its time and energy--as well as $1.2 million a month--to
survey villagers by helicopter and draw up a map of their hunger.</TE>
<TE>   Grass-roots aid organizations that have resorted to rickety trucks and
even donkeys say they need no map but could use money and better
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. gets big money for vehicles, rent, salaries of their staff,
and now they are paying $1.2 million a month for an assessment? Is it
logical?" asks Abdul Saboor, a manager with the International Rescue
Committee, a New York-based nonprofit group that deals with hunger and
refugee issues.</TE>
<TE>   The WFP contends that it needs information for the next phase of aid
and that it wants to see how much conditions have changed since the last
mapping, in July.</TE>
<TE>   Even those critical of the WFP acknowledge that the agency staved off
disaster with a massive food giveaway--300,000 tons were delivered from
November through February, according to WFP spokesman Khalid Mansur in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the story of Afghanistan's famine is that there is no
famine at all. And more rain and snow have fallen this winter than in
three previous years, greening many river valleys in the north.</TE>
<TE>   But looks can be deceiving in the hunger business. Villagers
throughout the north are scouring for wild spinach, various tubers and
bulbs, which they have not eaten in appreciable amounts since the last
drought almost 30 years ago. Many farmers have depleted their seed stocks
and sold off their oxen, cows, sheep and goats. In some areas, camels and
donkeys pull plows. In others, farmers crack the topsoil with hoes and
spades.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's agriculture, from which 80% of the population earns a
living for the most part growing grains such as wheat and sorghum, must
be rebuilt from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's show time," says Raymond Jordan, country coordinator for the
Irish aid organization GOAL. "The winter has been survived. It's between
now and next winter that we have to make an impact on rural communities."</TE>
<TE>Restoring Communities</TE>
<TE>   Zapletal wants to start by repopulating rural communities abandoned in
the last three years. With sponsorship from the International
Organization for Migration, he gathered Japanese wheat and bought seed
with Czech and American funds, packing them in trucks that the
Geneva-based IOM rented for $40 a day each.</TE>
<TE>   As Zapletal is learning, rebuilding Afghanistan requires improvisation
and blind luck. The latter appears to be in short supply by midday.
Zapletal waves the lead trucks to the shoulder of the road in a town
called Sayad, where almond trees blooming beside a brook provide an
incongruously lush speck in an otherwise bleak landscape. The drivers
insist on lunch and afternoon prayers. Passengers scramble to dip jugs
into a milky green pond and drink. Drivers refill their radiators, while
others replace crushed ball-bearings, oozing grease onto the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely going to regroup the convoy, because in the
mountains there are mines, and it's very dangerous for the trucks--if we
can call them trucks," Zapletal explains.</TE>
<TE>   It is 2:45 p.m. before the last truck is repaired and the convoy gets
underway, and 45 minutes later they're on dirt roads. The convoy
stretches out more than a mile, the drivers spreading out to let the
contrails of dust kicked up by the trucks float out of their path.</TE>
<TE>   They snake up a narrow gorge, past a burned-out Russian tank. Soviet
troops fought pitched battles here with moujahedeen warriors during the
1980s. The roadside is strewn with empty mortar casings, and trenches and
battlements on the high points are abandoned. Soon, telltale red slashes
appear on roadside rocks, left by HALO Trust, an international de-mining
group.</TE>
<TE>   By 5:50 p.m., the first passengers to board have been on the trucks
for 12 hours. When they stop for Asr, the evening prayers, the sun blazes
dead-even with the edge of the plateau, casting lengthy shadows behind
prostrate believers. Daylight can be measured in minutes; the road ahead,
in miles.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen trucks are woefully behind, broken down and in
various states of disrepair. Zapletal sends a vehicle back to guide them
and orders the rest to move on. Soon it is pitch dark and frigid.</TE>
<TE>   It is 7:45 p.m. when the low rectangular contours of the village of
Haji Mirge emerge in a starlit sky. A line of men parts from the wall of
a house, where they had huddled against the cold, waiting for hours for
the fellow villagers they have not seen in three years.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few happy greetings. Sharp words fill the air as
refugees assemble what they've packed--mostly blankets and clothes. Abdul
Ahmad, 51, pronounces himself happy to be home. He gathers his three
children, wife and four bundles of possessions and studies the
silhouettes of homes.</TE>
<TE>Identifying Displaced</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Ahmad had two cows, 20 sheep and an acre of land. A
year later, he'd sold all but the land and headed with his family for the
big city.</TE>
<TE>   His money lasted three months in Mazar-i-Sharif before he got a job as
a construction worker. When Ahmad heard that aid groups were opening up
refugee camps, he brought his family to one for the free food. It has
taken U.N officials and aid workers several months to disentangle the
urban poor from the legitimately displaced, sending most of 290,000 camp
residents back to neighborhoods of the northern city.</TE>
<TE>   People in Need Foundation has vetted lists for those who immigrated to
the city and checked with villagers to see who were legitimate returnees
to the land.</TE>
<TE>   Now in Haji Mirge, Ahmad heads off into the darkness as truck drivers
circle their rigs and fire up kerosene stoves to boil tea.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, Zapletal takes inventory: Five trucks that forked off
to another destination made it. But he counts only 17 trucks parked in a
field in the center of Haji Mirge. Two more have gone to outlying
settlements. That leaves 26 unaccounted for. Word comes by radio that 15
stragglers opted to stay overnight in a village two hours short of the
destination. But the remaining 11 are strung along the road for miles.
Zapletal dispatches several trucks to offload the goods from stranded
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   It has not been a good night for Ahmad, who found only two walls of
his house standing. "My family, when they saw the house collapsed, they
became upset," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In the daylight, Ahmad's gnarled left hand is visible--a 20-year-old
wound from a short-fused hand grenade intended for Soviet soldiers. Only
his pinky and half his thumb remain. He takes aid workers to see the
remains of his house and a one-acre field bordered by a mud-brick wall.</TE>
<TE>   There is no clinic or school in town, villagers explain on the way.
When Haji Mirge residents die, it's of tuberculosis, appendicitis,
typhoid and diarrhea. Few make the five-hour ride to the nearest city.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what people have been eating, villager Abdul Haq produces a
small bulb he calls tosla, the size of a small leek. Another hands over a
pale green weed he calls gawtarkan. "If cows eat this, they explode," Haq
jokes. "Imagine what it does to us."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad walks across his cracked field to the two walls, which stand
like an upturned bookend. His 14-year-old son, Habibullah, will help him
rebuild and plow, he says. Or he will ask neighbors. Or it will rain, and
the soil will become supple again. "God willing," he says, and leads the
way back to the trucks.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 a.m., aid workers are still calling out names for
handouts--three sacks of seed, one of wheat and a collection of pots,
pans and other housewares. An angry villager waves a sharp fence pike to
keep the crowd orderly and curious children at bay. Men amble forward and
humbly hand over their papers. Zapletal inks their thumbs and presses
prints beside their names. Then he swipes the back of their hands with an
X.</TE>
<TE>   It is 10:47 a.m. when Ahmad steps forward. Volunteers haul down the
last sacks of free aid he'll see. "Now I can make a new life and I can
plant my seeds," Ahmad says. "Then maybe it will rain, and in a few
months it will produce."</TE>
<TE>   Gripping with his good hand, Ahmad heaves a sack onto his back. Two
neighbors get the rest, but after 35 yards, the men drop the sacks and
the neighbors walk off. For a moment, Ahmad stands beside what is
supposed to get him through next winter and considers his options. He
asks an elderly man to watch his goods. Then he sets off to find a
donkey.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Bloodshed Hardens Resolve to Fight</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Dozens are hurt in a suicide attack in Tel Aviv. A police
officer in an Israeli Arab town dies in a gunfight with would-be bombers.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel was raked by another day of violence Saturday when a suicide
bomber blew himself up in a crowded Tel Aviv cafe, a police sergeant was
killed stopping two would-be attackers from entering the country and
Lebanese guerrillas fired mortar rounds at a military outpost in a
disputed border area in the north.</LD>
<LD>   If there had been any hope that the latest round of bloodletting would
give either side pause, that quickly vanished when Israelis and
Palestinians pointed to the day's events as a reason to strengthen their
resolve and press forward with the fight.</LD>
<LD>   The anger was palpable outside the scene of the third suicide bombing
to strike Israel in four days.</LD>
<TE>   "Kill Arafat!" chanted spectators who gathered near the charred
remains of My Coffee Shop, a popular gathering spot on Allenby Street in
central Tel Aviv. Referring to the 1993 peace accords, they shouted,
"Bring the Oslo criminals to justice!"</TE>
<TE>   It was about 9:30 p.m., the Jewish Sabbath had ended, and the streets
of Tel Aviv were teeming with people. Despite 18 months of violence, life
continues to go on in Israel, and Allenby Street was the center of it,
the hippest cafe scene in the country's most cosmopolitan city. Cafes,
pizzerias and kiosks were bustling with people.</TE>
<TE>   My Coffee Shop was packed with customers, some of whom had traveled
from Jerusalem eager for a night out and hoping that Tel Aviv would be
safer. Music was playing when a young man walked into the center of the
cafe and detonated himself.</TE>
<TE>   He was the only one killed. But the devastation left 32 injured, five
of them critically. Glass showered the street outside. Chairs and
fixtures burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>Al Aqsa Strikes Again</TE>
<TE>   Eran Katri was sitting outside quietly chatting with a friend when
suddenly there was a blast--then silence, then a shower of glass and
blood.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like a daydream, but then the blood began to flow and I saw
people lying on the ground shaking," Katri said. "I wouldn't wish this
experience to my enemies. To be honest, my friends and I were planning a
trip together, but now I realize this is not the time for trips, since we
are in a time of war and we must protect ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack. Al
Aqsa, which is affiliated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement, has staged increasingly brazen and lethal
strikes inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The group identified the suicide bomber--or martyr, as they call
him--as Muhanen Ibrahim Salahat, 23, from the northern West Bank town of
Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came even as Israeli tanks and forces had Arafat under
siege in Ramallah and after soldiers had spent the day systematically
searching and arresting Palestinian men in the West Bank city. The
message to Israel seemed clear: Its forces cannot stop militants from
entering the country.</TE>
<TE>   Israel heard the message and vowed to press even harder. A call-up of
20,000 reservists, the largest mobilization since Israel invaded Lebanon
in 1982, was expected to continue today.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another suicide attack, and we are facing more such attacks,"
said Gideon Ezra, the deputy minister for internal security. "Therefore,
we must prevent the entrance of such attackers by cutting off fuel
supplies, preventing cars from traveling freely--including cars with
Israeli license plates."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said another suicide attack was thwarted
Saturday--but at a cost. In Baqa al Gharbiya, an Israeli Arab town,
police stopped a vehicle at a checkpoint as it was headed to the Sharon
region along the coast.</TE>
<TE>Deadly Shootout</TE>
<TE>   First Sgt. Maj. Konstantin Zanielov, 23, was killed in a shootout with
Palestinians in the car--identified as Fathi Abed Gawad 21, and Majdi
Ameiri, 18. Police said the men were on their way to stage a suicide
attack. Both Palestinians were killed in the gun battle.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also sent tanks back into Beit Jala, a West Bank village, after
Palestinians fired a mortar shell into Gilo, a Jewish neighborhood on the
outskirts of Jerusalem. No one was injured in the attack on Gilo.</TE>
<TE>   As if to remind Israel that Palestinian militant groups are not its
only enemy, the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon fired machine
guns and mortars at military posts in the disputed Shabaa Farms area.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says the land was captured from Syria in 1967 and thus is not
part of any Israeli-Lebanese border dispute. Hezbollah insists that the
vacant pasture is Lebanese territory and must be returned, a position
disputed by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli warplanes retaliated by firing missiles at suspected Hezbollah
targets near Lebanese border towns. But the response was limited, and
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said that the government
had no intention of reacting any further.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no interest in reacting. We have no interest in opening up
another front," he said in an interview with Israel's Channel Two
television.</TE>
<TE>   In Tel Aviv, the nighttime explosion turned out to be far less lethal
than emergency officials had feared. Ambulances were called into the city
from the surrounding region and crowded Allenby Street.</TE>
<TE>   Tel Aviv is a vibrant city, one that has managed to maintain an aura
of normality despite the repeated and deadly attacks that have occurred
there since the current Palestinian intifada against Israeli rule began.
A suicide attack outside a disco last June killed the bomber and 21
mostly young people.</TE>
<TE>   But the persistence of the attacks, and the undeniable reality that no
one is completely safe, is wearing through the veneer that people have
built around themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Tali Doron, 46, lives in a suburb of Tel Aviv. Her parents were
pioneers, early residents of Israel. She has experienced nearly every war
and conflict that confronted the Jewish state and served as an officer in
its military.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis are tough," she said Saturday night after watching news
reports about the latest suicide bombing. "We are trying to do everyday
things. We were born in an abnormal situation. . . . I think, in some
way, we are survivors."</TE>
<TE>   But now she has a son in the army and a 17-year-old daughter, and the
nature of the conflict is strange and scary. "It is a different type of
war that my parents had to experience," she said. "There wasn't terror,
like we have today. You heard a siren, you went to the shelter. You
didn't have to be afraid to walk on the street. Now it is much tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the smoldering remains of My Coffee Shop, a witness who
identified himself only as David said: "I am going straight home--I'm
buying a plane ticket and getting out of here. Right now, every place is
safer than here. I don't want to be killed."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the explosion, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office
issued a statement. The essence? The fight will continue "using all means
possible."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Offensive Is Met With Criticism and Rage</HD>
<DH>Reaction: European leaders demand an immediate end to Arafat siege.
Arabs angrily take to the streets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>European nations demanded Saturday that Israel immediately comply
with a U.N. Security Council resolution and end its siege of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's compound.</LD>
<LD>   From Moscow to Paris, European governments also warned Israel that it
could not disregard Arafat, whom the Israeli government blames for not
doing enough to stop deadly attacks against its citizens.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be a grave mistake to imagine that the elimination of Yasser
Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Authority, could lead to
anything positive," French President Jacques Chirac told RTL radio.</LD>
<TE>   Israel has said it doesn't intend to harm Arafat, but it insists that
the raid on his offices is necessary to stop militant attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli siege provoked a second day of protests across the Middle
East. Burning American and Israeli flags, tens of thousands of protesters
took to the streets in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya and Yemen. Smaller
anti-Israeli demonstrations were held in Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Syria
and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, Israel's closest ally, joined other members of the
Security Council in approving the resolution Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia demands that the parties fully and immediately observe all
provisions of this resolution," Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov
said, adding that he was immediately instructing Russia's envoy to the
Middle East, Andrei Vdovin, to initiate talks with both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, whose country holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union, said the Israeli siege in the
West Bank city of Ramallah "will exacerbate a situation which is already
causing great instability and, most of all, a huge number of mortal
victims."</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, more than 1,000 people demonstrated against the policies of
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, many carrying Palestinian flags and
chanting anti-Israel slogans. Similar demonstrations were held in smaller
French cities and in Berlin, the German capital.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sent a message to Arafat,
through the Italian consul general in Jerusalem, to "express his concern
over the dramatic developments of the last hours and his hope that all
violence stop immediately."</TE>
<TE>   In Athens, a cross-party group of Greek lawmakers delivered a letter
of protest to the Israeli Embassy about the troop movements.</TE>
<TE>   "Any attempt against the life of Yasser Arafat will lead to extensive
bloodshed in the region," said former Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos, representing Greece's governing Socialists.</TE>
<TE>   In Turkey, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that Israel's actions
threatened the whole of the Middle East. Ecevit called on the United
States to rein in Sharon's government.</TE>
<TE>   In the Arab world, the support for the Palestinians was unqualified.
Jordan's King Abdullah II used a telephone conversation with President
Bush to urge him to swiftly intercede with Israel to end its "aggression
on the Palestinian people and the siege on President Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   After an emergency meeting of the Arab League, Secretary-General Amr
Moussa said its members disagreed with U.S. calls for Arafat to rein in
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "How [can Arafat act first] while Israeli troops are a few meters away
from his office?" Moussa said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said he was disappointed that
the United Nations resolution was not stronger, but he added that Israel
must abide by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, Foreign Minister Jack Straw appealed to both sides to show
restraint.</TE>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>First the tanks and armored bulldozers punched holes in the high
brick perimeter walls that shielded Yasser Arafat's headquarters and
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Then they smashed through the metal gates on three sides of the
compound, which takes up a city block. The black iron door that once
glided open for visiting dignitaries lay askew in the debris.</LD>
<LD>   Once they'd gained entry, the tanks and armored personnel carriers
roared into the Palestinian Authority president's parking lot and across
his helipad, homing in on three buildings that were the heart of the
headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat's offices, where he had been confined for more than three
months, are in the middle building.</TE>
<TE>   The building to the east is the intelligence division, where the
Israeli forces opened a garage-size hole in the facade and then strafed
it with sustained fire from heavy-caliber tank-mounted machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   The building to the west is the governor's offices. There too troops
opened a gap and blew a metal door off its hinges. Inside, they shot
through each room and tossed stun grenades for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   They also smashed the snack bar. A red soft-drink vending machine and
an ice cream stand protruded from the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   The region's most powerful army was a well-armed wrecking crew Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Piece by piece, Israeli forces were dismantling Arafat's headquarters,
his power base. With it, the army of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was
symbolically dismantling Arafat's legendary mystique as the ultimate
survivor. Arafat was no longer in charge but utterly besieged, trapped in
a couple of rooms, surrounded by the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon says he is dismantling the "terror infrastructure" that he
charges Arafat built and operated out of his headquarters, after the
Palestinian leader failed to stop a deadly wave of suicide bombings and
gun attacks by Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of Friday, the Israelis pounded the headquarters with
stun grenades--more for psychological impact than actual damage--and
fought sporadic gun battles with Arafat's guards. They shelled the
intelligence office, and snipers were posted in spots.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat was essentially caught in a pincers movement, with soldiers
inching toward him from two sides.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat used the time to grant one interview after another to
Arabic-language television stations and to telephone various foreign
leaders to appeal for help.</TE>
<TE>   The facade of the intelligence building was splattered with
copper-colored scorch marks. The air was full of grayish dust from the
debris, patted down periodically by a cold rain.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, head of the Central Command that
oversees the West Bank, said his forces had seized control of all of the
compound except the floor of the building where Arafat lives.</TE>

<HD>Bush Heightens Pressure on Leaders</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President tries to be forceful yet evenhanded toward
Sharon and Arafat as he breaks his silence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>President Bush broke his silence on the Middle East crisis
Saturday, telling Israel to follow "a path to peace" and demanding that
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat make clear his opposition
to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said that Arafat's security force must "do a much better job of
preventing people from coming into Israel to blow up innocent people" and
that the Palestinian leader must "stand up and condemn, in Arabic, these
attacks."</LD>
<LD>   "These aren't just isolated incidents," Bush said. "I mean, there's a
pattern, a routine, and a constancy. . . . Mr. Arafat could have done
more three weeks ago and could do more today. I have been disappointed in
his unwillingness to go 100% toward fighting terror."</LD>
<TE>   In the 36 hours since Israeli forces laid siege to Arafat's compound
in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Bush had avoided public comment. His
newfound visibility heightened pressure on Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon to step back from a conflict that has escalated
drastically in the last few days.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush spoke, television video showed the aftermath of the latest
explosion in Israel, a suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>Iran, Syria Asked to Rein In Terrorists</TE>
<TE>   The president spent an hour in the morning making a series of
telephone calls to foreign leaders--Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Jordan's King Abdullah II, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar,
who holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   In his public remarks, Bush called on Iran and Syria to use their
influence to restrain the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And he said his Middle East envoy, Anthony C. Zinni, will remain in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   In recent statements, U.S. officials, particularly Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell, had seemed to lean more heavily on Arafat. But Bush's
focus was on Arafat and Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Although he repeatedly said that Israel has a right to defend itself
against terrorism, Bush noted: "I urge that their government, the Israeli
government, make sure that there is a path to peace as she secures her
homeland. . . . They've got to keep in mind the need that there's got to
be a peaceful solution at some point."</TE>
<TE>   The president linked the situation in Israel and the Palestinian
territories to his broader campaign against terrorism, saying that
violence is the result of lack of resolve to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "All the leaders in the world must stand up against terror, must do
everything in their power to cut off the funding to terrorist
organizations, to prevent terrorist organizations from finding safe
haven," he said. "And that especially applies to Chairman Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe he can do a lot more to prevent attacks, such as the one
that just occurred in Tel Aviv. He's got a lot of forces. He's got a lot
of people that listen to him still."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, on vacation at his ranch in Texas, spoke in a two-room trailer
that he uses for secure videoconferences with officials in Washington.
Seated on a small rotating chair, he rocked back and forth, projecting a
relaxed appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to increase Bush's visibility in the search for a
cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinians reflected a sudden change
in the White House approach. Barely an hour before the president spoke,
an aide told reporters in Crawford that there was "only a very, very,
very small chance of seeing him" Saturday.</TE>
<TE>Pressure Mounted for President to Speak</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Bush had shunned any public statement, turning that
role over to Powell. Aides had considered the possibility that he would
make a statement today after attending an Easter service at sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   But pressure was growing for him to interject the prestige of his
office in the so-far futile efforts to restrain the suicide bombers and
the Israeli response.</TE>
<TE>   "The president just felt it was important to make a statement today so
everyone could hear the president of the United States reiterate the U.S.
position," said Gordon Johndroe, a White House spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Casting a broadened call for others in the region to take an active
role in seeking peace, Bush said: "The Iranians must step up and stop
sponsoring terrorism. The Syrians must participate."</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question, he said he had no evidence connecting
either to the recent string of bombings in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appeared to be going out of his way to be evenhanded.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand why the Israeli government takes the actions they
take. Their country is under attack," he said. "Every day there has been
a suicide bombing, and every day the government sees the loss of innocent
life."</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, I understand why some Palestinians feel so
hopeless. The loss of innocent life on the Palestinian side is too much."</TE>
<TE>   The president defended the United States' handling of the situation,
saying its role has been "very visible and . . . very active."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, aides described Bush as monitoring the developments in the
Middle East by telephone, getting frequent updates from Powell and
Condoleezza Rice, his national security advisor. There was a reluctance
to place him visibly in the midst of efforts to bring calm while
conditions were murky and fluid.</TE>
<TE>   But by Saturday, the president was more involved.</TE>
<TE>   He was briefed by Steve Biegun, executive secretary of the National
Security Council, the No. 3 NSC official and his chief foreign policy
aide here, Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made calls to the world leaders. With each expression of concern
about the growing violence, he reiterated that Zinni would remain in the
region and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to restoring the
peace process, Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke to neither Sharon nor Arafat. The president has met several
times with Sharon, but he has had no personal contact with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Arafat, he doesn't need a phone call from me. All he's got to do
is watch what I just said. And that message will be delivered to him,"
the president said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Powell planned to contact Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "He was supposed to have made a call, like, right now," the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's words did not go as far as a United Nations Security Council
resolution passed earlier in the day that called on Israel to pull back
its forces.</TE>
<TE>   But Johndroe said that didn't reflect any lack of support for the
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The president made the points he wanted to make," Johndroe said. "The
United States had a hand in crafting that resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The president's announcement, and responses to reporters' questions,
was relayed live over an audio line from his ranch. But video was delayed
until a tape could be brought from the ranch to the Crawford elementary
school, about seven miles away, where it was distributed to television
networks.</TE>
<TE>   After he spoke, Bush climbed behind the wheel of his white Ford pickup
truck, telling reporters before he drove off: "Clear out. I don't get
much practice."</TE>

<LD>   The final tally shows he spent $73.9 million to defeat Democrat Mark
Green and $2.5 million on his transition and inaugural ceremony,
according to his campaign staff.</LD>

<HD>A Sacred Sanctuary Wards Off Bulldozers</HD>
<DH>Development: As sprawl gobbles up old New Mexico towns, a church
known for healing receives its own miracle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHIMAYO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>A solemn, middle-age woman emerges from a tiny room off the chapel
of the Santuario de Chimayo and bursts into tears. A trickle of dirt
seeps from between the fingers of her clutched fist.</LD>
<LD>   The brown earth, scooped out of a hollow in the floor of the famous
adobe church, is believed by some to have healing powers. And, although
not all land here is considered miraculous, it has always been precious.</LD>
<LD>   Never more so than now, as small northern New Mexico towns--some of
them 300 years old--are being overtaken by development that's marching
inexorably from Albuquerque in the south to Taos in the north.</LD>
<TE>   Scores of local citizen groups are working to preserve the integrity
of the region and their timeless, traditional way of life--especially at
Chimayo. The church's cultural and historical significance has lent
urgency to preserving the open space around it. The efforts have been
largely successful.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish colonial church, which is a National Historic Landmark,
draws nearly 300,000 visitors a year. The visitations exploded last week,
Christians' Holy Week, when tens of thousands of pilgrims flocked here
seeking the miracles held in the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The pilgrims, called penitentes, walk (some even crawl) to reach the
church, some from as far as Albuquerque, 90 miles away. The procession
clogs the two two-lane highways leading to Chimayo and creates an annual
logistical headache for county authorities. Pilgrims walking with
crutches and using wheelchairs cannot use the sandy shoulder and often
spill onto the highway. Every year there are close calls between
motorists and pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   For believers and tourists--and now preservationists--the church is a
magnet. It was built to house a crucifix said to have been discovered in
the dirt here. As the legend of the dirt's curative powers grew, the
sanctuary came to be called the Lourdes of America.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the appeal is its pastoral setting along the Santa Cruz River.
The small church sits atop a hill with an outdoor chapel just below.
There, in the meandering valley, a pasture butts up to low hills, with
the Sangre de Cristo Mountains beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The village of Chimayo is nearby, but few buildings encroach on the
church. Leona Medina-Tiede, who grew up here and owns a restaurant near
the church, said the bucolic land is the perfect backdrop to Masses held
at the outdoor chapel.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer, horses and cows come to the fence and listen to the
Mass. I guess they hear the voices," she said. "It's so cute. They stand
by the river and listen to the priest."</TE>
<TE>   The quest to preserve this land began after a 22-acre parcel was put
up for sale and a developer in nearby Espanola showed an interest in
subdividing it into 30 lots.</TE>
<TE>   The Chimayo Cultural Preservation Assn. sought the help of the San
Francisco-based nonprofit Trust for Public Land. "The fear was that
someone would come in here and put in a mobile home park, which would
totally change the setting," said Jennifer Parks, the trust's project
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Parks began trying to acquire the entire 72-acre
tract that lies at the foot of the church.</TE>
<TE>   She quickly ran into a typical northern New Mexico land scenario: Many
parcels were divided into small tracts when land-rich patriarchs passed
their property onto their heirs. Over successive generations, the parcels
changed hands and siblings grew apart or their relationship devolved into
a full-on feud.</TE>
<TE>   Sorting out who owns what was difficult enough, but Parks also had to
negotiate fragile family dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different world up here," she said, standing at the rustic
outdoor chapel and gazing at the contested land. "Old Hispanic families
have a lot of history here. They have a special feeling about land and
what's done with it."</TE>
<TE>   Animosities have surfaced, but family members have a strong
determination to maintain the land as they have always known it, making
the preservation effort easier than many others. One by one, brothers and
sisters are agreeing to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall the land trust bought the first 17 acres, then conveyed the
land to Santa Fe County, which passed two bond measures to raise money to
preserve it as open space. Another tract of 27 acres is under contract
and could be owned by the county in the next few months. The total
acquisition is expected to cost $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Family and community members alike are closely watching the
process--and the land.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to help bring in the hay in that pasture when I was a little
girl," said Medina-Tiede. "I love this place and would like to see it
kept the way it is. It's so peaceful, and I think that's the way it
should be near the church."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bal grew up here, helping his father tend the family's 22 acres.
Bal is undecided about selling, mainly because he doesn't trust the
county to maintain the land properly. He said if he sells, he will place
a conservation easement on the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The land has been in my family for generations; it's my heritage," he
said, standing behind the counter in his family's gift shop across from
the church. "I watched my father work this land on his hands and knees,
as an old man who could barely walk. I will do everything I can to
preserve this as it is. The sense of peace the land offers, being so near
the church, I just can't see it being developed."</TE>
<TE>   The only other holdouts are Josephine and Seledon Martinez, who are
asking three times fair market value for their six acres, according to
the Trust for Public Land. The Martinezes say they would use the proceeds
from the sale of their land to set up a scholarship for local students.</TE>
<TE>   Josephine, 83, said her family always ran cattle and horses on the
pasture and grew hay and alfalfa. As a child, she climbed the
rattlesnake-infested hills behind the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hate to see them build on that," she said. "My brothers and
sisters all have this property--it seems like it is a bond, no matter
what. We all remember what our fathers and uncles did to keep this land
healthy. It is a very special place."</TE>

<HD>Mobile Treasure Trove of All Things Baseball</HD>
<DH>Museum: The traveling exhibit from the hall of fame in Cooperstown,
N.Y., is a provocative, gritty look at the national pastime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Vin Mavaro had been digging through debris at the World Trade
Center site for weeks, sifting the rubble for any signs of human remains.
And then he found a scuffed baseball.</LD>
<LD>   "It is one of the few recognizable items I have come across," the New
York City fire battalion chief wrote to a company whose name was printed
on the ball. "Being a baseball fan, coach and player, this ball has
become a symbol of hope for me. I'm happy to hear all of your employees
are OK."</LD>
<LD>   Mavaro's letter and the ball are mounted in a glass case at the
entrance to "Baseball as America," a huge exhibit of memorabilia from the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., that just opened here. And it
is a fitting beginning, because the exhibit--which comes to Los Angeles
on Sept. 21 as part of a traveling roadshow to 10 cities--is intended to
be a gritty, provocative look at baseball as a mirror of daily American
life.</LD>
<TE>   It's all here--from the fixing of the 1919 World Series in Chicago to
the 1981 eruption of "Fernando-mania" at Dodger Stadium. None of the more
than 500 items on display at the American Museum of Natural History has
ever been shown outside of Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was to tell the honest story of baseball, to tell it
straight and not make any judgments pro or con," said Ted Spencer, vice
president and curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. "We all love
the game, we all have favorite stories, but there's much more to it than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will find original, handwritten lyrics to the game's most
famous song, including a rarely sung introduction that tells of a woman
spurning a beau's advances before she welcomes him to "Take Me Out to the
Ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   For those fascinated by Dodger great Sandy Koufax, the show has one
true gem: The inflatable black rubber tube he used to protect his
arthritic left arm before bathing it in ice during the 1966 season, his
last.</TE>
<TE>   Another exhibit shows visitors how to master the basic pitches. For a
fastball: "Grip the ball with your index and middle fingers, cutting
across the wide part of the seams. Now, throw it 90 miles per hour!"</TE>
<TE>   The historical sweep of the show--ranging from the ball used in the
first game to charge admission (1858) to the bat Mark McGwire used to
club his then-record-setting 70th home run in 1998--is rich in
storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these stories are familiar to fans. A special audio exhibit,
for example, plays Lou Gehrig's emotional farewell speech from Yankee
Stadium, as well as the scratchy radio recording of Bobby Thompson's
dramatic home run that won the National League pennant for the New York
Giants in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Yet other tales may surprise. Curators have not simply recapped the
story of Jackie Robinson's battle to break the color barrier in 1947.
They display copies of the ugly, racist mail that Henry Aaron got as he
was on the verge of breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 home runs in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "We also exhibit a heartfelt letter that a fan wrote to Aaron, saying
how much he meant to him," Spencer said. "The idea was to show you both
sides of the coin, to say this is what life and baseball are all about."</TE>
<TE>   Fans will see the facemask of Bernice Gera--who fought to become the
major league's first female umpire. She triumphed after years of
lawsuits, yet retired after only one professional game in 1972 because of
mental exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   The wooden home plate from Zenimura Field, located in a Japanese
American internment camp during World War II, is no less riveting.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball, like American society, is not entirely free of the remnants
of discrimination," writes historian Jules Tygiel in an essay that is
part of a book published by the exhibition. "Minorities and women remain
underrepresented in the ranks of ownership and management. Episodes of
racism and sexism periodically mar the game."</TE>
<TE>   As they streamed through the museum last week, several visitors made a
point of showing their children both sides of the national pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you believe how stupid and prejudiced people were?" asked
Meredith Shepherd from New York, as she guided her son and daughter
through the Robinson exhibit. "It's hard to believe this could happen."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Anthony Palermo was telling his two young sons about the great
Latino ballplayers, and shaking his head over a 1962 Sporting News
cartoon that lampooned the way a famous Cuban outfielder spoke English.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who put this exhibit together don't pull any punches,"
said the father, wearing a Mets cap and jacket. "I wanted my boys to see
all these things, so they'll know the history as well as the fun."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, however, Palermo was fighting a losing battle. His sons
made a beeline for the cafeteria, which offers hot dogs from parks across
the country; the Fenway Frank, Milwaukee Brat, Chicago Red Hot, Texas
Corn Dog, New York Deli Dog, Cincinnati Cheese Coney and, of course, the
Dodger Dog.</TE>
<TE>   Ranting at the owners--and blasting greedy ballplayers--is also part
of the game, and the museum has a wing focusing on the business of
baseball. After years of superstar salaries, it's startling to read the
original copy of St. Louis Cardinal outfield Curt Flood's 1969 letter to
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, demanding his economic right to
negotiate as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   "After 12 years in the major leagues," he wrote, "I do not feel that I
am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes."</TE>
<TE>   The same display case has a copy of a briefing book compiled last year
by the agent for shortstop Alex Rodriguez, as he marketed his client to
several clubs. Rodriguez eventually signed a 10-year deal with the Texas
Rangers for $232 million.</TE>
<TE>   Money's corrupting influence is an old story in major league baseball.
As the New York Evening Standard complained in a 1908 editorial on
display: "Sentiment no longer figures in the sport. It is now only a
battle of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Yet sentiment has a way of outlasting the skeptics. When visitors
enter the natural history museum, they see the massive, cracked
cornerstone of Ebbets Field. The fabled home of the Brooklyn Dodgers was
built in 1912 and torn down after the team left for Los Angeles in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Few subjects whip up as much baseball nostalgia as the old Flatbush
club, and a glimpse of Ebbets Field, however minute, may be worth the $15
price of admission. Yet, as the exhibit points out, that's only part of
the story.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years ago next month, Dodger Stadium opened. And building in
Chavez Ravine--which required the forcible eviction of a sizable
contingent of Latino residents--is no less controversial in Los Angeles
than the 1960 demolition of Ebbets Field. Both left lingering scars.</TE>
<TE>   This is one more social injustice on which the exhibit touches all the
bases.</TE>
<TE>   On May 5, the New York museum will present a one-woman play by
dramatist Heather Woodbury depicting the simultaneous effect of the
Dodgers' move west on Brooklyn and Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   "The Brooklyn Dodgers and baseball are symbols of a childhood ethos,"
she said in a recent interview. "But they are also truly symbolic, in
this case of life and loss, like the proverbial home to which we cannot
always return."</TE>

<HD>For Easter, Bush Talks Faith, God Over Evil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>President Bush presented the war against terrorism in deeply
religious terms Saturday, as he marked the Christian Easter and Jewish
Passover as a period that tells the world "history is of a moral design."</LD>
<LD>   "Justice and cruelty have always been at war, and God is not neutral
between them. His purposes are often defied but never defeated," the
president said in his weekly radio address, expressing the hope that the
holidays will renew faith and bring comfort.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, who is spending the holiday weekend at his ranch in Central
Texas, has routinely presented the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and
Washington as the work of "evildoers." On Saturday, he said that after
this "terrible evil . . . America and the civilized world are now joined
together in a great struggle against enemies who have no regard for
innocent life."</LD>
<TE>   His remarks in the taped speech presented the holidays as a moment
that offers hope that religion can help heal the pain that accompanied
them.</TE>
<TE>   The holy days, he said, offer "some of the most profound hopes of
humanity," in which "we feel our reliance on the creator who made us. We
place our sorrows and cares before him, seeking God's mercy. We ask
forgiveness for our failures, seeking the renewal he can bring."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who says he experienced a new appreciation for religion as an
adult, used language rarely employed--and delved into ideas infrequently
addressed--by a president. And he sought to broaden his reach to many
religions and to those who do not believe in any religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans practice different faiths in churches, synagogues, mosques
and temples. And many good people practice no faith at all," he said.
"For those who observe Easter and Passover, faith brings confidence that
failure is never final, and suffering is temporary, and the pains of the
Earth will be overcome."</TE>
<TE>   "We can be confident too that evil may be present and it may be
strong, but it will not prevail," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to attend an Easter sunrise church service today in
Crawford. He plans to return to Washington later today and attend the
traditional Easter Egg Roll on the White House South Lawn on Monday.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AKRON, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>A former Roman Catholic priest, who has been spotlighted by the
national media for pedophilia, is under investigation for allegedly
sexually abusing the 6-year-old son of a man he allegedly molested more
than 20 years ago, Summit County authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The 41-year-old father, who grew up in Cleveland but lives in
Michigan, said that ex-priest Neil Conway molested his son repeatedly
last year on a farm inherited by the former cleric, said Capt. Larry
Momchilov of the Summit County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   No charges have been filed against Conway pending an investigation of
the new allegations, said Momchilov, who declined to comment further.</LD>
<TE>   Conway could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday edition of Cleveland's Plain Dealer reported that Conway,
now 65, has admitted molesting eight boys during his 22 years in the
priesthood but told Newsweek magazine and the "Nightline" news show that
he had conquered his pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified Michigan man said he forgave Conway years ago, the
newspaper said. He said he had even asked Conway to be his son's
godfather.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Cardinal Draws Criticism Over Policy on Sex Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Edward M. Egan says the archdiocese will review the
allegations before informing the police, if victims approve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>As many Roman Catholic Church officials across the nation rush to
cooperate with law enforcement officials in the burgeoning sex abuse
scandal, the New York archdiocese has been a notable exception.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Edward M. Egan, who has called pedophilia "an abomination,"
says the nation's third-largest archdiocese will refer cases of alleged
abuse to authorities--but only when the church determines there is
reasonable cause to do so, and only if victims' families do not object.</LD>
<LD>   His policy has sparked intense criticism, not just from church
opponents but from New Yorkers who have been traditional friends of the
archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   "This position is a huge mistake for him [Egan]," said former New York
Mayor Edward I. Koch, an Egan supporter and longtime ally of the
politically powerful church. "It's not the job of the church to screen
these cases--that's what the district attorney is supposed to be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Many other dioceses have taken a different course, referring cases
immediately to the police, whether or not the victims approve. In nearby
Long Island, for example, Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre
announced last week that church officials would voluntarily give
authorities the names of all priests accused of sexual misconduct with
minors.</TE>
<TE>   As controversy grows, some observers say Egan's policy, no matter how
sincere, reinforces the notion that church officials are more interested
in protecting themselves against lawsuits than protecting their flocks.</TE>
<TE>   Egan has roundly denounced such suspicions. But his problems worsened
recently when New Yorkers learned that, as bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.,
from 1988 to 2000, Egan had vigorously defended several priests accused
of sexual abuse and had allowed several of them to continue in their
positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The church has gone soft," said William Donohue, president of the
Catholic League of Religious and Civil Rights, in a CNBC interview.
"Where is the leadership?"</TE>
<TE>   Egan remained silent for weeks before speaking out last weekend on the
current scandal, and his policy has been criticized as too little, too
late. Some observers say New York church officials have badly misread the
depths of anger among the archdiocese's 2.4 million parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   A recent New York Daily News poll suggested 90% of New York Catholics
disagree with Egan's position on reporting sex abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   And his refusal to cooperate fully was a key factor in the state
Legislature's push last week to pass a bill mandating such disclosure, as
teachers and doctors are required to do.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure is passed, as expected, New York will become the 20th
state to require the clergy to make such information public.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the New York archdiocese, declined to
say whether Egan, 69, supports or opposes such legislation, noting that
"the [New York] State Catholic Conference [representing eight dioceses]
will monitor this for us." Zwilling also pointed out that the
archdiocese's policy of referring cases of suspected sexual abuse to
authorities--with its two exceptions--is strictly voluntary and not
required by state law.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this has been a public relations disaster for Egan," said
Jeffrey Stonecash, a Syracuse University political science professor.
"And the stories about his actions in Bridgeport have made the problem
worse."</TE>
<TE>   This month, the Hartford Courant published reports about Egan's
handling of suspected sexual abuse cases while he was in Connecticut.
According to legal depositions, Egan--who was trained in canonical
law--challenged the credibility of victims' stories, saying "very few
have even come close to having anyone prove anything" against a priest.</TE>
<TE>   In one deposition, Egan was asked by an attorney suing the archdiocese
if he was aware of the details about a priest accused of oral sex, sodomy
and beatings: "I am not aware of any of those things. I am aware of the
claims of those things, the allegations of those things."</TE>
<TE>   The Bridgeport archdiocese settled 26 claims against five priests
about 18 months later, admitting that "there were incidents of sexual
abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Egan has criticized the news reports as inaccurate, saying the
published stories "omitted certain key facts and contained inaccuracies."
He added that cases of sexual abuse in Bridgeport, including the referral
of several local priests for psychiatric counseling, "were handled
appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to "heal the Church" at a time of great national scandal, Egan
promised in a March 23 letter to New York parishioners that "should any
priest sexually abuse a child, he will be removed from the pastoral
ministry. My heart goes out to any and all victims and their families."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Egan's pledge, he has come under attack from New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg, the district attorneys representing each of the
city's five boroughs and a host of other elected officials. Normally
these politicians would think twice about locking horns with Egan in
heavily Catholic New York. But as many experts note, this issue is
different.</TE>
<TE>   "His policy and actions leave much to be desired," said Father Richard
McBrien, an influential theologian and professor at the University of
Notre Dame. "And I've said that, just as the Berlin Wall fell, so will
the Egan wall. Stonewalling just won't work now. He has to better explain
himself."</TE>
<TE>   It's been a rough baptism for Egan, who took over the high-profile New
York post on June 19, 2000, after the death of Cardinal John O'Connor.
Although he clashed with opponents over issues such as abortion and
homosexuality, O'Connor was admired for his gregarious personality. Egan,
by contrast, comes off as stiff, and he has yet to build the reservoir of
public support that might help him survive such turbulence.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now, after all these terrible stories have come out, I still
don't think he gets it," said Michael Dowd, a New York attorney who has
handled several sexual abuse cases against the church. "Egan and a lot of
his allies seem to be praying that this whole abuse thing will somehow
blow over."</TE>
<TE>   For those who know Egan, however, his stern demeanor and lawyerly
skills sum up his greatest strengths. He was born in Oak Park, Ill., a
Chicago suburb, and was a bright student who was attracted early to
service in the Catholic Church. Rising rapidly through the hierarchy, he
was made assistant vice rector in moral theology and canon law at
Pontifical North American College in Vatican City in 1960 and returned to
Rome in 1971 as judge of the Tribunal of the Roman Rota, the church's
highest appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Egan became an auxiliary bishop in the New York Archdiocese in 1985,
before being named bishop of Bridgeport. He was credited with being a
good administrator, and his defenders have noted that the sexual abuse
cases that he handled in Connecticut did not take place on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   For now, New York parishioners are taking a wait-and-see attitude
toward their new archbishop. Yet some observers believe Egan may have
done irreparable damage to his image by failing to take stronger action.</TE>
<TE>   "He's blotted his record," said McBrien. "In the beginning, he took
the stance that he wasn't going to say anything, so people shouldn't
waste their time. And now, of course, he's saying things. He has to."</TE>

<HD>Town's Goal: No Scofflaw Left Behind</HD>
<DH>Government: Ohio city raises revenue through traffic citations. The
policy makes it a laughingstock and ruins business, residents say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ROME, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Let the cruiser parked by the 35-mph sign as you enter town be a
warning: New Rome is in the business of issuing traffic citations, and
business is very, very good. So good, in fact, that one state official
says the village has become "the poster child of bad government in Ohio."</LD>
<LD>   Located along Route 40 on the western outskirts of Columbus, New Rome
is three blocks wide and 1,000 feet long. It has 60 residents and a
police force of 14. Operating out of a trailer a block off the highway,
the cops scurry around like mad 18 hours a day, writing so many citations
that traffic fines cover 90% of New Rome's $424,000 annual budget.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the department issued 184 citations and made 40 arrests.
Patrol officers bag motorists for going 2 mph over the limit. They
scrutinize vehicles for defective lights. They expect motorists to count
to three after braking at a stop sign. Their zero-tolerance policy is so
rigid that many locals drive around, rather than through, the village.
Others refuse to patronize New Rome's businesses.</LD>
<TE>   "This whole nonsense has made New Rome the laughingstock of Ohio,"
said Ed Anthony, the village barber and a newly elected reformist on the
six-member village council. "And I understand why people think we're a
joke. It's all about money, and frankly, I'm disgusted."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jeff Nourse, a trustee of surrounding Prairie Township: "We're
never going to be able to develop this area as long as people are
terrified to drive this stretch of highway. One Realtor owns 14
apartments here, and eight are empty. People won't move in. You might as
well tell them there's a nice unit available in a leper colony."</TE>
<TE>   Run for years by a village council whose members were related by
blood, marriage or business interests, New Rome institutionalized its
speed trap in 1970 and immediately saw village coffers grow flush. This
year, the council is spending $328,000 on its police department. It has
allocated nothing for public health, refuse collection, fire prevention,
public housing, recreation, street repair, firefighting or utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprising, New Rome's financial affairs have raised
suspicion among the state's watchdog agencies, especially since, over the
last decade, two clerks in the mayor's court have pleaded guilty to theft
of funds in office. Another resigned when a $56,000 shortfall was
discovered. A fourth has been charged with pilfering and is facing trial.
Additionally, the state auditor says, local officials have destroyed and
falsified records, not reconciled bank statements, discarded deposit
slips and been unable to account for large sums collected in court.</TE>
<TE>   "What our audits show," said spokeswoman Kim Norris, "is that records
have been destroyed and money is missing." It is not unusual, she added,
for the state to find problems in municipal audits, but "not theft year
after year. This goes on and on."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Cunningham, New Rome's $20,000-a-year police chief, did not
respond to interview requests. But he told the Columbus Dispatch in
January that he was doing all he could to keep village employees' fingers
out of the cookie jar. "Unfortunately, this is not unique to us,"
Cunningham said. "It happens to everybody--from United Way to whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Unique or not, the public's patience is running out.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bussey II, 28, a computer systems analyst, started a Web site
after getting a ticket in September. He's received 25,000 hits, mostly
from motorists complaining about what they consider police harassment.
"It's horrible when you're afraid to drive through your own county,"
Bussey said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, more than 100 people joined a peaceful protest that
Bussey organized outside New Rome's police trailer. Many wore T-shirts
emblazoned with the face of Barney Fife, the bumbling TV lawman from "The
Andy Griffith Show." A band, the Five Hand Gang, played on the porch of a
nearby house, and motorists honked and waved as they passed.</TE>
<TE>   More important, businessman Jamie Mueller stepped up last fall to
challenge the entrenched mayor, Charles Chapman, and his relatives and
friends on the village council. Mueller, running on a platform to reform
or abolish the police department and clean up the village, won the
backing of New Rome's 16 registered voters and was elected mayor. The
vote was 8 to 0.</TE>
<TE>   In a congratulatory letter to Mueller, one resident wrote: "I wish to
acknowledge you for your courage and your integrity and your intelligence
in attempting to clean up the stinking den of indolent, corrupt,
narrow-minded folks who run the mysterious village of New Rome."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller says he wants to sweep away the past. But, he added, "if we
can't fix New Rome, we should consider dissolving it" and making it part
of Prairie Township. To place the village's future on the November
ballot, he needs the signatures of 40% of the people who voted in the
last gubernatorial election. That's no small challenge in New Rome
because, in the 1996 election, no one voted.</TE>

<HD>Bush Regaining His Taste for Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Politics: Feeling pressure to retake Congress, he has brought in
about $12 million this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>President Bush, under pressure from fellow Republicans eager to
hold their slim margin in the House and recapture control of the Senate,
is beginning to embrace the role of presidential campaigner.</LD>
<LD>   Early in his tenure, Bush shied from fund-raising, seeking to set
himself apart from the openly aggressive approach President Clinton took
in building Democrats' treasury chests. Then, in the first months after
the Sept. 11 attacks, he ruled it out altogether, recognizing that
overtly political activity would have been unseemly.</LD>
<LD>   There is no such skittishness at the White House these days. Bush has
begun reaching out for dollars with the ease of a successful telemarketer
dialing busily at the dinner hour.</LD>
<TE>   By rough count, since Jan. 1 he has spoken at fund-raising lunches and
dinners that have brought in about $12 million, bringing his total as
president to roughly $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, on his way to Crawford for an Easter holiday at his
1,500-acre ranch, he stopped in Greenville, S.C., to raise money for Rep.
Lindsey O. Graham's race for an open Senate seat, and in Atlanta for Rep.
Saxby Chambliss, who is seeking to defeat incumbent Democratic Sen. Max
Cleland in Georgia. The day after Bush arrived at the ranch, he flew
aboard the Marine One helicopter to Dallas to boost the campaign of Texas
Atty. Gen. John Cornyn, who is running for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The three stops picked up about $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, that is the most he can do for a candidate this early in the
season. In the fall, he can encourage voters to go to the polls. But as
candidates contemplate their advertising budgets in the spring, a
presidentially enhanced bank account can provide the foundation for a
well-financed race to the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is the biggest piece" of what a president can offer, said
one veteran of Democratic presidential races who is watching the White
House's spring political calendar with interest.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond his willingness to speak once a week, on average, at political
fund-raising parties this season, Bush's shift to politics is most
visible in the message he is delivering.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, he is using his speeches to support the war on
terrorism--a message that serves to link his favored candidate with a
popular cause.</TE>
<TE>   But he also has been moving in recent days to lay out differences with
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Bush initially had been reluctant to follow such a course, because he
sought to ease away from the bitterness of the 2000 election campaign and
the dispute over the Florida ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But consider the message audiences pay $1,000 a head to hear these
days.</TE>
<TE>   He defends his tax cuts as a prescription to boost economic demand and
expand jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, some folks evidently don't understand that," he said at the
Chambliss dinner. "They've been reading a different textbook than Saxby
and I read. You see, they either want to delay the tax cut or raise your
taxes. We need somebody in Washington, a friend of the taxpayer, a vote
we can rely on."</TE>
<TE>   He embraces the idea of drilling for oil in Alaska's environmentally
sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, hailing Graham, for instance,
for supporting greater exploration of new energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   And he rails against the Democrat-controlled Senate's refusal to vote
on his nomination of U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. of
Mississippi to a seat on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "We need people like John Cornyn in the United States Senate who will
work with the White House to have a solid judiciary, to make sure that
the judges do what they're supposed to do in the United States and not
overstep their bounds," Bush said in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   It is a pace and message likely to continue throughout the coming
months, interrupted only by the demands of foreign travel--the president
has scheduled a trip to Russia, Germany and France in May, and another to
Canada soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   This week, he plans to be in Philadelphia to boost the Republican
gubernatorial candidate.</TE>
<TE>   His goal reaches beyond the midterm elections in November. Longer
range, the outcome will determine how much of his agenda is enacted in
the next congressional session. It could also test whether, if he seeks
reelection in 2004, he can run on his legislative accomplishments or
against a Congress that thwarted him.</TE>

<LD>Robert Iger and David Letterman had two things in common: Both
started their careers as TV weathermen and worked as production
assistants at the Indianapolis 500.</LD>
<LD>   It was a bond that Iger, now president of Walt Disney Co., thought
would give him an inside track in the company's attempt to woo the
late-night talk show host to its ABC network from CBS.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I really connected with him," said Iger, defending ABC's
highly publicized but unsuccessful bid for Letterman.</LD>
<TE>   Critics maintain that the pursuit of the talk show host proves that
news does not fit with Disney's plans. Had Letterman signed with ABC, the
prestigious news program "Nightline" would have been displaced from the
slot it has occupied for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't throwing the news division over the transom; it was going
after David Letterman," said Iger, a former ABC president. "I don't think
people have any idea of the level of which Michael and I are supporters
of ABC News," he said, referring to Disney Chairman Michael Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   Iger said the gambit was intended to seize an economic opportunity
that could have brought the network an additional half a billion dollars
in profit over five years. (Rival networks question that estimate.)</TE>
<TE>   "Because the numbers were so enormous, we felt that, even given the
potential fallout of news, that it was the right thing for us to do,"
Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in my position and you're focused on earnings per share and
shareholder value . . . you have to look at that very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Iger said that keeping the matter secret was a calculated and
necessary strategy to prevent CBS from quickly re-signing Letterman and
to avoid placing ABC News President David Westin in an untenable
position.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have said, 'David, I'm going to give you really bad news, but
you can't tell anybody.' What good would that have done?"</TE>
<TE>   Iger said his chief regret was in not stepping in sooner to defend the
quality of "Nightline" and ABC News. But he added that there's room for
improvement. The network needs more cutting-edge prime-time specials,
such as a recent program on Osama bin Laden that drew solid ratings, Iger
said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC trails NBC in the morning and nightly news races, though "World
News Tonight With Peter Jennings" is up 8% in viewership this season.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem with ABC News has been clashing corporate
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Iger acknowledged, for example, that he receives outraged anonymous
letters from news division personnel who bristle whenever Eisner sends
out companywide e-mails addressed "Dear cast member," reflecting Disney's
view that all its employees should be working toward the goal of
entertaining an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'm insensitive," he said of the complaints, "but get a life."</TE>

<HD>4 Injured as Tornadoes Blow Through Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THORNTON, Texas
</DL>
<LD>A tornado blew through a small Central Texas community Saturday,
damaging houses and injuring at least four people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The storm cut a wide swath east of Thornton, said Aubrey Briggs, mayor
pro tem of the city of about 500 people about 35 miles east of Waco.</LD>
<LD>   "It missed the city. It was pretty widespread and pretty destructive,"
Briggs said. "My sister-in-law saw it. She said it was just a red cloud.
It must have been sucking dirt out of the ground."</LD>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said several tornadoes blew through the
state Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A command post was set up at a school in Thornton, where several
people were treated for cuts and bruises and some were sent by ambulance
to area hospitals, Briggs said. Four people were taken to Limestone
Medical Center in nearby Groesbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Storm damage also was reported near Hico, about 65 miles southwest of
Fort Worth. Authorities said some power lines were knocked down there.</TE>
<TE>   Strong winds damaged part of a hospital and knocked out power to
several homes and businesses in the East Texas town of Atlanta, near the
state's border with Arkansas and Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Crow, administrator at Atlanta Memorial Hospital, said a glass
corridor connecting the hospital to administrative offices was destroyed
by wind.</TE>
<TE>   "It just took the top off. It happened really, really fast," Crow
said. "I drove around in town and I saw a couple of big trees, I mean big
trees you can't get your arm around. They were knocked down."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, flash flood watches and warnings continue for dozens of
counties in North and East Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling storm system should move out of the state by today,
forecasters said.</TE>

<HD>Urgent Calls for Peace in Mideast Ring Hollow as Prospects Dwindle</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Observers say the Bush administration missed its
chances--and now hopes are moribund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Is the Middle East peace process dead, dying or in a coma?</LD>
<LD>   In a public statement from his Texas ranch and in calls to Mideast and
world leaders, President Bush used strong language Saturday to reaffirm
America's commitment to the process. And he pledged that U.S. envoy
Anthony C. Zinni will stay in the region to try to mediate.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is very important for our country to provide an
opportunity for discussion, an opportunity for people to come together,"
Bush said. "So Gen. Zinni will stay there. He will stay there to continue
to push for a process."</LD>
<TE>   But the words rang hollow to vast numbers at home and abroad.
Prospects for ending the bloodshed or getting either side to talk about a
cease-fire, much less peace, now seem slim to nonexistent, according to
an array of experts and former U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no peace process. There is only a war process," said Martin
Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel until last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of [Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco] Franco when he was
brain dead but was kept breathing on resuscitation equipment until people
figured out the succession," said Augustus R. Norton, a Mideast expert at
Boston University and author of several books on the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mideast peace process launched in Oslo in 1993 has been brain
dead for a long time," Norton said. "But the vital signs in the corpse
have been maintained to keep the fiction that there's some possibility of
a revival."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and U.S. officials say Palestinian militants, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
share varying degrees of blame. But with yet another Palestinian suicide
bombing Saturday along with fresh Israeli missile attacks on Arafat's
headquarters--and no new action by the United States--the Bush
administration is also increasingly under fire for not doing enough to
avert or manage the mounting crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "While all this goes on, Bush fiddles in the White House or Texas,
playing Nero as the Mideast burns," Norton said. "It's very sad."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is coming under fire even among his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "The supreme irony is that the greatest power the world has ever known
has proven incapable of managing a regional crisis," said Geoffrey Kemp,
who ran Mideast policy at the National Security Council for the Reagan
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "A 2-year-old could have seen this crisis coming. And the idea that it
could be brushed under the carpet as the administration focused on either
Afghanistan or Iraq reflects either appalling arrogance or ignorance,"
Kemp said.</TE>
<TE>   He called the crisis a "wake-up call" comparable to the effect of the
Sept. 11 attacks in turning around policy.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that the United States now has few options and that the
hard realities explain Bush's limited actions and remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I suspect the reason is
that he's recognized that simply to insert himself into this mess without
any real possibility of achieving any success is, in and of itself,
dangerous, because it would demonstrate that in fact we don't have any
ability right now to control or affect events," Lawrence S. Eagleburger,
secretary of State during the administration of Bush's father, said on
CNN. "And I don't think we do."</TE>
<TE>   Even with Zinni's efforts in the region, others agree that the
confrontation may be beyond U.S. intervention for now.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably have to play out until something so horrific happens
that the United States and the international community will have to step
in and stop it. Conflicts like this go into a stage of madness, as in
Lebanon and Algeria, and this one is now entering that phase. It will
have to play itself out," predicted Judith Kipper, a director of the
Mideast program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleburger said the current crisis may be worse than the other
"murderous . . . and tough" Mideast wars over the last half a century.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody else sees any clear way of getting out of this
mess we're in now. It could go on for a very long time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the potential consequences extend well beyond the
Palestinian-Israeli crisis, many analysts warn. Eagleburger said the
long-term danger is that the violence will spill over and have a
"chilling effect" on the U.S. ability to pursue the broader war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The brewing backlash against the United States was visible Saturday in
Kuwait, the oil-rich sheikdom liberated from Iraqi occupation by an
international coalition mobilized and led by the United States in 1991.
Kuwait and the U.S. remain pivotal diplomatic allies and commercial
trading partners.</TE>
<TE>   But 11 years after Kuwait was freed, about 4,000 demonstrators rallied
at Flag Square in Kuwait City to denounce Israel and the United States.
With the speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament and other top ministers
present, the crowd shouted, "No god but Allah! America enemy of Allah!"
and "Muslims, Muslims unite. . . ! Death to Israel, death to America!"
the Reuters news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   In a reflection of shifting sentiments over the last 18 months, since
the latest Palestinian intifada began, the crowd also roared, "America
and Zionism are against the Muslim nation!" Rallying on behalf of the
Palestinians and against the United States is particularly ironic because
the Palestinians sided with Iraq, not the Kuwaiti monarchy, during the
1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The administration can't be blamed for the violence, but it can be
faulted for missed opportunities during the last year and a half that
have allowed the situation to spin out of control, said Indyk, who's now
at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The default position--which is not to be engaged as long as the
conflict does not generate regional instability--has at various points
along the way resulted in missed opportunities. And then at each stage
it's gotten harder and harder to intervene effectively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts point to a number of turning points that the United States
failed to capitalize on. One was after the June bombing of a Tel Aviv
discotheque, which killed 22 people, then the highest death toll in a
single such incident since the current intifada began. The Bush
administration showed little interest then in getting both sides to agree
to a cease-fire plan worked out by CIA Director George J. Tenet. It was
left dangling, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The second missed opportunity was at year's end, as the situation
quieted down, after Zinni had failed to win an agreement and returned to
Washington. Although U.S. officials insisted that the process was not
moribund, Zinni's three-week stay coincided with a huge upsurge in
violence that left about 100 Israelis and Palestinians dead from suicide
bombings and retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the United States said it would not send Zinni back to the
region until there was a lull in the violence indicating that both sides
were ready to talk. The administration stuck to that assertion until Vice
President Dick Cheney set out for the Mideast this month to explore Arab
sentiment about U.S. interest in a regime change in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Kipper said, is that "the peace process is in a coma."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Everyone--make that everyone--in Washington wants to make
prescription drugs more affordable for the elderly, especially the
poorest among them.</LD>
<LD>   "Now's the time" for Congress to pass a drug benefit, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the voice of the
big drug manufacturers, says in television and newspaper advertisements.</LD>
<LD>   But agreement ends where philosophy gives way to practicality. So deep
are the divisions that meaningful congressional action is a longshot this
year.</LD>
<TE>   The contentious debate over how to ensure access to prescription drugs
will probably force politicians to reconsider government's role in health
care and raise new concerns about influence of the powerful health-care
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade ago, President Clinton's national health insurance
proposal served this purpose, preoccupying Congress before being rejected
as too cumbersome and expensive. Now prescription drug coverage for the
elderly, though much narrower in scope, could have the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drugs taken outside the hospital are not covered by
Medicare. And thanks to the financially lethal combination of the drugs'
higher prices and their broader use, they are becoming an ever-greater
burden on the budgets of the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors' groups and consumer advocates are demanding that somebody
fill the gap between what the elderly need and what they can afford.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people now agree that this should be done, I don't think
Congress can afford to drag their feet on this," said John Rother,
director of policy and strategy for AARP, which has 35 million members
age 50 and older.</TE>
<TE>   Many political leaders have responded--but not with one voice.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has proposed letting the elderly buy into existing
private drug-discount cards. Cardholders would receive substantial
discounts from drug companies, which would benefit by gaining access to
huge sources of potential customers.</TE>
<TE>   The discount cards, which would cost the government little, are
intended as a stopgap on the way to broader Medicare reform, which the
administration has proposed funding at $190 billion over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But community pharmacists and retail drugstores fear that the
government-endorsed discounts would come out of their profit margins.
They have sued in federal court to block Bush's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The big companies that make the familiar brand-name drugs also oppose
other efforts to make prescription drugs more affordable. They have
revved up their formidable lobbying machine to oppose state cost-control
measures and federal legislation that would favor lower-cost generic
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for PhRMA said a Medicare prescription drug benefit would
lead to government regulation of drug prices just as surely as Medicare's
basic coverage led the government to regulate the delivery of medical
care to the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   AARP has been concerned primarily with the size of a prescription drug
benefit. Like PhRMA, it believes any benefit should be voluntary: The
elderly should be able to use an annual Medicare grant to buy insurance
on the private market. If the government premium for drug coverage is too
high, AARP says, the elderly simply won't buy that type of coverage. It
estimates the 10-year cost of an adequate drug-benefit program at as much
as $750 billion over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The need for prescription drug coverage has grown urgent because three
forces have converged to create "almost the equivalent of a perfect
storm," says Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer group
Families USA.</TE>
<TE>   Although many elderly Americans purchase private insurance coverage
for their prescription drugs, at least half of the nation's 40 million
Medicare recipients go without coverage for at least part of each year.</TE>
<TE>   And even for those who are insured, premiums and co-payments are
increasing as employers, faced with rising health insurance costs for
their employees, are cutting back on benefits for their retirees.</TE>
<TE>   What makes these two trends acutely important is a third: the soaring
cost of prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   National spending on prescription medications grew by 19.2% in 1999,
17.3% in 2000 and 18.2% in 2001, according to the government's Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the private National Institute for
Health Care Management. While prescription drugs account for barely more
than 10% of the nation's health-care spending, the government agency
said, they represent the single fastest-growing health cost, and they are
most responsible for the return to double-digit health-care inflation.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the spending increase is because of the growth in the
number of prescriptions used by the rapidly increasing 65-and-older
population, according to Stanley S. Wallack, executive director of the
Schneider Institute for Health Policy at Brandeis University. The other
half, Wallack says, stems from the rising cost of individual
prescriptions--even though some prescription drugs are only slightly
better than over-the-counter remedies and generics.</TE>
<TE>   Families USA found that the average number of prescriptions (including
refills) filled by seniors annually increased by 45% from 1992 to 2000
(from 19.6 to 28.5) while the average prescription price increased by
49%, from $28.50 to $42.50.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, those two factors meant that the average elderly
person spent more than twice as much on drugs in 2000 as in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Spiraling prescription drug costs are forcing state governments,
insurers and businesses to implement controversial cost-control measures.
Sixteen states have cut or are considering cutting payments they make to
pharmacies for filling Medicaid prescriptions. In turn, many drugstores
in those states are threatening to reduce their hours, close stores in
poor neighborhoods or stop participating in the Medicaid programs, which
also serve the nation's poorest seniors. In Charlotte, N.C., several Kerr
Drug Stores will close next month.</TE>
<TE>   In California, state law requires pharmacies that participate in
Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, to offer Medicare beneficiaries
the same 20% drug discount received by Medi-Cal patients. However, a Rand
Corp. health study released this month by the California HealthCare
Foundation found that only 75% of enrolled pharmacies gave seniors the
required discount. And in more than half the pharmacies, seniors had to
ask for the discount to get it.</TE>
<TE>   Other states are restricting the number of prescriptions Medicaid
patients can fill each month before physicians must convince program
officials that their patients really need additional medications.</TE>
<TE>   And some states are seeking greater discounts from drug manufacturers.
PhRMA sued the governments of Florida, Michigan and Maine to stop what
assistant general counsel Jan Faikes called their "hijacking of
[Medicaid] patients to force us to pay higher rebates." PhRMA is
appealing first-round court rulings that upheld the legality of the state
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Many older Americans experience sticker shock when they retire and
switch from their employer's health plan to Medicare and have to pay full
freight for their drugs. A recent public opinion poll commissioned by
AARP found that 80% of Americans 45 and older want a Medicare drug
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Among AARP members, the sentiment is even stronger. Such a benefit is
the No. 1 priority for congressional action not only for members 65 and
older but also for those ages 45 to 64, Rother said.</TE>
<TE>   And no politician wants to tell AARP's 35 million members that their
No. 1 priority is out of reach.</TE>

<HD>New Codes Do a Number on Mexico Callers</HD>
<DH>Communications: Long-distance dialers at home and in the U.S. are
still trying to sort out the state-ordered prefix changes adopted last
fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>From the bus station to the national legislature, Mexicans are
playing a numbers game.</LD>
<LD>   Four hundred new telephone area codes were adopted last fall, all at
once, and the changes still confound many long-distance dialers here and
in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican government ordered the changes, which added two or three
digits to every phone number in the country, to meet an increasing demand
for new numbers. For U.S. callers to Mexico, the changes are to go into
effect in May, but many are finding the old numbers already out of
service.</LD>
<TE>   At Mexico City's busy northern bus terminal, Rosario Fuentes is on the
front lines, working for a company that charges travelers about a dollar
a minute to make phone calls for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I take the number they give me, add the new area code on, then you
start crossing out digits from the left, and when you have 10 digits, you
have your number," she explained matter-of-factly, flipping through pages
and pages of new area codes in her shoe box of an office. "It works most
of the time. But there are a lot of people who leave here furious. Livid.
They can't get through."</TE>
<TE>   The largest cities--Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey--received
two-digit area codes to use with eight-digit phone numbers. All other
cities were assigned three-digit area codes for their seven-digit
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, area code changes have spurred rousing public
debate and sometimes accommodation by phone companies. In Mexico, the
changes adopted in November came with not even a grace period in which
new and old phone numbers worked simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Now each state has so many area codes that many callers say they are
baffled. Zacatecas, a state roughly the size of Maine in terms of
population and square mileage, now has 16 area codes. Maine has one area
code.</TE>
<TE>Life and Death Situation</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Delgado, owner of the Delgado Brothers Co. picture frame
business in Los Angeles, tried mightily, but ultimately failed, to place
a call to Zacatecas a few weeks ago. He had been asked to reach the
family of an employee whose brother was so sick, it was feared that he
would die. The employee did not know the new area code for his family's
village, so Delgado, a Zacatecas native, asked his own relatives there
for help. The relatives called Mexican operators but repeatedly got busy
tones; once they got through, they were given the wrong code, Delgado
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This really caused a lot of anguish for my worker. It was a grave
situation. The only luck was that the brother did not die. He survived,"
Delgado said. "These changes are totally illogical, and they pose a real
problem for immigrants here who don't have enough information to even
call home."</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry spent $9 million to publicize the area
code changes in Mexico with fliers, television advertisements and notices
in bills, said Guillermo Montero, planning director for the Mexican
Federal Telecommunications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it seems that many callers didn't get the message.</TE>
<TE>   Some complain that lists issued by the largest telephone company,
Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, include incomplete or erroneous
information. Callers who make mistakes get a 10-second message directing
them to another number for information, but many say that's not enough
time to write down the number.</TE>
<TE>   Telmex, once a giant state monopoly, was privatized in 1990 and has
since struggled to improve its image and service. The company says these
complaints are unfounded and cited a survey of 2,000 callers that showed
that 90% had no problems with the new area codes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, reports of confusion come from all walks of life.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant to the national legislature couldn't figure out how to
get through to a legislator on his cellular phone. A taxi driver who
takes people from Mexico City to Guerrero state lost a $100 fare because
he could not track down his passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so mad," said the driver, Miguel Pozos Vargas. "I never knew
what happened to them. I tried calling relatives in Guerrero to help me,
but we couldn't figure it out."</TE>
<TE>Domestic Confusion</TE>
<TE>   Before Susana Gonzalez's recent trip to Mexico City from the port city
of Tampico, she and her family sat down to figure out how to call the
brother who was to pick her up. Her mother said to add one 5 to the phone
number. Gonzalez suggested two 5s, and her uncle said no 5s at all. None
of those options worked. Gonzalez said the family tried to call the
operator but got only repeated busy signals.</TE>
<TE>   "I never saw my brother while I was here. It's a real shame," Gonzalez
said as she ran to catch a bus for the trip home.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time Mexicans have suddenly had to change their
calling patterns. In the last four years, the government has ordered
changes to prefixes, used before the area codes, for national and
international calls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for people to change. In any country, a change like this
one would take 10 years. We have done it in four years," said Telmex
spokeswoman Concepcion Rivera. "To ask millions of people to change the
way they make calls was a big request. . . . The speed of these changes
made the people crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Montero, of the federal telecommunications commission, said Telmex and
other phone companies chose the cold-turkey conversion because it would
have cost millions of dollars to temporarily keep the old and new area
codes in place at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "We really had no choice but to do this. We would have run out of
numbers had we not," Montero said. "We feel it's been a success. There
were only some problems at the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   One of them was right at Montero's office. Mexico's secretary of
communications and transportation fired the president of the
telecommunications commission just days after the new area codes took
effect. Mexican media such as the respected newspaper El Financiero said
the decision stemmed from the "megaconfusion created by the new dialing
system," but Montero said the decision was unrelated.</TE>
<TE>   He did concede that "it would have been better had there been more
publicity. It's not easy to change and make people add digits to their
calls. There might have been a more gradual way to do this."</TE>
<TE>   For more information about area codes in Mexico, consult
http://www.telmex.com/internos/english/areacode/areacode.html, or ask an
international operator.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>A justice on the New Hampshire Supreme Court was attacked in his
home early Saturday and his face was beaten beyond recognition,
authorities said. A suspect was in custody but had not been charged.</LD>
<LD>   Justice John Broderick, 54, who played a role in the investigation of
ethics violations charges against the state's highest judge, underwent
six hours of surgery to repair multiple fractures to his face. His
prognosis for recovery was good, said his lawyer, Stephen Tober.</LD>
<LD>   "He was seriously and brutally assaulted," said Atty. Gen. Philip
McLaughlin.</LD>
<TE>   Broderick was sleeping when he was attacked. McLaughlin said his face
was beaten so severely that he could not recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Broderick's wife, Patricia, was asleep in another room and
was awakened by her husband.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin said a suspect was in custody but that no arrest had been
made, nor charges filed.</TE>
<TE>   In a domestic dispute in October 2000, Broderick was charged with
simple assault. He was accused of slapping his son Christian, then 30.
The charge later was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Broderick and Justice James Duggan were criticized for
involving themselves in negotiations on behalf of Chief Justice David
Brock.</TE>
<TE>   The House impeached Brock in the summer of 2000 on charges of not
enforcing conflict-of-interest rules and trying to influence a lower
court case.</TE>
<TE>   Brock was acquitted by the Senate, but the Supreme Court-appointed
Judicial Conduct Committee continued the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   After Broderick and Duggan stepped in, the committee had a last-minute
change of heart last April and publicly admonished Brock, deciding
against more severe sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general decided in January that Broderick and Duggan did
not break the law or commit ethics violations.</TE>
<TE>   Broderick, a former co-chairman of Bill Clinton's New Hampshire
presidential campaign, was appointed to the high court in 1995.</TE>
