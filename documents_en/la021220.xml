<HD>Golden day for 'Hours,' 'Chicago'</HD>
<DH>The literary drama and brassy musical lead the Globe
nominations. 'Gangs of New York' also gets several nods.</DH>

<LD>The brassy old-fashioned musical "Chicago" and the literary drama
"The Hours" earned the most Golden Globe nominations Thursday,
marking them as early favorites for Oscar contention, with the
long-delayed, extravagant Martin Scorsese 19th century epic "Gangs of
New York" not far behind.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently rebounding after a slow award season last year, Miramax
dominated this year's Globe nominations, garnering the most of any
studio with eight for "Chicago" and five for "Gangs of New York." In
addition, "The Hours," a Paramount/Miramax co-production, received
seven nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., including
one for best picture-drama and two for best actress-drama for Meryl
Streep and Nicole Kidman.</LD>
<LD>   The Globe nominations, which are seen as fairly reliable
indicators of Academy Award bids (the Oscar nominations will be
announced Feb. 11), turned out to be good news for such films as "My
Big Fat Greek Wedding" "About Schmidt," "Adaptation," "The Pianist"
and "About a Boy," as well as for such actors as Diane Lane, a best
actress nominee for "Unfaithful," and Goldie Hawn, a surprise best
actress nominee for "The Banger Sisters." The 60th annual Globe
awards will be given out Jan. 19 and will air on NBC.</LD>
<TE>   Not faring well were two DreamWorks films, "The Road to Perdition"
and "Catch Me if You Can," each of which received only one
nomination. "Far From Heaven," a critical favorite and winner of the
New York Film Critics Circle award, failed to get a best picture
nomination, although its stars, Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid, were
both nominated.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "The Hours," other nominees for best picture-drama are the
dark comedy "About Schmidt," "Gangs of New York," the second part of
the fantasy adventure "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and
Roman Polanski's Holocaust drama "The Pianist."</TE>
<TE>   "Chicago" will compete for best picture-musical or comedy with the
coming-of-age film "About a Boy"; the surreal Hollywood screenwriting
tale "Adaptation"; "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," the highest-grossing
independent film ever made; and the latest adaptation of the Charles
Dickens classic "Nicholas Nickelby."</TE>
<TE>   "Chicago" cast members were still recuperating Thursday morning
from their glitzy New York premiere the night before when they
started getting congratulatory calls about the nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Best-director nominee Rob Marshall was watching an entertainment
news show in his New York apartment when he saw that the entire lead
cast had been nominated -- Gere for best actor, Renee Zellweger and
Catherine Zeta-Jones for best actress, John C. Reilly for best
supporting actor and Queen Latifah for best supporting actress.
Hailing from Broadway, the Tony award-winning choreographer-director
is in exclusive company with such other stage directors as Sam Mendes
("American Beauty") and Stephen Daldry ("The Hours"), who have
successfully crossed over into film. Marshall said he has been blown
away by the reaction that his first foray into feature film has
caused.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped to make a movie that maybe a few people would see and
that would not be too horrible," he said, adding that all the hoopla
seems like a fantasy. "You just want to say, 'Did someone make a
mistake?' "</TE>
<TE>   Zellweger, who plays the murderous Roxie Hart and had never before
starred in a musical, was crawling back into bed after a night on the
town in New York when she got the call about the nominations. Her
response was more typical of the nominees -- unrestrained delight.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm elated," she said from a car on her way to JFK Airport for a
flight back to Los Angeles. "I mean, to turn on the TV and to see Rob
Marshall's name there, my heart was just going to burst." Fellow
"Chicago" nominee Zeta-Jones, who plays murderess Velma Kelly, said
she hoped the sweep in nominations would bring back the old "triple
threat" actor.</TE>
<TE>   "For so many years, if people knew you could dance and sing, they
presumed you could not act," she said. "And that was a terrible
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Condon, who was nominated for best screenplay with "Chicago,"
was making calls from a plane as he was traveling back to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Every musical, because they are so infrequently done, carries the
weight of the world on their shoulders," said Condon. "I just hope
the genre will come back to life."</TE>
<TE>   In the best actress-drama category, both Kidman, playing the
English novelist Virginia Woolf, and Streep as a modern-day Clarissa
Dalloway were nominated for "The Hours." Other nominees in the
category included Salma Hayek for "Frida," Lane for "Unfaithful" and
Moore for "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Lane, who also won the New York Film Critics Circle award for best
actress earlier this week, said she struggled to make her character
likable.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [the role] was very challenging," she said. "I felt it was
almost like a dare.... How do you create an adulteress and allow her
to be empathized with throughout the disaster she creates?"</TE>
<TE>   Nia Vardalos, who was nominated for best actress in a musical or
comedy for her starring role in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," said she
was overwhelmed by the nomination and the success of the film.
"People ask me if I'm living my dream," she said Thursday. "I never
even dared to dream something like this."</TE>
<TE>   In the best actor-drama category, Adrien Brody was nominated for
his role as a Holocaust musician in "The Pianist"; others nominated
were previous Golden Globe winner Michael Caine for his role as a
cynical British reporter in "The Quiet American"; Daniel Day-Lewis,
who also won critics' awards for his performance as the brutal
Nativist gang leader in "Gangs of New York"; Leonardo DiCaprio for
his portrayal of a young con artist in "Catch Me if You Can"; and
Jack Nicholson for his bitter retiree in "About Schmidt."</TE>
<TE>   Caine was sipping tea in the kitchen of his British country estate
when he got the word. "It just gets better [each time] because you've
been nominated before and you've won before and they still think
you're good," said the actor, who has won numerous awards. In the
category of best actor-comedy or musical, nominations went to Nicolas
Cage for his dual role as screenwriters Charlie and Donald Kaufman in
"Adaptation," Kieran Culkin for his spoiled high school student in
"Igby Goes Down," Richard Gere for his flashy lawyer in "Chicago,"
Hugh Grant for playing an adult who refuses to grow up in "About a
Boy" and Adam Sandler for portraying an eccentric man who falls in
love in "Punch-Drunk Love."</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who was in town for the premiere of his latest romantic
comedy, "Two Weeks Notice," said he is grateful for the recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm genuinely thrilled, since these things, they don't come
around very often for me," said Grant, who won in this category eight
years ago for "Four Weddings and a Funeral."</TE>
<TE>   In the best director category, nominations went to Stephen Daldry
for "The Hours," Peter Jackson for "The Lord of the Rings: The Two
Towers," Spike Jonze for "Adaptation," Alexander Payne for "About
Schmidt" and Scorsese for "Gangs of New York."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was nominated last year in this category for "The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." Scorsese has been nominated
four previous times in this category. Scorsese said he was
particularly proud of this nomination because of all the negative
publicity surrounding his film, which was originally slated to come
out last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The film had to speak for itself," he said. "The more we showed
it to people, the more it turned around these stories that have
preceded the picture.... It was a journey making the movie."</TE>
<TE>   First-time nominee Payne said the nomination will be "good for the
film."</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have the recognition," he added. "The definition for
filmmaking is groping in the dark. You just don't know how a film
will turn out."</TE>
<TE>   There were many surprising omissions this year, most notably
director Steven Spielberg for "Minority Report" and "Catch Me if You
Can."</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks might have sabotaged its own chances at a nomination by
requesting that "Catch Me if You Can" be considered as a drama rather
than musical/comedy.</TE>
<TE>   The nominations will likely give a big boost to such movies as
"About a Boy," which received good reviews but drowned at the
domestic box office when it was released in May last year.</TE>
<TE>   This year's foreign-language film nominees are France's "Balzac
and the Little Chinese Seamstress," Brazil's "City of God," Mexico's
"The Crime of Father Amaro," China's "Hero," Germany's "Nowhere in
Africa" and Spain's "Talk to Her."</TE>
<TE>   The Globes are also given out for TV, and once again HBO dominated
the main categories. NBC officials -- who were said to have been less
than thrilled in January when their Golden Globe Awards telecast
turned into an HBO promotional parade -- could face the same scenario
next year.</TE>
<TE>   The pay-TV service, which at the last ceremony swept the two main
TV categories -- comedy and drama series -- with "Sex and the City"
and "Six Feet Under" -- garnered 26 nominations this year, twice as
many as its nearest competitor, NBC. That included repeat nominations
for "Sex and the City" and "Six Feet Under," nods to "The Sopranos"
and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and continued dominance in the area of
made-for-TV movies.</TE>

<DH>Midweek premiere of the second 'Ring' installment outdraws
last year's opening of 'Fellowship,' the first film in the trilogy.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The middle edition of director Peter Jackson's three-part
Middle-earth saga thundered to $26 million for its opening Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The figure includes midnight Tuesday showings in about half the
3,622 theaters where "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is
playing on 6,633 screens, but New Line Cinema didn't break out the
early-show tally.</LD>
<LD>   The third-best midweek opening bodes well for business this
weekend, and it beat last year's opening for the first installment,
"The Fellowship of the Ring," which grossed $18 million on Wednesday,
Dec. 19, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The top two midweek spots belong to "Star Wars: Episode II Attack
of the Clones," which opened on Thursday, May 16, this year with
$30.1 million, and "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace," which
on May 19, 1999, tallied $28.5 million, according to Nielsen EDI.</TE>
<TE>   Advance ticket sales were brisk on such online services as
Moviephone.com and Fandango.com.</TE>

<HD>'Kaante': On Hollywood's turf</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ready for a singing and dancing "Reservoir Dogs"?</LD>
<LD>   That's what the makers of "Kaante" are hoping India's mass
audience is eager to see, and while the Hindi-speaking film industry
is looking to the much-delayed movie to give it a boost, it shouldn't
count on any crossover appeal. On home ground, however, "Kaante,"
which translates as "thorn," as in "a thorn in the side," could
conceivably connect with its roster of top male stars and mix of
violence, schmaltz, fervid songs and flashy imitation of Hollywood
crime melodramas.</LD>
<LD>   Bollywood goes Hollywood with the film shot in Southern
California, but as a perfect heist caper gone awry it is a stale,
lurid, grade-Z rehash of everything between the aforementioned
Quentin Tarantino film to Jules Dassin's classic "Rififi," served up
with a lot of gaudy stylistic flourishes and stretched out to the
epic length Indian audiences demand of their escapist entertainments,
including a couple of obligatory musical interludes that have a
certain endearing ludicrousness. Indeed, there is a steadfast
earnestness in director Sanjay Gupta's deluded attempt to equal or
even better Hollywood on its own ground that is rather touching --
but not to the degree that it sustains the film's many tedious
stretches.</LD>
<TE>   Gupta and co-writer Yash-Vinay's elementary script lands six shady
Indian residents of L.A. in jail for questioning, long enough for
them to complain about ethnic stereotyping on the part of the cops
and to hatch a scheme to rob the bank that handles the LAPD payroll.
They are Major (Amitabh Bachchan), a middle-aged businessman with a
blot on his record and a dying wife; Ajju (Sanjay Dutt), a pimp; Marc
(Sunil Shetty), a hot-tempered bouncer at a club where his girlfriend
is the star attraction; Andy (Kumar Gaurav), a young computer whiz
fallen on hard times; Baali (Mahesh Manjrekar), a bleached-blond
madman; and Mak (Lucky Ali), the quietest of the group and the film's
narrator.</TE>
<TE>   The skilled Bachchan is an internationally renowned actor, but it
is tough guy Dutt who has the corner on star charisma. A lot of the
action takes place in downtown Los Angeles with Major and his
bedridden wife living in an improbably tasteful suite at the Frontier
Hotel, which hasn't offered such a level of amenities since at least
the Eisenhower administration, when it was still known as the
original of the adjacent Rosslyn Hotels at 5th and Main. (The thieves
hatch their bank heist on the hotel roof, under the recently restored
original Rosslyn sign.) The Mayan stands in for Club India, Marc's
erstwhile place of employment.</TE>
<TE>   On the technical side, "Kaante" isn't anything to write home
about, but then its sleazy, cut-rate look and feel is actually
appropriate to the potboiler that it is. When it comes to Bollywood
breakthroughs, a far better bet was last May's "Lagaan," which paid
affectionate homage to the Hindi musical epic with fully drawn
characters, a serious underlying theme and a sophisticated style and
point of view. In a sense, "Kaante" lives up to its title.</TE>

<LD>A Long Way From Home</LD>
<LD>   Growing Up in the American Heartland</LD>
<LD>   Tom Brokaw</LD>
<TE>   Random House: 238 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tale of the boy or girl who leaves home in the vast bleakness
of the Great Plains to seek fame and fortune in the bright lights of
the big city is one of the enduring American stories.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchorman, has done his turn on this classic
form in "A Long Way From Home," which is breezy and straightforward
if not deep or original, much like the assertive TV newsman himself,
whose bass-baritone voice is more familiar to the nation than most
politicians'.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Brokaw's book reads like the autobiography of the Eagle
Scout he was. He was born in 1940 to working-class parents in South
Dakota and became quick of mind and a good and endless talker. He
excelled at nearly everything he undertook.</TE>
<TE>   "As the firstborn, and someone with big ambitions," he writes, "I
was always determined to be at the head of whatever parade happened
to be passing through my life at any given time."</TE>
<TE>   His father, Red, a construction worker and overseer, was a
short-tempered man whose upbringing had not blessed him with the
patience and sensitivity the raising of three sons required. His
mother, Jean, now a widow who lives in Southern California, supplied
the finesse. And the humor. When her son sent her a copy of his book,
she told him, "In some parts your ego is showing, but mostly it's
fine."</TE>
<TE>   In the small towns in which he lived, Brokaw had it all: Eagle
Scout and the Order of the Arrow (a sort of Phi Beta Kappa for Scouts
-- he liked wearing the white scarf that is the order's sign of
honor), high school class president, South Dakota governor for a day
in Boys' State, star high school football and basketball player. In
the summer and after school there was work, in construction, in jobs
on the Missouri River. It was, he writes, "a Tom Sawyer boyhood."</TE>
<TE>   And inevitably, there was a stint as a small-town radio announcer.</TE>
<TE>   There was even, at 17, a trip to New York, won because he had been
governor at Boys' State. He says he tried to see everything in the
city because he didn't know when he would be back.</TE>
<TE>   As you might guess, the young Brokaw was riding so high he was
riding for a fall. That came in his senior year at high school and as
a freshman at the University of Iowa. "When I turned eighteen," he
writes, "I began a steady descent into a pattern of self-deception,
deceit and irresponsibility." He goofed off at work and at school,
drank too much and spent a lot of time chasing girls, who readily
fell for him.</TE>
<TE>   All except one, Meredith Auld, Miss South Dakota of 1959. He
pursued, she rebuffed until, with a push from his father, some
thoughtful advice from older friends and a few stern warnings, he
left Iowa, straightened himself out and graduated from the University
of South Dakota. He and Auld were married, he at 21, she at 20. And
so they remain.</TE>
<TE>   They have lived in New York for more than 25 years. In his
apartment on Park Avenue he has a library, from which he watched the
towers of the World Trade Center fall. Then, of course, he went
straight to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   He wonders what it would have been like if he had stayed in South
Dakota: "When I read 'Main Street,' Sinclair Lewis' novel of Gopher
Prairie, Minn., his withering description of the boorish and
small-minded culture that can suffocate unconventional attitudes and
free spirits was uncomfortably close to a truth I was reluctant to
fully embrace."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he asserts, "the early bearings I took as a child on the
prairie, surrounded by working people and the communities they
established, often in difficult circumstances, have been a steadying
and reassuring presence."</TE>
<TE>   "As for me," Brokaw says, "I will always be a child of the Great
Plains and a direct descendant of those who bent their backs against
the soil and hard times and held true to their bearings."</TE>

<HD>Comic book feedback: Letters lose to the Web</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hank Stuever</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geekdom used to be so lonely, and that's why kids -- and grown-ups --
wrote letters to comic books.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning about 45 years ago, hard-core fans started to send in
letters on sheets of notebook paper. They would praise superheroes,
but also take umbrage with story arcs or abuses of mutant powers, or
point out tiny inconsistencies in the canon, or decry super-gaffes.</LD>
<LD>   DC Comics recently announced the end of its letters-to-the-editor
pages in all of its titles, more or less admitting that no one was
really taking the time to write and mail letters to superheroes
anymore.</LD>
<TE>   DC's decision to kill off letters -- and with Marvel Comics
inclined to do the same -- is a surrender to the far superior powers
of the Internet. Fans haven't complained about the loss; they're too
busy flaming each other on comic book Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Online, thousands of comics fans, most of them using clever
pseudonyms, are joined in a steady, more satisfying fray of
criticism, debate and adulation. No longer marginalized or lonely,
they swarm by the tens of thousands to annual comic book
mega-conventions in San Diego and Chicago, where creators from
Marvel, DC and other publishing houses await their probing comments.
Fans have forged a direct link to writers, artists and editors, many
of whom respond online to questions within a day.</TE>
<TE>   At Marvel Comics, only one current title is featuring any letters
from readers -- "X-Statix," a new addition to the copious "X-Men"
family of titles, and one that drives its readers into a froth of
advice and opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Marvel Editor in Chief Joe Quesada admits that the letters format
is rapidly dying. "There may be a time when someone sends in
something that is incredibly touching or valid and needs to see print
somewhere, somehow," he says. "Otherwise, the Web is so much better."</TE>
<TE>   "Fans take it for granted now, all the ways they have to offer
feedback," he says.</TE>

<HD>Sound and fury, signifying genre</HD>
<DH>The yelling and heavy breathing in 'Narc' can't disguise
the cliches that pepper the script or the stock characters who speak
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Patric and Ray Liotta do a whole lot of shouting in the new
film "Narc," but I wonder if the two actors ever sat down together
and quietly went over the script. If they had, they might have
noticed that director Joe Carnahan's story about a pair of tough
Detroit cops had been cobbled from the remains of so many other genre
movies that there wasn't much to hang onto save borrowed cliches and
attitude. Then again, perhaps that's precisely why the two spend so
much of the film with the volume turned up: They don't want us to
hear the words, only the noise.</LD>
<LD>   "Narc" is nothing if not loud. The frenetic opening scene finds
Patric's character, an undercover narcotics detective named Nick
Tellis, mad-dashing after a drug-addled freak as a hand-held camera
dogs their every step. The freak -- eyeballs rolling, bullet-head
gleaming, two long needles clenched in one fist -- is so high he's
barely touching the ground yet not so high he doesn't notice another
man just passing through. The druggie plunges the needles into the
bystander's neck, the guy drops in a foamy spasm and Nick throws
himself down in a futile attempt to help. Then he's off running
again, chasing his prey all the way to the playground, where he
nearly upends his career by shooting the wrong person.</LD>
<TE>   This nerve-jangling opener bristles with wild style. The sound is
a syncopation of footfalls and heavy breathing, and the herky-jerky
cinematography, which brings to mind the Dogma film "Celebration,"
amplifies the sense of risk. Both the camera and the cop look as if
they might lose it (each seems out of control), but that's just part
of the pose. Like Al Pacino in "Serpico" and Russell Crowe in "L.A.
Confidential," Nick is the departmental rebel who always runs afoul
of the system. At once inside and outside the law, he carries his
existential solitude right next to his badge and gun, although in
this case he's also hauling a load of familiar pulp fiction.</TE>
<TE>   After the playground shooting, Nick is pulled out of narcotics and
put on a murder investigation with an older cop named Henry Oak
(Liotta), the type of oversized swaggering rule-breaker for which
Nick Nolte once held the patent in movies like "Q&amp;A." (Over and over,
every gesture and character in "Narc" summons up yet another movie.)
Together the cops tear Detroit apart, terrorizing snitches in grubby
apartments and in the bombed-out vistas that now define the city's
cinematic landscape. Even with the ending in sight, it takes a long
time for anything to happen. Henry lectures Nick on the difference
between law and justice; Nick stares into space (Patric excels at
such meaningful emptiness) as his incessantly irritating wife (Krista
Bridges) nags him to quit the force.</TE>
<TE>   In movies like these, women tend to be either prostitutes or
wives, and the wives tend to be scolds or dead. That's part of the
pulp fiction territory, which, however finite, offers up worlds of
possibility. Carnahan, whose first feature was a raucous,
self-conscious crime blowout called "Blood Guts Bullets &amp; Octane,"
has a true believer's love of pulp. But love isn't enough when you
are playing movie cops and robbers. To transcend cliche, movies like
"Narc" need the passion of a heretic who can take stock characters
with their stock predicaments and turn them inside out, the way
Curtis Hanson and Quentin Tarantino do. Blood, guts and flash aren't
enough.</TE>
<TE>   It's during a stakeout when Henry tells Nick about his dead wife
that the cliches and Carnahan's wild style reach an absurd crescendo.
The two cops are inside a parked car -- Henry in the front seat, Nick
for some reason in the back -- and the camera is prowling outside.
Dark lighting obscures both cops and, rather than focus on Liotta's
face during one of the actor's bigger big moments, Carnahan has
instead focused on some overhanging trees crisply reflected in the
car windows. As he does throughout the movie, Liotta works hard to
put his character across, but it doesn't matter: You can't see the
acting for either the trees or the cinematography.</TE>

<HD>New Chinese game show gives viewers chance to win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Who wants to be a millionaire? Pretty much everyone in China, and
Communist leaders are urging them on. Now, the latest Chinese game
show is offering treasure-seeking citizens a novel path to the riches
their government is encouraging -- the chance to win cash simply by
watching TV.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone Wins," unveiled Wednesday in the booming city of
Shanghai, is billed by its creators as the first TV quiz show in the
world that enriches viewers as well as contestants.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which debuts New Year's Day in Shanghai, looks familiar
enough: Seven players in a studio compete for cash prizes by
answering questions on everything from history to science.</LD>
<TE>   But there's a twist, which executives at Shanghai Oriental
Television say they hope will prove irresistible to viewers in this
money-mad city of 17 million. At show's end, the final digit of each
player's score will be strung together to form a seven-digit "lucky
number." Though producers didn't spell out details at a news
conference, they said viewers who can match all or part of it with
any personal number -- a home phone number, an official ID, a utility
bill, even a car license plate -- will collect up to $500.</TE>
<TE>   That's about four months' salary, even by the standards of China's
wealthiest city.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Shanghai are going to like this," predicted Teng
Junjie, an executive director at Shanghai Oriental Television.</TE>
<TE>   The producer, Hong Kong-based Robert Chua, is a Singaporean
executive who also founded a 24-hour Chinese-language family channel.</TE>

<HD>Hall needs a rescuer</HD>
<DH>Ambassador Auditorium's owner plans to raze it if a buyer
doesn't step in.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena's famed concert hall, the Ambassador Auditorium, will be
demolished unless the community can find a way to preserve it,
according to the property's owner, the Worldwide Church of God.</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Schnippert, the church's director of finance and planning,
said the church's preferred plan for residential development of its
48-acre site -- formerly the Ambassador College campus -- does not
include preserving the auditorium, which is known for its superior
acoustics. The church closed the campus, as well as the auditorium,
in 1995 as revenue and church membership declined.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview Wednesday, Schnippert said an alternative
development plan has been prepared in case preservation becomes
possible but added that for that to happen, the costs of owning and
operating the hall would have to be assumed by the public or private
sector, not the church.</LD>
<TE>   The auditorium's value has been estimated at $22 million by the
city of Pasadena, and Schnippert said it would cost about $8 million
to create a new parking structure if the hall were to be reopened.
Annual maintenance costs for the building have been estimated at
about $300,000 and programming costs at $3 million for the first
three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission on the building is over; we aren't going to keep it,"
Schnippert said. "If it is not bought by the city or bought by a
benefactor, the church will tear it down." He added that a decision
must be made in the first three months of 2003: "Hard decisions will
be made at that point. There comes a point when you can't leave all
of your options open."</TE>
<TE>   Schnippert said any owner would have to program the auditorium in
a manner consistent with the needs of the new residential community:
"It couldn't become, say, a rock hall." He added that the church
cannot leave the auditorium standing in hopes of a future buyer,
because potential revenues from developing the land would be lost and
because new residents would probably not want to move in next to an
empty building.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2001, Los Angeles-based developer Legacy Partners had
proposed purchasing the campus for a 1,727-unit housing development.
Legacy proposed donating the campus' intimate, 1,250-seat performance
hall to the city. While Pasadena would have owned it, the auditorium
was to have been programmed and maintained by a new nonprofit with an
oversight board made up of local arts patrons and with expenses paid
through fund-raising, rental fees and ticket sales, not city funds.</TE>
<TE>   Legacy abandoned its proposal early this year after neighbors
objected to the density and the church denied the developer's request
for more time to address the issues. In July, the church hired Shea
Homes as its chief development consultant to create a new master plan
for the property. Under the new arrangement, the church will retain
ownership of the development.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Cosgrove, project management consultant for the city, said
it remains open to assuming ownership of Ambassador Auditorium
provided that it does not become responsible for its expenses. "When
we were in the period dealing with Legacy, we wanted assurances that
the city would not end up with any kind of financial responsibility
for the operation or maintenance of the auditorium, and I think [the
city's] position remains exactly that," Cosgrove said. "I think if
Shea Partners and the church propose a similar arrangement to us, the
city would certainly work with them to try to make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Following the breakdown of the arrangement with Legacy Partners,
members of a residents group called the Board for Ambassador Hall
have continued to lobby for preservation of the facility. "Here's
this gem that has been likened to Carnegie Hall, and it could be torn
down because the church wants to maximize its investment on the
property," board member Carol Henry said. "Given what they bought it
for and what they're going to get for it now, they can afford to be
more generous."</TE>
<TE>   Henry acknowledged that with both the church and the city refusing
to become financially responsible, an angel from the private sector
probably represents Ambassador Auditorium's only hope. "We'd love to
find that angel," she said.</TE>

<HD>For the 'Scud Stud,' it's all about access to the action</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The present never escapes the past.</LD>
<LD>   Flashback to the U.S. versus Saddam Hussein Part 1, when it was
another nerve-jangling night on the media's Persian Gulf War beat as
falling missiles sent edgy TV reporters scrambling in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   It was a night when NBC correspondent Arthur Kent sprang into
action there while readying a war update for halftime of his
network's Raiders-Bills AFC championship telecast. As sirens wailed
in the background, the usually unflappable Kent frantically waved his
gas mask while trying to alert NBC's New York office, unaware the
camera was rolling.</LD>
<TE>   "Hello, New York! They're firing Patriots! This is not a drill!"</TE>
<TE>   The date was Jan. 20, 1991. The Patriots Kent described were U.S.
missiles launched to intercept usually off-the-mark Scuds that Iraq
had fired at Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   What does Kent recall about that moment now, when another
U.S.-Iraq war appears imminent?</TE>
<TE>   A good memory: "Suddenly we had a story falling on our heads, and
we had the ability to report it in real time," said Kent, in Los
Angeles this week to do some work for the History Channel and take
part in awards handed out by the International Documentary Assn. "I
was trying to get their attention, because I knew in the control room
they were watching about 40 monitors around the world, including the
football game. I felt good that we did not make mistakes and we did
not compromise security for anyone in that area when we reported the
Patriots intercepting some of the incoming Scuds. You could see some
of the debris explode in the dark and send up a glow."</TE>
<TE>   A bad memory: Kent's adrenalin flash notwithstanding, it was no
happy or productive time for Western media in Dhahran. They were far
from the important action, in effect observing the war through the
wrong end of a telescope, when seeing it at all. In fact, what
Americans witnessed on TV through much of the conflict were not
troops in combat, but favorable sky views of U.S. bombings and
journalists in Saudi Arabia jumping for cover when sirens blew,
usually in response to false alerts.</TE>
<TE>   "We were about 200 miles away from anything even remotely
approaching the front," recalled Kent, famously nicknamed the "Scud
Stud" that year because of his dashing good looks. "I always remind
people that covering the Gulf War was not as dangerous for most of us
as Tiananmen Square was, as Afghanistan would be, as Bosnia would
be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the media's choice.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to chance a repeat of home-front protests generated by
unchecked TV coverage of Vietnam, the military applied the clamps in
Iraq by conducting the war largely out of the camera's view,
contending that full disclosure could jeopardize combat plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We were reporting under the strictest controls U.S. journalists
had ever faced [during a war]," Kent noted. "The pool [reporting]
system that hampered us in the first Gulf War should not be forced on
journalists again, other than in exceptional circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon has been holding boot camps for reporters as
war clouds again thicken over Iraq, and promises to have media
"embedded" in combat units that take the field, Kent is skeptical.
"They said they would do that before the Gulf War and before
Afghanistan," he said. "The biggest disappointments are always
preceded by promises of cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Which worries Military Reporters and Editors, an organization of
mostly print journalists formed recently to lobby the Pentagon for
greater media access to combat troops in wartime. Here's the concept:
Full and open disclosure is not only the democratic way but could
help prevent a senseless conflict. Kent is a member of the group,
which had its first conference last month in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be improved access," said Kent, a Canadian who lives
in London. "It's the right thing, the intelligent thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Not that media themselves necessarily do what's right and
intelligent, Kent is quick to point out. Although he's spent much of
his career reporting before a camera, he is a harsh critic of TV
news.</TE>
<TE>   "Newspapers responded to Sept. 11 and last year's war in
Afghanistan in splendid fashion," he said. In contrast, the big
broadcast news operations are more than ever slavishly tied to
Pentagon and White House briefings. "So much of their coverage is led
by the Washington perspective, which is mainly the Bush
administration's perspective."</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing vague about Kent's perspective. "The most galling
thing about the Sept. 11 coverage," he said, "was [U.S.] anchormen
talking about a failure by American intelligence agencies. Who were
they to talk? How many times were the network news organizations in
Afghanistan [before Sept. 11]? Instead, look what they were passing
off as news -- a nonstop diet of health stories, salacious innuendo,
scandal surrounding the Chandra Levy tragedy and shark attacks."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Kent is "Jaws" to his former employer.</TE>
<TE>   His four-year association with NBC ended in 1992 during a nasty
dispute that saw him bringing a breach-of-contract suit against the
network, which settled with him out of court two years later. But not
until it had played hardball by publicly calling Kent a coward for
resisting an assignment to cover the war in Bosnia. Kent said he did
so because NBC wanted him to go there without proper preparation and
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence supported Kent. He was always as much news stud as
Scud stud, his long pedigree as a serious journalist speaking
impressively for itself. At age 49, he has made several strong
documentaries and spent more than two decades reporting from
Afghanistan and other hot spots for the History Channel, PBS, the
BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and Canada's Maclean's Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   His regular TV job now is host/narrator for "History Undercover"
Tuesday nights on the History Channel, which from Jan. 14 to 17 will
roll out a cluster of documentaries under the title "Beyond Desert
Storm Week."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen if a new desert storm is just ahead and
reporters again find themselves responding nervously to sirens far
from the main action. If so, this time Kent won't be one of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where to tune in</TE>
<TE>   "History Undercover," hosted by Arthur Kent, returns to its
regular 8 p.m. Tuesday time slot on Jan. 7.</TE>

<HD>Against all odds, his story is told</HD>
<DH>In 'Antwone Fisher,' Denzel Washington tells a gripping
tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the individual it's named after, a man who wrote the screenplay
of the film based on his own life and then had to wait nearly a
decade to see it arrive on screen, "Antwone Fisher" is the story of
obstacles overcome.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is it unusual that this emotional story of how a damaged
boy became a whole man made it to the screen at all, it is a measure
of its strengths that it overcomes storytelling flaws that would have
disabled a weaker project. For there are moments when this film plays
as overly earnest and conventional, moments when issues resolve too
tidily or do not resolve at all.</LD>
<LD>   But because you'd have to be a stone not to be moved by "Antwone
Fisher's" story of hope, forgiveness and love, its focus on the power
of the family to heal what it once destroyed, those difficulties seem
insignificant and beside the point compared to the good things that
are going on.</LD>
<TE>   These strengths go further than a vibrant acting debut by star
Derek Luke and a satisfying first time behind the camera for co-star
Denzel Washington. They go beyond the film's willingness to skirt the
sentimental in showing a world that feels real even though affirming
things happen there, a world where even the worst stories can have
positive endings.</TE>
<TE>   Rarest and most impressive of all, "Antwone Fisher" is a serious
drama set in the African American community, one that showcases
powerful, confrontational scenes between black actors that compel
attention while making you wonder why you might have to go as far
back as Charles Burnett's neglected 1990 "To Sleep With Anger" to
find the last time that was done.</TE>
<TE>   Because films like this are so difficult to get made, it's likely
that only the presence of someone of Denzel Washington's stature as
co-star and director got it done. It took years until he could find
the time and the mental energy to direct, just as it took years for
the real Antwone Fisher, helped by producer Todd Black and others, to
get his life into an "Inspired by a True Story" screenplay form that
Hollywood could accept.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's is a tale both individual and prototypical, one that
echoes "Ordinary People" in its emphasis on how therapy can change
lives but one that also gives us a sense that we're seeing things
we've not often seen before.</TE>
<TE>   Antwone Fisher has not been on screen for many minutes before it
is clear that this Navy enlisted man has a true powder-keg temper, a
bottled-up rage that needs only the slightest provocation to erupt
into savage brawls. Not even his tentative romantic interest in a
beautiful fellow sailor (a debuting Joy Bryant) can take the edge off
his fury.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher is sent, and not for the first time, to see a naval
psychiatrist to deal with the rage. What's different this time is
that the therapist is Jerome Davenport (Washington), someone who has
the patience to outlast Fisher's studied what's-it-to-you
indifference and his sullen "I got nothing to say" conversational
style.</TE>
<TE>   Building this relationship is not a straight-line endeavor, as the
often-betrayed Fisher is always willing to assume that the
psychiatrist is just another deceiver. But Davenport gradually does
break through, and what he finds is a Dickensian childhood where each
horror is succeeded by one even more grotesque.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, it turns out, was born in prison two months after his
father was murdered. He was turned over to the state, and when his
mother did not come for him on her release, he spent his entire
childhood in foster homes, including one run by Mrs. Tate (Novella
Nelson) that had tortures of an especially toxic kind.</TE>
<TE>   As Fisher struggles with his temper and with Davenport's
suggestion that he try to find his family so he can get on with his
life, the therapist, in one of the film's least convincing elements,
struggles with a marriage that seems unduly distant and restrained.</TE>
<TE>   If "Antwone Fisher" works in fits and starts, that cannot be said
of Luke's performance in the title role. The young actor has great
presence on screen, bringing this character with a formidable chip on
his shoulder alive in an unforced way. He makes Antwone's stillness,
his sweetness and his violence equally believable and compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit for this goes to Washington, who has wisely
avoided getting distracted by technical fripperies and has instead
concentrated in his directing debut on infusing his distinctively
natural style on his young cast. Seeing an actor of his stature so
capably mentoring a younger generation is yet another thing that
makes "Antwone Fisher" so satisfying and so against the odds.</TE>

<HD>'Spider' spins a dark tale of torment</HD>
<DH>Ralph Fiennes is gripping as a mentally ill man facing his
past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime in the 1980s a shabbily dressed, disturbed young man exits a
train in a vast station so furtively and with such hesitance that he
at first seems either in a weakened condition or somehow physically
disabled. Neither is the case.</LD>
<LD>   This first image of Ralph Fiennes' Dennis Cleg is unsettling, to
say the least, and a harbinger of things to come in "Spider," David
Cronenberg's compelling and provocative film of Patrick McGrath's
adaptation of his 1988 novel. In an instance of director, stars and
material melding flawlessly, "Spider" is a brilliantly realized
depiction of a mentally ill individual unexpectedly confronted with
his past in a manner that suggests the seemingly infinite capacity of
the mind for distortion in the name of self-protection.</LD>
<TE>   Cronenberg has pulled off a richly visual feat of the imagination
that ranks among his finest achievements and draws full measure of
the talent and skill of Miranda Richardson (in a breathtaking dual
portrayal), Gabriel Byrne, Lynn Redgrave and John Neville as well as
Fiennes. He has made equal demands of his crew, which includes most
prominently cinematographer Peter Suschitzky, production designer
Andrew Sanders, costume designer Denise Cronenberg and composer
Howard Shore, all of whose contributions in creating the gray, somber
universe in which this complex and contradictory psychological
odyssey takes place cannot be overpraised.</TE>
<TE>   With intense effort at concentration, Cleg makes his way, with the
wariness and tentativeness that will mark almost all his actions, to
a seemingly endless swath of identical Victorian row houses in a
section of east London so far from the city's center that it borders
on countryside. He finally arrives at the correct address, which
proves to be an unmarked and surprisingly large halfway house run by
the severe Mrs. Wilkinson, a cold upholder of rules and regulations,
a cousin of Nurse Ratched except that her passion for control is
limited by the fact that her residents, all of them male, are free to
come and go as they please.</TE>
<TE>   The environment of the halfway house is shabby and minimalist in
the extreme, and it hasn't had a fresh coat of paint since between
the wars if not before. Neville's elderly Terrence greets Cleg kindly
but can't resist telling him about a man in Africa who took 17
agonized hours to die from the bite of a scorpion. Withdrawn and
recalcitrant, Cleg eventually starts wandering around the
neighborhood, which happens to be where he lived with his parents as
a child. It is a stark, alienating area of row houses hard by a canal
and a looming gasworks with vast reservoirs; an immense arched brick
bridge slices one vista.</TE>
<TE>   In time he comes upon his drab childhood home, and in peering
through its dining room window he sees himself (played by a subtly
creepy Bradley Hall) seated at the dinner table with his father
(Byrne), a plumber who seems to spend most of his evenings at a
nearby pub even though his wife (Richardson) is an attractive, warm,
accommodating woman. From a seamless flow of images moving between a
real present and an imagined past, Cronenberg has driven home his
things-aren't-necessarily-what-they-seem observation with a peculiar
force that is characteristic of his dark vision of human nature.
Cronenberg is too sophisticated an artist and too much the master of
the enigma and of confused sexuality to spell everything out, and it
may well be that the most revealing moment of the film is when little
Dennis observes his mother in a slip she says she hopes will please
his father.</TE>
<TE>   There is no Gothic horror in "Spider" but instead a portrait of a
man with a shattered mind striving compulsively with all his might to
make sense of and survive in an indifferent world. With remarkable
persuasiveness Fiennes and Cronenberg illuminate the workings of this
tormented man's mind, impaired yet functional in its weird but
comprehensible logic.</TE>
<TE>   Cronenberg has said of Spider, which is Cleg's nickname, that he
is "so strange ... and yet oddly familiar, and even more so these
days when the world's streets are filled with the 'homeless,' each of
whom has a specific story to tell about 'home.' " The way in which
Cronenberg tells Cleg's story and what we discover home means to him
are what make "Spider" so disturbingly evocative.</TE>

<TE>   MPAA rating: Rated R, for sexuality, brief violence, language.</TE>

<LD>The Christmas Elf</LD>
<LD>   By Mallin, 11</LD>
<LD>   Viewpoint School, Calabasas</LD>
<TE>   'Twas Christmas Eve, I awoke to a loud noise. I thought it was
Jolly Old Saint Nick, delivering his toys.</TE>
<TE>   But the sound was coming from the pantry downstairs. I thought it
was burglars, or even bears.</TE>
<TE>   I ran down the stairs and hid behind the Christmas tree. A safe
place to hide so the criminal would not see me.</TE>
<TE>   He was stealing all of the cans that sat next to the spice rack.
After he collected a few, he would put them in a small sack.</TE>
<TE>   Moving closer, this creature was the most unusual thing -- I saw a
black little tail sticking out of a green coat, with a little bell
that made a small ring.</TE>
<TE>   As I got a closer look, little black ears stuck out of a green
hat. Putting the clues together, I figured it was a cat!</TE>
<TE>   Then he turned around looking with his small yellow eyes,
discovering me with a quick surprise.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed his sack and ran quickly out the back door. I realized
he took all the tuna cans, leaving me poor!</TE>
<TE>   I chased after him, and he stopped at his tiny sleigh. It looked
like the one I bought at Kmart the other day.</TE>
<TE>   With his keys, he turned on the mini-sleigh and drove off with
cheer. I read his bumper sticker, which said, "Merry Christmas, and
to all suckers a good year!"</TE>
<TE>   Then the most wonderful name came to myself. He would be called
"The Christmas Elf."</TE>

an illustration with your poem if you like to draw. See "How to write

<HD>A film buff's best friend</HD>
<DH>Need a copy of 'Cuban Rebel Girls'? Sidney P. Bloomberg is
your man. He excels at tracking down obscure titles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sidney P. Bloomberg believes there is no such thing as a lost movie.
And for the last three years, he's tracked down some of the more
obscure titles for movie buffs.</LD>
<LD>   The 83-year-old Bloomberg, a former publicist at 20th Century Fox,
doesn't take much stock in today's stars. "Actors are just foolish
now," he says. Nor is Bloomberg fond of what most critics believe is
the greatest movie ever made. "I think to some degree you can't even
watch 'Citizen Kane' now," Bloomberg states over the phone from his
home in San Francisco. And he's still grousing that Marlene Dietrich
didn't get an Oscar -- let alone a nomination -- for the 1957 classic
"Witness for the Prosecution."</LD>
<LD>   But can Bloomberg really deliver? I decided to put him to the
test.</LD>
<TE>   Do you have "Cuban Rebel Girls"?</TE>
<TE>   "Cuban Rebel Girls" is a 1959 grade-Z drama starring Errol Flynn
in his last movie with his then 17-year-old girlfriend, Beverly
Aadland. This legendary turkey saw very little distribution in
America because of its pro-Castro sympathies.</TE>
<TE>   "I have that some place," Bloomberg says, then pauses and adds: "I
think it's down in Havana."</TE>
<TE>   What about "Porgy and Bess"?</TE>
<TE>   The 1959 Samuel Goldwyn production of the George Gershwin opera
has never been out on video, and only one print of the film is known
to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no," says Bloomberg. "I got my last copy back. Someone
ordered it from Brooklyn and sent it back to me and I played it. You
can't watch it -- it hurts your eyes. I don't sell anything I
wouldn't buy myself. I got to find a new, a better copy."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg did have a copy, however, of an obscure 1931 Gary
Cooper-Claudette Colbert movie, "His Woman," as well as the very rare
and very bad 1956 Katharine Hepburn-Bob Hope comedy, "The Iron
Petticoat."</TE>
<TE>   He's been collecting films for years, and he started selling
videos to keep active. "I am one of those people who can't sit still.
I am the only person alive who can tell you the capital of Somalia if
you want to know. I have this font of irrelevant information."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg has about 150 of his favorite films on VHS. When a
request comes in for a title he doesn't have ready access to, he goes
searching around the world, often from collectors. "I get them from
all over. I am at the moment writing for Spanish films to the Latin
American Video Archives. I found them on the Internet. If anybody has
something I want, I usually trade."</TE>
<TE>   He says he has also talked with "upwards to 20 lawyers" about
copyright infringement and other legal questions dealing with movie
titles. "There are certain things I will not sell, like 'Bolero' with
George Raft and Carole Lombard. There is a suit pending as far as I
remember -- two people who are alive claim they did the dancing for
Raft and Lombard. That's patently stupid. George Raft was a fantastic
dancer. Carole couldn't dance."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg says he gets "tons of hits" a week on his Web site --
www.blsinc.com/partners/bloomberg/bloomberg.htm. "I decided to stop
sending out order forms because it is 37 cents each time I stick
something in an envelope. So we put up my Web site. There's a wish
list and a want list. People just download it and fill it out and
mail it in." Most videos cost $45 to purchase; it's $50 and up for
titles that require an extensive search.</TE>
<TE>   He generally deals only with films from the silent era through the
'40s "I don't' deal with animation," he says. "I don't deal with
serials. They were falling apart five years after they came out."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg admits he still hasn't been able to find certain titles.
In fact, he has his own wish list. "I would love to find 'Rose of the
Rancho'; 'My Man,' with Fanny Brice from 1928; 'The Great Gatsby'
from 1926."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg recently acquired a copy of the 1929 film "The Letter,"
with Jeanne Eagels, who was nominated posthumously for an Oscar for
best actress. "She should have won the Oscar," he says of Eagels. "I
think it was the year they gave it to Mary Pickford for 'Coquette.'
They did it to give United Artists a boost, but the Oscar should have
gone to her."</TE>
<TE>   (Note: Besides the Web site, Bloomberg can be reached at (415)
931-3676. However, you may have to try him several times before you
reach him; he doesn't have an answering machine.)</TE>

<HD>Ancient hero, modern epic</HD>
<DH>In an ambitious, big-budget film, Zhang Yimou turns the
story of united China's first emperor into a martial arts drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Zhang Yimou's "Hero" premiered here last weekend, marking the first
foray by mainland China's leading director into epic martial arts
dramas, a genre Hong Kong has dominated for more than three decades.</LD>
<LD>   With an all-star Chinese cast headlined by Jet Li, the film is an
impressive blend of art-house aesthetics and aerial kung fu dogfights
with ambitions of attracting a mass global audience. The film also is
building high expectations in the post-"Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon" cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Zhang has downplayed any aspirations for an Oscar, but the film is
China's submission for a best foreign-language film award. It will
hit the international festival circuit, and Miramax is distributing
it in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "I simply wanted to make a movie that was fun to watch," Zhang
said at a news conference before the film's extravagant opening, at
which Chinese politicos were treated to a screening at the cavernous
Great Hall of the People, the scene of last month's 16th Communist
Party Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese and foreign media have lavished attention on the details
of the film's production, its $30-million budget (the biggest for a
Chinese film), its formidable publicity offensive and the intense
security measures aimed at thwarting would-be video pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Like fellow director Chen Kaige's "Assassin," which premiered in
the Great Hall three years ago, the story line of Zhang's "Hero" is a
variant on an historical event during the 2nd century BC: the
attempted assassination of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor to rule a
united China.</TE>
<TE>   For killing off three potential assassins, the emperor rewards a
local constable, played by Li, with an audience and a chance to
recount how he bested the trio of expert swordsmen. But the account
comes under suspicion, along with the constable's loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   Competing narratives follow, each with a different color scheme
and alternate characterizations for the story's main figures.</TE>
<TE>   The color-coded cataclysms of black arrows, white brushes, brown
bamboo scrolls, red leaves and green drapes are Zhang's signature
touch, reminiscent of the richly dyed cloths in "Ju Dou" or the
hanging clusters of corn and chili peppers in "The Story of Qui Ju."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast with the lengthy, static compositions of Zhang's
earlier films, the strength of "Hero" lies in the visual and sonic
impact of its action. The cruise missile-like flight of the Qin
army's hail of arrows and the gravel-spraying hoofs of its cavalry
pack the punch of a modern war movie.</TE>
<TE>   The backdrops include China's most spectacular natural scenery,
including the desert canyons of Dunhuang and the azure lakes of
Jiuzhaigou.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some critics and viewers have not found the film original in
its themes or convincing in some of its portrayals.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, we all understand the emperor and understanding the
emperor means peace. What kind of logic is that?" asked Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences film expert Chen Xiaoming in an article in
the Beijing Daily.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews before the premiere, two principal actors said they
had agreed to the project out of admiration for Zhang. But they
confided that the film turned out differently from what they had
imagined, and that they had expected it to be more realistic and
complex.</TE>
<TE>   The film's ideal of the romantic but lethal peacenik is embodied
in Broken Sword, the assassin played by Tony Leung and his equally
lethal lover, Snow, played by Maggie Cheung. The convictions of
Leung's character radiate from his wounded smile, and the chemistry
between him and Cheung, which fueled Hong Kong director Wong
Kar-wai's "In the Mood for Love," still smolders.</TE>
<TE>   But when Leung uses his calligraphic brushwork to demonstrate to
the constable and the emperor that the highest level of martial skill
is to transcend technique and violence, the results are less than
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   "Hero" is the first movie in years in which former martial arts
athlete Li has spoken in his native language, and he shows an
unprecedented maturity. But the narrow range of expression that
filters through his stony visage offers little clue of his conversion
to Leung's cause.</TE>
<TE>   While the pacifists clearly move the emperor, their moral suasion
and sacrifices still seem lost on him. We can imagine a twinge of
regret flickering across his face before he commits the greatest act
of censorship in Chinese history: burning all of the country's books
and burying its scholars alive.</TE>
<TE>   The totalitarian rule of China's first emperor has been debated,
cursed and emulated for centuries. Zhang admits that he did not
tackle some difficult issues head-on. "I had no intention of
assessing Qin Shihuang's place in history," he said in an interview.
"Movies can't resolve this question. We're just telling a story."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the themes explored in "Hero" have been treated more
successfully elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang started planning the film before "Crouching Tiger" had great
success, but the bad timing, which may force comparison to Ang Lee's
work, does not work in favor of "Hero." Technically, the film is in a
slightly different genre from "Crouching Tiger." Chinese film experts
distinguish the wuxia or swordplay flicks of the 1960s from the wuda
or kung fu pictures of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Hero" martial arts choreographer Tony Ching focuses on the
aesthetics of combat rather than the techniques, and prides himself
on his ability to make nonmartial arts actors (such as Zhang Ziyi of
"Crouching Tiger" fame, as well as Leung and Cheung) look like
adepts. His style contrasts with "old school" masters such as
"Crouching Tiger" choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, who try to bring out
the natural beauty in martial technique itself.</TE>
<TE>   The combat in "Hero" is all with weapons, much of it airborne wire
work, and largely unoriginal. Only the duel between Li and veteran
martial artist Donnie Yen delivers the electricity of a face-off
between highly skilled combatants.</TE>
<TE>   As for martial arts movies, "no matter how you make them, it's all
been done before," said Li, who says he is too busy to practice
martial arts these days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to explain the martial artists' code of chivalry,
especially to foreigners," Zhang said. "I'd say it is one of man's
spiritual realms. I wanted to make the martial arts action
subordinate to the chivalrous conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Leung said that like Zhang, he grew up reading the martial arts
novels of Hong Kong's Jin Yong and Taiwan's Gu Long, but that
people's conceptions of that fictional world can be very different.</TE>
<TE>   "Hero" is likely to be among Zhang's least controversial films.
His earlier works -- "Ju Dou," "Raise the Red Lantern," and the
Cannes Palme D'Or prize-winning "To Live" -- have been or are still
banned for their political content. Zhang's films have been
criticized sometimes for pandering to foreign tastes, sometimes for
parroting government propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   The crew of "Hero" reflects Zhang's growing prominence in the
international film industry.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese composer Tan Dun, who, along with cellist Yo-Yo Ma,
created the music for "Crouching Tiger," composed the music. Tan
invited violinist Yitzhak Perlman to perform some of the pieces with
a violin outfitted with silk strings to sound like an ancient Chinese
instrument.</TE>
<TE>   From Japan, Zhang employed Emi Wada, former costume designer for
one of Zhang's favorite directors, Akira Kurosawa, and the powerful
rhythms of the Taiko drummers.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang also teamed up with Mandarin-speaking Australian
cinematographer Chris Doyle, who has contributed to the visual
richness of many of Zhang's films.</TE>

"Silent Night," "Help!" is "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" -- giving
Beatlemaniacs fresh listens to both. They divvy up 20 songs

and "Rubber Soul" through "Abbey Road" versions on the second. They

Brothers to trump the generic-looking "Christmas Grass" package. But
"Christmas Grass" shines with straightforward, impeccably played
instrumentals by no less than Alison Krauss, Ricky Skaggs, Ronnie
McCoury and Stuart Duncan. "Christmas on the Mountain" is more for
fans of the acts, who'll be more entertained by the corny humor and
quasi-novelty numbers, than for the average music fan looking for new

<HD>On the edges of influence in Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Yes, he's under federal indictment, but what really steams
Jules Nasso is the suggestion that he's not a player.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julius R. Nasso has been waiting six months for this trip down
Wilshire Boulevard and he is determined to make it in style, with a
diamond pin as the top button of his white shirt and a limo decorated
with twinkle lights. And an entourage, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Here's who piles into the limo with him for the drive to the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theater Tuesday night:
Two of the bodyguards who have been watching over him since his
attempted extortion indictment in New York. One of the lawyers waging
Nasso's legal war with his old partner, the action star Steven
Seagal, the same man Nasso is accused of trying to shake down. The
former maitre d' from Spago. And the mandatory babe -- a young woman
from Czechoslovakia well cast for the role of being escorted over a
red carpet before 30 TV crews and dozens of still photographers. Most
are there to get shots of Tom Cruise, who soon will be striding the
carpet as one of the executive producers of the -low-budget but
buzzed-about film "Narc."</LD>
<LD>   But the man in the limo will be looking for another name when the
producer credits roll.</LD>
<TE>   "Now the show begins," one of the entourage announces as Jules
Nasso pulls up to the curb.</TE>
<TE>   When we last encountered Nasso over the summer, he was steamed,
and not only because of his indictment in June. He was concerned,
naturally, about the Feds' accusation he had sought out the local
Mafia capo on Staten Island to cook up the plot against Seagal, who
Nasso complained had reneged on an agreement to do four more films
with him.</TE>
<TE>   But what rankled him almost as much as being branded a mob
"associate" was something else a federal prosecutor called him at a
bail hearing: "a self-styled film producer." Nasso kept saying, "He
said what? 'A self-styled producer?' Self-styled?"</TE>
<TE>   The Mafia charges he could answer in court. But this slur cut
deeper for the 5-foot-6 pharmacist by training, who had been bitten
by the Hollywood bug as a young man when Italian director Sergio
Leone came to Brooklyn to shoot the mob saga "Once Upon a Time in
America." Nasso spent the next two decades trying to establish his
bona fides, getting his break when he befriended Seagal, the rugged
martial-arts instructor he saw as "the next John Wayne."</TE>
<TE>   Though some studio veterans viewed Nasso as more of a personal
manager and peacemaker for the temperamental actor than as a
traditional producer, no one could take away the credits he racked up
during more than a decade of Seagal-Nasso Productions.</TE>
<TE>   After FBI agents arrested him at his waterfront Staten Island
mansion , he brooded at how the prosecutor made him sound like some
wannabe again. That's when he began talking about the trip to Los
Angeles for the premiere of the film that would prove any such
naysayers wrong, once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   He flew in Monday night on low-cost Jet Blue -- security costs
have been killing him, he said. Tuesday morning, he had two egg-white
omeletes on the patio of his Wilshire Boulevard hotel, the first one
being too small. He took a cell-phone call from a gossip columnist
back in New York who was preparing to fling another bit of dirt from
the central evidence in the mob case, FBI tapes recorded at a Staten
Island restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso fretted, as he would off and on through the trip, that maybe
he shouldn't have come. "I don't want to hurt the movie," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Nasso tells it, he got the call on "Narc" about six months
after he split with Seagal in 2000, from an old friend who does
completion bonding for films. A production in Toronto was in trouble.
Could he help out with some "bridge money"?</TE>
<TE>   Nasso says he borrowed about half a million dollars, "not off the
street, not gangster money," for the then-obscure project of a
fledgling writer-director, Joe Carnahan. The shaved-head son of a
grocer had a one-film resume, "Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane,"
which he'd made for less than $8,000 and somehow gotten released in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan, now 33, had grown up as a fan of the gritty cop movies
of the '70s, such as the "The French Connection," in which justice
eluded an antihero Gene Hackman in a climactic warehouse shootout. He
tried making a short like that in college, about a warehouse
confrontation between cops and drug dealers, but it got a C-minus,
Carnahan said. Nonetheless, he wanted to "revisit" and expand the
scenario as his second feature, drawing on the life of an old friend,
a heroin addict, to craft a script about two Detroit detectives
obsessed with solving the murder of a colleague.</TE>
<TE>   The studios were not sold. "Everyone said no: A-tier, B-tier,
C-tier on down," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan's agent passed the script to another client, actor Ray
Liotta, who was looking to develop material for himself. Poised for
stardom after "GoodFellas" and "Field of Dreams," Liotta had seen his
career slump instead. He decided, "It's not how good you do in the
movie -- it's how good the movie does. And mine weren't doing so
good.... I did 'Operation Dumbo Drop,' so that gives you an idea."</TE>
<TE>   Sounding like many actors, he added, "I wasn't crazy about the
movies I was getting ... so we formed our own production company."
Liotta and his wife named it Tiara Blu Films -- after her taste in
headgear and the color of his eyes -- and settled on "Narc" as their
first project. Liotta would play one of the cops, Jason Patric the
other.</TE>
<TE>   They began shooting in Toronto in February 2001, under a financing
deal with Los Angeles-based Cutting Edge Entertainment, one of whose
principals mortgaged his house to come up with part of the
$3-million-plus budget.</TE>
<TE>   "A week into shooting, we got a phone call [telling us] we didn't
have the money," recalled Diane Nabatoff, the principal producer for
Liotta's new company. "Everyone told us, 'Walk off. Shut down.' "</TE>
<TE>   They didn't, though. As Cutting Edge and others scrambled to find
additional investors, Carnahan used whatever film they could afford
and finished the shoot in an intense 28 days.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan, Liotta and Nabatoff all said they only learned later how
many people had been recruited to help fund their film -- and how
these strangers they had never met, or seen, had become "attached" as
producers. They wound up with four listed producers (including
Nasso), nine executive producers, five co-executive producers and
their one line producer. That roster became a running gag this past
Sunday when the lead actors, director and Nabatoff appeared on a
panel after a screening at the Directors Guild in New York -- and not
because one of the names was now also listed on a federal mob
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   No, the joke was the producer proliferation. "We bummed a
cigarette off some guy -- he got an E.P. credit," Liotta quipped.</TE>
<TE>   One of the other panelists invited the audience to get credits
too, saying, "There's a sign-up sheet outside."</TE>
<TE>   They were able to joke about it now because of the eventual twist
in their movie-making ordeal: how "Narc" was a hit of this year's
Sundance festival and later was screened for Tom Cruise and his
producing partner, Paula Wagner, who then convinced Paramount
Pictures to pick it up. Before long, Carnahan was lined up to direct
a film with Harrison Ford, and the once precarious "Narc" was being
slated for January release in up to 1,500 theaters nationwide, after
limited release this weekend in Los Angeles and New York for, as they
say, "academy consideration."</TE>
<TE>   "If someone doesn't wake up and give you an Academy Award
nomination, Hollywood is dead," a man in the balcony called down to
Liotta at Sunday's New York screening.</TE>
<TE>   Liotta called back, "Could you say that again?" and the audience
laughed on cue, having no idea of the battle that the brewing Oscar
campaign had set off between the actor and producer No. 4. That
acrimony lingered even after both men arrived in L.A. for this week's
premiere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bad news</TE>
<TE>   At a Starbucks several miles from where Nasso ordered his omelets,
Liotta told of calling Nasso a few weeks ago with some bad news.
Under the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science rules, only
three producers may be named for each film nominated for best
picture. In the long-odds event that "Narc" gets one in February,
Liotta said, the named producers would be the trio who did the
"hands-on everyday stuff" -- Liotta, his wife and Nabatoff. Not Jules
Nasso.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso responded with a rant about how he had "saved" the film,
Liotta said. Nasso has told friends that he did everything from help
edit it to advise Liotta to gain weight to make his vengeful
detective more convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Such stories astonish the actor.</TE>
<TE>   "Never saw him. None of those producers ever spent a day [on
set]," the 47-year-old Liotta said. "I'll bet deep down the guy's
really nice. He wants legitimacy. 'Who needs Steven Seagal -- I just
did a movie, "Narc," with Ray Liotta.' I understand. But ... don't
yell at me."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 2, Paramount took out one of those full-page "For Your
Consideration" ads touting "Narc" in Variety, and listing four other
companies behind the film, including Liotta's Tiara Blu Films.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, there was another full-page "Narc" ad, offering
"Congratulations and Thanks to Our Cast and Crew." But this one was
taken out by Julius R. Nasso Productions.</TE>
<TE>   During the limo ride from his hotel to the premiere, the
50-year-old Nasso was regaling his entourage with how an old industry
friend had told him, "Jules, we're ready to pull the plug and flush
the film" until he came to the rescue. Nasso said he wasn't going to
be "steamrolled by star power" and deprived of his credit.</TE>
<TE>   "You did it, Jules!" said the former Spago maitre d', Bernard
Erpicum, who, when he wasn't encouraging Nasso, kept talking about
his own new project, hoping to recapture the "magic" he'd once had
with Wolfgang Puck at Silvio de Mori's new place on Rodeo Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The two bodyguards were seated near him, toward the front of the
limo, as was Nasso's civil lawyer from New York, Robert Hantman, who
is handling his $60-million suit against Seagal. Hantman, who was
wearing a corduroy tuxedo jacket, said he had spoken with Liotta's
manager about the credit dispute and come to an agreement -- it was
way too premature to argue over Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso's other guest, Christine Simrova, an economics student from
Prague, already had had quite a day, including a "Pretty Woman"-like
experience along Rodeo Drive: first a visit to a hair salon, then to
the Armani store, when she asked, "Where do I find a dress?" Nasso
explained that it was a platonic relationship ("she has a boyfriend")
but she stayed by his side as he climbed out of the limo and marched
across the red carpet, stopping to pose when some of the
photographers called out "Jules! Jules!" Such are the rewards of
notoriety, though once inside the academy headquarters Nasso wondered
whether the "rag magazines," the tabloids, might use the photos to
zing him again. Near the stairs to the academy's Samuel Goldwyn
Theater, he passed Seagal's current producer without a word. But
others stopped him for hugs or handshakes, including one that left
him beaming, from Rob Friedman, the vice chairman of Paramount.
"Self-styled?" Nasso said after the studio executive moved on.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the film was over, buffet lines were set up in the
lobby for the usual look-who's-here premiere party. Cruise apparently
had left after his walk-and-wave down the carpet, but everyone agreed
that he'd helped earn his own credit -- as one of the executive
producers -- by attracting such a gantlet of cameras to a
small-budget indie-style film. Nasso spent much of the next hour
smoking cigarettes on the terrace area, and saying he probably should
have stayed home on Staten Island. When yet another producer who
worked with Seagal came up, however, he couldn't resist a little "How
did you survive?" banter.</TE>
<TE>   When the crowd thinned, the entourage returned to the limo for one
last short stop at Ago Ristorante on Melrose. Harvey Weinstein was
there following the Los Angeles premiere of his new Miramax film,
"Gangs of New York." There were waves for Harvey, but Nasso reserved
his hug for a fellow at the next table almost exactly his size, and
smoking a foot-long cigar. Joe Pesci is another guy from the streets
of New York who can't take this fantasy life for granted -- he was
managing a Bronx restaurant when he got a call asking him if he'd
want to play Robert De Niro's brother in "Raging Bull."</TE>
<TE>   Now Nasso poured out his troubles to the great portrayer of wise
guys, not needing to mention his criminal case, but complaining about
these actors who wanted to put their wives and friends in the credits
-- never mind that he for years had been the producing partner of an
actor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd tell them, I don't want the credit -- just send me the cash,"
Pesci said. Then he said, "I'm so happy for you, Jules. Just relax.
Just remember, everything must pass."</TE>
<TE>   Nasso was to fly back to New York on Thursday, despite his
lawyer's urging him to stay longer and follow Pesci's advice to
relax. But the morning did not go well for "Narc," which received not
a single Golden Globe nomination. Oscar nominations will be announced
Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the first trial stemming from last spring's indictment
will be underway, if not over. Scheduled to be in federal court in
Brooklyn on Jan. 6 are three Gottis and other heavy hitters in the
racketeering case, including the alleged Staten Island capo, Sonny
Ciccone. If there's no plea bargain, Seagal could be called as a
witness. Nasso and his brother, Vincent, are not scheduled for trial
until next September, when his lawyers may have to explain why he is
quoted in the tape transcripts telling the waterfront boss, "Tell me
what I have to do and I'll do it." Prosecutors have alleged that the
group was conspiring to extort $150,000 per film from Seagal, though
no money was collected.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, who says he has a good explanation for what's on those
tapes and will show his innocence, spends much of each day on the
phone with his lawyers.  "I'm an alleged gangster. My concentration
now is on facing my accuser, not worrying about all this Tinseltown
stuff," he said shortly before he left Los Angeles. But the phone was
ringing off the hook while he was here, he noted. . "Yeah, I got tons
of deals. I'm still a young producer."</TE>

<HD>Wit adds a satisfying kick to a frothy romantic treat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many have tried but few contemporary filmmakers have succeeded in
capturing the wit, charm and sophistication of the classic Hollywood
romantic comedies. Writer Marc Lawrence, in his directorial debut
with "Two Weeks Notice," and his stars Sandra Bullock, who is also
his producer, and Hugh Grant have, however, gotten it just right.
They understand how all important the effortless-seeming light touch
is and how crucial it is to play against the predictability inherent
in the genre with all the humor, intelligence and ingenuity they can
muster.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the
down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be
sensational, and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment.
"Two Weeks Notice," as accomplished as it is unpretentious, offers a
satisfying alternative to the much-ballyhooed year-end blockbusters.</LD>
<TE>   Bullock's Brooklyn born and bred Lucy Kelson is a Harvard-educated
Legal Aid attorney-activist who carries on the liberal ideals
instilled in her by her law professor mother (Dana Ivey) and her
lawyer father (Robert Klein), who continue to live in the small
vintage Coney Island apartment in which they raised their daughter.
So it is not surprising to meet Lucy as she is staring down a
wrecking ball about to demolish a magnificent Brooklyn movie palace.
It is to be replaced by yet another project of the ubiquitous Wade
Corp., a real estate development company on the par of that of Donald
Trump (who in fact cameos as himself).</TE>
<TE>   Even closer to her heart is Coney Island's community center, a
beautiful Mediterranean-style 1920s structure endangered by yet
another Wade proposal. However, when Lucy attempts to protest
directly to George Wade (Grant), he winds up co-opting her, in a
virtuoso display of self-deprecating charm, by persuading her to sign
on as his chief legal counsel -- and he promises that the community
center will be preserved. (George Wade gives the company its public
face while his less glamorous, no-nonsense brother Howard, played by
David Haig, is really in charge.)</TE>
<TE>   Lucy and George prove to be a crackerjack team, with Lucy stepping
up Wade Corp.'s socially conscious charitable activities and
revealing herself to be a tough negotiator in handling George's
divorce. Pretty soon she's selecting George's ties and stationery;
pretty soon after that she wants out because of his incessant and
trivial demands. Lucy is a zealous workaholic not without humor but
lousy at cutting loose and having fun, while George is an unabashed
playboy who makes few if any serious demands upon himself.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved in the making of this film surely knows we've
seen all this before many times but strives imaginatively to make
"Two Weeks Notice" distinctive. Lawrence, who wrote the much broader
but equally sure-fire " Miss Congeniality" for Bullock, is unafraid
to make Lucy and George really smart -- a key characteristic of such
evergreen romantic comedies as "The Philadelphia Story" and "His Girl
Friday" -- as well as immensely likable. The people around Lucy and
George are as well-drawn as they are. "Two Weeks Notice" also shows
that Lawrence can direct actors as skillfully as he can write for
them.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock continues to polish her producing as well as her acting
abilities. Every element and detail in "Two Weeks Notice" contributes
to its overall effect. The mellowness and attractiveness of the
film's settings is matched by the glow of Laszlo Kovacs'
cinematography. Even though the way Lucy dresses falls short of
George's standard for female glamour, she is not dowdy but merely
appropriately low key, which pays off in the film's big moment.
Suffice it to say that what Edith Head did for Elizabeth Taylor and
Givenchy for Audrey Hepburn, designer Gary Jones has done for
Bullock. Production designer Peter Larkin and composer John Powell
have furthermore enabled Lawrence and Kovacs to turn "Two Weeks
Notice" into a Valentine to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Two Weeks Notice" deftly ups the ante as it unfolds, enabling us
to care more about Lucy and George than we perhaps realize. It is a
lovely, amusing diversion from the start, but the depth of its
poignancy by the time it's over comes as a surprise.</TE>

<HD>Mandela will return to prison for HIV benefit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Nelson Mandela will be just another prison number again when he plays
host of an HIV-AIDS benefit concert on Robben Island, where he spent
18 of his 27 years in apartheid jails.</LD>
<LD>   The Feb. 2 concert -- featuring artists such as U2's Bono, Shaggy,
Queen and Macy Gray -- will be held within the walls of the island
prison, which is now a World Heritage site.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers say the 84-year-old Mandela will walk onto the stage to
the tune of a new song, "48864," named for the number he wore as a
prisoner during his time on the island.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great way to close ... to chant this number and get Nelson
Mandela to walk onto the stage and be able to speak to the world
about HIV-AIDS and the number," Dave Stewart, one half of Eurythmics
and music coordinator for "Mandela SOS," told reporters on a
conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he, Bono and Joe Strummer of the Clash wrote the
song, which will be on a "Mandela SOS" album.</TE>
<TE>   Mandela, who admits he still finds it difficult to say the word
"condom" in public, has become a leading AIDS awareness campaigner
since he retired as South Africa's first black president in 1999. At
least one in nine South Africans, or about 4.8 million people in a
population of 43 million, has the disease or is infected with the HIV
virus that causes it. The concert will be televised globally, with
all funds raised going to the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the United
Nations' program UNAIDS and two other groups.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when mindless spectacles are filling museums and American
culture is being so aggressively dumbed down that art is on the verge
of becoming an underground movement, it's heartening to see the new
video installation by Jennifer Steinkamp at Acme Gallery. Titled
"Jimmy Carter," the L.A. artist's silent light show is a blast from
the past that provides some respite from the horrors of modern life
while never making the mistake that art's job is to serve up escapist
entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Thoughtful and ravishing, Steinkamp's dazzling piece of
participatory theater is as accessible as anything on television --
and as imaginative as the best art in any medium. It's radical
because its optimism is not pie-in-the-sky utopianism but
down-to-earth, this-is-it realism. To spend more than a few moments
in the darkened gallery is to experience your mind and body working
in concert, cooperating to process the generous sensory extravaganza.</LD>
<TE>   Three walls are covered with projected images of thousands of
flowers Steinkamp designed on a computer. Arranged in rows that run
from floor to ceiling, the artificial asters, chrysanthemums, lilies,
orchids and tulips form a rainbow of blazing colors -- screaming
yellows, glorious oranges, off-key periwinkles -- all punctuated by
verdant greens and gaps of absolute blackness. It's hard to say
whether you've stepped into an electronically transmitted hothouse or
are somehow standing inside a giant stripe painting whose molecular
structure forms an impossible cosmos.</TE>
<TE>   And that's only the beginning. Steinkamp has set her wallflowers
in motion.</TE>
<TE>   All the rows sway sinuously, in the manner of sea grass pulled
back and forth by the surf. Individual blossoms buck the current,
their stems and petals bending and twisting. Imagine a meadow
jampacked with flowers so eager to reproduce that they can't wait for
bees to pollinate them. The flowers make jittery movements, zipping
out of formation to cross-pollinate before looping back into place.</TE>
<TE>   Up close, the cinematic image disintegrates into a grid of pixels
that occasionally sit still but never for long. To stand back and
take in the whole is to see patterns begin to take shape, only to
dissolve into apparent chaos. But Steinkamp's carefully orchestrated
disorder inspires a wider perspective, a big-picture view in which
everything just might make sense -- if your imagination's up to the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1950s, Harold Rosenberg coined the term "apocalyptic
wallpaper" to describe abstract paintings that failed to convey the
aspirations of their makers. Steinkamp's installation turns
Rosenberg's term into a virtue: a work of art that is scintillating
and scary, aware of its place in the world and bold enough to fly in
the face of business as usual.</TE>

<TE>   Paintings explore a new dimension</TE>
<TE>   Pia Fries is a painter who doesn't let her infatuation with
trick-the-eye illusionism get in the way of her love of paint's
tactility. At Christopher Grimes Gallery, four large oils on canvas
and three medium-sized paintings on paper are simultaneously juicy
and lyrical, as resplendent in their physicality as they are graceful
in their visual appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss-born, Dusseldorf, Germany-based artist's first solo show
in Los Angeles demonstrates that, when it comes to abstract painting,
you can eat your cake and have it too -- especially if you have
talent to burn and aren't afraid of making a mess.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers reap the benefits of Fries' celebratory paintings, which
begin as big white fields. Onto these blank slates she silk-screens
enlarged photographic images of rudimentary sculptures she has made
from lumps of oil paint or bundles of brightly colored crepe paper.
From a distance, these mechanically reproduced pictures resemble
brush strokes. They form the backbone of Fries' compositions, whose
flesh and blood is made of nothing but paint.</TE>
<TE>   In her hands, paint doesn't function as it ordinarily does,
smoothly covering surfaces or filling up space. The 47-year-old
artist uses paint sculpturally, exploiting its plasticity to build
3-D reliefs that take turns pulling your eye into deep space and
jumping off the wall.</TE>
<TE>   A typical painting by Fries includes every color in the rainbow
(and an indescribable variety of mixtures). More important, it
includes an encyclopedic inventory of ways of applying paint:
slathering, slinging, stirring, splotching, splashing, scraping and
squirting (through specially designed funnels), to name but a few of
her techniques.</TE>
<TE>   No two components of any painting are laid down the same way. This
suggests that the permutations available to Fries are infinite and
that she'd need a powerful computer to see her vision realized.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of advanced digital technology registers in her
paintings in another way. Although Fries juxtaposes photographic
reproductions with hand-painted passages, her works never have the
presence of collages (whose cut-and-paste collisions are beginning to
look very 20th century). In contrast, her up-to-the-minute paintings
give sensuous shape to the look of digitally manipulated images in
which disparate components fuse to form seamless hybrids.</TE>

<TE>   Schmalix: Colorful contradictions</TE>
<TE>   Hubert Schmalix has titled the centerpiece of his first solo show
in Los Angeles in 10 years "The Place Where I Got Caught." To stand
before the 10-by-15-foot painting, which depicts the corner of a
life-sized brick wall in an Arcadian landscape, is to think that a
more appropriate title would be "The Place Where I Made My Escape."</TE>
<TE>   Similar contradictions -- between memory and make-believe, truth
and deception, the past and the present -- animate Schmalix's images
at Black Dragon Society. Rendered in the style of thickly outlined
pictures in children's coloring books, his three oils on canvas are
filled with more mystery than their simple forms initially reveal.</TE>
<TE>   In the foreground of the largest painting lies a crumpled sheet.
Its freshly laundered whiteness contrasts dramatically with the ochre
wall, olive lawn, purple leaves and orange sky. Although the best
explanation for the stray sheet is that it blew off a neighbor's
clothesline or was dropped by inattentive picnickers, it's difficult
not to think of it as a toga, shed by someone in a rush to get naked.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout history, gardens like this have served as perfect
settings for illicit trysts. In Schmalix's picture, the stage is set
for such liaisons to continue in the present; between viewers and the
web of historical references the painter has woven together with
seemingly effortless ease.</TE>
<TE>   The stillness Schmalix conveys in his harmonious composition has a
classic, even antiquarian quality. But his modern palette and
perverse paint handling suggest an unholy alliance between Paul
Gauguin and Maxfield Parrish.</TE>
<TE>   Schmalix applies paint swiftly, immediately sopping it up with
ordinary paper towels. He does this repeatedly, leaving traces of the
disposable towels' embossed surface on his canvases. The outlines of
his superimposed images rarely line up precisely, suggesting
woodblock prints made too hastily to register cleanly.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" and Roy Lichtenstein's image of a
woman's arm sponging a stove clean lie behind all of Schmalix's
paintings, in which restraint reins in the excesses of Expressionism
without blunting the emotional appeal or narrative range. The elusive
artist, born in a small town in Austria, educated in Vienna and based
in Los Angeles, disappears from his pictures -- all the better to
catch viewers in them.</TE>

<TE>   Zittel recycles without a cause</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Zittel's new works are based on a great idea: recycling.
Unfortunately, all they do with this environmentally friendly concept
is exploit it.</TE>
<TE>   In her pieces, active conservation of the Earth's resources gives
way to a conservative view of how art works in the world: as a symbol
of good intentions.</TE>
<TE>   At Regen Projects, the gallery walls have been painted a rich
brown. The luxuriant tint highlights the colorlessness of works from
two ongoing series.</TE>
<TE>   The first consists of embossed wall panels Zittel has made from
recycled paper. Mounted in powder-coated steel frames, the squares of
molded paper-pulp hang in variously sized groups. Their simple
geometric patterns follow no logical sequence.</TE>
<TE>   Like stylishly mismatched building blocks, Zittel's clunky
decorations symbolize the privilege of not having to decide which
pattern is best. In this, they partake in the aversion to critical
judgment that's currently sweeping the art world, where shortsighted
pretenders act as if the wheel needs to be reinvented.</TE>
<TE>   The second series is represented by several white dresses Zittel
made from raw wool. Like the wall panels, which are too expensive to
even think about using as construction materials, the lumpy garments
are impractical fashion statements. Filled with holes, they look like
the offspring of moth-eaten clothing and something a sophisticated
Neanderthal would love to wear.</TE>
<TE>   As works of conceptual art, Zittel's pieces recycle ideas that
have seen better days. As utilitarian products, they fail to meet the
rigors of the marketplace, where good intentions are no match for
value.</TE>
<TE>   An out-of-touch, let's-pretend quality runs throughout Zittel's
body of work, in which dilettantism is raised to an art form,
stylishness stands in for substance and token gestures take the place
of practical activities. While her art may not be the emperor's new
clothes, it has the same sense of exaggerated self-importance.</TE>

<HD>Manhattan transfers, successful and not so</HD>
<DH>'Movin' Out' got the fine-tuning it needed between its
out-of-town tryout and its Broadway opening. Other shows fare less
well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Phillips</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In Hollywood, where your realities become dreams, no single word can
unmake someone's day like "turnaround." When a script goes into
turnaround, it means it has been dumped by its studio and must search
for a new home. Leave it to the film industry to transform a chipper
phrase into something euphemistically heinous.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, "turnaround" hasn't become common parlance in the
theater, so the notion of turning a project around still carries the
old optimistic ring. This is precisely what director-choreographer
Twyla Tharp has done with "Movin' Out," scored to the songs of Billy
Joel, since its Chicago tryout last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Now settling in for a long Broadway run at the Richard Rodgers
Theatre (if such a kinetic show can be said to settle anywhere),
"Movin' Out" has officially and rather remarkably turned around. On
Tharp's own terms, it works. Audiences are going even crazier for Act
2's choreographic fireworks than they did in Chicago and, crucially,
Act 1 of Tharp's story ballet no longer appears to be sending a
certain percentage of ticket holders up the aisles and out the door
at intermission, disoriented and muttering.</LD>
<TE>   How did this happen? After the July tryout opening, Tharp,
unencumbered by the usual Broadway cadre of collaborators with
competing ideas for improvement, went to work with her dancers. For
weeks during the Chicago run, the dancers performed the old show at
night and rehearsed the evolving one during the day.</TE>
<TE>   These weren't cosmetic changes; these were numbers wholly revised,
largely for clarity but also for dramatic selectivity, which is a
higher form of clarity. "Movin' Out" now begins with a prologue
danced by the company to "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me" (not heard
in Chicago). At one point, Tharp sends her five principals sliding
straight to the lip of the stage, as if to declare: We are the people
the show is about. It's not memorable choreography, but it fulfills
its mission.</TE>
<TE>   As before, Eddie (John Selya), Tony (Keith Roberts) and James
(Benjamin G. Bowman) experience hell on earth in combat. James is
killed. Now, movingly, the late Act 1 passages focus more intently on
the grieving war widow, Judy (Ashley Tuttle). Without squandering the
full ensemble, "Movin' Out" now boasts five fully rounded and
artfully balanced characters, the fifth being Brenda (Elizabeth
Parkinson), whose bruised and bruising relationship with Tony becomes
a postwar war unto itself.</TE>
<TE>   The exasperated tone of many of the Chicago "Movin' Out" reviews
had to do, I think, with Tharp's overcrowded and hammering impulses,
otherwise known as "the Oliver Stone effect." All the same -- here is
the crow-eating sentence -- I don't think I fully appreciated how
good the five principals really were, and are. In Chicago, at the
press opening, you couldn't always find them, amid Tharp's visual
aesthetic. Now, on Broadway, each of the five pops out with a kind of
glorious confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Selya's the flash-master and a true star, but the entire company
responds to Tharp's best dances: "Angry Young Man," "Big Shot" and,
especially, the beautiful, thrashing "Shameless," a reunion for
Parkinson and Roberts that ranks with Tharp's peak achievements. In
an entirely different emotional key, it's as joyous as the ensemble
swirl Tharp imagined years ago to Willie "The Lion" Smith's "Echoes
of Spring."</TE>
<TE>   Some of what I initially resisted in "Movin' Out" remains. Eddie's
descent into Greenwich Village S&amp;M nastiness ("Captain Jack") is as
silly as ever. The Vietnam battle sequence is more lucid, but Tharp
backs herself into a narrative corner here, required by the story to
paint Eddie as somewhat and somehow culpable in James' death, but not
really, so ... confusion. But a lot less of it.</TE>
<TE>   In form and content, "Movin' Out" may not relate to many other
Broadway-minded musical-theater projects -- that's a plus, not a
minus -- but any director can learn a lesson from how thoroughly
Tharp revisited this show.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the mighty Harold Prince. Twenty Tony Awards
notwithstanding, he might've taken a cue from Tharp as he oversaw the
Chicago-to-Broadway transfer of "Hollywood Arms," the play based on
Carol Burnett's early years, written by Burnett and her daughter, the
late Carrie Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Arms" tried out at the Goodman Theatre earlier this
year. Since then, Burnett has tweaked bits here and there, setting up
the conceit of the younger and older Burnett stand-ins (played by
Sara Niemietz and Donna Lynne Champlin) more effectively at the top.
But a few new lines don't make a full-on revision, which the script,
sweet as some of it is, really needed. The play remains the same
soft, synthetic mixture of laughter and heartbreak -- however
smoothly staged -- that it was at the Goodman.</TE>
<TE>   Performers of a certain caliber often give very different
performances in an out-of-town tryout than they do on Broadway. Linda
Lavin, now billed above the "Hollywood Arms" title in large capital
letters, has amped up the comedy (the passing-gas sight gags and
such) big-time. It's as if someone slipped Lavin, who is a deeply
pleasing actress, a license to kill under her dressing room door at
the Cort Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Watching a licensed scene-stealer can, of course, be exhilarating.
But a license to kill can easily become a license to overkill. The
same can happen to an entire production. Last season's best musical
Tony Award winner, "Thoroughly Modern Millie," began a year earlier
at the La Jolla Playhouse as a goofy but entertaining improvement on
its source material, the 1967 Julie Andrews movie about the flapper
era. By the time it reached Broadway, every change effected by
director Michael Mayer had conspired to make "Millie" twice as
garish, three times as pushy and about half as funny.</TE>
<TE>   In a less radical but dispiriting fashion, a similar pushiness has
diminished "Flower Drum Song," another Southern California
transplant. Now at the Virginia Theatre, this David Henry
Hwang-penned revision of the 1958 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical
started out as a modest, thrust-stage lark at L.A.'s Mark Taper
Forum. Now, with a few extra million and an overriding impulse to
impress, director-choreographer Robert Longbottom's staging has
become larger and more opulent, with lots more pan-Asian cheesecake
in the nightclub numbers, more but not better material for the creaky
gay dresser character (Allen Liu), and longer, gabbier book scenes
"amplifying" the love story of Mei-Li (Lea Salonga) and Ta (Jose
Llana).</TE>
<TE>   Something, too, has happened to even pros such as Jodi Long, who
plays a brash theatrical agent. The pacing is off; lines that were
made for simply tossing off, and quickly, now go drip ... drip ...
drip. I would suggest coffee. Speed counts for a lot with musical
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Even discounting the shrill amplification levels afflicting
"Flower Drum Song" and "Thoroughly Modern Millie," both of which were
louder than "Movin' Out," the shows in question now operate with a
tiring, life-of-the-party desperation to them. They didn't have it
during tryouts. "Movin' Out" has gone in the other direction, much to
Tharp's credit.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the show on Broadway the other night, I thought of an
utterly unrelated old war horse of a comedy, the 1930 Moss
Hart-George S. Kaufman Hollywood spoof "Once in a Lifetime." In
tryouts, the Kaufman and Hart collaboration was not going well. Its
craziness was unvarying. Then the writers put in a nice, quiet scene
for the female protagonist, and suddenly everything worked better.</TE>
<TE>   In a nonverbal way, this is what Tharp has done, at key junctures,
with her show about a generation at war and peace. She has sharpened
the focus and delivered the goods, without merely making everything
bigger, louder, more obvious.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what you call the right kind of turnaround.</TE>

<LD>Monica Mason, a former dancer credited with having "restored calm" to
London's Royal Ballet after its director quit three months ago, was
appointed as the company's new chief.</LD>
<LD>   Ross Stretton quit in September after only 18 months in the post,
following poor reviews of his productions and complaints by some
dancers.</LD>
<LD>   Mason, who was born in South Africa and worked as Stretton's
assistant, said she was deeply honored by her appointment, which runs
until mid-2007. She joined the Royal Ballet in 1958 at 16 and became
a principal a decade later.</LD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greece's tourism agency said Thursday it will use the huge success of
Oscar-hopeful "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" to boost the country's
flagging tourism industry.</LD>
<LD>   Greece's attractions will be advertised in a special edition of
Modern Bride magazine, in which 7.2 million DVDs of the film will be
included, EOT, the national tourist board, said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea is based on ... exploiting the results of the enormous
box-office success of the film in the U.S.," said EOT President
Ioannis Patellis. Tourism makes up about 15% of the Greek gross
domestic product and 10% of total employment.</LD>
<TE>   The comedy stars Nia Vardalos as a 30-year-old woman of Greek
heritage who marries a non-Greek -- to the annoyance of her quirky
family.</TE>

<LD>When Michael Jackson dangled his baby over a balcony in Berlin last
month, the collective outrage could be heard far and wide. "Those
kids ought to be taken from him," some parents and some in the media
cried. Well, now there's a way for you to save Michael Jackson's
kids. Sort of.</LD>
<LD>   Madblast.com, a comedy Web site owned by Los Angeles-based
eUniverse Inc., has created the "Michael Jackson Baby Drop" game, in
which you use your computer mouse to move a basket to catch falling
infants as quickly as daddy Jackson tosses them down. The more babies
you catch, the more time you get and the higher your score.</LD>
<LD>   But watch out: Jackson also throws spiders, which cause the basket
to overturn. In an earlier version of the game, Jackson dropped
records to distract players, but the newer version was obviously
updated to keep up with Jackson's recent encounter with the arachnid
kind.</LD>

<LD>When she's being herself, Angie Bayer likes to wear
attention-grabbing chunky jewelry, killer stiletto boots with metal
straps and a studded belt slung dangerously low on jeans. Today,
though, she's in gauzy drawstring pants, pink tank top and plastic
flip-flops, her outfit for staying below the radar -- a look that
lets her breeze through airport security without triggering a beep, a
hand wand inspection or removal of her shoes.</LD>
<LD>   This is just how the 33-year-old computer consultant from Atlanta
on a stopover at LAX planned it. Like millions of others, she has in
subtle and overt ways figured out how to dress the part for her
journey through airport security. Since heightened security
procedures kicked in last month -- with screening practices made
uniform nationwide -- many travelers who once didn't trigger metal
sensors or secondary scrutiny find that they're being searched.
Everything from hidden shanks in boots, rivets in sneakers, zippers
in pants and even clasps on barrettes are triggering alarms. And,
dare we say, so are under-wire bras.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to getting the attention of passengers, all the
buzzing at security checkpoints is getting the attention of some in
the clothing industry. They are beginning to rethink how items are
constructed.</LD>
<TE>   New lines of detector-free clothing and marketing campaigns may
not be far off. Jockey International introduced a new bra seven
months ago that uses Mylar under the cup rather than metal.
"Internally, we would bring up how this bra 'won't set the detector
off,' " recalls Jim Noble, senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   And Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPDFashionworld, a market
information company based in Port Washington, N.Y., says don't be too
surprised if "airport-friendly footwear" hits store shelves next
spring. In a meeting last week he saw such a marketing plan with the
slogan "Shoes built to last without setting off metal detectors."
Cohen says he can't reveal the company's name yet, adding the shoe
lines are "dressy and casual, but most of all, work boots will have
the same construction without the metal content in them."</TE>
<TE>   The metal shanks used to strengthen the soles of shoes and boots
between the heel and instep are hidden triggers that trip up those
who think they are dressed metal-free. Eyelets for shoelaces have
been known to make even a child's tennis shoe set off the buzzers.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two weeks, among the busiest travel times of the year,
many more passengers will be learning the ins and outs of the new
system -- and the importance of wearing clean socks when traveling by
air. When travelers set off the sensitive metal sensors on the
security walk-through, a secondary search that includes removing
their shoes is triggered.</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago people used to dress up to travel. Now they have to be
aware about how to dress down," says fashion forecaster David Wolfe
of the New York-based Doneger Group. "Air travel clothes have taken
on the function of, say, a uniform for an Xtreme sport. Certain items
have become 'my travel clothes' because their function is to not set
off an alarm and then I won't be seen as a potential troublemaker or
terrorist," he says. "C'mon, who in their right mind wants to have
their feet inspected at an airport?"</TE>
<TE>   Levi Locke, chaperoning 26 track students (who packed their cleats
in carry-on bags) for a junior Olympic cross-country championship
outside Atlanta, said during a stopover at LAX that he'd made sure he
was wearing clean socks before he got to the airport. "And no holes
in them too," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Swasey says sock sales at her Designer Shoes store in Boston,
located on the way to Logan Airport, have increased at least 15%
thanks to shoppers who drop in before catching a flight. "We get a
lot of people heading back home and feeling like their feet might be
exposed at the airport," says Swasey. "They want to make sure they
have nice socks on, just in case."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avoid wearing metal</TE>
<TE>   The top security official at LAX says he wants to see travelers
breeze through checkpoints too -- and without having to bare their
soles.</TE>
<TE>   "If you and your belongings have cleared through a metal detector
then the probability of a secondary screening with a wand is very
low," says retired Rear Adm. David M. Stone, federal security
director for the Transportation Security Administration at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The way to avoid triggering the sensors is simple he says: Don't
wear metal.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say how much or what types of metal set off the
alarms, but it doesn't take a lot. Some of the common culprits --
depending on heft -- are pins, necklaces, bracelets, rings, watches,
earrings (and jewelry on other pierced body parts), cuff links or
bolo ties; shoes with steel tips, heels, shanks, buckles or nails;
clothing with metal buttons, snaps or studs and belt buckles.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of passengers have no intention of bringing
anything prohibited on board, but plenty still show up with stuff
that gets caught in the dragnet. At LAX on the recent Thanksgiving
holiday weekend, 4,171 items were confiscated, among them seven box
cutters, 1,215 knives, 2,463 cutting instruments, 222 tools, 18
pepper-spray devices, nine clubs, nine toy weapons and a turkey
thermometer (regarded as a potential weapon.) In addition to avoiding
metal, Stone adds this advice: "Don't wear, pack or bring items that
you think would create panic and fear." Things like the recently
seized cologne bottle and belt buckle that resembled hand grenades.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No compromising on style</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, Jason Manning, 23, of Amarillo, Texas, says he knows he's
going to set off alarms, but the bull-riding cowboy never leaves home
without his boots and is always asked to remove them at airport
checkpoints."That's the price to pay for what I like to wear," says
Manning, on his way to the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. "I did
remove the belt because it does have a big metal buckle and it always
triggers the alarms. This is my style but I haven't given into
changing it and no one I know has either."</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Williams, a Los Angeles athlete who designs a women's
basketball clothing line called Lady Hoops, has always been a
casually attired flier: lightweight tops with mesh track pants,
slip-on sneakers. Her choice of clothes for her flight to Portland,
Ore., for business is no different, except for the mule-style
sneakers she has on rather than lace-ups for faster removal.
"Everyone is more concerned these days about how much you're going to
be searched, so I keep my look and the stuff in my carry-on bag to a
minimum."</TE>
<TE>   Patty Parker and her daughter, Tricia, 18, are on a stopover en
route to Honolulu. "We called our airport in Savannah [Ga.] and they
told us that there were a lot of under-wire bras causing the sensors
to go off, so we didn't want to take any chances," says sports-bra,
track-suit-wearing Patty; her daughter is in terry cloth drawstring
pants and a favorite T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Charlene O'Brien of Teton Valley, Idaho, has her own strategy for
traveling in comfort -- bring and wear less of everything -- and even
an observation on what seems to get past the sensors. Headed home
after a New Zealand and Fiji Islands vacation, her checkpoints
through security went smoothly even with her multiple piercings. She
says it's been her experience that it's the cheaper jewelry that sets
off the detectors.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these are real gold and diamonds, baby," she says pointing
out the bling-bling on her nose, four on one ear and two on the
other. "Not had a problem with them. Here's a tip for all the ladies
-- wear the good stuff."</TE>

<HD>Powerful, volatile flamenco solos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The six-week series of small-scale flamenco programs at the Fountain
Theatre ended Wed- nesday with a sold-out performance memorable for
commanding solos by Juan Talavera and guest artist Maria Bermudez.</LD>
<LD>   Until a joyous passage at the very end, Talavera opted for a
clenched, sullen and even threatening demeanor with angry outbursts
of thunderous, high-speed steps and handclaps. His technique
generated not only a powerful rhythmic engine but also a level of
mastery in which he managed to cross-fade from one complex
step-pattern to another with perfect control.</LD>
<LD>   Volatile and gutsy, Bermudez made each step seem newly chosen, and
her placement on either the stage or a raised platform at the side
appear to be driven by impulse. This spontaneity, and especially the
sense she conveyed of hearing the music for the first time, shifted
the emphasis away from her forceful technique and onto
self-expression: the portrait of a free, passionate spirit.</LD>
<TE>   The dancing of La Sari (from Indonesia) and Irit Specktor (from
Israel) tended to get swamped by the over-amplified guitar of Antonio
Triana and singing of Antonio de Jerez. However, the former dancer
brought to the occasion her sharply focused technique and the latter
an effective sense of dramatic contrast.</TE>
<TE>   If the brief group dances proved uneventful, the collaborations
between De Jerez and Triana (artistic director of the series) exuded
proficiency, expressive sophistication and a warm rapport.</TE>
<TE>   In the finale, the cast invited audience members Lourdes Rodriguez
and Ellen Markowitz onto the stage for solos of their own, after
which -- in a deft switcheroo -- Bermudez sang and De Jerez danced.</TE>

<HD>Christmas story takes a dark turn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As its title suggests, "Mary Shelley's Santa Claus" fuses Shelley's
Gothic horror novel "Frankenstein" with the Santa Claus myth,
charting a bleak yet magical course through the hearts and minds of a
dreamy girl and her guardian angels during a cold, blustery night in
Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   Staged by Cornerstone Theater Company at Armory Northwest in
Pasadena, this unusual holiday offering is boldly envisioned and
vividly performed. The writing, however, presents a challenge.
Playwright Erik Ehn works in a heightened, poetic style similar to
that of Suzan-Lori Parks or Mac Wellman. Words spill forth in dense,
tumbling streams. Plot points are oblique; meanings are allegorical.</LD>
<LD>   Ehn's protagonist is Kristin (Adina Porter), a lonely,
poverty-stricken girl. As Christmas approaches, her thoughts turn to
charity and selflessness, qualities too often lacking in her meager
life.</LD>
<TE>   Her hopes take the form of a story about another lonely girl,
named Shelley (Elisa Bocanegra), who sits in a bubble bath of glowing
white twinkle lights, dreaming up a creature. The creature assumes
the form of a dark angel, a doll-sized, bunraku-like puppet animated
by a pair of operators (Leslie K. Gray and Peter Howard). Shelley
teaches the creature the magic of gift giving, but when her delight
turns to horror, the shunned creature flees to the North Pole. There,
the now-grown creature (played by Howard, in "Edward
Scissorhands"-like garb) devotes himself to the making of presents,
which he delivers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   As directed by Mark Valdez and given form by Christopher Acebo
(sets), Geoff Korf (lights), Garry D. Lennon (costumes), Lynn
Jeffries (puppets) and John J. Flynn (video), the show is a fantasy
of incandescent moons, icy mountains and a glowing, upside-down
Christmas tree. It can be enchanting, but it fully reveals itself
only to those who patiently fit together its puzzle pieces.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of Cornerstone's ensemble shows, performed by its
professional company members and guest artists. It's not one of the
community shows, created with local residents.</TE>
<TE>   -- Daryl H. Miller</TE>

<TE>   Warmth and wit in a holiday quintet</TE>
<TE>   It's odd how the season of "peace on Earth, goodwill to men" is
accompanied by so much stress, triggering bad behavior even as people
are trying to be at their best. The naughty and the nice are
humorously depicted in "Christmastime Is Queer," five short plays
about the lesbian and gay holiday experience, presented by
Playwrights 6 at the Celebration Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The opener, Larry Dean Harris' "The Portrait Norman Rockwell
Forgot to Paint," pays a Christmas-morning visit to a lesbian-gay
extended parenting unit (Kimberly Elaine Crowe, Jodi Kirkpatrick,
Michael Gee and Paul Clausen, with the playwright taking over for
Clausen for the rest of the run). Under Sharon Rosen's warm
direction, it's a celebration of selflessness and commitment, even as
gift choices for the 3-year-old son momentarily short-circuit the
good cheer and wryly reveal some essential differences between
lesbians and gay men.</TE>
<TE>   The closer, G. Bruce Smith's "Christmas With the Mitchells,"
watches what happens when a young man (Mickey Caputo), newly out to
his Midwestern parents (Jeri Holst and Larrs Jackson), brings a guest
(Cyrus Deboo, alternating with Robert Callow) on a visit home. Mom
and Dad prove to be over-earnest in their attempts to make the men
feel comfortable (inflated condoms in place of party balloons, for
instance), and end up making one too many assumptions. Yet this
merely proves the depth of their love, as conveyed through Jonathan
Levit's tender direction and vivid performances all around.</TE>
<TE>   The meltdowns occur mostly in the intervening pieces, as
wanderlust or the ghosts of relationships past complicate "The Gift,"
by Laura Black, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Breakup," by Amy
Heidish, and "Christmas Past," by Monica Trasendes. These pieces
deliver laughs, but due to pedestrian writing here or slack direction
there, they pack less of an emotional wallop.</TE>

<HD>Clever lyrics and Wu-Tang spirit from GZA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sterling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the '90s, few hip-hop legacies loomed larger than that of New
York's Wu-Tang Clan. Composed of hip-hop heroes such as Method Man
and the notorious Ol' Dirty Bastard, the act brought an even grittier
realism to the hard-core rap scene with its 1993 debut "Enter the
Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)," juxtaposing distinctly original rapping
styles with the stark, orchestral production of studio wizard and
leader RZA.</LD>
<LD>   Their uncompromising approach and larger-than-life personas have
earned them a rabid fan base, and it was out in force Wednesday when
Wu-Tang's GZA (a.k.a. Genius) headlined at Hollywood's Knitting
Factory.</LD>
<LD>   While GZA may not have the highest profile of the outfit, his
consistently impressive lyricism has earned him much respect from
fans and peers alike. Supporting his recently released fourth solo
album, "Legend of the Liquid Sword," GZA delivered a raucous hourlong
set peppered with Wu-Tang classics.</LD>
<TE>   Flanked by fellow Wu-Tang member Masta Killa and DJ Mathematics,
GZA kept the energy high throughout the show with his raw,
metaphor-rich rhymes and direct delivery. The sold-out crowd returned
the favor, lustily rapping along to such new songs as "Animal Planet"
and the single "Knock Knock" as if they were old favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia ran high as GZA gave a tribute to the embattled (and
currently incarcerated) Ol' Dirty Bastard with a rendition of "Shimmy
Shimmy Ya Ya," while Masta Killa took the opportunity to introduce a
new song of his own, "No Set Date," as mosh pits erupted in front of
the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The audience had been ably warmed up with a fiery and fun set from
independent rap hero J-Live, whose album "All of the Above" is among
the year's shining debuts.</TE>

<LD>"ALL right, Jack," Grandpa said, "it's your turn to tell us about
your special gift."</LD>
<LD>   Jack took a big breath. "I'm going to sing 'Away in a Manger,' "
he said.</LD>
<LD>   Fred groaned. "That's what you did last year, Jack. We're supposed
to have a new gift each year."</LD>
<TE>   Jack smiled again. "This year we're all going to sing it," he
said. "Put on your coats. Everybody."</TE>
<TE>   "Coats?" Grandma looked puzzled. "Where are we going?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll show you," Jack said.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as everyone was dressed warmly, Jack led them outside.
Tarzan came running, whirling his tail.</TE>
<TE>   "You come too," Jack said.</TE>
<TE>   He led them all to the barn. "We're going to sing here," he said.
"To the cows and the horse." He said it shyly, wondering if the
cousins would laugh at him.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't. All of the Christmas Cousins, and Grandpa and
Grandma, and Mom and Dad, and all of the aunts and uncles lined up by
the corral fence. When Jack gave them the signal, they began to sing.</TE>
<TE>   The old gray horse nodded his head as if he liked the song. The
patient cows came closer to listen. Tarzan sat down in the snow, his
ears bent forward. A big orange cat came out of the barn to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Stars sparkled overhead. Snow crackled underfoot. The voices
sounded crisp in the chilly air.</TE>
<TE>   After everyone finished all the verses of the song, they stayed
for a long time out there in the cold. Jack petted the old horse and
fed hay to him and the cows.</TE>
<TE>   Just before they went back to the house, Wally said, "I make a
motion that we give Jack's gift every year when we come here to
Grandpa and Grandma's house."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody shouted, "Yes!"</TE>
<TE>   Jack smiled happily. It didn't matter that he was the youngest
Christmas Cousin. He had thought of a very special gift.</TE>

<HD>'Callar' tells its story in taut, bold strokes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her 1999 debut feature, "Ratcatcher," director Lynne Ramsay
discovered a surprising lyricism and tenderness in the life of an
impoverished 12-year-old Glasgow boy; now in a Scottish port town,
the setting of her "Morvern Callar," Ramsay reaches out boldly with a
film that is as unsettling as it is minimalist.</LD>
<LD>   Samantha Morton's title character, a lovely enigma, awakens on
Christmas morning to a shocking discovery that will transform her
life in ways she could never have predicted. Most likely she has no
real context in which to react to this jolt in a conventional manner.
What's really important is that this unexpected turn of events has
given her the opportunity to escape her supermarket stock clerk job
and take off with her friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott) on a holiday
in Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Adapted by Liana Dognini and Ramsay from the 1995 Alan Warner
novel, "Morvern Callar" is suffused with an implicit yearning for
freedom and escape from a drab working-class existence, but it also
delves into the process of self-discovery she experiences and the
challenge she faces in forging a sense of identity when she has lived
as marginal an existence as she has. She has spent her days in a
boring, low-paying job and nights hitting the clubs with their
drinking, drugs and possibilities of casual sex.</LD>
<TE>   Their package holiday lands the pair at a vast, seedy tourist
hotel somewhere in Almeria, where their evenings are much like those
back at home and their days spent lolling about. Morvern probably has
no more than a high school education and evinces little interest in
much of anything beyond having a good time, but what sets her apart
from the likable but ordinary Lanna is that she has the capacity for
reflection, undeniable imagination and an adventurous, decidedly
reckless streak. She seems to have no close family ties, and she
clearly does not feel bound by the rules and conventions of society.
She is an individual who lives within herself, has a sense of humor
and opens up to life's possibilities beyond Lanna's comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay's portrait of Morvern has an admirable spareness and
tension as one sequence connects to the next, tautly but with the
randomness of Morvern's new existence. The film is almost entirely a
visual experience, and the images of cinematographer Alwin Kuchler
(who also shot "Ratcatcher") are as beautiful and expressive as
Morton's Morvern is herself. While not quite as elliptical and
experimental as the films of Nina Menkes, "Morvern Callar" is equally
provocative and accrues the emotional impact of the more conventional
narrative that is "Ratcatcher." No question about it: "Morvern
Callar" confirms Lynne Ramsay as an important, original talent in
international cinema.</TE>

<HD>Baryshnikov leaps toward new venture</HD>
<DH>Dancer dissolves White Oak project and will concentrate on
starting an arts center to open in Manhattan in 2004.</DH>

<LD>Mikhail Baryshnikov has dissolved the White Oak Dance Project, the
modern dance company he founded with choreographer Mark Morris in
1990, and turned his energies to starting an arts center on
Manhattan's West Side slated to open in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt there needed to be an intense effort and drive behind
building a center in Manhattan," said Christina Sterner, managing
director of Baryshnikov Productions, White Oak's administrative arm.
"White Oak takes 90% of our company's time and resources to produce;
we developed work from soup to nuts." She said the dance company and
the center could not go forward at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The Baryshnikov Center for Dance will be at 450 W. 37th St.,
occupying the three top floors of a theater and performance complex
currently under construction.</LD>
<TE>   The center will include rehearsal studios, offices and a 300-seat
theater and will lease space to performing groups at discount rates.
Mostly, it will serve as a laboratory for young artists to develop
work in dance, film, theater and design with the help of established
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Violinist Gidon Kremer, stage and opera director Peter Sellars,
choreographer Merce Cunningham and filmmaker Pedro Almodovar are on
the center's 18-member artistic advisory panel. Baryshnikov, 54, has
raised $3 million of the estimated $8 million cost of the center,
which will not rely on government funds.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the Baryshnikov Center go back to 2000. "It simply feels
like the right time," said Sterner. "We've been running White Oak for
12 years. This was a very good opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Sterner did hint that the White Oak name, and its tours, could be
revived someday. Baryshnikov was meeting on the plan at press time
and was not available for comment.</TE>

<HD>White House in holiday colors</HD>

<LD>Americans like nothing better than (1) celebrating the holiday season
and (2) looky-looing around famous people's houses, and if you can
manage to combine the two -- as HGTV has in "White House Christmas
2002" -- it's ratings gold.</LD>
<LD>   The premiere of the program last Sunday drew the biggest audience
ever for Home and Garden Television, with 1.5 million households
tuning in. The previous record-holder? Why, it was "White House
Christmas 2001." Knowing a cash-cow franchise when it sees one, HGTV
has scheduled the first of several encore airings of this year's
hourlong special tonight at 7 and 10.</LD>
<LD>   The program takes viewers behind the scenes at the Bush White
House as preparations are made to turn the historic residence into a
winter wonderland, replete with 21 elaborately festooned Christmas
trees, massive holiday pastry creations and scores of papier-mache
figurines marking this year's decorating theme as chosen by the
Bushes, "All Creatures Great and Small."</LD>
<TE>   It takes a small army of artisans to make the transformation a
reality, and we get to meet a number of them as the room-by-room tour
progresses. First Lady Laura Bush, looking cozily casual in pants and
sweater for much of the visit, is on hand with family dogs Spotty and
Barney trotting along at her heels.</TE>
<TE>   The 18 1/2-foot noble fir from Washington state that graces the
Blue Room and a giant replica of the White House fashioned out of 120
pounds of gingerbread, 40 pounds of chocolate and 30 pounds of
marzipan are two of the most impressive set pieces, but the climactic
moment is handled by the chief exec himself, as George W. makes a
brief appearance to flip the switch on the lights strung over the
towering national Christmas tree on the White House grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even viewed from sunny California, it's inspiring enough to give
you chills.</TE>

<LD>It's been 25 years since an advertisement in a Hollywood trade paper
announced that director Martin Scorsese was in pre-production with a
tale of 19th century street-fighting men called "Gangs of New York."
Now, a full quarter of a century later, we have the film before us.
It has not been worth the wait.</LD>
<LD>   "Gangs of New York" seems in that great passage of time to have
lost its sense of story and its narrative drive, to have quite simply
lost its way. Its two-hour and 45-minute length is elephantine enough
to include an actual elephant, but what it doesn't contain is any
compelling reason for us to pay attention. Despite having Daniel
Day-Lewis, Leonard DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in a melodramatic story
centered on murder and revenge, the film plays like an interminable
airplane flight: You look at your watch, hoping its nearly time to
land, only to realize with a sinking heart you're not even halfway
there.</LD>
<LD>   While "Gangs" is surprisingly heavier on tedium than bloodshed,
when we are not being bored we are being assaulted by the film's
palpable violence, always a Scorsese preoccupation and prominent
enough here that some people are calling the result "Stab Wounds of
New York." Even though the scenes of sustained mayhem are one of the
few areas where "Gangs" rouses itself and displays some energy, it's
also the area where you wish it hadn't.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, it was a depiction of a world permeated with violence as
much as any specific characters or incidents that doubtless drew
Scorsese to "Gangs of New York," Herbert Asbury's florid,
print-the-legend chronicle of early underworld doings, first
published in 1928 and long a favorite of writers from Jorge Luis
Borges to William Burroughs.</TE>
<TE>   The other place where "Gangs" shows some passion is in its
determination to have the most meticulous re-creation of the old Five
Points section of Lower Manhattan an estimated $100-million budget
could facilitate. (Five Points was so infamous one unnerved 19th
century reporter claimed "the very letters of the two words seem to
redden with the bloodstains of unavenged crime.")</TE>
<TE>   So Scorsese and his cast made the well-publicized trek from the
new world back to the old, setting up shop in Rome's vast Cinecitta
studio complex, where revered production designer Dante Ferretti set
a working waterfront in a 3-million-gallon exterior tank and used
more than 40 acres to painstakingly reconstruct several New York
neighborhoods, accurate down to the cobblestones on the streets and
the shingles on the roofs.</TE>
<TE>   This fetish for authenticity (no, that's not too strong a word)
overflowed into other facets of the "Gangs" production. The film has
a Chinese opera coordinator, a butchering advisor, a man in charge of
hand-lettered signs, plus a consultant who taught vintage fighting
methods. These things are hardly meretricious, but they should be
means to an end, not ends in and of themselves. Unfortunately, what's
happened in "Gangs" is that all the time, money and energy invested
in authenticity has both distracted the filmmakers from and enabled
them to ignore the fact that nothing dramatically compelling is going
on in those immaculately conceived and executed sets.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the credited presence of Steven Zaillian and Kenneth
Lonergan, two of the best of Hollywood's screenwriters, as well as
original writer Jay Cocks, none of "Gang's" main characters make any
kind of meaningful emotional connection. The streets, shot by
cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, may be as authentic as they are
mean, but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangs" opens with an extended street-battle-prologue set in 1846,
in which the foreigner-hating Native Americans led by William "Bill
the Butcher" Cutting (Day-Lewis) take on an immigrant Irish group
called the Dead Rabbits and commanded by the imposing Priest Vallon
(Liam Neeson).</TE>
<TE>   Technically, though, "Gangs of New York" opens with a sound that,
given Scorsese's predilections, is easily guessed to be a straight
razor at work. When Vallon intentionally cuts his cheek, he tells his
young son Amsterdam, in the first of the film's numerous
self-consciously mythic lines, "The blood stays on the blade. One day
you'll understand." Don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing his father killed by the agile Butcher, Amsterdam
disappears to be raised in an orphanage. He returns 16 years later as
DiCaprio, a young man so changed by his theoretical thirst for
revenge that of his father's old comrades (Brendan Gleeson, John C.
Reilly, Gary Lewis) only his old boyhood chum Johnny (Henry Thomas)
initially recognizes him as Priest's son.</TE>
<TE>   Equally oblivious is Bill the Butcher himself, who, in the way of
movies since time immemorial, takes a shine to this lad with the
murderous rage and makes him a surrogate son. In fact, so much of
"Gangs" is spent on Amsterdam shelving his revenge and just chilling
with Bill and the lithe pickpocket and confidence woman Jenny
Everdeane (Diaz) he takes a violent fancy to that the film has to
apologize for him with a voice-over line about how warm and cozy it
is to be under a dragon's wing.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Day-Lewis, who apparently listened to Eminem to keep his
rage level up, gives an impeccable performance as the dandified,
psychotic dragon Bill the Butcher. He's a self-consciously theatrical
gangster, all menace and malevolence, and he has our complete
attention whenever he's on screen. But as proficient as the work is,
it's a performance in a vacuum, so apart from the rest of the film
that it can't enlarge or feed it the way great performances
classically do.</TE>
<TE>   Facing even bigger problems is DiCaprio, who is simply miscast as
an ace street fighter and all-around murderous type. Taking on a role
that goes against his strengths (shown to good advantage in the
forthcoming "Catch Me If You Can"), the strongest attitude DiCaprio
can manage is the petulance of a sullen choir boy sulking because
he's been caught filching the Communion wine. No amount of intense
training in authentic combat techniques can turn him into a plausible
rival for Bill the Butcher, and the film suffers as a result.</TE>
<TE>   That casting lapse also hamstrings "Gang's" grandiose attempts to
turn Amsterdam into something of a political leader as it sets this
personal rivalry against the backdrop of the societal discontent that
led to the Civil War draft riots of 1863. For "Gangs" does have a
lust for larger themes, a desperate desire to be seen as saying
something profound about the nature of the American experience and be
what Scorsese has called "a template for what's going on today."</TE>
<TE>   But using Amsterdam Vallon as a poster boy for multicultural
democracy, a kind of early Tom Joad fighting for a more just and
equal America, is way off the mark. You don't need to carry a torch
for Henry Fonda to see that there's no way this kind of twerp can be
a prototype of anything.</TE>
<TE>   Because nothing feels at stake in this kind of disconnected
filmmaking, a great deal of what "Gangs of New York" attempts comes
off as disjointed and beside the point. "Gangs" does not, for
instance, lack for local color, but instead of enriching the film,
undoubtedly authentic folk -- bare-knuckle fighters, bearded
cross-dressers, opium smokers and unclothed prostitutes -- turn the
final product into a cluttered muddle, an overstuffed trunk of movie
flotsam thrown together and packed in haste.</TE>
<TE>   The film's supporting cast of real people -- hey, there's Horace
Greeley, and isn't that P.T. Barnum and, look, it's Boss Tweed talking
about his soon-to-be-infamous courthouse -- come off as window dressing,
even when, as with Jim Broadbent as Tweed, the acting is expert.  "Gangs'"
voice-over describing mid-19th century New York as "a furnace where a city
someday might be forged" sounds forced.  Even the film's closing song by
U2 plays as lugubrious as its "The Hands That Built Ameria" title would
have you fear.</TE>
<TE>   The virtues of "Gangs," a failed film but not a fiasco, are the
virtues of a pageant, not a drama. Unable to make his personal
obsessions compelling despite his unquestioned filmmaking skill,
director Scorsese and his team have created a heavy-footed golem of a
motion picture, hard to ignore as it throws its weight around but
fatally lacking in anything resembling soul.</TE>

<HD>Bond film yields high interest</HD>
<DH>The surprising box office success of "Die Another Day" has
given new life to the aging franchise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Waxman</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Bond got his groove back. How'd that happen?</LD>
<LD>   Four weeks after the opening of the 20th movie in the dapper spy
series, this creaking franchise is keeping pace with "Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets," the second installment in one of the
hottest series around. Last weekend, "Die Another Day" came in fourth
in the U.S. box office sweepstakes -- pushing its total North
American take over the $131-million mark -- and became the
highest-grossing Bond film.</LD>
<LD>   This was highly unexpected, to say the least.</LD>
<TE>   Three years ago, at the release of the 19th Bond film, "The World
Is Not Enough," there were heartfelt cries to put Bond out to
pasture. Bond was too smooth; the people wanted it rough. After all,
007 joined the culture back when martinis were cool and is still here
now that cocktails -- in fact, the word "cocktails" -- have gone out
of style and come back again. Wrote Entertainment Weekly in 1999:
"The sad fact is, after four decades, the franchise has grown more
than stale -- it's ossified into self-parody, turned into Austin
Powers without the jokes."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, really?</TE>
<TE>   Turns out Bond will live to die another day. Says box office guru
Paul Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations: "The Bond franchise is
alive and well and making lots of money." "Die Another Day's"
distributor, MGM, expects the film to take in more than $400 million
worldwide. The series' producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael
Wilson, are hard at work on a script for Bond No. 21, and there are
plans to produce a Bond spinoff based on Halle Berry's character,
Jinx.</TE>
<TE>   The success, it appears, is due to a concerted effort to
revitalize the fading brand. "The smartest thing we did was wait
another year," MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said. The studio took
three years between productions rather than two. "We wanted to go
back to basics, to get a great script, a great director [Lee
Tamahori], to do things in a new and interesting way, and expand the
audience. That was the single most important thing in making a better
movie."</TE>
<TE>   The producers were initially reluctant to bring in up-and-coming
Berry, fresh off her Oscar win. Some worried that the actress might
upstage the older Pierce Brosnan, but studio executives and producers
finally warmed to the notion. In the end, Berry helped bring key
elements of female smarts and youthful hipness to the movie. For the
first time in years, teenage, young adult and women moviegoers went
to see "Die Another Day."</TE>
<TE>   The longer pre-production schedule also gave MGM time to come up
with an unprecedented number of marketing tie-ins, decried by critics
but envied by other studio executives. Twenty-four companies -- from
Jaguar to Aston Martin to Omega (the watch maker) -- had promotional
tie-ins and spent $100 million on film-related advertising.</TE>
<TE>   To draw younger viewers, the studio advertised on MTV and staged
promotions such as a "making of" special on cable. In addition, two
new James Bond video games were released when the movie opened.</TE>
<TE>   The proof was in the surprising box office response. "Die Another
Day" opened at the top of the attendance list at $47.1 million, then
dropped the next weekend to take in $31 million. The third week, the
film trounced a much-anticipated newcomer, "Analyze That," starring
Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   McGurk is now convinced that there can never be enough James Bond.</TE>
<TE>   "The results speak for themselves on this movie," he said. "We
will definitely approach the next one the same way."</TE>

<HD>Serengeti surprise: a delightful family film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a splendid animated transition from the Nickelodeon cable channel
to the big screen, "The Wild Thornberrys Movie" makes a witty and
delightful Christmas present for the entire family. The inspired
adventures of 12-year-old animal lover Eliza Thornberry (voiced by
Lacey Chabert) transpire largely on Africa's Serengeti plain, which
unfolds in all its unspoiled magnificence like a series of vast and
beautiful murals, luminous in their richly shaded hues and subtle
play of light and shadow.</LD>
<LD>   As fans of the series know, Eliza is the precocious younger
daughter of Nigel and Marianne Thornberry (Tim Curry and Jodi
Carlisle), globe-trotting documentary filmmakers from England. The
bespectacled Eliza looks rather like a caricature of Sissy Spacek in
adolescence.</LD>
<LD>   Nigel and Marianne are every bit as intrepid and confident as
legendary naturalists Martin and Osa Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   Their older daughter, Debbie (Danielle Harris), is the classic
self-absorbed teenager, sarcastic and bored by all she surveys. (She
speaks universal teen-speak, heavy on the obligatory "whatevers.")
The Thornberrys have also adopted a wild child, Donnie. Eliza's
grandparents (Lynn Redgrave and Tom Kane) are stalwart survivors of
Britain's imperial era.</TE>
<TE>   So brave and dedicated to animals is Eliza that an African shaman
has bestowed upon her the gift of being able to talk with them; her
constant companion is Darwin (Tom Kane), a fussy, erudite chimp.</TE>
<TE>   Eliza is especially adoring of three cheetah cubs whose mother
(Alfre Woodard) warns her of poachers yet inadvertently allows one of
the cubs to be swept up by a poacher's helicopter. Eliza is thus
propelled on a quest to rescue the kidnapped cub that places her in
perils more numerous than Pauline's and adventures straight out of
"King Solomon's Mines."</TE>
<TE>   Directors Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian and writer Kate
Boutilier aim to entertain first and foremost, of course, but Eliza's
odyssey effectively acquaints young children with the notion of
endangered species without ever actually uttering the phrase. Their
message, expressed deftly, is that a loving heart is capable of
working miracles even without Eliza's special gifts of communication.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Neumann's lively score incorporates a wide range of pop
numbers, among which is Paul Simon's first song written for a film in
15 years, "Father and Daughter," which sets the tone for this winning
film. "The Wild Thornberrys" remarkably balances some honest
heart-tugging with a sophisticated sense of humor, a quality far from
common in family entertainments.</TE>

<HD>The iciest debate in Tinsel Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The holidays, like superheroes, are known for their transformative
powers. Misers go philanthropist, feuds turn into love-fests and
irritating repetition becomes "tradition." At this time of year, that
word lends meaning to the most baffling family eccentricity, from
regrettable punch-bowl consumption patterns to the inevitable holiday
arguments.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, most of the conversations occurring in Christian
households between Thanksgiving and New Year's range from friendly
negotiation to foot-stamping fights. There's just so much to decide.
White lights or colored? Blinking or non-. Fake wreath or real?
Scotch pine or Douglas? Flocked or plain? Does the family decorate it
or Santa?</LD>
<LD>   And then when you think it's all been settled, when the house is
ablaze with icicle lights and illuminated reindeer are nodding
placidly on the front lawn, when the tree is up and decorated, it's
time to have the tinsel talk. When I was growing up, we called them
"icicles," and the conversation went something like this: "Let's not
put any icicles on this year." My mother.</LD>
<TE>   "What!?! No icicles? Why bother having a Christmas tree?!?" My
father.</TE>
<TE>   "All right, but just a little tinsel. Do it strand by strand. No
clumps."</TE>
<TE>   Cue smothered knowing laughter from the children. Because my
father was an unapologetic tinsel tosser. He believed in taking great
handfuls of the stuff and simply throwing it at the tree, allowing it
to fall "artistically." The Jackson Pollock of tree trimming. "This
way," he would say, handing each of us gobs of silver, "it will look
just like snow."</TE>
<TE>   By the time we were done, the ornaments were barely visible, the
greenery undetectable by the naked eye. It was excessive but not
unusual in our circle -- everyone we knew had the same sort of debate
year after year, and everyone we knew tinseled to some degree or
another.</TE>
<TE>   But like so many traditions, the tinsel debate appears to be on
the wane. According to the professionals, there is simply nothing to
discuss.</TE>
<TE>   "Tinsel is old-fashioned and messy," says Abbas Sorbi, store
manager for Stats in Pasadena, a holiday decorating mecca. "No one
wants it anymore." So few people have asked for it in the last couple
of years, he says, that he stopped ordering it. "There is no tinsel
in this store," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In decorating the 20 or so trees in the store's magical tree room,
Sorbi has used a lot of gold mesh instead. "It is very elegant," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial trees -- the ones in hotel lobbies or town squares --
almost never have tinsel these days. Partly this is because it is
messy and time-consuming to put on but also it is just not considered
classy enough. Speaking via her cell phone from Las Vegas, where she
was working on the holiday decorations for Treasure Island and the
Bellagio, Laurie Resnick called tinsel "residential." But in the
nicest possible way.</TE>
<TE>   As president of the Associate Group in Santa Ana, Resnick oversees
the tree trimming and garlanding of high-end hotels, such as the
Ritz-Carlton Huntington in Pasadena, and commercial thoroughfares,
including Paseo Colorado. And she never, ever tinsels. "Our look,"
she says, "is a little more elegant."</TE>
<TE>   That word again. And from a woman standing in the middle of Las
Vegas. Still, it's true that many home trees are taking their cue
from the professionals: Theme trees, says Sorbi, are becoming more
popular each year.</TE>
<TE>   But some people still prize tradition over "elegance": A random
poll of various drug and discount stores revealed that tinsel is
still available in Los Angeles, and if the baffled replies of "I
guess," from various clerks are to be believed, people are still
buying it.</TE>
<TE>   Which is a good thing. Yes, a tree dripping with tinsel looks more
homemade than one bedecked in gold mesh and oversized themed
ornaments. But that's sort of the point. Tinsel has been around
practically as long as the Christmas tree itself -- as early as 1612,
silversmiths were beating the metal thin enough to cut into strips at
yuletide. Every American has lurking somewhere a picture of their
first Christmas tree, and dollars to doughnuts, that sucker's
tinseled.</TE>
<TE>   So if bell-bottoms and bare midriffs have been recategorized from
"hideous and out-of-date" to "retro-hip and groovy," why not tinsel?</TE>
<TE>   As a grown-up, I have never tinseled, neither have I themed. But
this is the first Christmas since we lost my dad, and so, after we
finished trimming our tree, we filled our children's hands with
silver. For the next 20 minutes, strands of tinsel flew through the
air, covered the floor, the chair, the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   And some of it actually stayed on the tree, where it glittered and
shone just like snow.</TE>

<HD>A Way to Foster Employee Health</HD>
<DH>Some southern African firms are taking on the costs of
fighting AIDS for their workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JWANENG, Botswana -- The digging does not stop. Not when night falls
or when a three-year drought sears the countryside or when the nation
edges toward famine. Workers for Debswana Diamond Co. have not
stopped digging for 20 years, scooping out enough wealth to make
Jwaneng the world's richest diamond mine and Botswana's economy one
of the fastest-growing in southern Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Gems, and the miners who dig them up, are building the nation. So
when the death rate among Debswana's 6,000 employees doubled in five
years and nearly a third of the workforce -- including 18% of its
executives -- became infected with human immunodeficiency virus, the
company took an unprecedented step. In 1999, it began offering
voluntary testing for HIV, which can lead to AIDS, at mining
operations around Botswana.</LD>
<LD>   "We decided that AIDS was the biggest threat to our business,"
said Assistant General Manager Sebetlela Sebetlela. So last year,
Debswana became the first company in Africa to give HIV-fighting
anti-retroviral therapy to its employees, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't just that we wanted to be good," he added. "We realized
that unless we did something, we could have had a situation where
production came to a halt."</TE>
<TE>   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is beginning to take an
economic toll on sub-Saharan Africa, hindering the region's efforts
to lift itself out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Companies in the region are reporting increased absenteeism and
rising recruitment and training costs as AIDS-stricken workers sicken
and die. Studies have shown that businesses are spending six to 10
times as much money on HIV-infected employees as on healthy workers.
Production losses so far have been modest, but they are noticeable
and deepening.</TE>
<TE>   Sub-Saharan Africa is the focal point of the pandemic, according
to a United Nations report released last month. In the hardest-hit
countries -- Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe -- one of every three
residents has HIV. Of the 3.1 million deaths due to AIDS this year,
77% have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent speech in Johannesburg, South Africa, Stephen Lewis,
the U.N. special envoy for HIV/AIDS for this continent, said the
pandemic has devastated the region's agricultural sector and is
driving a food shortage that is putting 15 million Africans at risk
of starvation.</TE>
<TE>   Botswana's Affluence</TE>
<TE>   Botswana has the region's highest per capita income and one of the
most stable governments, having avoided the civil wars and the harsh
colonial rule that its neighbors Zimbabwe and South Africa endured.
But Botswana's relative affluence and progressive health policies
haven't protected it from the pandemic; nearly four of 10 people in
this nation of 1.6 million are infected by HIV.</TE>
<TE>   With the beef industry suffering because of parched grasslands,
diamonds -- especially the ones from the Jwaneng mine -- are all that
stand between the country and ruin. Profit from Debswana's mines is
fueling Botswana's economy, which is expected to grow 9% this year,
up from 8% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which is jointly owned by the government and DeBeers,
has set a powerful example in the region by offering to cover most of
the cost for employees' anti-retroviral drugs, which attack HIV. This
year, the government also started giving out anti-retroviral
therapies at four hospitals. About 3,000 people are receiving the
life-saving drugs, and the government plans to open four more
dispensaries next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Debswana is the model for our country," said Dr. Banu Khan, head
of Botswana's AIDS programs. "Anti-retroviral therapies will lead to
AIDS prevention, they will prevent children from becoming orphans,
they will prolong life."</TE>
<TE>   Botswana's programs became feasible only after pharmaceutical
companies reduced prices for AIDS medicines -- sometimes by as much
as 90% -- after a clash last year with several African countries. New
drugs with fewer side effects and simplified regimens also helped.</TE>
<TE>   A Lesson for S. Africa</TE>
<TE>   South African companies have watched Debswana and Botswana's
government for two years, and now dozens of businesses -- including
multinationals such as DaimlerChrysler, Coca-Cola and Barclay's Bank
-- are offering anti-retroviral treatment along with AIDS awareness
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're stepping in because the government isn't," said Errol
Sackstein, general director of pen manufacturer Bic South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   It took an international outcry before the South African
government acknowledged the link between HIV and AIDS and realized
that anti-retroviral therapies are the country's best hope of
mitigating the pandemic. But there still is no plan to provide the
drugs on a wide scale.</TE>
<TE>   The examples set by Botswana and the private industry are
inspiring, said Dr. Ayanda Ntsaluba, head of South Africa's public
health department. But they are of little use to his country, which
has the world's greatest concentration of HIV cases: about 4.7
million people, nearly three times Botswana's entire population.</TE>
<TE>   Recent legislation will sharply increase South Africa's health
budget over the next three years, but the country still cannot afford
to offer AIDS medicines to its people, Ntsaluba said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have a big enough pool of physicians fully trained in
the use of some of these drugs," he said. "We have good hospital
facilities, but if we started concentrating on this, we would have to
convert all of them to AIDS treatment hospitals. They would be
overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Ntsaluba pointed out that businesses are treating "captive
populations who have to show up for work every day" whereas "our
patients often disappear, go to their villages and then come back
after a month or two."</TE>
<TE>   Company programs are working with people who are employed, he
added, but half of South Africa's 43 million people are indigent.
Many could not even afford to meet the requirement that some drugs be
taken on a full stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Debswana's financial success here has built a town of 16,000,
where 20 years ago there were only scrub brush and herdsmen's
scattered round huts. Now Jwaneng has a modern town hall, a country
club and row upon row of brick hovels for miners and tract
developments for executives.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a state-of-the-art hospital, which next year will
distribute anti-retrovirals for 60,000 people in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Brink, senior vice president of mining conglomerate Anglo
American, said he recognized the "monstrous challenge facing
government in dealing with people who are unemployed, have poor
nutrition, no sanitation, lack housing."</TE>
<TE>   "But you can start," he said. "And I would argue that you could
begin with the economically active people that you need to keep the
country moving."</TE>
<TE>   Providing AIDS therapies was a simple matter of enlightened
self-interest for his company, Brink said. This year, executives at a
subsidiary, AngloGold, estimated that AIDS was costing $9 for each
ounce of gold mined. Brink said about 33,500, or 25%, of the
company's southern African workforce is HIV-positive.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have people getting sick and dying from AIDS, when
you've got sickness and death all around you, when you're going to
funerals every weekend -- all these things are going to have a
negative impact on morale and productivity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Who Gets the Medicine?</TE>
<TE>   As welcome as these corporate AIDS programs are, they are not
without moral ambiguity. Debswana, for example, offers
anti-retroviral drugs to its employees and to one spouse for each.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe that is enough to give the medicine to a worker and
his wife," said Topo Autlwetse of the Botswana Mining Workers Union.
"But here in Botswana some men will marry more than one wife. And
what about the children?"</TE>
<TE>   Marriage itself can be hard to pin down in a country where
matrimony often leaves no paper trail.</TE>
<TE>   Debswana machine operator Ishmael Time is taking anti-retroviral
drugs, but his "permanent girlfriend" is ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell her that she should get tested," he said. "But she says it
will do no good."</TE>
<TE>   Bic's Sackstein noted: "A lot of workers say they don't want the
drugs if they are going to live and their spouses and children are
going to die. We're finding that some workers are getting the drugs
and giving half of them to their spouses and children. That way no
one benefits from the drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Most private programs only provide anti-retroviral medicine to
employees as long as they are working for a company. Laying off or
firing an HIV-positive worker could be tantamount to a death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies report low levels of participation in programs
because of a lack of awareness and fear of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The stigma of HIV is perhaps more intense here than in the United
States; even people with obvious symptoms of full-blown AIDS tend to
deny they are ill. And there have been reports of companies firing
sick workers.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have found evidence that some firms have reduced their
pension funds and health benefits to avoid payouts to AIDS sufferers.
One study reported anecdotal evidence in Zimbabwe of firms testing
applicants for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Jelley, a consultant on corporate AIDS programs, said
businesses face a stigma too. Some corporations avoid tracking HIV
rates or making them public, he said, to protect their brand and
retain skittish investors.</TE>
<TE>   Amalgamated Beverage Industries, a 4,500-employee South African
Coca-Cola bottler, has an anti-retroviral program that covers each
employee and three dependents. But company policy prohibits public
disclosure of the HIV rate among its workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't even disclosed that to our shareholders," said Lindi
Oberink, strategic affairs manager. "We're trying to protect our
employees and our company against the stigma."</TE>
<TE>   Debswana was among the first businesses in the region to announce
its infection rates, but only 20% of its HIV-positive workers have
enrolled in its program.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting Help</TE>
<TE>   Time, the machine operator, is one of the brave few at Jwaneng who
have come out publicly about their infections.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when he could scarcely hide it. Until getting on
a triple therapy program, Time was frail, covered in painful lesions
and taking lots of sick days. At one point, supervisor Mooketsi
Seragi was so worried that he ventured to pry: "Mr. Time, you're
losing weight. Is it due to the fact that you're not happy at work?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm fine," Time lied.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later Time gathered enough gumption to get an HIV
test at the Jwaneng Mine Hospital. He took the results to Seragi and
said he wanted to quit working -- and maybe even living.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to commit suicide," Seragi said. "I sat him
down and told him that I accept him exactly how he is, so he should
accept himself. Then I thought to myself, 'What am I going to do
about the rest in the group?' I didn't want them discriminating
against him or treating Mr. Time with suspicion. I had to manage the
attitudes and emotions of his co-workers."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the reactions of people as Time walked around
Jwaneng, Seragi was successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Mr. Time, where are you coming from, looking so fit?" a
female worker said, flirting.</TE>
<TE>   Time does look healthy. His appetite has returned, and he
supplements his diet with vitamins and a regimen of immune system
enhancers: three tablets in the morning, four at night. He stopped
drinking and smoking. No sex either. Most days, he is back in front
of his diamond sorting machine.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my peers to see me and to know that AIDS is manageable,"
he said. "I will work until I decide to retire."</TE>

<HD>Minorities Hope to Boost Ranks as New-Car Dealers</HD>
<DH>High start-up costs and a decline in available showrooms
are major hurdles, a group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clarence Price is a rarity among Acura dealers: He's black.</LD>
<LD>   Of 260 U.S. dealerships selling the luxury brand of Honda Motor
Co., Price's Bakersfield lot is one of just six owned by African
Americans -- a circumstance found throughout the industry, according
to a recently released report.</LD>
<LD>   Only three African American owners are counted among the 623 U.S.
dealers for Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the Washington-based National
Assn. of Minority Automobile Dealers said in its report. Only two
Latino owners are among the 341 U.S. dealerships for Volvo, a brand
of Ford Motor Co., the group found.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the association reported, just 5% of new-auto dealerships
are minority-owned.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, minorities own about 15% of all U.S. businesses,
according to the Census Bureau. Minority ownership is even higher in
some sectors -- McDonald's Corp., for example, says that up to 30% of
its franchises are owned by minority group members.</TE>
<TE>   Although individual domestic and import auto brands have made
strides in recent years in diversifying their dealership bodies,
nationwide progress has been slow, critics charge. With minorities
buying an estimated 15% of new cars and trucks, the dealers group
urged auto manufacturers this year to set a goal of having 15% of its
dealerships in minority hands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a call to arms," said Sheila Vaden-Williams, who heads
the association. "As the minority population grows larger, we cannot
continue to be satisfied with a 5% or 6% representation. This is a
business imperative."</TE>
<TE>   But increasing the ranks of minority owners will be a challenge,
according to industry experts. Buying a dealership isn't cheap --
even small ones can cost $1 million or more. At the same time,
industry consolidation means that fewer dealerships are for sale, and
bidding wars often ensue for dealerships that come on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "With the advent of public companies and mega-dealerships, that
has had a dramatic effect on minority dealership ownership because of
the costs," said William E. Shack Jr., one of the original members of
the minority dealers group.</TE>
<TE>   Before the advent of large public dealer groups, "you would pay
two times earnings for a dealership," said Shack, who owns a Honda
franchise in Henderson, Nev. "They came in and started paying four or
five times earnings. The ability to raise working capital to fund
these large operations, for many minorities, is limited."</TE>
<TE>   Today, a domestic franchise earning about $1 million a year could
sell for as much as $4 million, said Todd Berko, managing director of
New Jersey-based Bel Air Partners, which helps place values on
dealerships as part of its mergers-and-acquisition work. A luxury
import dealer earning that same million could sell for $5 million, he
said. But prices can go higher, depending on the name brand and
dealer location.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, McDonald's says its new restaurants typically cost
$455,000 to $768,000.</TE>
<TE>   Most major auto manufacturers -- including the Detroit-area Big
Three of Ford, General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler
Group -- already sponsor programs in which they lend up to 90% of a
dealership's cost to qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with such programs -- some of which involve training
as well as financial support -- blacks and others have failed to gain
much ground, minority advocates say. The industry needs to be more
aggressive, they maintain, in helping secure available dealerships
for minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Cowger, president of General Motors North America, said that
increasing the number of minority dealers beyond the company's roster
of about 380 -- the most of any manufacturer and about 5% of the
total dealership body -- "obviously is a focus for us."</TE>
<TE>   "As with our suppliers and with our dealers and our employee base,
we feel that the makeup should try to mirror the population," Cowger
said. "During the '80s and '90s, our dealer body dropped
dramatically, but the absolute numbers and percentage of minority
dealers went up."</TE>
<TE>   GM is not alone in its downsizing. Nationwide, the number of
franchise new-car dealerships has been declining for decades; it
stands today at about 22,000, a loss of more than 17% compared with
January 1981, said Paul Taylor, chief economist with the National
Automobile Dealers Assn. He pointed out that smaller dealerships are
being shuttered largely in rural areas but also in some urban
settings.</TE>
<TE>   BMW of Germany, for example, is opening no new dealerships, a
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   That reduces the number of options for all would-be dealers,
several auto executives noted.</TE>
<TE>   For entrepreneurs who do accumulate enough cash to get into the
game, regardless of ethnicity, the payoff often is substantial.</TE>
<TE>   "They're tough businesses to run," Berko said. "But if you do it
right, with the right franchise, in the right location, you can own a
yacht. If you know how to do it, the opportunity to make money in the
auto industry is probably one of the highest I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of all U.S. dealerships are profitable, with the
average dealer in 2001 seeing more than $337,000 in profit, economist
Taylor said. But he said that's partly because, with such a
capital-intensive business, unprofitable dealers don't last long.</TE>
<TE>   Even successful minority dealers say getting a foothold in the
business can be tough.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old Price -- who played defensive end for Indiana
University in the 1968 Rose Bowl -- just celebrated his first
anniversary as the owner of Superior Acura in Bakersfield. This year,
Price estimates, he will see more than $20 million in sales -- enough
for a "respectable profit."</TE>
<TE>   He began his journey to dealer ownership in the late 1980s, when
he was accepted into the minority dealer development program run by
GM. In all, he worked for the world's largest automaker for 14 years,
including stints in the factory and as a sales manager for the former
AC Spark Plug division.</TE>
<TE>   Though he successfully completed the roughly 18-month program --
an 11-by-14-inch certificate adorns his office wall -- his efforts
never led to a GM dealership.</TE>
<TE>   Price said there were serious discussions about only one
dealership, in Olympia, Wash. After checking it out, he said, he was
concerned about the profit potential and passed on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   GM declined to comment on how the program ran in the 1980s. But
several dealers noted that the company's minority dealer program has
been improved through the years.</TE>
<TE>   Biding his time and squirreling away cash, Price worked for a
decade as a district sales manager for American Honda Motor Co. Along
the way, he said, he established friendships with some of the most
successful Honda dealers in Southern California, soaking up their
secrets to success.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, as Honda stepped up its dealer development
efforts, Price checked out several possibilities but did not settle
on a deal until Superior Acura came up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Honda -- about 3.6% of whose dealers are minorities -- will lend
as much as 85% of a dealership's purchase price to qualified
candidates who can come up with the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Price said he used his personal savings to acquire 26% ownership
in the Acura dealership, with Honda kicking in the rest.</TE>
<TE>   But for many minorities, "access to capital is a big issue," said
Marjorie Staten, executive director of the General Motors Minority
Dealers Assn. "We find that does become a wall for many minorities."</TE>
<TE>   To help poke a hole in that wall, the GM minority dealers group is
working with a consortium of minority athletes to create an
investment fund to support dealer development, Staten said, adding
that the fund will officially launch next month.</TE>
<TE>   The initial goal is to raise more than $10 million. Details are
still being worked out, Staten said, but the money would be used at
first to help existing dealers with needs such as expansion and real
estate purchases. Eventually, she said, as the fund grows, backers
hope to help bankroll dealership purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Vaden-Williams of the national minority dealers association said
the group was in talks with Ford -- which, at 7%, has one of the
highest proportions of minority dealers -- to develop a plan to
increase its tally to 15%. The Ford plan could serve as a blueprint
for other manufacturers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some minority dealers fear that without a hard deadline -- which
the minority dealers association has not established -- the 15% goal
may never be achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Benjamin "Ed" Fitzpatrick, who has been in the
auto business for 34 years, believe that just having an aim in sight
makes it easier to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 15% is a realistic goal," said Fitzpatrick, an African
American who owns Valley BMW and Valley Lexus in Modesto. "We've
never had a goal before, and now it's up to all sides to find a way
to get there."</TE>

<HD>Dynegy to Settle Futures Probe for $5 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. agreed Thursday to pay $5 million to settle a regulatory
investigation into fake trades reported to industry publications.</LD>
<LD>   The company agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying
the findings of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which
concluded that Dynegy submitted false information to skew natural gas
and electricity prices in its favor.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the General Accounting Office, which is the
investigative arm of Congress, said in a report Thursday that there
were "some indications" that natural gas prices may have been
manipulated on the West Coast in the winter of 2000-01.</LD>
<TE>   The GAO said that until various federal investigations were
complete "it is not possible to definitely establish whether and how
much [energy] prices paid by consumers were affected."</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy traders gave false data to newsletters that compile
gas-price surveys from at least January 2000 through June 2002, the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. The false prices and
trading volumes related to pipeline hubs in California and the Henry
Hub in Louisiana, which is the delivery point of the New York
Mercantile Exchange's futures contract.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Houston-based Dynegy fired six traders and disciplined
seven other workers after an internal probe found that they reported
false trade information to industry publications.</TE>
<TE>   The CFTC said its investigation revealed that from January 2000
through this June, Dynegy and West Coast Power, a joint venture in
California between Dynegy and NRG Energy, reported fake trade, price
and volume information to firms which use those reports to calculate
index prices of natural gas.</TE>

<HD>Index of Leading Indicators Surges 0.7% in November</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melissa Bland</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. leading indicators gauge issued Thursday posted a solid
November gain, adding to signs of economic recovery though not at a
pace fast enough to generate new jobs.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based Conference Board said its index of leading
indicators, designed to predict economic performance three to six
months ahead, jumped 0.7% in November.</LD>
<LD>   That was its biggest gain since a 1.1% jump in December 2001,
helped by higher stock prices and stronger consumer confidence.
Revised figures showed that in October it barely edged up by 0.1%,
rather than being flat.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the surprising surge in leading indicators was
encouraging, especially in the face of new data from the Labor
Department Thursday showing new weekly claims for jobless pay still
at a lofty level.</TE>
<TE>   The department said first-time jobless claims during the week
ended Dec. 14 totaled 433,000. While that was down 11,000 from the
prior week, it handily topped Wall Street economists' forecasts for
408,000 claims and remained above the 400,000 level that economists
say signals stalled job prospects.</TE>
<TE>   The data fit a general pattern of sluggish expansion currently but
with reason to hope for a modest revival by the middle of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the closely watched Blue Chip economic forecasting
survey said its members anticipated a gradual pickup in activity
during 2003 to an annual growth rate around 3.7% by year-end. But the
Blue Chip forecast was for anemic 1.4% growth in the fourth quarter
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of
Manufacturers, described the leading indicators report as
"bittersweet." Although consumer optimism strengthened, new orders
for capital goods fell last month, which implies a recovery in the
manufacturing sector will be delayed amid a generally lackluster
economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, today's report suggests that while the economic
expansion will remain on track, it will continue its anemic pace in
the near term," Jasinowski said.</TE>
<TE>   The November leading indicators report was taken as a sign of
creeping progress, at a minimum reinforcing hope that the economy
will avoid slipping back into a recession like the mild one that
lasted through the first nine months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The rebound in the index is a clear sign that we are basically in
no more than a soft patch. The economy is not headed anywhere down
the path of anything resembling a double dip," Anthony Chan, chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, suggested
that a few more positive factors were kicking in to give the
expansion a late-year lift.</TE>
<TE>   "Only consumption consistently fueled the recovery throughout
2002. Meanwhile, the financial market slump seems to be lifting a
little this autumn," he said, noting that there were no signs that
consumers were retrenching. "Recent consumer buying figures have
somewhat allayed fears about a weak holiday season and consumer
attitudes have also improved."</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago offered
a mixed signal -- its national activity index remained in negative
territory for a fourth month in November, but was not in as steep a
decline as it was during October. The Chicago Fed said the index, a
three-month moving average of a basket of indicators, was hit by a
rise in the national unemployment rate to 6% last month.</TE>
<TE>   Job weakness may persist for some time, even if the economy
rebounds modestly as predicted.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department report on jobless claims showed the four-week
moving average of claims rose by 12,750 to 400,750 last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a very soft labor market," said David Wyss, Standard &amp;
Poor's chief economist. "I think flat is probably a better
description than deteriorating, but it certainly is in line with what
we've seen in the [monthly] employment report where payrolls have
been flat for the whole year."</TE>

<HD>Modest Rise in Mergers Seen in 2003</HD>
<DH>Buyout firms have the cash and may be looking at firms with
battered share prices, a study says. The stock market could benefit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate bargain hunters could be on the verge of a new round of
"Let's make a deal."</LD>
<LD>   After a sharp two-year slide, merger activity is likely to bounce
back modestly in 2003, according to a new analysis by Ernst &amp; Young.
If it does, that could help the ailing stock market as companies
search for bargains after three years of tumbling share prices.</LD>
<LD>   Just this week, EchoStar Communications Corp. agreed to buy back a
stake from Vivendi Universal, and Los Angeles-based K2 Inc. agreed to
purchase Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. as it begins a bold expansion
plan.</LD>
<TE>   The number of announced U.S. corporate merger and acquisition
deals this year is off about 42% from 2000's record levels, which
came as the bull market was reaching its climax and acquirers were
using inflated stock as transaction currency. The dollar volume of
deals has plunged 73% from the high of $1.5 trillion in 1999, said
Ernst &amp; Young, which expects to release the study today.</TE>
<TE>   A late rush of deals could improve the picture. This year's tally
of 6,451 transactions worth a total of $403 billion covers only
activity through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the merger market is healthier than it appears, say
partners at Ernst &amp; Young, whose tax consulting group in Los Angeles
compiled the data.</TE>
<TE>   The steep deal-making spike during the boom years of the late
1990s "in no way represents a realistic or sustainable level of M&amp;A
activity," the report says, noting that 2002 appears to be in line
with the longer-term trend since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be both misleading and inaccurate to use the M&amp;A
activity level of 1995 to 2000 as the benchmark to measure the health
of the current M&amp;A market," said Joseph Doloboff, an Ernst &amp; Young
partner.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young expects both the number of deals and average
valuations to rise slightly next year from 2002 levels, although it
does not expect a 1990s-style "frenzy" anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons: Buyout firms have plenty of cash at the ready,
Doloboff said, and they may be sensing that after 2 1/2 years of
falling stock prices, companies may be available at bargain prices.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, another reason merger activity could pick up is that
companies made a lot of questionable acquisitions during the boom
years and may now be looking to slim down by unloading unwanted
assets.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously aggressive buyers will seek to divest certain holdings
in situations where synergies were not achieved or in cases where
stocks are under shareholder pressure to improve performance," said
Gregory Soukup, an Ernst &amp; Young partner.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Taulli, author of "The Complete M&amp;A Handbook," concurs. "The
'de-merger' effect will come into play as companies need to raise
cash," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vivendi deal exemplifies this trend. EchoStar agreed Wednesday
to pay $1.1 billion to repurchase a 10% stake from Vivendi after
scuttling a plan to buy rival DirecTV. The French conglomerate had
paid $1.5 billion for the stake in January.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in its bankruptcy filing this week, Conseco Inc. said
it would sell the former Green Tree Financial Corp., which it bought
for $6 billion in 1998 in a deal blamed for Conseco's mounting debt
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also say recent moves by several prominent companies and
wheeler-dealers could be a sign of things to come.</TE>
<TE>   In the technology sector, for example, IBM Corp. agreed Dec. 6 to
buy Cupertino, Calif.-based Rational Software Corp. for $2.1 billion
in cash.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to see savvy deal makers and big companies start to test
the waters," Taulli said. "When you see leaders like IBM stepping up,
that tells you something."</TE>
<TE>   Under its new chief executive, Richard Heckmann, K2 could be in
the early stages of a buying binge.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which Heckmann hopes to build into a sporting goods
powerhouse, reached an agreement Monday to buy Rawlings for $84
million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Heckmann used a series of acquisitions to turn
USFilter from a penny stock into a water industry giant that was sold
to Vivendi for $6.2 billion in 1999, Taulli said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one person locally who understands the M&amp;A market,
it's Heckmann, and he's back in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Taulli said he attended a corporate finance conference in Carlsbad
about a month ago in which 20 companies made presentations, and three
already have received buyout offers. Among them: Hoover's Inc., which
got a $117-million offer from business information provider D&amp;B, the
former Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Though the overall numbers are down, HSBC Holdings' $14.2-billion
deal in November for Household International Inc. indicates that
mega-mergers still can get done, Doloboff said. Century City-based
Northrop Grumman Corp. recently completed its $10.7-billion purchase
of TRW Inc.</TE>
<TE>   So-called hostile takeovers might add to a merger rebound in 2003,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana-based Troy Group Inc., which makes check-printing and
electronic payment systems, recently got an unsolicited $26.5-million
takeover bid from Amara Group Inc. of Aliso Viejo, even as the family
of Troy's CEO, Patrick Dirk, was negotiating to take the company
private, Taulli noted.</TE>
<TE>   Taulli said angry shareholders at U.S. companies could be
increasingly receptive to unsolicited takeover bids, and he said that
in today's era of harsh regulatory scrutiny, managements may be more
willing to consider offers to be taken private in a buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Although the equity market could benefit from even a modest merger
uptick, sustained weakness in the stock indexes might damp or thwart
a deal-making revival before it gains traction, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Acquirers often use stock for currency, which is one of the main
reasons for the late-1990s merger boom, as profitless firms often
bought one another with overvalued shares. With share prices now
greatly devalued, companies may be forced to use cash -- if they have
any -- for acquisitions, which limits their options.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, falling share prices can put pressure on CEOs to
focus on fixing the company's internal business rather than planning
aggressive and costly expansion.</TE>
<TE>   But if it happens, an M&amp;A pickup could aid the stock market in
several ways, experts say. As acquirers bid for companies, sometimes
in competition, they may drive up prices because targets typically
demand a premium.</TE>
<TE>   Merger activity also can boost market psychology, creating a
buying mood as investors see that others are willing to gamble on
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The market could use any help it can get: After rallying in
October and November, stocks have stalled this month, with the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index losing 4.8% through Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>It's hard to find yuletide cheer this year at Christmas tree lots.</LD>
<LD>   Operating a roadside Christmas tree stand has never been a huge
moneymaker, and now the big boys have moved into the market, making
it even tougher.</LD>
<LD>   The National Christmas Tree Assn. said 17% of the approximately 30
million Christmas trees sold last year came from so-called big-box
chains led by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Home Depot Inc., Lowe's Cos. and
Target Corp. That's up from 14% in 2000, the first year the
association began tracking sales at chain stores.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, sales at roadside and parking-lot tree stands
fell to 21% from 27% of all sales, and purchases from nonprofit
organizations remained steady at 15%, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart sells Christmas trees at nearly 1,800 stores nationwide,
and Home Depot sells trees at all 1,400 of its stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Christmas tree sales are growing in excess of 20% annually over
the past two years," said Home Depot spokesman John Smiley.</TE>
<TE>   More grocery chains also are selling trees. Food Lion, for
instance, sells trees at all 1,200 of its stores in the Southeast and
Middle Atlantic regions, with sales projected to be $2 million this
year, spokesman Jeff Lowrance said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Roth, owner of a tree farm in Franklin, Maine, shut his stand
in Ellsworth in 1999 in part because of competition from Wal-Mart. If
he hadn't, he said, he certainly would have shut down after Home
Depot opened last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The unfortunate thing is they use it as a loss leader," Roth said
of big chains' tree sales. "They seem to drive out the small guy with
low prices."</TE>
<TE>   The Wal-Mart in Scarborough, Maine, for instance, sells 6- to
9-foot trees for $18.98 (and 4- to 6-footers for $14.47), and Home
Depot sells trees for $19.96 for balsam fir and $29.96 for Fraser
fir.</TE>
<TE>   The average nationwide purchase price for a tree last year was
$31.09, according to the Christmas tree trade association.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Williams, spokesman for Wal-Mart, says selling Christmas trees
is part of Wal-Mart's emphasis on one-stop shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "You're shopping for gifts and you're walking out and the trees
are right there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He would not comment on the profitability of tree sales, citing
company policy against discussing individual product sales or profit
margins.</TE>
<TE>   Annual sales of real Christmas trees have hovered between 32
million and 37 million over the last 10 years. Sales last year
dropped to 27.8 million trees, though the association projects sales
of 33 million to 35 million for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Although Christmas tree sales at chain stores represent a growing
trend, the biggest worry for growers is artificial trees, not big-box
chains.</TE>
<TE>   Last year among U.S. homes with Christmas trees, only 32% were
real, the association said. A decade ago, the percentage of real
trees and fake ones was about evenly split.</TE>
<TE>   The slow decline has some growers cheering the big chains' entry
to the market.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is good because, after all, they're selling real
trees, and they're pricing trees very competitively and making them
available to everyone," said Jim Corliss, president of the trade
association.</TE>
<TE>   Local sellers are battling back by promoting the selecting and
cutting of a Christmas tree as a family outing, offering wagon rides
and hot cider, said Al Gondeck, owner of a tree farm in Turner,
Maine.</TE>
<TE>   About 33% of U.S. live tree sales last year came from such
choose-and-cut farms, up from 20% to 25% in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going back to what counts: the real tree and what goes
along with it, rather than the plastic," Gondeck said.</TE>

<LD>Jefferies Group Inc., a New York-based investment bank, said it
acquired Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a Century City firm that
specializes in mergers and acquisitions in aerospace and defense.</LD>
<LD>   Terms weren't disclosed. But in recent months Jefferies had been
increasing its stake in Quarterdeck, which has 26 employees and was
founded a decade ago by Jon B. Kutler, a former naval officer.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterdeck mainly handles transactions dealing with mid-market
defense companies with revenue of $25 million to $500 million.</LD>
<TE>   Quarterdeck has benefited from a major shakeout among mid-tier
companies as defense spending increases have renewed interest in the
sector, a trend that apparently attracted Jefferies to the highflying
firm. Kutler will continue to run the business.</TE>

<LD>   Linda Le, 16, of Santa Ana was doing some Christmas shopping
Thursday at South Coast Plaza. She had just bought an $8 pair of
white socks with purple flowers for one friend at Quiksilver Inc.'s
Roxy store and was heading toGap and Wet Seal for other gifts: a
scarf and some low-cost earrings.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead of buying shoes or something expensive, I just like to
buy socks for my friends ... or everyday wear like a beanie or a
scarf," Le said, noting that she was spending about $5 to $10 per
gift this year.</TE>
<TE>   Her 12-year-old sister, Clare, had just purchased a pair of
slippers -- pink with cherries and a sprinkle design.</TE>
<TE>   The accessories surge isn't just limited to teens. For the
holidays, more modest gift items, such as semiprecious stone jewelry
and cashmere mufflers, are proving hot sellers as consumers of all
ages hunt for bargains in the midst of a slow economy.</TE>
<TE>   Accessories sales are expected to increase 7% this year to about
$3 billion, according to NPD FashionWorld, a business unit of market
research firm NPD Group in New York. By comparison, apparel sales
overall are expected to be flat at about $166 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kind of been through the wave of large, significant
purchases," said Adriennet Tennant, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan
Securities. "It's become much more widely accepted to have something
that's just fun."</TE>
<TE>   Even some higher-end retailers -- where penny-pinching is a
relative concept -- are seeing the trend. A well-heeled shopper at
Nordstrom or Saks Fifth Avenue will accessorize with a $200 purse
long after she has stopped collecting $1,000 outfits, noted Marshal
Cohen, NPD FashionWorld's co-president.</TE>
<TE>   But it is teenagers -- snapping up scarves, beanies, hair clips
and childlike socks -- who are driving the boom.</TE>
<TE>   Younger consumers have less money to spend than adults but are
particularly determined not to leave a store empty-handed, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Buying smaller-priced items allows them to shop in their favorite
stores and complete" a purchase, said Michael Wood, vice president of
Teenage Research Unlimited in Northbrook, Ill. "They might have only
10 bucks or 20 bucks in their pocket, but they can come home with
something."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, sales of accessories have become an important growth
vehicle for teen apparel companies. Huntington Beach-based
Quiksilver, Anaheim-based Pacific Sunwear of California and Costa
Mesa-based Paul Frank Industries Inc. all say accessories now account
for about a fifth to a quarter of their total sales.</TE>
<TE>   These days, teen "style" involves draping floor-dragging scarves
around their necks and wrapping men's ties -- the nerdier the better
-- around their waists, according to Barbara Fields, an Los Angeles
trend forecaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls are shopping in the guys department, girls are shopping in
their daddies' closets," she said. "Girls want old vintage ties, not
the Jerry Garcia ones."</TE>
<TE>   Oddball accessories such as stickers, mirrors and magnets also are
being purchased to decorate the inside of school lockers, Fields
said. Cell phone accessories continue to be hot, as are slippers --
especially if they have a face design on them or make noise.</TE>
<TE>   Often, stores place accessories near the cash register to prompt
impulse purchases.</TE>
<TE>   In the juniors section of Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza, tables
alongside the register are heaped with necklaces, earrings and tiny
purses. Shoppers waiting in line could grab a pair of sunglasses for
$10 or a bracelet-style watch for $28.</TE>
<TE>   In a testament to the promise of accessory sales, privately held
Paul Frank Industries -- best known for the monkey face that appears
on many of its products -- will soon have a dozen stores.</TE>
<TE>   The company got its start in 1995, hawking vinyl wallets and
purses out of a garage in Huntington Beach. Over the years, it has
added women's sportswear, pajamas, housewares and men's clothes. But
accessories remain its bedrock, accounting for one-fourth of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   At Pacific Sunwear, big sellers include socks, beanies and
wallets. Tote bags, meanwhile, are "just killin' it," said the
company's president, Tim Harmon. In fact, accessories sales jumped
29% last month and will account for about 18% of all sales this year,
up from 13% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We even created a gift table in our stores for the juniors
customers for the first time to feature all these stocking suffers,"
Harmon said.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday, a
top Quiksilver executive said the accessories business at its Roxy
division is "on fire," accounting for about 20% of revenue. And that
number is on the rise, said Heidi Draper, vice president of sales for
Roxy accessories. Girls are buying shell necklaces, beaded bracelets
and embroidered purses.</TE>
<TE>   And socks. Clutching her Roxy purchase, Linda Le talked of buying
more accessories -- though not for herself. "There are too many
friends," she said, "and a lot of stuff to buy."</TE>

<HD>AOL Wins U.S. Patent for Instant Messaging</HD>
<DH>The company could get a legal leg up on rival providers
Microsoft and Yahoo but says it has no plans to enforce it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner has quietly won a U.S. patent for instant messaging,
an increasingly popular mode of online communication that the media
giant already dominates.</LD>
<LD>   AOL executives downplayed the significance of the patent and said
they had no plans to enforce it against other instant-messaging
providers.</LD>
<LD>   "There are no plans to do anything with the patent at this time,"
a spokesman for AOL's Internet division, America Online, said
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The patent, issued in September, grants AOL's instant- messaging
subsidiary, ICQ, ownership rights to the technology, which enables
users to chat quickly and cheaply across the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The broad wording of the patent means AOL could get an important
legal leg up on rivals Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc., the other
players in the potentially lucrative instant-messaging arena that
have their own proprietary technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and AOL have recently embarked on a project to develop
secure chat applications for corporate users, the first major effort
to cash in on what has been a largely free software tool. Reuters
Group is one of the biggest corporate clients, using Microsoft's IM
technology.</TE>
<TE>   AOL has scores of other technology patents, including one for
Internet browsing memory tags, or "cookies," and another for secure
sockets layer, an application that secures e-commerce transactions.
But it has never sought to enforce these.</TE>
<TE>   It has, however, been protective of its IM technology. It did not
permit rivals' proprietary IM applications to communicate with AOL
Instant Messenger and ICQ for years. It now allows this in a limited
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The new patent defines AOL's instant-messaging application as one
that enables users to chat with and identify one another across a
specific communications network, opening up the possibility for AOL
to collect royalties from rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The technology was developed in the mid-1990s by a group of
Israelis. A patent was filed in 1997 and was acquired by AOL in 1998
for $287 million.</TE>
<TE>   AOL said it had 180 million registered AIM users and 140 million
registered ICQ users. The company said 2.1 billion instant messages
were sent across its network daily.</TE>

<HD>Boeing to Shelve 'Sonic Cruiser'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. is expected to announce today that it is scrubbing plans
to develop a high-speed commercial jet and instead will focus on
building a more conventional fuel-efficient next-generation aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The move to shelve the "sonic cruiser" has been expected for
months amid a sharp downturn in the airline industry.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing unveiled plans for the jet with much fanfare in March 2001,
saying it would fly faster, higher and farther than current
airliners, and abandoned plans for a larger 747. The sonic cruiser
would travel near the speed of sound, and passengers could save at
least an hour on long, transpacific flights, Boeing said.</LD>
<TE>   But in the aftermath of last year's terrorist attacks, airlines
have been focused mainly on surviving the travel slump and have shown
little interest in new concepts. United Airlines and US Airways have
filed for bankruptcy protection, and many airlines have taken some of
their airplanes out of service.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Mulally, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft business, has
scheduled a media briefing today. Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit
acknowledged that the company is "about to decide" the sonic
cruiser's fate.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how much Boeing has spent on the development of
the aircraft. But aerospace analysts said that to bring it into
production, Boeing would have had to spend up to $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The decision didn't surprise some analysts, who were dubious about
Boeing's plans before the airline industry's financial problems
surfaced.</TE>

<HD>Goldman, Lehman Profit Up; Morgan Down</HD>
<DH>Mixed bag of brokerage earnings reflects how some firms
offset weak banking conditions with cost-cutting efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Kelleher</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street stalwarts Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Bros.
Holdings Inc. posted higher earnings Thursday as bond trading and
cost controls largely offset the dreary merger and stock underwriting
business.</LD>
<LD>   However, rival Morgan Stanley was unable to overcome disappointing
trading results and restructuring costs for its retail brokerage
business, which has suffered from weak individual investor trading
activity.</LD>
<LD>   The three firms wrapped up their fourth quarters at the end of
November, along with Bear Stearns Cos., which posted a 23% increase
in profit Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Fixed-income trading was a bright spot as investors put their
money into blue-chip bonds. But the top focus was cost reduction, and
each firm cut jobs during the quarter to help boost profitability, as
no one expects a quick turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "In the near term, we remain quite cautious about the
environment," Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said. "We
can't control the environment, only what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Goldman shares fell $3.40 to $70.30 in New York Stock Exchange
trading, while Lehman shares fell 88 cents to $55.08 on the NYSE.
Morgan Stanley's stock dipped 80 cents to $40.30 in trading on the
Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenues [for Goldman and Morgan Stanley] were clearly the
bad news," said Mark Constant, an analyst at Lehman. "Principal
transactions, investment banking and net interest income were
disappointing for both companies."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to weak banking conditions, the three firms are
embroiled in talks to settle charges of abusive business practices,
which could lead to a combined $1 billion of industrywide fines in a
settlement expected to be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman reported net income of $505 million, or 98 cents a share,
for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 29, compared with $497 million, or
93 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman edged the analysts' average estimate of 96 cents a share
by paying less in compensation and interest expense to partially
offset a 34% decline in investment banking revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman reported net income of $243 million, or 91 cents a share,
for the three months ended Nov. 30, up from $130 million, or 46 cents
a share, a year earlier and above the consensus estimate of 88 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, Lehman took a one-time gain for an
insurance claim related to the Sept. 11 attacks, but also took a
$128-million charge to move its European headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's results included a $127-million Sept. 11-related
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman's bond trading revenue jumped from a year ago, when the
Sept. 11 attacks disrupted business and displaced the company from
its downtown New York headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley reported fourth-quarter net income of $732 million,
or 67 cents a share, compared with 78 cents a year earlier. Excluding
a $235-million pretax restructuring charge for office space
reductions and severance, the company said it earned $884 million, or
81 cents a share, in the latest quarter. The analysts' average
estimate was 74 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's merger advisory revenue and underwriting revenue each
fell 16%, while trading revenue fell 35%. The firm also closed 50
brokerage branches, leading to a $112-million charge.</TE>
<TE>   "The results looked sloppy in key areas," Merrill Lynch analyst
Judah Kraushaar said in a research note, adding that trading results
were disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston, the
firms reporting Thursday have avoided mass layoffs. But they have
been trimming staff to cope with dwindling revenue. Goldman cut 4% of
its staff in the quarter. Lehman shed 5%. Morgan Stanley cut 4% of
its staff in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>Can Disney Turn a Frog Into a Prince?</HD>
<DH>Firm again may bid for creator of Muppets, but it must make
the characters relevant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again, Mickey Mouse may try to bring Miss Piggy and her fellow
Muppet friends into the Magic Kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co. is considering whether to make an offer to buy Jim
Henson Co., creator of Muppet characters Kermit the Frog and Fozzie
Bear, sources close to the matter said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   It's unclear what Disney would be willing to pay Henson Co.'s
parent company, financially strapped EM.TV &amp; Merchandising. But any
offer probably would be well below the $150 million Disney bid more
than a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for Disney or any other potential buyer will
be to find ways to make the Muppet figures relevant to a new
generation of kids weaned on characters such as Arthur, SpongeBob
SquarePants and the Rugrats.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry sources, who have taken a close look at Los
Angeles-based Henson Co., value it at as little as $80 million. The
company's properties include Muppet characters such as Miss Piggy and
Kermit, as well as a movie special-effects house known as the
Creature Shop.</TE>
<TE>   But any sale would not include several of the Muppets' most
recognizable characters from the children's television program
"Sesame Street," such as Big Bird and Bert and Ernie. The rights to
those characters belong to Sesame Workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Germany-based EM.TV are said to be in Los
Angeles this week seeking buyers for Henson Co., which it acquired
two years ago for $680 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has had a long interest in acquiring Henson's characters to
complement its line of family entertainment. Buying Henson Co. would
fit the Burbank entertainment giant's recent strategy of investing
heavily in children's programming, particularly for the profitable
Disney Channel. Hits there have included the show "Bear in the Big
Blue House," which is produced by Henson.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Disney faces competition from other potential suitors,
including billionaire investor Haim Saban and Dean Valentine, former
chief executive of United Paramount Network.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of EM.TV, Henson Co. and Disney declined to
comment. A source close to Saban said his offer still was on the
table. Valentine declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Muppets made their network TV debut in 1956 on "The Steve
Allen Show," and "The Muppet Show" ran in first-run syndication from
1976 to 1981. Since then, however, Henson Co. has struggled to make
its characters connect with younger audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 movie "Muppets From Space" flopped, as did the Muppets TV
series "Muppets Tonight," which first ran on Disney-owned ABC.
However, a Muppets Christmas movie that aired on NBC on Nov. 29 drew
surprisingly strong ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a wonderful brand name in the Jim Henson Co. that
if placed in the right hands could be a very valuable asset," said
Toper Taylor, president of Nelvana Communications, a Canadian
animation studio that specializes in children's programming.
"However, the clock is ticking and the tarnish is growing."</TE>
<TE>   Disney believes it could revive the Muppets with better management
and with the help of the company's TV, film and direct-to-video
outlets, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Other studios have had huge success repackaging older characters
for a new generation of children, notably Warner Bros. with its hit
movie "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a good strategic move for Disney," said Tom Wolzien,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   It's uncertain, though, whether Disney Chief Executive Michael
Eisner would be willing to engage in a bidding war for Henson.</TE>
<TE>   Turning around Henson would be an expensive undertaking, and
Eisner may not have the appetite for such a task given Disney's tight
finances, which have been squeezed by the slow economy.</TE>
<TE>   Disney and Henson Co. have had a lengthy -- and sometimes
acrimonious -- relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner agreed to buy the company for $150 million nine months
before Jim Henson's death in May 1990. But the deal unraveled after
Henson passed away, prompting his heirs to sue Disney for allegedly
exploiting the Muppet characters before owning them. Disney then
countersued. The parties reached a settlement in May 1991, with
Disney agreeing to pay $10 million for limited theme park rights.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting "Muppet Vision 3D" attraction at Disney-MGM Studios
in Florida was replicated in 2001 at Disney California Adventure in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   EM.TV is said to be eager to sell Henson Co. by the end of the
year to avoid a cash crunch stemming from several acquisitions that
left the media company with $934 million in debts.</TE>

<HD>Another View of Economy Focuses on Points of Pain</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For more than two years, mainstream economists have portrayed what
has happened since the boom-time 1990s as "recession lite," a sort of
economic upset so evenly distributed among America's income groups
and regions that it barely has been felt.</LD>
<LD>   But how does this picture square with the catastrophes of the tech
and telecom industries, which have been every bit as painful as the
massive declines that once swept steel, oil and autos? And how does
it fit with the demolition of $6 trillion in paper wealth since the
stock market peak?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is it doesn't.</LD>
<TE>   The mismatch may throw light on some curious recent behavior of
President Bush, who seems alternately casual about the economy -- as
when he agreed to let federal extended unemployment benefits run out
at Christmastime -- and so hyper-concerned that he replaced virtually
his entire economic team.</TE>
<TE>   Herewith, then, is an alternative account of what has happened to
the U.S. economy in recent years, one that -- in the tradition of the
Rust Belt recession of the early 1980s and the "bicoastal" recession
of the early 1990s -- might be called the "points-of-pain" recession
of the early 2000s.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom is that this downturn has been
democratic; that it's affected all parts of the country evenly, but
that's not what the numbers show," said Northeastern University
economist Paul Harrington, who co-authored a recent study of the
recession with analyst Sean Toppel. "This thing has been highly
concentrated."</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the economy has managed to deposit most of its
troubles on a few, widely dispersed groups and places -- many of them
high-tech and telecom centers -- leaving the rest of the nation
relatively unscathed. Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * Although unemployment nationally has been surprisingly benign --
with the jobless rate now at 6% -- unemployment at various points of
pain most definitely has not.</TE>
<TE>   Take San Jose, which has the dubious distinction of having
suffered the biggest jump in joblessness of any metropolitan area in
the nation during the last two years. There, the unemployment rate
has climbed from an almost imperceptible 1.9% in October 2000 to
nearly 8% in October this year.</TE>
<TE>   "That puts us somewhere between the worst recession possible and a
mild depression," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   * The concentration of pain also shows up in the growing ranks of
the long-term unemployed, who have been out of work for six months or
more and who now account for one in every five jobless workers.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the low national unemployment rate is coming at
the expense of those who get walloped so hard they can't get up
again.</TE>
<TE>   * Although it has been widely assumed that stock owners are more
or less distributed across the country so that the pain of the stock
crash of the last two plus years has been evenly -- and comparatively
easily -- handled, the numbers suggest otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Internal Revenue Service data on capital gains -- the
money people make from selling shares for more than they bought them
-- show that in 2000 just three states (Massachusetts, Connecticut
and California) accounted for more than one-quarter of all U.S. share
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   That means that residents of those states probably have borne a
quarter, or more, of the multitrillion-dollar loss in share value
since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to be at the forefront of stock ownership when the
market was going up, but it's been very tough since the market has
been going down," said California Treasurer Phil Angelides.</TE>
<TE>   The state faces a budget deficit of nearly $35 billion over the
next 18 months, a huge chunk of which is traceable to a free-fall in
state capital gains tax collections.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that the economy's troubles have been highly concentrated
rather than broadly dispersed -- that there have been points of pain
instead of recession "lite" -- helps explain several big mysteries
about the current period.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, it sheds light on how American consumers have
managed to keep buying in the face of economic travail -- and, in the
process, have propped up the economy. The reason is that consumers in
most places haven't faced all that much travail. And they have been
able to enjoy the Federal Reserve-administered, low interest rate
medicine intended to help those who have.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, interest-sensitive sectors such as housing have
defied economic gravity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first recession on record where housing hasn't gone
down steeply," said Los Angeles economic consultant Donald
Straszheim.</TE>
<TE>   The points-of-pain account also helps explain the public's recent
tendency to fall into nervous funks that show up in declining
consumer confidence. These mood swings infuriate mainstream analysts,
who insist that the slumps in confidence are not justified by the
mildness of the economy's problems.</TE>
<TE>   But the declines are considerably easier to understand if the
problems that do exist are landing heavily on just a few people and
places, leaving everyone else to wonder whether they might be next.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a "Star Trek" episode in which the Enterprise
encounters a society in which everything is perfect -- except for the
fact authorities periodically vaporize one in every 20 citizens. No
wonder people are nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the points-of-pain account may help illuminate a recent
political conundrum -- the Bush administration's decision to let
unemployment benefits for nearly 1 million jobless Americans expire
in the middle of the Christmas holiday season, even as the president
expresses such concern about the economy that he replaces his
Treasury secretary and his top White House advisor on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on unemployment benefits was especially surprising
because Bush has worked diligently to avoid the political missteps of
his father.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush is widely thought to have damaged his
1992 reelection chances by vetoing two bills to extend jobless
benefits in the wake of the early '90s recession.</TE>
<TE>   The current president said last weekend that he supports Congress
reviving the benefits when it returns in January, but he sidestepped
the central issue: choosing between a narrow House measure and a more
expansive, bipartisan Senate version. Bush's studious avoidance could
well leave the extended benefits as good as dead.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the president's action begins to make political sense
if one looks at where the economy's recent troubles have taken their
greatest toll, and therefore where new benefits would most likely
flow.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, the places that would benefit most from an
extension of unemployment compensation are places that did not vote
for Bush in 2000 and are not likely to vote for him next time," said
Milken Institute regional economist Ross DeVol.</TE>
<TE>   The president's political advisors "must have determined they are
not going to lose much" by letting the benefits lapse, DeVol said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but the decision is likely to rub at what already are
points of pain.</TE>

<HD>Judge Asked to Bar DVD Software</HD>
<DH>Studios want permanent injunction against programs that
allow motion pictures to be duplicated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven Hollywood studios have raised the stakes in their courtroom
battle with 321 Studios, a software developer that makes two programs
for duplicating DVD movies.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the studios asked U.S. District Judge Susan Illston
in Oakland to permanently forbid 321 Studios and its executives from
making or selling the two programs -- DVD Copy Plus and DVDXCopy --
or any similar product that circumvents the electronic locks on DVDs.
They also asked to be awarded all of the start-up company's profit
and its entire inventory of the two programs.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis-based 321 Studios had started the legal maneuvering in
April by filing suit against the studios. The company initially asked
Illston to declare that DVD Copy Plus was a legal product, and it
later amended its lawsuit to seek protection for DVDXCopy as well.</LD>
<TE>   The case is the latest test of the 1998 Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, which makes it illegal to pick the electronic locks
protecting a digital movie, music or other copyrighted material. In
its lawsuit, 321 Studios argued that the restrictions in the DMCA
don't apply or are unconstitutional because their products are used
mainly for a legal purpose: letting users make back-up copies of
their DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   The company also noted that DVDXCopy includes features to deter
pirates, including an electronic code that prevents copies from being
duplicated and an identifier that can link pirated discs to their
source.</TE>
<TE>   The studios initially asked Illston to dismiss 321 Studios'
lawsuit on procedural grounds. On Thursday, though, they filed a
counterclaim accusing 321 of trafficking in illegal products.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia H. Benson, an attorney for the studios, said the legal
landscape changed when 321 Studios brought out DVDXCopy, which
enables DVD-to-DVD copying.</TE>
<TE>   DVDCopyPlus squeezes DVD movies onto CDs, eliminating the extra
features on a DVD in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Benson and Daralyn J. Durie, an attorney for 321 Studios, agreed
the central issue of the case hasn't changed. The only real
difference, Durie said, is that the studios added the three owners of
321 Studios to the case, potentially subjecting them to penalties and
restrictions.</TE>

<HD>SBC's Long-Distance Bid Gets Federal OK</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators gave SBC Communications Inc. the green light
Thursday to start offering long-distance service to California
customers.</LD>
<LD>   Pending an expected approval from state regulators, the company is
ready to launch an advertising blitz at the end of the month.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission, in a 3-1 vote with one
abstention, found that SBC meets the legal criteria to enter the
long-distance market, "making increased competition in all markets
for telecommunications services possible." Until recently, SBC
operated in California under the Pacific Bell name.</LD>
<TE>   The order, which takes effect Dec. 30, relies in part on the
continued monitoring and enforcement by the FCC and the California
Public Utilities Commission to ensure that SBC doesn't use its
massive local-service market share to hammer long-distance or other
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The commission vote on SBC, which had been anticipated, brought
relief to executives who had fought doggedly to win approval in the
face of charges that giving it access to the nation's most lucrative
long-distance market would stifle competition, not promote it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really excited about this," said Lora Watts, president of
SBC's Pacific region covering California and Nevada. "Our marketing
team is trained, our systems are ready. Everything is set to go on
the effective date."</TE>
<TE>   The California PUC is expected to rule next week on a decision
from one of its administrative law judges giving SBC the go-ahead to
provide long-distance service within the state. Until then, SBC can't
discuss rates or product packages.</TE>
<TE>   "All we can do is promise we'll offer some exciting packages,
combining local, long-distance, wireless, data and give some
discounts for bundling them all in one bill," Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts also welcomed the FCC approval, giving the
company high marks for managing an operation that encompasses 13
states and controls a third of the nation's residential access lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that approval is in hand, California can expect to see the
same benefits of competition that other states are experiencing,"
said independent analyst Jeff Kagan in Atlanta. "This allows SBC to
offer a bundle of services, and it's all about the bundle in the new
telecom marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   But competitors such as AT&amp;T Corp. complained that SBC will now
use its muscle to push competitors out of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC acted on the "perceived" ability of competitors to enter
local markets by leasing access lines from the Baby Bells, said AT&amp;T
spokeswoman Claudia Jones. But the regional Bell companies are trying
to push up the prices for leasing the lines, she maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bells are in the final stretch of gaining access to the
country's long-distance market, while at the same time continuing
their domination of the local telephone marketplace," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Watts noted that although SBC covers 78% of the state and controls
90% of the residential access lines and 80% of the business lines, it
expects to lose some of its share of the local-service market as it
gains long-distance customers.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting Commissioner Kevin J. Martin said that approving SBC's
application is "premature," though he commended the company for
working to open its market to rivals.</TE>

<HD>GAO Report Finds SEC Failures</HD>
<DH>The account is hard on Robert Herdman for his role in the
selection of a chief for the accounting oversight board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Poor communication and a lack of consensus at the top of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, plus failures by SEC staffers,
caused the agency to bungle its appointment of the head of a new
accounting oversight board, the General Accounting Office said in a
report Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, came down especially hard on
former SEC Chief Accountant Robert Herdman. But it also criticized
outgoing SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and his four fellow
commissioners for lapses prior to their Oct. 25 decision, on a 3-2
vote, to name former federal Judge William H. Webster to head the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-page report, however, also made clear that Pitt was not
aware before the vote of details of Webster's role as a director of
U.S. Technologies Inc., a high-tech company that fired its auditors
last year, a month after they warned of poor financial controls at
the firm.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Technologies' stock has since collapsed and its chairman, C.
Gregory Earls, was charged with fraud in a criminal complaint
unsealed Thursday by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. He
allegedly took $13.8 million of investor proceeds meant for the
company and diverted it to his personal use. Earls and the company
also were sued for fraud by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Amid backlash from the Webster appointment, Pitt resigned Nov. 5
and Herdman quit Nov. 8. Webster stepped down Nov. 12 as chairman of
the accounting panel.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democratic congressmen said Thursday that the Webster debacle
illustrates a lack of commitment by the White House and congressional
Republicans to the corporate-reform goals of the sweeping
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation enacted July 30.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC, whose power was to be enhanced by this new law, is in
fact weaker now than it was ... before the president signed the
bill," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) of the House Financial
Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush last week promised to more than double the SEC's
budget. But Frank said Bush was talking about the 2004 budget year.
Meanwhile, the agency is on what Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.)
called "a starvation diet."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), co-sponsor of
the reform law and chairman of the House Financial Services
Committee, said Frank and Markey's comments represented "an
unfortunate and unfair partisan attack."</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted Harvey Pitt out. He's out," she said, "and now they
complain about a lack of leadership at the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   Under Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC faced an Oct. 28 deadline to fill
the accounting board. Pitt expected SEC commissioners to approve a
slate of nominees by the end of September, leaving a month for a
background investigation, the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the commissioners stumbled in their efforts to reach a
consensus on a chairman and the process dragged out longer than
expected, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt and Herdman met with Webster on Oct. 15 and asked whether he
would take the job, the report said. At the meeting, Webster asked
that the SEC examine its records on U.S. Technologies to make sure
that his role there didn't pose problems.</TE>
<TE>   However, it wasn't until Oct. 24, the day before the vote, that
Herdman followed up on Webster's suggestion. He learned of U.S.
Technologies firing its auditor but "deemed that the information
would not affect Judge Webster's nomination" and decided not to pass
it along to Pitt and the other commissioners or the SEC general
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO recommended that the agency develop a better plan for
screening candidates.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Ex-Accountant Warns Investors on Financial Results</HD>
<DH>KPMG says its former client's restatements mean previous
audit data are not reliable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miles Weiss</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>KPMG, the former accountant for Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc.,
Thursday warned investors not to rely on its most recent audit of the
company's financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   The auditor withdrew its report on Gemstar's past results after
the company on Nov. 15 restated its 2000 and 2001 results to write
off more than $100 million in previously recorded revenue after
losing a patent dispute involving Scientific Atlanta Inc.</LD>
<LD>   But a month earlier, a dispute over whether the results should be
restated led Gemstar to fire KPMG as its auditor. The company has
since hired Ernst &amp; Young, which is reviewing Gemstar's most recent
financial statement.</LD>
<TE>   The November restatement meant that Gemstar's management had
implicitly withdrawn representations made to KPMG in regard to
previous financial statements, the accounting firm said in a letter,
which was dated Nov. 22 and filed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Accordingly, KPMG hereby advises you that our report on the
company's financial statements should no longer be relied upon," the
accounting firm said in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena-based Gemstar, run largely by its biggest shareholder,
News Corp., had said in November that it would revisit its handling
of that revenue after consulting with Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG responded at the time by saying it was "not surprised" by
Gemstar's decision to change auditors and said it would detail its
disagreement in an SEC filing.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar, publisher of TV Guide and a maker of on-screen television
guides, has seen its share price decline 87% so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the company's shares slid 13 cents to close at $3.36 in
Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Winnick Puts Cash in Fund for Workers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making good on a pledge to Congress last summer, Global Crossing Ltd.
founder Gary Winnick put $25 million into an escrow account Thursday
to repay employees for company stock they bought for their pension
plan -- shares that became worthless when the fiber-optic network
builder filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   But his donation didn't sit so well with some, and the payout may
not be so simple to accomplish, according to current and former
employees.</LD>
<LD>   "If Gary Winnick really wants to do us justice, tell him to write
a check for all the money we lost: our severance and our 401(k),"
said Irene DiNolfo of Rochester, N.Y., a former executive who took a
voluntary severance package 15 months ago.</LD>
<TE>   "It still hurts," DiNolfo added. "People think it goes away, but
it doesn't. I have to save for retirement again."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing doesn't know how the money will be distributed,
who will get it or how it will be allocated, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   She referred questions to Winnick, the Los Angeles financier who
built the company's worldwide system, cashed in more than $575
million of the company's stock and oversaw Global's crash.</TE>
<TE>   Union Bank of California is waiting for instructions on what to do
with the money wired from Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just holding the funds in an interest-bearing account,"
bank spokeswoman Joanne Curran said.</TE>
<TE>   But Winnick's handlers say he has nothing more to do with the
matter. He simply turned the money over to Union Bank for deposit in
an irrevocable escrow account and left the bank and the company to
work out the details of who gets what and when.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent is for the payout to occur as soon as possible," said
Winnick's chief spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein. But neither
Rubenstein nor aide Scott Tagliarino could say when that would be,
and they couldn't provide further details.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether Winnick will get a tax benefit from the
donation. Generally, only contributions made to registered charities
are deductible, but there can be exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The money is aimed at repaying current and former employees the
amount they put into the pension plan to buy Global Crossing stock
between October 1999, when the company merged with Frontier Telephone
of Rochester Inc., and the company's bankruptcy filing Jan. 28.
Winnick told a congressional committee that he got the $25 million
figure from Global Crossing's human resources department.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing can't say how many employees might be eligible for
a refund. The company had about 9,000 U.S. workers at its peak after
the merger, but not all of them contributed to the 401(k) or put all
of their pension contributions into company stock.</TE>
<TE>   DiNolfo, for instance, allocated only 20% of her contributions to
company stock. But she had been an employee for 14 years, working for
Frontier and its predecessor firm, Rochester Telephone Co., since
1987. The stock she and others bought for their pension plans rolled
over with each acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's money "doesn't cover all the stock I bought in Frontier
and Rochester Telephone," she said. She would not disclose how much
money she had lost.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing won Bankruptcy Court approval Tuesday of a plan to
sell a majority stake to two Asian companies, repay creditors pennies
on the dollar and emerge from bankruptcy sometime in the next four
months.</TE>

<HD>Jack in the Box Lowers Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andria Cheng</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack in the Box Inc. on Thursday lowered its profit forecasts for a
third time this year as bigger fast-food restaurants slash prices.
The company's shares fell 20%.</LD>
<LD>   Profit will be about $21 million, or 55 cents a share, in its
fiscal first quarter ending Jan. 19, the company said. It had
expected to earn 63 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall about 2.7% in
the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald's Corp., Burger King and Wendy's International Inc. have
been slashing prices as they fight over customers in a market
saturated with hamburger restaurants. McDonald's said Tuesday that it
would have its first quarterly loss in almost 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants "can't make money during the price war," said
Frederick Sears, a portfolio manager at Investors Capital Corp.,
which sold its shares of Jack in the Box and doesn't own any
restaurant-related stocks. "It's a horrible business to be in right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Diego-based Jack in the Box fell $4.02 to $16.14 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The decline was the shares' biggest
one-day drop since January 1993. They've tumbled 41% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it is introducing two products, the Jr. Bacon
Cheeseburger and the Chili Cheeseburger, to its dollar menu to
compete with bigger rivals. Jack in the Box has 1,860 restaurants in
17 states.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's has about 30,000 worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box had expected first-quarter same-store sales to
fall 1.5%. Same-store sales will be little changed this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the year-ago first quarter, Jack in the Box earned $26.7
million, or 67 cents. Last year, the company had net income of $83
million, or $2.07 a share.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Mortgage Sued for $9 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California regulators said Thursday that they have sued Long Beach
Mortgage Co., seeking $9 million in fines from the big sub-prime unit
of Washington Mutual Inc. for alleged repeat violations of lending
laws.</LD>
<LD>   State law bars mortgage lenders from charging interest until one
day before loans close. Long Beach Mortgage, based in Orange, was
found to be breaking that law in 1999, and kept doing so despite
pledging to repay overcharged borrowers and change its policies, the
Department of Corporations said.</LD>
<LD>   After reviewing loans originated from December 1999 to January
2002, Long Beach Mortgage admitted charging $625,000 in excess
interest on 3,618 loans, Corporations Commissioner Demetrios Boutris
said.</LD>
<TE>   Boutris said his department ordered repayment of the overcharges
in June and was pursuing the $9-million penalty in court because the
case involved the "nickel and diming of financially disadvantaged
Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual officials could not be reached for comment on
the suit, filed Nov. 21 in Sacramento County Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. War Jitters Outweigh Positive Economic Reports</HD>
<DH>Dow dips to its lowest level in nearly six weeks. Oil and
gold prices continue to rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>War fears overshadowed encouraging economic reports Thursday on Wall
Street, sending stock prices lower for a third consecutive day. The
Dow Jones industrials fell to their lowest level in nearly six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said trading was choppy as investors struggled to decide
whether to buy on bets of stronger prospects in 2003. But the
escalating rhetoric on Iraq ultimately gave them another reason to
sell, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "They're worried quite a bit about a war, and they're still
worried about corporate profits and economic factors going forward,"
said Mark Donahoe, managing director at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.</LD>
<TE>   War jitters also helped gold and oil prices continue their recent
rally.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow average fell 82.55 points, or 1%, to close at 8,364.80 for
a three-day loss of 262 points. It was the lowest finish since Nov.
11.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index lost 7.41 points, or 0.5%, to 1,354.10
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 6.87 points, or 0.8%, to
884.25.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a broad retreat. Losers outnumbering winners by slim 6
to 5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq in slow
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix told the Security Council
that Iraq's 12,000-page weapons declaration contains gaps and
inconsistencies. The United States called Iraq in "material breach"
of U.N. resolutions, setting a course toward a possible war early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, meanwhile, largely shrugged off reports showing modest
improvements in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department reported Thursday that new claims for
unemployment benefits dropped last week by a seasonally adjusted
11,000 to 433,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said Thursday that its index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.7% in November, the largest monthly gain
in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say investors in recent days have been uncertain whether
to commit to stocks on hopes of a strengthening economy or cash in
quick profits from an eight-week blue-chip rally in the autumn.
Indeed, many analysts are questioning whether Wall Street will see
its traditional holiday rally in the last two weeks of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Oil futures in New York surged as high as $31.10 a barrel
Thursday, then fell back to end up 12 cents at $30.56.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term gold futures rose $3.70 to $345.90 an ounce in New York.
The metal has gained 9.2% since Nov. 27 as some investors have sought
a safe haven.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields continued their recent slide, also reflecting a
search for safety. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
fell to 3.94% from Wednesday's close of 4.04%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow was clipped by AT&amp;T, which fell $1.20 to $25.11; Eastman
Kodak, off $1.22 to $35.95; and Procter &amp; Gamble, down $1.67 to
$85.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Oracle rose 37 cents to $11 after the business software maker
reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Dole Foods jumped $4.13 to $32.58 after its chairman, David
Murdock, agreed to buy all of the Westlake Village-based food
company's outstanding shares that he doesn't own and take it private
in a $2.5-billion deal.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of San Francisco-based UnionBanCal dipped $1.14 to
$39.86. The parent of Union Bank of California said it is buying San
Diego-based John Burnham &amp; Co., a closely held commercial insurance
broker.</TE>

<HD>Pfizer to Pay Neurocrine to Co-Develop Insomnia Drug</HD>
<DH>The global pharmaceutical firm will spend up to $400
million for rights to indiplon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug firm, agreed Thursday to pay
San Diego-based Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. up to $400 million for
rights to co-develop and co-market the biotech firm's experimental
insomnia drug.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Pfizer will have exclusive rights to sell the
medicine, called indiplon, abroad in exchange for royalties to
Neurocrine. The two firms will jointly market it in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement reflects a continuing effort by big pharmaceutical
makers to expand their pipeline by investing in smaller biotech firms
and by strengthening their presence in leading centers of biomedical
research, such as the San Diego area.</LD>
<TE>   This year, Pfizer said it would build a major biomedical research
campus in La Jolla, where more than 1,000 scientists would work on
drug discovery. The La Jolla campus is being built on the current
facilities of Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which Pfizer acquired in June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Under the pact announced Thursday, Neurocrine will receive an
upfront payment of $100 million and up to $300 million in milestone
payments. Neurocrine, which had 2001 revenue of $41.2 million, also
is conducting early-stage trials of treatments for prostate cancer
and anxiety. The company has no drugs on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream for Neurocrine and also a terrific deal for Pfizer
since it may emerge with the best sleeping pill on the market," said
analyst Matt Geller of CIBC World Markets Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer said it would support the creation of a 200-member
Neurocrine sales force to sell indiplon. The team also would help
sell Pfizer's popular antidepressant Zoloft to U.S. psychiatrists
after Neurocrine seeks U.S. approval for the sleeping aid, possibly
by the end of 2003, the firms said.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America Securities analyst Michael King said indiplon
could reach annual sales of $2 billion if it wins government
approval.</TE>
<TE>   He said indiplon is unique in that one formulation of the drug
puts patients to sleep and keeps them asleep without making them
groggy when they wake up. Another formulation helps patients who wake
up in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer aims next year to buy Pharmacia Corp., a firm well-versed
in the insomnia business. Pharmacia helped make Ambien a
$1-billion-a-year seller, but the Peapack, N.J.-based firm recently
returned rights to the insomnia drug to French drug maker
Sanofi-Synthelabo under a previous agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Neurocrine shares closed up 31 cents at $42.86 on Nasdaq. Pfizer
slipped 18 cents to $30.10 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Agents Raid Tenet Hospital in San Diego</HD>
<DH>Warrants served at the offices of the CEO and director of
business development seek data on doctor recruitment and other
practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with search warrants, federal agents Thursday raided the
executive offices of a Tenet Healthcare Corp. hospital in San Diego,
seizing voluminous records as part of a probe into possible
violations of laws prohibiting kickbacks to physicians.</LD>
<LD>   Ten agents from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. attorney's
office and the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency
overseeing Medicare, spent six hours at Alvarado Hospital Medical
Center. They carted off boxes of documents and computer records about
how physicians were recruited, compensated and paid for relocation, a
hospital source said.</LD>
<LD>   The raid was another blow to the nation's second-largest hospital
chain. Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, has come under relentless
pressure in the last two months as one government agency after
another has launched probes into various aspects of its hospitals'
operations.</LD>
<TE>   After the raid, Tenet issued a statement that the company believes
the investigation does not involve patient care or issues involving
special Medicare payments.</TE>
<TE>   The company also requested that trading of its stock be halted.
Tenet's shares fell 11 cents Thursday to $17.04 on the New York Stock
Exchange before trading stopped.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second recent federal raid at a Tenet hospital. The
first, in late October at Redding Medical Center in Northern
California, involved 40 FBI and other federal agents and was sparked
by allegations that two doctors were performing unnecessary heart
surgeries. No charges have been filed in that probe.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also has been the target of a federal audit concerning its
sizable Medicare "outlier" payments made to help cover unusually
costly medical care. Since these revelations, Tenet's stock has lost
two-thirds of its value.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America Securities analyst Gary Taylor said it was
difficult to tell if the San Diego raid was an isolated incident or
the start of a systematic look at a number of Tenet hospitals. Tenet
operates 114 hospitals in 16 states.</TE>
<TE>   "You again come back to a management team that admitted to very
aggressive business practices," Taylor said. "So you can't preclude
the possibility that they may have done something wrong and that
there may be some liability here."</TE>
<TE>   One objective of Thursday's raid, according to the search warrant,
was to gather documents related to federal anti-kickback statutes
known as Stark laws.</TE>
<TE>   The laws make it illegal for a hospital to offer doctors payment
for referring patients whose care is funded by taxpayers. The aim is
to prevent hospitals from providing incentives to doctors to treat
more patients.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot offer financial inducements to get patient referrals,
" Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said. "We believe we are in full
compliance" with the laws.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said the search warrants were served at the offices, which
later were sealed off, of Alvarado Hospital Chief Executive Barry
Weinbaum and its director of business development, Mina Nazaryan.
Agents also sought admission and referral records involving 10
doctors who were named in the search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in San Diego had no comment on the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Thursday, Tenet CEO Jeffrey C. Barbakow said the
company is far from reaching an agreement with the Justice Department
over a long-standing dispute involving Medicare payments to its
hospitals from 1992 to 1998. Barbakow said Tenet may take the case to
court to resolve the matter.</TE>
<TE>   This case is not related to the recent federal investigation into
Tenet hospitals over Medicare outlier payments.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the nation's biggest for-profit hospital chain, HCA
Inc., agreed to pay the Justice Department $631 million to settle
allegations of health-care fraud. Whistle-blowers had accused HCA of
filing false claims for reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid and
paying kickbacks to doctors so they would refer patients to its
hospitals. HCA, which operates 180 hospitals, did not admit any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarado Hospital, a 311-bed facility near the University of San
Diego, is Tenet's only hospital in the city and specializes in
orthopedics and obesity care. In its fiscal year ended June 30, the
hospital had pretax net income of $34.1 million, according to state
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the company is getting kicked hard by a lot of
constituencies at this point," said David Peknay, a fixed-income
analyst Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>

<DL>SANTA FE SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>Vans Inc., which sells footwear geared to surfers and skateboarders,
reported a fiscal second-quarter loss Thursday but backed Wall
Street's estimates for the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported a net loss of $3.7 million, or 20 cents a
share, for the quarter, versus a profit of $513,000, or 3 cents a
share, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Net sales for the quarter were $60.6 million, compared with $68.3
million in the second quarter of last year.</LD>
<TE>   Total U.S. sales, including sales through Vans' U.S. retail
stores, were $42.2 million, versus $49.2 million for the same period
a year ago. Sales through the company's U.S. retail stores decreased
0.7% to $23 million from $23.1 million during the same period a year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Comparable-store sales for the quarter declined 9.3% versus the
same period last year. U.S. wholesale sales in the second quarter
were $19.2 million, versus $26.1 million a year ago. Total
international sales were $18.4 million, down 3.8% from $19.1 million
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that for the third quarter it expected sales of
$82 million to $85 million and that it remained comfortable with the
Thomson First Call consensus estimate of 3 cents a share for the
third quarter.</TE>

<HD>Jury Finds Wal-Mart Violated Overtime Laws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. managers in Oregon violated state and federal
wage laws by forcing employees of the world's largest retailer to
work unpaid hours to avoid overtime, an Oregon jury concluded
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A federal court jury in Portland found that the company engaged in
a pattern of prodding managers to hold down costs by using
off-the-clock work to ensure tasks were completed. More than 400
Oregon Wal-Mart employees are seeking damages as part of the
class-action lawsuit. Another jury will decide damages in a later
phase of the case.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart's pay practices have been criticized by unions and
advocacy groups, who picketed stores in 100 cities across the U.S.
last month, calling for improvements in wages, benefits and working
conditions. The United Food and Commercial Workers union is seeking
to organize Wal-Mart employees nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "The case is about managers learning how to put the pressure on
people to work off the clock to get the job done," James Piotrowski,
a lawyer representing Wal-Mart workers, told the eight jurors in
closing arguments last week.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart denied that the
chain's policies sanctioned off-the-clock work and said Oregon
employees were focusing on "isolated incidents."</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed in this verdict because we have a strong
policy against off-the-clock work, and we discipline managers under
that policy," said Bill Wertz, a company spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   A former Wal-Mart manager testified during the trial that she
routinely docked overtime hours from workers' paychecks at the
direction of her supervisors and pushed employees to work more than
40 hours a week without additional pay to finish assigned tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Thiebes, the former manager, recalled that if her
department missed performance goals, she'd be presented with a
trophy, shaped in the form of a donkey's hindquarters, to mark her
failure.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of pressure on managers, coupled with a crushing
workload, was part of a planned effort by Wal-Mart to hold down labor
costs, Thiebes said. When she complained to supervisors about it, she
was ignored, she said.</TE>

<HD>Court Puts a Cork in Wine Labeling Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court has ruled that a handful of wine brands can
still use "Napa" on their label, even if no grapes in the bottle come
from the prestigious wine-growing valley.</LD>
<LD>   The decision allows Ceres-based Bronco Wine Co., a producer of
inexpensive wines made from grapes grown in Stanislaus County and
elsewhere, to continue to sell its Napa Ridge, Rutherford Vintners
and Napa Creek brands, as long as it puts the source of the grapes
somewhere on the label.</LD>
<LD>   The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento on Wednesday voided
a state law, saying it could not interfere with federal regulation of
brand names.</LD>
<TE>   Napa Valley winemakers had been fighting Bronco's "Napa" labels
for years, claiming they deceive consumers and sully the region's
vaunted reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Bronco, which grosses about $17 million annually from these wines,
argued that federal regulators had approved the labels, preempting
state legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Only brands that have been in use since July 7, 1986, when a
federal "grandfather" clause took effect -- can use "Napa" and
related names as part of their brands, the court found.</TE>
<TE>   Bronco acquired its Napa brands in the 1990s, hoping to trade on
the cachet of the area without having to pay Napa-grown grape prices.</TE>

<DL>STELLENBOSCH, South Africa</DL>
<LD>South Africa's ruling African National Congress put AIDS at the top

efforts to build the nation.</LD>
<LD>   In a policy shift after what critics say has been years of
neglect, the ANC said it was readying a comprehensive plan to take on
the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The ANC's move follows mounting international criticism of South
Africa's official response to AIDS. Almost 5 million people, or one
in nine, in the country are infected with HIV, the virus that causes
the disease.</LD>
<TE>   President Thabo Mbeki was sharply criticized after he publicly
questioned the scientific link between HIV and AIDS.</TE>

<DL>OUDONG, Cambodia</DL>
<LD>Robed monks and hundreds of thousands of worshippers made a
procession through the countryside Thursday to transfer the fabled
remains of Buddha from a noisy neighborhood in the capital, Phnom
Penh, to a new, $4.5-million shrine.</LD>
<LD>   A golden urn containing ashes, bones and teeth was carried in a
float decorated as a giant legendary golden bird to the dome-shaped
shrine, or stupa, on a hilltop in Oudong, 30 miles north of the
capital. The town was Cambodia's capital from the 17th to the 19th
century.</LD>
<LD>   King Norodom Sihanouk then carried the urn up the 425 steps to the
shrine to place the relics in their new home.</LD>
<TE>   He said in a speech that the site was chosen on the advice of
astrologers, who have determined that it possesses "good luck
character."</TE>
<TE>   Monks chanted blessings, and worshippers held incense sticks and
lotus flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials estimated that nearly 1 million of Cambodia's 11
million people joined the procession. About 95% of Cambodians are
Buddhists.</TE>
<TE>   The route to Oudong was so clogged that many people had to abandon
the main road to walk across rice paddies.</TE>
<TE>   The procession was the culmination of a weeklong prayer session at
the site where the remains had been kept since 1957, when they
arrived from Sri Lanka.</TE>

<HD>Iraq's Report Falls Short, Inspectors Say</HD>
<DH>Arms declaration fails to prove Baghdad lacks weapons of
mass destruction, U.N. experts state. U.S. calls it a new 'material
breach.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraq has failed to prove that it has no weapons of mass destruction,
the chief U.N. inspector said Thursday, pointing out that Baghdad's
12,000-page arms declaration made no attempt to account for suspect
materials that inspectors believe the country may still possess.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials went a step further, calling the omissions "another
material breach" but stopping short of declaring the flawed
declaration a trigger for war. Instead, U.S. officials consider
Baghdad in effect on probation until the inspectors' next assessment
of Iraq's cooperation Jan. 27.</LD>
<LD>   The report's "pattern of systematic holes and gaps" violated the
terms of the U.N. resolution on disarming Iraq, putting Baghdad just
one misstep away from military action, U.S. Ambassador John D.
Negroponte said after inspectors Hans Blix and Mohammed Baradei met
with the Security Council on Thursday morning.</LD>
<TE>   "These are material omissions that, in our view, constitute
another material breach," Negroponte said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell echoed the warning in
Washington. "We are disappointed, but we are not deceived," he said
at a later news conference. "We have seen this game again and again
-- an attempt to sow confusion and buy time, hoping the world will
lose interest. This time, the game is not working."</TE>
<TE>   Although the White House said this week that the declaration was
supposed to be Iraq's "final chance" to come clean about its weapons
inventory, Powell indicated that Iraq could still fill in the
declaration's gaps before the final deadline Jan. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The extra time would also allow inspectors in Iraq an opportunity
to ferret out any hidden materials with the help of more
international intelligence -- and gives the United States some
breathing room to build a politically important consensus on the
Security Council to launch military action if necessary. By February,
coalition troops would be in position.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Powell said the international community's
strategy must proceed on several fronts to ensure that Baghdad begins
to comply. First, the United States and its Security Council partners
should continue to analyze the Iraqi declaration to determine the
extent of any deceptions and to find other ways to "compel
compliance," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden remains on Iraq -- not on the United Nations, not on
the United States," he warned.</TE>
<TE>   High priority would then be given to interviews with Iraqi
scientists and other "witnesses" outside Iraq, where Powell said they
could speak freely. Baghdad, he stressed, is obligated to make these
witnesses available. U.S. officials acknowledge that access to
scientists, engineers and other technicians has become the pivotal
element in revealing where weapons material might be hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats at the U.N. say they anticipate that Iraq will fail to
provide access to people on the list, providing a clear act of
noncompliance with the resolution that the council could agree on as
a trigger for military action. "If the omissions in the declaration
are the first nail in the coffin, that will be the second," said a
diplomat on the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the U.N. inspections process would be intensified, with
data, intelligence and "every possible assistance" provided by all
Security Council members, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Thursday that London
already has passed on key information to the inspectors and will
continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them now to get down to hard questioning and robust
inspections," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq must provide full cooperation with inspectors, "not just on
process, on access and opening doors but proactive cooperation on
substance," Greenstock said. "That will be the test."</TE>
<TE>   After insisting for days that Washington "knows" that Iraq is
still pursuing a deadly weapons program, the U.S. is now prepared to
share more targeted intelligence with inspectors to help prove it,
Powell added.</TE>
<TE>   Many council members said they would like the U.S. to share their
evidence with them as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been hearing allegations that Iraq does continue its
[weapons of mass destruction] programs," Russian Ambassador Sergei V.
Lavrov said. "We have heard it many times, but we never saw any
evidence that this is the case.... To say that 'we know but we
wouldn't tell you' is not something which is persuasive, frankly
speaking. It's not a poker game, when you hold your cards and call
others' bluff."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials later said they are unlikely to release their
intelligence to the Security Council at large and will even be
guarded in how and what to provide the U.N. inspectors, for fear that
Iraq might gain access to preempt or undermine the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The extra month will also permit the U.S. to get troops into
position for an anticipated February invasion.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 U.S. troops are already deployed in the Persian
Gulf region, Pentagon officials said, and as many as 50,000 more may
be readied for duty in the Gulf in early January.</TE>
<TE>   But war is not inevitable, insist Security Council members such as
France, who led the way to build guarantees into Resolution 1441 to
prevent a hair-trigger attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   According to the resolution, omissions in the declaration alone
cannot trigger war but instead must be combined with other acts of
noncooperation. "Lies alone are not enough for war," a U.N. diplomat
said. "They have to lie and cheat to bring on the bombs."</TE>
<TE>   But that means that Iraq must step very carefully from now on,
said Baradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of Iraq's patchy record of cooperation, they need to have
100% cooperation to exonerate themselves," Baradei said. "They need
to come forward with evidence that Iraq has been disarmed."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has already shown that there is more information to hand
over. After Baghdad submitted the inventory to U.N. officials Dec. 7,
Iraqi officials discovered a report detailing chemical munitions that
directly contradicted other declarations of its chemical weapons
holdings and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The document is known as the "Air Force" report because an
inspector seized it during a visit to Iraq's air force headquarters
in 1998. An Iraqi official grabbed it out of her hands, and a
standoff ensued. The inspector was able to make notes of its contents
but not a copy, and ultimately had to return it to the air force
officials, who agreed to put it in a safe sealed by the inspectors
for later examination. The inspectors didn't see it again until this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi authorities, however, insist that they have provided
everything that was required. Iraq's deputy U.N. ambassador, Mohammed
Salmane, dismissed as "baseless" the charges that Baghdad failed to
prove that it no longer has weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to confirm that the Iraqi declaration is complete
and comprehensive," he said, adding that it can be verified on the
ground by U.N. inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said earlier Thursday
that his country has no weapons of mass destruction and that the
United States is looking for an excuse to invade.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq had no arms of mass destruction. I think the United States
is well placed to know this in the first place, but the United States
is looking for a pretext for an attack," he told French RFI radio
through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "Every people and every nation," he said, "has the right to defend
itself through all possible means."</TE>

<HD>Census Shows Catholics' Rise in N. Ireland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>Census figures, seen as a key indicator of how long British rule of
Northern Ireland will last, showed Thursday that Roman Catholics are
closing the population gap on Protestants.</LD>
<LD>   Britain is committed to letting the province decide its own
future. When Catholics finally outnumber Protestants -- as the trend
suggests will happen -- they are widely expected to vote to reunite
with southern neighbor Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   But although the proportion of Catholics is higher than at any
time in the 81-year history of the province, the statistics suggest
there is unlikely to be a majority for constitutional change for some
decades to come.</LD>
<TE>   Northern Ireland's political landscape is defined by the fact that
Protestants, who largely want to remain under British rule, outnumber
Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   The latest headline figures put the Protestant population down
nearly 5 percentage points from a decade earlier, at 53.1%, and the
Catholic population up almost 2 percentage points, at 43.8% of the
total population of 1.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Osborne, professor of policy studies at the University of
Ulster, said poll evidence suggested that while only a tiny
proportion of Protestants would vote for a united Ireland, a
significant minority of Catholics back the status quo.</TE>

<HD>S. Korea Votes to Keep Sun Shining on North</HD>
<DH>President-elect Roh Moo Hyun supports dialogue with regime
in Pyongyang, unlike U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- Propelled by the post-Cold War generation, South Koreans on
Thursday elected as their next president a maverick lawyer who wants
to remain engaged with North Korea -- and who is likely to declare a
measure of independence from the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Roh Moo Hyun, who at 56 is young by the standards of Korean
politics and a relative newcomer to the political scene, beat
conservative opposition leader Lee Hoi Chang by 48.9% to 46.6%. He'll
succeed his political idol, President Kim Dae Jung, on Feb. 25.</LD>
<LD>   Roh's victory could augur a strained relationship between the
United States and South Korea, traditionally one of America's most
steadfast allies. Amid a wave of anti-American protests across the
country, the president-elect has made cautiously critical comments
throughout the campaign about the Bush administration's position on
not only North Korea but also Iraq and Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   In his first speech as president-elect, Roh said this morning that
he would work closely with the U.S. to "resolve peacefully the
problem related to North Korea's nuclear development," while hinting
that there could be adjustments in the historic alliance. He also
said he would seek changes in the Status of Forces agreement on the
37,000 U.S. troops in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional friendship and alliance between the Republic of
Korea and the United States must mature and advance in the 21st
century," Roh said in a speech at the National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Although Roh led the polls in the weeks preceding the election,
his victory was seen as an upset. Just hours before the voting booths
opened, his most important backer, World Cup organizer Chung Mong
Jun, abruptly yanked his support over a perceived anti-American
remark by Roh.</TE>
<TE>   Voter turnout of about 70% was the lowest in South Korea's
history, a phenomenon attributed to confusion over Chung's
last-minute move.</TE>
<TE>   Exit polls showed that voters in their 20s preferred Roh by a
margin of nearly 2 to 1, while those in their 60s chose the
67-year-old Lee by the same margin.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a new generation that wants to get out of the old, Cold
War style of politics," said Yum Dong Yeon, a strategist for the Roh
campaign who was watching the election results with satisfaction
Thursday night at campaign headquarters in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The election results were a vindication for President Kim and his
Nobel Prize-winning "sunshine policy" of engagement with North Korea,
which has been under attack by hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who narrowly lost the 1997 election to Kim, has spent much of
the last five years accusing his rival of appeasing North Korea. This
morning, he apologized to supporters for the loss and announced that
he is retiring from the leadership of the opposition Grand National
Party and from politics.</TE>
<TE>   Despite North Korea's declared intention to unfreeze its nuclear
program, Roh promises not to suspend financial aid or economic
exchange programs, instead using gentle persuasion to get the North
to renounce its nuclear ambitions. That position puts Roh starkly in
opposition to the Bush administration's demand that there be no
"business as usual" with North Korea until it complies.</TE>
<TE>   Roh, who has barely traveled outside South Korea, has never been
to the U.S. The White House is expected to invite him for a visit
before he is sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush released a statement of congratulations to Roh on
Thursday and was expected to call him today to extend his personal
regards. A spokesman insisted that Bush had not called Thursday
purely for timing reasons that in no way reflected any lack of
enthusiasm for Roh.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of South Korea have once again demonstrated the
enduring vitality and dynamism of democracy in their country," White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said. "South Korea is a close
friend and ally of the United States, and the president looks forward
to working closely with President-elect Roh as the United States and
the Republic of Korea address the many challenges and opportunities
that we face together."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, Seoul representative of the Asia Foundation, said he
believes that Roh will eventually be able to make an accommodation
with the Bush administration over North Korea, much as President Kim
has done.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an overall structural environment which dictates a need
to maintain a relationship with the United States," Snyder said. "Roh
campaigned to the center, and he will end up having to govern to the
center as well."</TE>
<TE>   Yoo Jay Kun, an assemblyman and Roh advisor, said that Roh's
so-called political radicalism has been exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "Roh is not anti-American," Yoo said. "He wants to maintain good
relations with America.... He wants to work with America as an equal
partner for the common good."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential campaign has been shadowed by rapidly unraveling
relations between the United States and North Korea and a burst of
anti-American protests in South Korea. Young South Koreans with few
memories of the Cold War and only history-book knowledge of the
1950-53 Korean War increasingly question the role of the U.S. troops
stationed in the country -- and, whether deliberately or not, the Roh
campaign managed to ride the wave of these strong feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush regards Korea as a U.S. colony, and he wants to do things
his own way. That's why he is being so hard on North Korea," said Kim
Hyong Jin, 26, an office worker who was watching election results on
a large-screen television in downtown Seoul. "I agree with Roh Moo
Hyun, that you have to keep talking to North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Besides North Korea, many voters said, they were swayed by Roh's
promises to reform the political system to reduce cronyism and bring
in fresh faces. Although Roh ran on the ticket of the ruling
Millennium Democratic Party, he created an image for himself as an
outsider. And he managed to depict Lee, a former prime minister, as a
representative of politics as usual.</TE>
<TE>   "Roh Moo Hyun is seen as an engine of change. He is seen like Bill
Clinton back in 1992, younger and more independent than the rest of
them," said Hahm Sung Deuk, a political scientist at Korea
University.</TE>
<TE>   A self-educated lawyer, Roh grew up near the port city of Pusan.
Almost entirely unknown outside South Korea, he gained some
prominence in the 1980s representing radical students and workers in
the struggles against the military dictatorship that ruled South
Korea at the time. He later joined the opposition camp as an
assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   Roh burst upon the national political scene so quickly this year
that the phenomenon was dubbed by the press as the roh poong, or "Roh
tempest." He beat a better-known rival in party primaries to become
the ruling party presidential candidate. After initially leading Lee
in the polls by more than 20%, Roh's candidacy flagged over the
summer and the party nearly forced him out of the race on the grounds
that he wasn't electable.</TE>
<TE>   At that time Chung, a Hyundai conglomerate heir riding a wave of
popularity from the World Cup soccer tournament, jumped into the
political arena. When it became clear that Chung and Roh would merely
split the liberal vote and give the election to Lee, they struck a
deal: Chung dropped out and agreed to campaign for Roh.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances behind Chung's stunning announcement Wednesday
night -- less than eight hours before the polls opened -- remained
something of a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Chung attributed his decision to a remark Roh made at a rally
saying that "we must have a dialogue with the North and with the
United States ... [to] make sure that the North Korean-U.S. dispute
does not escalate into a war."</TE>
<TE>   The comment, Chung said through a spokeswoman, was offensive
because it suggested that the United States was planning to start a
war. Some Roh supporters believe that Chung, in fact, was angered
over comments Roh made praising other politicians as potential
presidential candidates in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Chung's eleventh-hour departure so angered voters, it
may have actually helped Roh.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to me like a dirty trick, as though somebody was behind
it," said Lee Myong Hoon, 29, a taxi driver who switched his vote at
the last minute from a third-party labor candidate to Roh.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Girl Is 3rd Gaza Youngster Killed in 3 Days</HD>
<DH>The source of gunfire that struck 11-year-old is unclear.
In the West Bank, Israeli troops dismantled settlers' illegal
outpost.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An 11-year-old Palestinian girl was fatally shot as she opened her
bedroom window Thursday, her family said. She is the third youngster
to be killed in as many days in the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives of the girl, Nada Mahdi, said she had just returned from
school to her home in the Rafah refugee camp and opened the window to
watch the funeral procession of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy who was
killed by gunfire the previous day.</LD>
<LD>   A stray bullet struck her in the chest, and she died half an hour
later at Rafah hospital, according to hospital officials.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether the fatal shot was fired by
Palestinian gunmen or Israeli soldiers. Her family said the bullet
came from the direction of an Israeli army observation post about a
quarter-mile away.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it had exchanged fire about that time with
Palestinian gunmen hiding in an abandoned building, according to
spokeswoman Capt. Sharon Feingold, who said she had no information
about the girl's death.</TE>
<TE>   Rafah, which lies close to the Egyptian border at the southern tip
of Gaza, has been the scene of daily gun battles between Israelis and
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says the border zone is a stronghold of Palestinian
militant groups who use a network of underground tunnels to smuggle
weapons into Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The area close to the frontier, in particular the Rafah refugee
camp, is very densely populated, and Palestinian civilians often find
themselves caught up in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The slain girl's family lives on a street that is laid out like
most others in the camp -- a tight-packed jumble of cement-block
houses sharing common walls and courtyards, with only an occasional
narrow alleyway running between them. Her family said gunfire echoes
through their neighborhood at all hours of the day and night.</TE>
<TE>   Feingold, the Israeli army spokeswoman, blamed Palestinian gunmen
for using the refugee camp and its environs as a staging ground for
attacks. She said that in the 48 hours before the girl's death, there
had been 16 separate shooting incidents in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a constant battle zone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides gave conflicting versions of the deaths of two
teenage boys in the two preceding days.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen-year-old Alaa Sdoodi was shot and killed on a street in
Rafah on Wednesday. The army said its troops were under attack and
that a soldier was wounded in the exchange.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in central Gaza,
16-year-old Jawad Zidan was fatally shot. His family said he was
sleeping inside his home at the time; the army described him as a
gunman.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli troops moved in before
dawn to evict Jewish settlers who had set up an illegal outpost at
the spot where 12 Israeli soldiers and settlement security men were
killed last month in a Palestinian ambush. Three of the Palestinian
attackers were killed.</TE>
<TE>   With rain pouring down, scuffles broke out in ankle-deep mud as
soldiers removed the shipping containers the settlers had set up at
the foot of a slope. Settlers, some chanting prayers, clung to the
containers' metal handles as they were dragged away.</TE>
<TE>   Seven settlers were arrested and several soldiers suffered minor
injuries, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlers vowed to re-erect the outpost, which they had named
"Heroes of Hebron" after the dead of last month's ambush on a pathway
leading from the settlement of Kiryat Arba, just outside town, to the
Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine sacred to both Jews and Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live among 130,000
Palestinians, is a frequent flashpoint for violence. Two Israeli
soldiers, one of them female, were killed by Palestinian gunmen last
week near the Tomb of the Patriarchs, revered as the burial place of
the biblical Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has promised to
widen the roadway leading from Kiryat Arba to the tomb, and the army
wants to demolish 15 Palestinian homes along the route to do so.
However, Israel's Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the
demolitions.</TE>

<HD>Marxists, Management Unite to Oppose Chavez</HD>
<DH>A motley group of Venezuelans joins forces with a single
goal -- the ouster of the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>One is the son of a tailor. The second an unemployed oil executive. A
third is the country's largest cement distributor.</LD>
<LD>   Then there are the 90 other people swirling around in the mix.</LD>
<LD>   This is Venezuela's opposition, an array of personalities and
organizations, from hard-core communists to homemakers to political
bosses. They are united only by their desire to oust President Hugo
Chavez.</LD>
<TE>   "Chavez is our enemy," said Jesus Hermoso, a 28-year-old student
leader of Red Flag, a Marxist party that participates in the movement
to oust the left-leaning president because he is not revolutionary
enough. "If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be together."</TE>
<TE>   It's a strange thing, running a fractious political movement based
on hating one guy, but it's worked -- so far.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two weeks of a national strike, the opposition has
presented a solid front against Chavez, whom it accuses of conspiring
to turn the United States' third-largest oil supplier into a
communist redoubt like Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Despite more intrigue than a "Survivor" episode, the opposition
has avoided fracturing amid growing pressures to call off the strike,
which has paralyzed the oil economy, polarized the country and ruined
the Christmas season.</TE>
<TE>   Though there were signs of worry -- one strike leader said in an
interview that he would drop the president's resignation as a
condition to lift the strike -- opposition leaders said they remain
firm.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no force that can fracture us," said Carlos Ortega, one
of the most powerful opposition members, in an interview. "We have
put the country's interests above our personal ones."</TE>
<TE>   Ortega is one of the four primary players in the protest. A gruff
and scowling union boss, the son of a tailor rose to become a pipe
welder at an oil refinery, then to head the nation's largest union,
the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Carlos Fernandez, the suave, white-haired cement
manufacturer whose father ran an orange farm after his family fled
Spain's bloody civil war. Fernandez, never before a political
activist, found himself the head of Fedecamaras, the nation's largest
business group, after the organization's then-president, Pedro
Carmona, was arrested in April. Carmona briefly took office as
appointed president in a coup. Two days later, Chavez was returned to
power by loyal military units.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega and Fernandez are part of an umbrella coalition, the
Democratic Coordinating Committee, which has 34 groups -- mostly
political parties and influential nonprofits -- that gather for
weekly meetings. There are an additional 60 or so affiliated
organizations that participate in monthly assemblies.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members have refused to concentrate power in a single
leader, insisting that everyone has a voice -- from small splinter
groups like Red Flag to mainstream political parties. The group has
no president, only an executive committee whose sole function is to
schedule meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Members say they do this to avoid falling into the trap of Chavez,
whom they accuse of building a personality cult to help control the
country. The lack of a single voice results, they say, in meetings
that are not exactly harmonious but which usually end in
near-consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "In a marriage where there are only two people there are
quarrels," said Antonio Ledezma, the president of the Alliance of
Brave People, a political party that draws its name from Venezuela's
national anthem. "You can imagine what it's like when there's a
polyphony of voices."</TE>
<TE>   The newest heavyweight is Juan Fernandez, who in recent days has
begun to appear with Ortega and Carlos Fernandez at nightly news
conferences -- transmitted live nationwide -- where the three assess
the day's events.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Fernandez, whose family also fled the Spanish Civil War, was
fired from his post as the director of financial planning for the
state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, after he took
the lead in organizing oil workers to join the strike that began Dec.
2.</TE>
<TE>   Though newly arrived, Fernandez has clearly become one of the most
important players in the sprawling opposition because the oil
industry is the most important part of the strike. Petrodollars
account for half the government's $20-billion annual budget and most
of its foreign currency. He does not rule out a run for political
office someday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our opinion is listened to and respected. These meetings can be
very tropical," he said, smiling. "But when we come in, everyone
quiets down."</TE>
<TE>   Although the opposition has so far remained united, it is
uncertain for how much longer.</TE>
<TE>   It began this month's strike by seeking a referendum in February
on Chavez's rule. But as the strike progressed, the cost of a
solution soared. National guard troops cleared a peaceful
demonstration with tear gas. Three protesters were shot by a gunman,
an event that spawned any number of conspiracy theories.</TE>
<TE>   At the start, opponents demanded that Chavez resign and hold
elections within the first three months of next year. They seemed
confident that the punishing oil strike would soon fell the
president.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez fought back, mustering enough workers to ship at least
some oil to the United States and threatening to spend the country's
ample foreign reserves to buy food, supplies and gas from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition protests have remained large, with hundreds of
thousands attending a weekend march and another big march planned
later this week. Strike leaders predicted gas shortages, which could
force the government to offer concessions at the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   And opponents refuse to rule out marching on the presidential
palace -- a clear provocation since a similar march in April led to
the deaths of 19 people and the military coup.</TE>
<TE>   But there were also setbacks for the opposition this week. The
White House on Monday backtracked on supporting the opposition's
demand for early elections, calling instead for a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of American States recognized the opposition but
also declined to back its demand for speeded-up elections.</TE>
<TE>   Many store owners in the wealthy eastern end of Caracas, the
capital, have reopened their doors in recent days. And there was also
increasing pressure to find a way out.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Fernandez's organization has been hit hardest by the
protest as small and medium businesses have continued paying workers
while forgoing Christmas sales. He said the strike could be lifted as
long as Chavez guaranteed funding to pay for a February referendum
and pledged to avoid reprisals against striking oil workers.</TE>
<TE>   The position was a step back from the hard line taken by
Fedecamaras in recent talks, where it has demanded Chavez's
resignation and new elections.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a position we have that could be negotiated," Fernandez
said in an interview. "The most important thing is to avoid a
situation of violence."</TE>

<HD>Bali Bombers Said Part of Earlier Plot</HD>
<DH>In statement to officials in Singapore, a suspect says
Christian priests in Indonesia were targeted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Two confessed organizers of an Oct. 12
terrorist bombing in Bali targeted Christian priests for
assassination last year in a plan directed by alleged Jemaah Islamiah
leader Abu Bakar Bashir, according to a statement by a captured
operative.</LD>
<LD>   The two admitted Bali bombers, who use the names Mukhlas and Imam
Samudra, also participated with Bashir in efforts to establish a
six-nation terror network extending from Indonesia to Myanmar,
according to a confidential Nov. 1 document summarizing the
confession of Faiz bin Abu Bakar Bafana.</LD>
<LD>   Bafana's statement to authorities in Singapore, which was reviewed
by The Times, depicts Jemaah Islamiah as a highly organized militant
group that is committed to the formation of an Islamic nation in
Southeast Asia and has numerous plans for terrorist actions.</LD>
<TE>   Bafana also alleged that Bashir has been associated for years with
the two bombers and discussed specific plans for violence that
involved them.</TE>
<TE>   A Malaysian leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Bafana was arrested in
Singapore last year after authorities uncovered the group's alleged
plan to attack the U.S. Embassy and six other targets there with
suicide truck bombers. Earlier, Bafana helped organize bombings in
Manila, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore authorities have declined to reveal all the targets of
the planned attack there, but another confidential document reviewed
by The Times says the group's hit list included the U.S. naval
shipyard, the Bank of America headquarters and the American Club, a
popular hangout for expatriate Americans in the center of Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police arrested Bashir in October, alleging that he
played a role in a series of deadly church bombings on Christmas Eve
2000, a plot to assassinate President Megawati Sukarnoputri and the
bombing of Indonesia's national Istiqlal mosque in Jakarta, the
capital. He has not been charged in connection with the Bali bombing,
which killed at least 191 people on the popular tourist island.</TE>
<TE>   The radical 64-year-old cleric denies any role in terrorist
activity and contends that Jemaah Islamiah does not exist. But he
praises Osama bin Laden and says Muslims have a duty to defend Islam
if it is under attack.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities apparently did not become aware of Jemaah
Islamiah's existence until last year, the clandestine organization
was established at least a decade ago to promote the formation of an
Islamic state from the territory of several Southeast Asian nations.</TE>
<TE>   It has been affiliated with the Al Qaeda terror network since the
early 1990s, when Jemaah Islamiah founder Abdullah Sungkar met Bin
Laden, according to the recent book "Inside Al Qaeda" by Rohan
Gunaratna.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Bashir has headed Jemaah Islamiah since the 1999
death of Sungkar, his close friend.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning in Singapore, Bafana told authorities that he
met with Bashir in the Indonesian city of Solo last year to discuss
terror plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Bashir asked Faiz [Bafana] to hatch a plan to assassinate
President Megawati and to carry out attacks on priests who would be
holding a meeting in [the city of] Manado," according to Bafana's
interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   His statement is consistent with the September confession of Omar
Faruq, an Al Qaeda operative arrested in Indonesia who told
authorities that Bashir was involved in plots to assassinate Megawati
and in the bombing of churches and the national mosque. At a meeting
in April 2001, Bashir warned Bafana to minimize any risk to
bystanders when targeting the Christian clerics, according to
Bafana's account.</TE>
<TE>   "Bashir instructed Faiz to continue their programs targeting
Christian priests with caution [and] hit their targets with accuracy
to avoid casualty from the civilians," the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Bafana said surveillance for the attacks on priests was conducted
by Samudra, whose real name is Abdul Aziz. Mukhlas, a top Jemaah
Islamiah leader whose name is Ali Gufron, directed him to pick up a
diskette from Samudra containing reports on the priests.</TE>
<TE>   According to their own confessions to Indonesian police, Mukhlas
oversaw the Bali bombing while Samudra served as the field
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether any of the planned attacks on priests were
carried out in 2001, but Jemaah Islamiah bombed the homes of four
pastors the year before during the church bombings that killed 18
people.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian intelligence officials say that key Jemaah Islamiah
members, including Mukhlas and Samudra, were among the radicals who
went to Afghanistan during the 1980s to fight the Soviet military or
during the 1990s to aid the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   One official said 272 Indonesian moujahedeen survived the fighting
and returned home. Today they make up an informal network known as
Group 272, or G272, and form the backbone of militant groups in
Indonesia. Many were trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and
belong to the international terror network as well as organizations
in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost among the Indonesian moujahedeen, authorities say, is
Riduan Isamuddin, better known as Hambali, a leading Al Qaeda member
who has served as Jemaah Islamiah's operations leader and is in
hiding. They say he helped set in motion the Bali attack, the
Singapore bomb plot, the Christmas Eve bombings in Indonesia and a
string of bombings in Manila that killed 22.</TE>
<TE>   Bafana said Hambali was present at the Istiqlal mosque when it was
bombed in 1999. The attack apparently was aimed at inciting religious
conflict between Muslims and Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Al Qaeda has dispatched a number of operatives to
Southeast Asia to aid in organizing terror activities. In September,
Indonesian authorities arrested suspected Al Qaeda member Seyam Reda,
an Arab with German citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect Reda gave money and orders to Faruq, the Al
Qaeda operative arrested in June. Earlier this year, Reda transferred
$74,000 to Aris Mundandar, one of Bashir's top lieutenants, according
to an Indonesian intelligence official. Mundandar has not been seen
since Reda's arrest, associates said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bafana's statement, Bashir convened three meetings in
Malaysia in 1999 and 2000 of extremist leaders in Southeast Asia to
form the Rabitatul Moujahedeen, or Moujahedeen League, in the hope of
coordinating terror activities in the region. Since 2000, there is no
indication that the group has been active.</TE>
<TE>   Bafana called the organization "the brainchild of Bashir and
Hambali," the statement said. The participants included Mukhlas,
Singapore Jemaah Islamiah leader Ibrahim bin Maidin, Indonesian
militant Agus Dwikarna and Malaysian extremist leader Nik Adli Nik
Abdul Azis. All four have been arrested on terror-related charges.</TE>
<TE>   The league's first meeting was held at a house Bafana owned in
Selangor, Malaysia. Samudra, who is known for his computer skills,
was present to help out but did not attend the leadership sessions,
Bafana said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bafana's statement, two top Al Qaeda leaders,
Mohammed Atef and Ayman Zawahiri, were sent to Indonesia by Bin Laden
in mid-2000 to find possible sites for the relocation of Al Qaeda
operations.</TE>
<TE>   They met various extremist leaders in Indonesia and may have
inspired Bashir and Hambali to have the Moujahedeen League issue a
decree calling for attacks in the Philippines, according to the
statement.</TE>

<HD>Slaying in Turkey Raises Fears of Political Violence</HD>
<DH>Academic's death fuels speculation of a bid to stir
tensions between secularists and Islamists.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Fears of resurgent political violence rocked
Turkey on Thursday as police investigated the slaying of a prominent
secularist academic in the capital, Ankara.</LD>
<LD>   Necip Hablemitoglu, a 48-year-old historian at Ankara University,
whose career was spent investigating the activities of Turkey's
shadowy Islamic brotherhoods, was fatally shot in the head outside
his home late Wednesday, just days after receiving anonymous death
threats.</LD>
<LD>   Police described the killing as "highly professional," saying
assassins had left neither footprints nor fingerprints at the scene.
There has been no claim of responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   President Ahmet Necdet Sezer called the shooting an "obvious
terrorist act" and a "politically motivated crime."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this is not the beginning of bad days to come," the
pro-secular president said.</TE>
<TE>   The mass-circulation daily newspaper Hurriyet speculated that the
slaying might have been aimed at igniting fresh tensions between
Islamists and secularists in this officially secular and
predominantly Muslim nation. It could also have been a bid to weaken
the ruling Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party, which won
power in Nov. 3 elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime that Turkey reaches stability there are those who want to
destroy peace through terror," Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said.</TE>
<TE>   Hablemitoglu is the latest victim of a string of attacks against
pro-secular public figures that shook Turkey throughout the 1990s.
Among those targeted were Ahmet Taner Kislali, a former culture
minister who was killed in a car bomb attack in 1999. Ugur Mumcu, one
of the country's best-known newspaper columnists and a fierce critic
of radical Islam, was killed by a car bomb six years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Hablemitoglu first came to prominence over his claims that an
influential and wealthy pro-Islamic fraternity, led by a fugitive
Islamic cleric, had infiltrated key state institutions, including the
rigidly pro-secular armed forces, with a secret agenda to introduce
Islamic rule.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed that the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who is now living in
the United States, had the backing of the CIA because of his moderate
brand of Islam. Gulen seeks to promote that vision in former Soviet
Central Asia, home to dozens of schools and universities set up and
run by his brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, tensions between Turkey's military-backed pro-secular
establishment and the government were poised to deepen after Sezer
vetoed a constitutional amendment Thursday that would have allowed
Justice and Development Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdogan to run
for parliament in a by-election and eventually become prime minister.
He was barred from running because of a conviction on charges of
seeking to incite religious hatred by reading an Islamist poem at a
rally.</TE>

<HD>High Court Rules Venezuelan Oil Strike Must End</HD>
<DH>Workers for the state petroleum company vow to ignore the
decision, saying it disregards their constitutional rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The Venezuelan Supreme Court on Thursday ordered striking oil
employees to restart the nation's paralyzed petroleum industry,
issuing a temporary injunction to prevent "irreparable" damage to the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   The court said it would next consider whether to order the workers
back permanently. It was unclear when a final decision would be
issued.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling "reaffirms the right of the national executive to
reestablish normality and protect the integrity of our principal
industry, petroleum, and of our country," said Rafael Ramirez, the
minister of mines and energy.</LD>
<TE>   But after huddling with lawyers, the striking workers for the
state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, announced that
they wouldn't obey the ruling, saying that it violated their
constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "What [this decision] has done is give us a new motive to defend
all of our rights -- democracy, peace and all Venezuelans' right to
liberty," said Juan Fernandez, leader of the striking oil workers.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was one of the most serious blows yet to opposition
leaders, who are demanding the resignation of controversial President
Hugo Chavez and elections within the first three months of next year.</TE>
<TE>   The strike, led by an opposition that includes dissident oil
workers, rival politicians, businesses and unions, has crippled
production in the United States' third-largest oil supplier.</TE>
<TE>   By refusing to recognize the ruling, the opposition runs the risk
of appearing hypocritical and losing moral force because it spent
much of the last week insisting that Chavez respect judicial orders.
On Wednesday, opposition leaders demanded that Chavez immediately
obey another Supreme Court ruling returning control of Caracas'
police force to the capital's mayor, a Chavez foe.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they have a similar reaction to this ruling," said William
Lara, the president of the National Assembly and a Chavez ally. "I
hope it's a positive, proactive and respectful reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Some opposition members said that because the ruling was based on
labor law, it wasn't applicable to a political strike seeking the
president's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition, which believes that the fiery leftist leader is
steering the country toward communism, argues that its strike is
based on a right to rebellion guaranteed in Venezuela's constitution,
rewritten in 1999. The constitution says Venezuelans "shall not
recognize any regime that infringes upon democratic rights."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court decision came on a day when gas shortages here
were becoming critical. For the first time since the strike began
Dec. 2, gas supplies in the capital were severely affected.</TE>
<TE>   Car lines stretched for blocks, backing up traffic and causing
havoc on major highways and streets. Many gas stations were shut, and
others were rationing gas to four gallons per person.</TE>
<TE>   Tension ran high as Venezuelans, used to buying some of the
cheapest gas in the world, suddenly faced a black market where prices
jumped 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I could sell a gallon for $4," said Nestor Betancourt, a
39-year-old tow-truck driver who was patrolling a congested highway
Thursday rescuing stranded motorists from long lines of traffic. "I
had to wait four hours just to fill up my tank."</TE>

<HD>Deal on Broker Scandal Expected</HD>
<DH>Sources say a pact with regulators includes more than $1
billion in fines over questionable recommendations by stock analysts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Government regulators are expected to announce today that they have
reached a long-awaited settlement with major Wall Street brokerages
that would require the firms to pay more than $1 billion to resolve
investigations of biased research by stock analysts, sources familiar
with the matter said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The pact, which seemed remote less than a week ago, came together
in the last few days as regulators pressured about half a dozen
holdout firms to sign on to the accord before Christmas. Among its
noteworthy provisions, the deal calls for some money to be paid to
aggrieved investors but would not subject Wall Street executives to
individual civil charges, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement follows a year of grueling investigations and
media leaks that shone an unflattering light on the practices of
securities firms in the late-1990s bull market.</LD>
<TE>   The probes uncovered incriminating e-mail messages written by
analysts, who admitted to harboring serious doubts about stocks they
were recommending to individual investors but churned out bullish
research reports anyway in hopes of winning lucrative corporate
financing business for their firms.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst controversy is the latest in a long list of Wall
Street scandals. What differentiated it from others, such as the
insider trading scams of the late 1980s, was its direct effect on
small investors. Individuals streamed into the market in the 1990s,
in part because of the upbeat pronouncements of analysts.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday night, 10 firms had given their assent to the
expected deal, one source said. Two smaller firms -- U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray and Thomas Weisel Partners -- had not signed on, but
negotiations were continuing, sources said. A Piper spokeswoman
declined to comment. A Weisel spokeswoman could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state regulators are expected to say they have reached
an agreement in principle with the brokerages and that they will draw
up formal documents early next month. Barring any last-minute snags,
the deal will be announced at a news conference at 1 p.m. EST at the
New York Stock Exchange, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the pact calls for Citigroup Inc., parent of Salomon
Smith Barney, to pay the largest fine, $300 million, and for Credit
Suisse First Boston to pay the second-biggest, at $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   The talks hit what appeared to be a serious snag last week when a
contingent of mid-tier firms -- including Lehman Bros. Holdings,
Deutsche Bank, UBS Warburg and Bear Stearns Cos. -- protested the
penalties asked of them. But the recalcitrant firms each agreed to
fines of $50 million under heavy prodding from officials at the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the NYSE and the New York
attorney general's office in the last two days, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;
Co. also would pay penalties of $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The pact calls for some of the money to be earmarked for investor
restitution. For example, at least half of Citigroup's $300-million
fine would go to an investor recovery fund. The details are not yet
worked out, but it is likely that several restitution funds would be
created, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the fines, the firms also would make additional
payments to fund the distribution of independent research to
investors. The firms would have to buy research done by independent
research boutiques and give it to their clients along with the firms'
in-house stock reports. The payments for research would be spread
over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms also would make payments to fund investor education
efforts, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. each would pay $75
million for independent research and $25 million for investor
education. Goldman Sachs would contribute $50 million for independent
research and $10 million for investor education.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley would pay $75 million and CSFB $50 million for
independent research but nothing for investor educa- tion. Deutsche,
Lehman, Bear Stearns, UBS and J.P. Morgan each would contribute $25
million for independent research and $5 million for investor
education.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also calls for stronger separation of the firms' research
and investment banking units.</TE>
<TE>   It would prohibit "spinning," the practice of awarding shares of
initial public stock offerings to corporate executives in return for
investment banking assignments, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The accord also calls for the creation of a public database that
would detail analysts' past stock picks for investors to study before
taking their advice, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the deal would not include charges against Wall Street
executives, sources said. Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney
general, said in a TV interview that executives would not be charged
individually.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement would not include the release of detailed
findings of fact specifying wrongdoing at each firm, sources said.
That probably would come later, after a final deal is signed.</TE>
<TE>   Private e-mails and other communications among analysts,
investment bankers and brokerage executives could be crucial to
private lawsuits seeking damages for individual investors.</TE>
<TE>   "You should arm the victims with the facts" of what was uncovered,
said Thomas Hargett, a plaintiffs' attorney with law firm Maddox,
Koeller, Hargett &amp; Caruso in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations were spearheaded by Spitzer, who was once
little-known even in his home state but gained national renown when
he reached a $100-million settlement with Merrill Lynch in May over
analyst conflicts of interest. (Merrill would not pay any additional
fines under the new agreement.)</TE>
<TE>   NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso and Stephen Cutler, SEC enforcement
chief, also played key roles in the probes.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, stock analysts personified the stock market's
stratospheric rise and later collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts such as Jack Grubman at Salomon Smith Barney and Mary
Meeker at Morgan Stanley became celebrities on CNBC and financial
shows on other TV networks.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' rising fame was accompanied by increasing doubts about
their integrity and allegiance to investors. For years, academic
studies and anecdotal evidence indicated that analysts favored the
stocks of companies that hired their firms for investment banking
work such as merger advice or securities issuance.</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns were largely ignored by the investing public and by
securities regulators until the stock bubble burst starting in early
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The harshest scrutiny came this year when Spitzer alleged that
Merrill analysts had privately disparaged stocks in e-mails --
labeling one stock "crap" and another "junk" -- despite touting them
publicly.</TE>

<HD>Talk Turns to Which Taxes to Hike</HD>
<DH>California levies on cars, incomes and purchases are the
most likely to see increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With Gov. Gray Davis leading a growing consensus that California
taxes are likely to increase next year, legislators and others are
contemplating an array of possible hikes, including boosts in sales
and income taxes, as well as taxes on movie tickets and higher fees
for passengers landing at airports.</LD>
<LD>   The need for tax increases was underscored Thursday when Standard
&amp; Poor's lowered California's credit rating from A-plus to A, a level
not seen since the recession a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   The change came a day after Davis projected the state's budget
deficit at $34.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "The low-hanging fruit has been lopped off and now serious cuts or
revenue increases will have to be considered," David Hitchcock of
Standard &amp; Poor's said, suggesting that a "fundamental rethinking" of
the state budget is needed. "The state can't print money, so there
will have to be some kind of long-term balance."</TE>
<TE>   While Davis and his aides continue working on the budget,
interviews and past proposals point to some of the most likely tax
hikes:</TE>
<TE>   * Car tax. Davis proposed raising it earlier this year and almost
certainly will again. Although Republicans managed to deflect the
earlier hike, Democrats believe they can legally open the way to
raise the car registration fee on a simple majority vote, rather than
the two-thirds needed for most tax hikes. That makes this increase
most likely.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst's office has estimated that raising the
fee would bring in $3.9 billion next year.</TE>
<TE>   * Income taxes. Some lawmakers and lobbyists are talking about
imposing at least some income taxes on people at lower and
middle-income levels. As it is, a typical California family earning
less than $50,000 pays little or no state income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, the Democrats who control Sacramento will embrace
higher taxes for people earning $150,000 or more. Though Republicans
could block this increase in the Legislature, proponents could place
it on a statewide ballot and let the voters decide.</TE>
<TE>   By imposing higher income taxes on wealthy Californians, the state
could raise $2.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, the
nonpartisan legislative analyst estimates. Treasurer Phil Angelides
endorses such an idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I would much rather see us raising taxes on the wealthiest
Californians rather than ripping textbooks out the hands of school
kids," Angelides said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * Sales taxes. Raising the state sales tax by a half percentage
point would generate about $2.5 billion annually, the legislative
analyst has said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans have been less opposed to sales tax hikes than in
the past. But if they remain solid in their opposition to all tax
increases, backers could place a sales tax increase before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers have suggested lowering the sales tax and extending
it to some services.</TE>
<TE>   Taxing amusement and recreation services, such as tickets to
movies, sporting events and such things as health club memberships,
would raise $475 million a year, the legislative analyst says.</TE>
<TE>   * Tobacco. Davis proposed raising the tax on cigarettes by 50
cents a pack in May, a step that would cost smokers $475 million next
year. He is now likely to seek a larger increase, given the size of
the budget gap. Assembly Democrats embraced a $3-a-pack increase
earlier this year, but that idea died amid Republican opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's method of financing public schools, more than
half of any general tax hike up to $5 billion would go to schools,
according to the legislative analyst's office.</TE>
<TE>   To get around that, the Legislature could suspend the law
governing school financing -- unlikely, given the influence of the
public school lobby. It also could forgo general tax hikes and
instead raise fees aimed at paying for specific state costs.</TE>
<TE>   Several lobbyists have suggested a variety of fee and tax
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Leary, lobbyist for the California State Assn. of Counties,
noted that enforcing sales tax laws already on the books on Internet
purchases could add $200 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion to
state coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Counties also is proposing a "tax" on lottery
winnings. Under that idea, lottery players could pay an extra dime as
"insurance" against having to pay taxes on any winnings. Such a step
would require voter approval. Leary also suggested new fees on rental
cars and on airport landings to help defray the cost of heightened
security.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at a $34.8-billion hole," Leary said. "You can't
solve it by cuts alone."</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's decision to lower the rating on California's
voter-approved general obligation bonds will add to the state's cost
of borrowing money -- and California will be borrowing heavily as
officials work their way out of the budget quagmire.</TE>
<TE>   With the downgrade, California drops into a tie with Louisiana as
the state with the lowest credit rating, said S&amp;P's Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken harder hits," said Treasurer Angelides, who markets
the state's bonds. "California is the midst of a fiscal storm. I have
every faith that we will endure it, and we will be leading the nation
out of its morass."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans renewed their claim Thursday that by raising the
deficit estimate to $34.8 billion over the next 18 months, from the
earlier estimate of $21 billion, Davis has inflated the problem to
try to soften opposition to tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials dismiss the charge. Hitchcock also
said he saw no reason for the administration to overstate the depth
of the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the deficit estimate is inflated or not, the state faces a
major problem. And Davis' new finance director, former state Sen.
Steve Peace, is sure to be a central player in any tax discussion.</TE>
<TE>   As Senate Budget Committee chairman and a 20-year veteran of the
Legislature, Peace voted for several tax hikes and tax cuts. He has
pushed for cuts in capital gains taxes on small corporations and
voted for budgets that included deep cuts to the car tax, which
motorists pay when they register their vehicles each year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, Peace angered Republicans by arguing for a
bill that would have permitted the finance director to raise the car
tax without a vote of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats approved the measure over GOP objections, but it
stalled in the Assembly. It is likely to be revived early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Peace, who would not comment Thursday, in the past has advocated
raising property taxes on businesses, an idea embraced by some
Republicans, and has been a critic of tax loopholes, once holding a
hearing that looked into special tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   He also has urged that lawmakers retool the relationship between
state and local financing to make it more stable.</TE>

<HD>Air Travelers Urged to Unlock Bags, Opening Liability Issue</HD>
<DH>Critics wonder who'll pay for losses, damage once
inspectors can freely search luggage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The government on Thursday asked air travelers to leave
checked luggage unlocked for security screeners to inspect starting
Dec. 31, but the policy prompted an outcry after officials failed to
specify who would be liable for lost, damaged or stolen articles.</LD>
<LD>   With passengers checking about 1 billion pieces of luggage a year,
the new policy by the Transportation Security Administration to check
for hidden explosives is expected to entail opening millions of items
-- in many cases while the passenger is not present.</LD>
<LD>   "That leaves a lot to be desired from the standpoint of making
people feel comfortable," said Kevin Mitchell, president of the
Business Travel Coalition. "What happens if you have an expensive
camera and it's gone?"</LD>
<TE>   The requirement also will test how much privacy passengers are
willing to give up for security's sake.</TE>
<TE>   Airline liability for damage, loss or theft of luggage is clearly
spelled out in government regulations. But the security agency has no
set policy on how it will handle complaints of security-related
damage, which critics and travelers rights groups fear may be
widespread. Agency officials say they will deal with such problems
case by case.</TE>
<TE>   Although some airports will use X-ray machines to inspect luggage,
some of the bags will still have to be checked by hand.</TE>
<TE>   So screeners will not have to break locks, the agency is advising
travelers to secure their bags with cable ties, locking plastic
strips that are generally used to fasten wire bundles in computer and
stereo setups. The strips can be snipped off without damaging a bag.
Eventually, the security agency expects to offer them to travelers
for free.</TE>
<TE>   If screeners do have to open a bag, agency officials said they
will leave a note inside with a toll-free number to call if there is
a problem. The line will be staffed from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Pacific
time on weekdays and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Pacific time on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not sufficient," said Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the
Air Transport Assn., which represents major airlines. "What if they
closed [a bag] improperly and your belongings fell out? Who is
liable? How do you make a claim? What can you expect? The public
needs answers. The absence of consumer information is breathtaking."</TE>
<TE>   There will be consumer safeguards, said security agency spokesman
Brian Turmail: "If someone gets back a bag with something missing,
they can call our consumer-response center."</TE>
<TE>   However, passengers who persist in locking their bags run the risk
of having their locks cut off. The security agency "will not be
responsible for damage to locks," Turmail said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also urged travelers not to pack food or beverages in
checked luggage. Some foodstuffs may spill or smear as the bag is
searched. Others, such as cheese and chocolate, may trigger a false
alarm by explosives detection equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Photo film can be damaged by screening equipment and should be
kept in carry-on bags. Presents in checked baggage must be unwrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Turmail said the agency is working hard to get the word out to
passengers in the hope that luggage screening will go smoothly.
Additional information is available online at www.TSATravelTips.US.</TE>
<TE>   With millions of bags jostling around on conveyor belts and
jetting around the country each day, airline officials said problems
are inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Major airlines reported about 120,000 complaints of lost, damaged
or delayed bags in October, the latest month for which statistics are
available. That covers complaints just from loading and unloading
closed bags. Industry officials fear that passengers angry over
security mishandling of baggage will take it out on the airline, not
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Airlines that mishandle baggage typically have a customer-service
agent on the receiving end of the complaint, and a written claim is
taken on the spot," Wascom said. "Who's to say that anyone is doing
anything when you call an anonymous person at the end of an 800
number that isn't even manned 24 hours a day? More needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The closer inspections stem from a congressional mandate that all
checked bags be screened with explosives detection equipment by the
end of the year. The security administration will be using two types
of technology, and both require some bags to be opened.</TE>
<TE>   Some luggage will be screened by SUV-size machines akin to the
medical scanners used by hospitals. The airport version of the
scanners has a high false-alarm rate. In some cases, doubts can be
resolved only by opening the bag.</TE>
<TE>   The security agency will also employ devices that detect
explosives residue on a swab that is touched to the bag or its
contents. To guarantee a high success rate in detecting bombs with
this type of equipment, a substantial proportion of bags must be
opened.</TE>
<TE>   At airports where screening will take place in lobby areas, such
as LAX, many passengers will be able to watch as their bags are
opened.</TE>
<TE>   But at other airports, such as John Wayne Airport in Orange
County, the screening equipment has been built into the luggage
conveyor system. At these facilities, most passengers will not know
their bags have been opened until they arrive at their destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, most large and medium-size airports are expected to
adopt the more efficient behind-the-scenes model.</TE>
<TE>   David Stone, federal security director at LAX, said authorities
are exploring options for opening locked luggage that would not
require cutting locks off.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sensitive to that," Stone said at a news conference
Thursday. "Do we have some master keys? Do we know some combinations?
So we're working with the airline industry to find out the best way
to do that, the smart way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The government cannot indefinitely escape liability for luggage
damaged by security, lawyers said. Airlines are now liable for up to
$2,500 in damage per passenger on domestic flights. The regulations
governing airlines may become the basis for rules that apply to the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to have to develop a system for reimbursing
passengers for lost or stolen bags," said Barry Steinhardt, a lawyer
who follows security issues for the American Civil Liberties Union.
"Nothing has ever occurred on this scale before, where you have the
government searching a billion bags. So, law is going to be made
here."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Dean, a Washington aviation lawyer who formerly worked in
the Transportation Department, said the security administration
should have addressed the liability issue before instituting the new
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The government requires airlines to explain to passengers how
claims are going to be handled," Dean said. "The government should
also live by the same rules."</TE>

<TE>   Packing tips for air travelers</TE>
<TE>   Bags should be left unlocked so screeners won't have to force them
open to search them by hand. They can be secured with plastic cable
or "zip" ties, which cut off easily. The ties are available at
hardware stores.</TE>
<TE>   Put toothbrushes and other personal items in clear plastic bags so
screeners won't have to touch them.</TE>
<TE>   Leave gifts unwrapped. Screeners may unwrap those that aren't.</TE>
<TE>   Food items, such as cheese or chocolate, can be mistaken by
bomb-detection machines for explosives and register a "false
positive" reading. Screeners will hand-search bags that register a
positive reading.</TE>
<TE>   Shoes should be packed last to make it easier for screeners to
hand-search luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Do not put film in checked bags because screening equipment will
damage it.</TE>
<TE>   Put scissors, pocket knives and other sharp items in checked bags;
they are prohibited from being carried on planes.</TE>
<TE>   Books should be spread out rather than stacked.</TE>

<HD>This Ain't Rodeo</HD>
<DH>On breakaway circuit, it's all bull riding, all the time.
No barrel racing, 'no sissy events.' And the female fans are on hand
for 'just hanging out.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Rockets scream from the rafters, fireballs rise into the darkness and
tremendous explosions rattle the New Orleans Arena. Brent Vincent
sits on a railing wearing a bulletproof vest.</LD>
<LD>   He's paying no attention to the thunder and flames. The vest is
not to protect him from fireworks. He's watching a 2,000-pound bull
named High Tide smash its horned head into the corral below.</LD>
<LD>   Another bull about the same size left Vincent, 26, with a broken
ankle just two months before. Another one left him with a dislocated
shoulder, another with a separated shoulder, two others knocked him
unconscious and yet another gave him that scar beneath his blond
hair.</LD>
<TE>   Several other bulls, however, helped him earn $64,277 in prize
money last year, with sponsors paying him thousands more.</TE>
<TE>   "High Tide, he's a rank bull," Vincent says with a grin. "Rank."</TE>
<TE>   That means wild, nasty, hard to hang on to. A rank bull is
precisely what every cowboy hopes to draw when he competes in this
new, fast-growing quirk of an age-old sport.</TE>
<TE>   The sport is not rodeo. There's no calf-roping, no steer-wrestling
or barrel racing. There is not even broncobusting. "No sissy events,"
as one rider put it. The sport is bull riding, all bull riding, all
mayhem all the time.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as one rider is helped from the New Orleans Arena a short
time later, blood trickling from behind his ear after a bull gored
him in the head, the next bursts from the chute atop another bull,
only to be thrown in 4.3 seconds, head-butted and left in the dirt
clutching ribs that have been broken before and feel like they are
again.</TE>
<TE>   The rider picks up his hat and hurries out of the arena. Another
launches from a different chute.</TE>
<TE>   "Ride that bull!" the announcer cries.</TE>
<TE>   Six thousand fans howl. It will continue like this for 2 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, a small group of professional bull riders gathered
in Scottsdale, Ariz. They had the most dangerous job in the rodeo
business, lured the bulk of every crowd, but were not being fairly
paid, they felt.</TE>
<TE>   They decided to break away from the rodeo circuit, trade in its
country-fair feel for explosions, spotlights and sponsors, and see if
they couldn't drag bull riding into the present. Twenty riders put up
$1,000 apiece in seed money.</TE>
<TE>   The first season, 1994, consisted of eight events with $250,000 in
prize money from sponsors. An average of just 1.5 million watched
each of the events on cable television. No one expected the tour to
last.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, there are 29 events, most held in urban centers
from Anaheim to Baltimore, and $9.5 million up for grabs. Last season
the Professional Bull Riders tour, or PBR, drew 90 million cable
viewers, enough to prompt the networks to tap in. CBS, NBC and
Spanish-language Telemundo are all broadcasting events this season,
some slated to follow NFL games or NASCAR events.</TE>
<TE>   The first network broadcast in one market drew more viewers than
several other sports that weekend, including a PGA tournament, an NHL
match and a college basketball game. The market: New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, a new type of celebrity has emerged, niche stars
for certain, but ones whose fans know if they ride right-handed or
left, who know the names and bucking styles of the bulls, and how
their favorite rider scored last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Shivers rode Hammer, right?" said attorney and bull riding
fan Greg Balmer, who had watched on television at home in Chicago.
"Well, actually he didn't ride Hammer. Nobody has. That's a nasty
bull."</TE>
<TE>   With very few exceptions, the riders are young cowboys from tiny
towns who neither dreamed of nor sought celebrity. They grew up
hopping on, and getting bucked off, goats and calves around the farm,
graduating to steers, then big bulls.</TE>
<TE>   This year the top rider will earn more than $1 million, and tens
or even hundreds of thousands of dollars more from sponsors such as
U.S. Smokeless Tobacco, Ford trucks, Resistol hats. If you don't stay
on, though, you don't get paid, and many riders will spend more on
airfare and meals than they win.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone gets to watch himself on network television. Many are
semi-famous. To make a living having such giddy, dangerous fun is
more than most ever hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I ain't never had a job," says 20-year-old rookie Craig
Sasse of St. Peter, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I made $10,000 riding bulls when I was 14. Made about $67,000 in
the PBR. I never wanted to do anything else, but I thought I'd have
to. This is great."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent thinks so too. When he made a promotional appearance at a
Bourbon Street bar, the disc jockey announced that the first woman to
remove her top would receive his intimately placed autograph. The
tops flew. The next day the cowboy from Sulphur, La., was the star
attraction at a children's hospital. That night, at another watering
hole, he was clearly happy to be the center of attention again.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, ladies," he called as three women and a man strode in. He
ignored the man.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello," the women said in unison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The PBR has marketed itself carefully and tirelessly, and from the
beginning eschewed the "Happy Trails" nostalgia of rodeos in favor of
speed, noise, patriotism and dramatics. The big-screen TV overhead
plays a video showing U.S. soldiers at attention, then bull riders in
front of a flag, then more soldiers, then more riders.</TE>
<TE>   The rockets fired from the scaffolding have slammed into the dirt
arena, igniting crystallized chemicals. A massive "USA" sizzles in
the soil.</TE>
<TE>   The announcer introduces the riders. One by one, they step from a
cloud of artificial smoke wearing chaps that are pink and green,
bright yellow, in Vincent's case black and gold, and emerge into a
storm of swirling spotlights.</TE>
<TE>   High-volume music pumps from a giant sound system, and it isn't
country and western. It's all rock 'n' roll, heavy songs from AC/DC,
KISS, Van Halen.</TE>
<TE>   The riders return to the chutes. Vincent eyes the bulls, eyes the
crowd -- searching for pretty women, his friends say -- and wonders
if on-the-road roommate Wiley Petersen is going to make it. Petersen,
23, was delayed at airports trying to make his way from his home in
Fort Hall, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Cody Custer, who is part Choctaw Indian and occasionally meets
Native American children named after him, starts things off on a bull
called Hiawatha. When the buzzer sounds at eight seconds, he's still
on.</TE>
<TE>   With only minutes to go before his ride, Petersen arrives in a
cab. He suits up, sprinkles rosin on his bull rope and pulls his
gloved hand rapidly down the flat rope, melting the rosin and helping
glue the two together.</TE>
<TE>   He launches on Blackjack, but the bull is not in the mood, and all
but sits in the dirt. Petersen is awarded a ride on another bull.
This one, Pork Chop, bucks hard, spins left, right, then left again.
Petersen starts to slide precariously and Pork Chop just keeps
bucking and spinning. Finally the buzzer sounds. He's awarded a
respectable 86 points before he's sent flying.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the theater of modern professional bull riding, the
essential drama is what it has always been: a slightly schizophrenic
sport in which a man tries to hang on with one hand to a bucking bull
for eight seconds, even as he spurs the bull to make it buck harder.
During a long, successful career, a rider will spend only 10 or 15
minutes on the backs of bulls.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred points is a perfect score, with a possible 50 points
going to the bull and 50 to the rider. A meek bull, then, is a bad
bull. What every rider wants is to draw a nasty, angry but barely
ridable bull -- a rank bull.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its growth -- 2.6 million will watch the event the next
day on NBC -- the PBR does not generate enough money to give riders
contracts. Staying relatively free of serious injuries, then, is at
once crucial and difficult in a sport with this kind of conventional
wisdom: You'll get hurt on every ride, the question is how badly.</TE>
<TE>   Kevlar vests have become as essential as boots and spurs. Riders
with head or facial injuries trade their hats for a black helmet with
a full facemask. They look like hockey goalies.</TE>
<TE>   (After the event, five riders sat down to dinner. Custer had a
broken ankle that wasn't healing; two were awaiting knee surgery; two
had sore riding arms after surgery to reattach bicep muscles that had
torn loose at the elbow and curled up into small, hard balls.
"Nothing really bad," one said and all agreed.)</TE>
<TE>   Most events cover two days, each cowboy riding one bull the first
day, another the second, with the top 15 riding a third bull in the
finals. This, however, is a one-day event, and each rider goes just
once before the finalists are chosen to ride a second time.</TE>
<TE>   This is only the second event of the season, but Vincent hasn't
stayed on a bull yet. He needs this one, and grows nervous as he
lowers himself onto the back of High Tide. He forgets about the
lights and the women and his broken ankle, and wraps and re-wraps the
bull rope around his hand as High Tide bangs around in the chute.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the gate, the bull bucks twice and Vincent is off, lying in
the dirt. The New Orleans Open, for him, lasts 3.2 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In the finals, his buddy Petersen draws a bull called Mossy Oak
Mudslinger. Its name is Mudslinger; Mossy Oak is a manufacturer of
outdoor and hunting gear. Even the bulls have sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen rides the bull brilliantly, scoring a 93.5. He wins.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent has been here three days, making appearances at bars,
hospitals, a Knicks-Hornets NBA game. He's been paying for his hotel
room and his food, as well as the bill for the cell phone that seldom
stops ringing ("A girl I know."). His ride is over so quickly there's
nothing to remember. "I just fell off. Embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   Petersen, on the other hand, arrived half an hour after the event
began, worked for 16 seconds, and earned $29,055 -- more than he made
all last season.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent gives his pal a hug.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not competing against each other," he explains. "Your only
competition is the bull."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The wives, the girlfriends and "the girls" began to gather
backstage during the final round. They will have to wait a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Ever vigilant in promoting itself, the tour fines any rider $500
if he refuses to sign autographs after an event. Wanting to just go
home after his poor performance, Vincent nonetheless joins the others
as they make their way around the arena signing programs and straw
cowboy hats for hundreds, including a police officer, a rancher, a
homemaker, a 7-year-old named Trevor Clay.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor likes his autographs on his cowboy hat. When his first one
was covered in signatures his mom bought him another. It's covered
now too.</TE>
<TE>   When the lights finally go down and the crews come in to remove
the tons of dirt and reinstall the basketball court, Vincent heads
for the parking lot. He's spent a bunch of money, "fell off, just
plain fell off" his bull, and dropped to 32nd out of 45 in the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   About six times a year the tour kicks the five lowest-ranked
riders down to its minor-league Challenger Tour, and calls up that
tour's best five riders. Vincent knows he must have some good rides
at the next event, in Minneapolis on Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   He tosses his hat into his pickup and cracks a smile. Things
aren't so bad. He's off to visit a woman in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not my girl. I mean, we're just hanging out," Vincent says.
"But she's prettier than a supermodel."</TE>
<TE>   Petersen, who likes to say he's "riding for Jesus," and four other
staunchly Christian riders head for the heart of the Big Easy on a
Saturday night and find a bar that is still serving food. The place
is nearly empty and the waitress is delighted to see a bunch of men
in cowboy hats looking thirsty. Then everybody orders iced tea. The
waitress rolls her eyes. She doesn't make big tips on iced tea.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the riders hang around the arena and chat with the women.
Ross Coleman, 23 -- a tall, squared-jawed favorite of many female
fans -- talks to a couple of blond women in tight-fitting Wranglers.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have done roping, I could have ridden horses, I could
have done all that," he says. "But bull riding is the coolest."</TE>

<HD>Challenge Mounts to Lott's Job</HD>
<DH>Pressure grows as Sen. Frist of Tennessee, an ally of Bush,
offers to be the next majority leader. He wins immediate support.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican with close ties to the White
House, mounted a bid Thursday to topple Trent Lott as Senate majority
leader, the most serious blow yet to Lott's uphill effort to hold
onto the job.</LD>
<LD>   Frist said in a statement that he had been encouraged by GOP
colleagues to run for leader, and agreed to sound out others "to
determine the viability of such an effort."</LD>
<LD>   "If it is clear that a majority of the Republican caucus believes
a change in leadership would benefit the institution of the United
States Senate, I will likely step forward for that role," said Frist.</LD>
<TE>   Frist's statement steps up already intense pressure on Lott to
relinquish his leadership post. The Mississippian has been under fire
for comments he made two weeks ago suggesting sympathy for the 1948
presidential campaign of Strom Thurmond, who advocated segregation.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republican senators have said they believe the continuing
controversy has made it impossible for Lott to continue as an
effective leader. But Frist is the first senator to openly offer
himself as a possible alternative.</TE>
<TE>   He was quickly endorsed by three influential GOP senators --
George Allen of Virginia, incoming chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the
incoming chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, and John W.
Warner of Virginia, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. The announcements were the first in a series of
high-level endorsements expected by the Frist camp.</TE>
<TE>   Allen said he called Lott late Wednesday to urge him to give up
his leadership post.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), a longtime Lott
adversary who had been considered a possible challenger, said Nickles
would probably back Frist.</TE>
<TE>   Frist is considered a favorite of President Bush. And his
statement follows criticism of Lott's comments by several Bush allies
-- his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and, just Thursday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry.</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to Frist vehemently denied any White House
complicity in Frist's initiative. "He has studiously avoided talking
to the White House because it isn't the White House's deal," this
source said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's 51 Republicans are scheduled to meet Jan. 6 to
consider the future of the party's leadership. Lott critics are
hoping he will step down before then. But Lott, who spent Thursday in
Mississippi calling colleagues, has given no indication that he would
relinquish his position voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect he's going to resign," said a Republican senator
who is supporting Lott. "He's determined to overcome this and he's
confident he can."</TE>
<TE>   But other Republicans said Frist's candidacy is just the kind of
opening many GOP senators were seeking to give vent to their
frustrations with the political furor caused by Lott.</TE>
<TE>   "The dam has broken," said an aide to a senior Republican senator.
"It's never over till it's over, but members have been trying to find
a place to jump. If Frist opens the door, they will jump."</TE>
<TE>   Lott spokesman Ron Bonjean Thursday night insisted the senator
will survive any challenges. Bonjean said Lott "will be the majority
leader in the next Congress." The firestorm was touched off by Lott's
comments at the 100th birthday party for Thurmond, now a Republican
senator from South Carolina but who in 1948 ran for president on the
Dixiecrat ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Bush last week termed "offensive" the Lott comments that seemed to
endorse segregation. But he has not called on Lott to step down as
leader. And White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer on Thursday
continued the administration's hands-off approach to the leadership
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever is chosen, if there is an election, the president will
work with whoever that is, including Sen. Lott, to advance the agenda
that the American people have elected everyone in Washington to work
on," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, however, has accused White House aides of fueling sentiment
against him through anonymous comments to the media suggesting the
administration believes a change is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Frist announced his decision to consider a leadership challenge
after keeping a low public profile as the criticism of Lott built. In
private, he expressed concern that the controversy would hurt GOP
efforts to make inroads among black voters. After discussing the
fallout with colleagues, "he began to realize it was pretty bad --
probably so bad we need to change leaders," a source close to Frist
said.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, 50, has been seen as a rising star in the Senate, in part
because of his close relationship to Bush. In 2000, he served as the
Senate Republican liaison to Bush's presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   His stock has risen even more following his chairmanship of the
Senate Republican campaign committee for the 2002 elections, in which
the GOP gained two seats and recaptured control of the Senate. In the
course of the recent campaign, Frist grew closer to Bush's chief
political advisor Karl Rove.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican senator said that Frist's ties to the White House
could be a liability. Lott's allies have been fueling resentment
among some senators over what they see as White House meddling. "The
White House is overplaying its hand," said an aide to a senior Senate
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   But many GOP senators share Allen's concern that the furor
surrounding Lott would dash the GOP's hopes for quick passage of the
party's legislative agenda. Frist backers see him as a potentially
appealing leader because he communicates well on television and
projects a moderate image, which could make it easier for him to
reach out to Democrats and bridge differences within the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   His voting record is consistently conservative and generally in
the mainstream of his party. But he is viewed as less ideological
than Lott primarily because his principal legislative interests --
health care legislation and increased funding for combating AIDS in
Africa -- are not typical conservative mainstays. Frist is a former
surgeon first elected to the Senate in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   As Frist ponders whether to challenge Lott, other Republican
senators could also emerge to seek the leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania have
been supporting Lott, but are considered possible candidates if Lott
steps down. Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee suggested Wednesday he
would like to see a woman as majority leader. Frist's potential
candidacy emerged as Lott continued to take a pounding from
Republicans across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Inhofe told a radio station that Lott had compromised himself with
a series of apologies that have not put out the firestorm.</TE>
<TE>   "So his ability as a leader dissipates on a daily basis," Inhofe
said in an interview reported in the Oklahoman newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming also indicated he was ready for a
leadership change. "I don't have a strong feeling about the
personality that's there," Thomas said. "I don't condone what [Lott]
did and I'm not opposed to change either."</TE>
<TE>   Perry, who succeeded Bush as governor of Texas, said he believes
Lott should step aside as leader. Perry became the first Republican
governor to call explicitly for Lott to be replaced. Earlier this
week, Jeb Bush said the festering Senate leadership crisis must soon
end but stopped short of specifically calling for Lott to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Some senators continued to stand by Lott. Sen. George Voinovich
joined his Ohio colleague, Sen. Mike DeWine, in asserting his backing
of Lott.</TE>
<TE>   And in a CNN interview, Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said he still
supported Lott. "Trent doesn't deserve the death penalty," he said.</TE>

<HD>War Appears Increasingly Unavoidable</HD>

<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- One warning to Saddam Hussein was loud and clear
Thursday: He has until Jan. 27 to come clean on his arsenal. The
other warning was unspoken but just as clear: Or else.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. and U.S. officials denied Thursday that there was a specific
D-Day for a decision that would trigger a military campaign to disarm
Baghdad of what the West insists is Iraq's programs of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no calendar deadline," Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell said, giving the administration's formal response to Iraq's
weapons declaration. The United States, he insisted, is doing
"everything we can to avoid war."</LD>
<TE>   Yet, with the first assessment from chief weapons Inspector Hans
Blix, the United Nations passed a crucial turning point Thursday in
the drama that began with a tough U.N. resolution in November. There
is a growing sentiment even among Hussein's traditional allies at the
U.N. Security Council and doves in the Bush administration that,
barring a political upheaval in Baghdad that preempts it, a U.S.-led
military campaign appears increasingly unavoidable. The U.N. put Iraq
on notice politely. The U.S. was more stern.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there is a practical limit to how much longer you can
just go down the road of non-cooperation and how much time the
inspectors can be given to do their work," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq continues its pattern of non-cooperation, its pattern of
deception, its pattern of dissembling, its pattern of lying. And if
that is going to be the way they continue through the weeks ahead,
then we're not going to find a peaceful solution to this problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   To satisfy the U.S.-driven process, Baghdad would have to do a
virtual about-face to avoid a military showdown. So Hussein has
roughly another five weeks to confess everything the U.S. and its
allies say he's hiding and where he's hiding it before the Security
Council meets to hear the U.N. inspection team's 60-day report on its
work inside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leader would also have to give inspectors unimpeded
access to hundreds of scientists, engineers and technicians involved
during the last two decades in programs to develop nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons and ballistic missiles -- and allow them to
talk with inspectors without behind-the-scenes intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad would then have to surrender all equipment, research
material and documents, including invoices for purchases, involved in
weapons programs. Finally, Iraq would have to begin passing laws
making it illegal to again produce the world's deadliest arms.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid losing his power or his life, Hussein could still do all
that -- or at least try to appear to be complying, say some analysts
and former U.S. diplomats who have dealt with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He may do what he did in 1995 after the defection of his
son-in-law Hussein Kamal, when all of a sudden the Iraqis said they'd
found some documents they didn't know about and, my goodness, that
showed they had a program," said Joseph Wilson, the last U.S.
ambassador to talk to Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not be surprised at all to see him try to offer an
amended declaration, but it would mainly be an attempt to play for
time."</TE>
<TE>   But the scope of what Baghdad would have to do now seems beyond
reach, say U.S. officials and U.N. envoys, as well as Iraq analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The extent of the gap in Iraq's declaration is not just factual,
it's conceptual, so it's not just a matter of making a few
corrections, of fixing it," said Ellen Laipson, former vice chairman
of the National Intelligence Council and now president of the Stimson
Center, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   In a telling response, however, Baghdad instead continued to fume
Thursday that it has no arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has no arms of mass destruction, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan told French radio. "I think the United States is well
placed to know this in the first place, but the United States is
looking for a pretext for an attack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the U.S. military deployment has been on the periphery
of diplomatic events. But it now becomes the center part of the story
-- and of the pressure on Hussein, U.S. and U.N. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "With the intense military buildup and the growing support in the
international community for the Anglo-American viewpoint that Iraq
continues to cheat, Iraq's military and political elites have to know
that there will be a war if Saddam remains in power. And when that
war comes, they'll be finished," said Geoffrey Kemp, a Reagan
administration National Security Council staffer.</TE>
<TE>   "While I've been skeptical about a coup, the probability of
political upheaval grows with the imminence of a ground invasion.
It'll be the presence of large U.S. forces on the ground that will
signal to the Iraqi elite that it's over," Kemp said.</TE>
<TE>   The military momentum is going to be hard to slow, say diplomats
and analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States still has the option of stopping the train at
any time," said Judith Yaphe, a former intelligence analyst now at
National Defense University.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality now is that everything is on the move toward war.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Issues a List of the Shortcomings in Iraqi Arms
Declaration</HD>
<DH>Administration also says some intelligence findings will be
given to U.N. weapons inspectors in an effort to sway the Security
Council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Moving to support charges that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is building banned weapons, the Bush administration for the
first time released a list of its chief concerns Thursday and will
begin providing classified intelligence to U.N. weapons inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   A one-page State Department fact sheet, issued after Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell accused Iraq of lying, lists what Washington
considers the key omissions and deceptions in Baghdad's Dec. 7
weapons declaration to the United Nations Security Council.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. list notes Iraqi claims that suspected mobile germ
warfare laboratories -- what some U.S. officials call "the Winnebagos
of Death" -- are really "refrigeration vehicles and food-testing
laboratories."</LD>
<TE>   The list also says that Baghdad did not explain its effort to buy
uranium in the African nation of Niger. A British intelligence report
in October revealed that Iraq had secretly tried to buy uranium in
Africa, but it did not identify the country.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has no civilian nuclear power or research reactors, and thus
no apparent need for uranium other than as fuel for nuclear weapons.
The Iraqi declaration, U.N. officials said, also did not explain
Baghdad's covert attempts to procure 60,000 specialized aluminum
tubes. The CIA believes that the tubes would have been used in gas
centrifuges to enrich uranium.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department paper also cites the following gaps or
concerns in Iraq's declaration:</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq does not account for 4,752 pounds of special nutrient
material that U.N. inspectors believe was imported before 1995. The
material could have been used to produce 6,760 gallons of anthrax,
triple the amount that declared by Iraq, as well as other germ
agents. U.S. officials say they don't know if Iraq produced
biological weapons in those quantities.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq disclosed manufacturing fuels suited only to a class of
long-range missile that it does not admit owning. Iraq also asserts
that a new "larger diameter" missile does not exceed a 94-mile flight
limit imposed by the U.N. "This claim is not credible," the U.S.
report says.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq does not provide additional and credible details about
production of the deadly nerve agent VX. In 1998, Iraq declared 3.9
tons of VX, but U.S. and U.N. experts believe that it produced much
more, including at least some that could be used in weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq does not provide evidence to support previous claims that
it destroyed 550 artillery shells filled with mustard gas and 400
aerial bombs capable of delivering biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq does not adequately account for hundreds, possibly
thousands, of tons of chemical precursors -- which can be combined to
create chemical weapons -- or of nearly 30,000 empty munitions that
could be filled with chemical agents.</TE>
<TE>   * Iraq denies any connection between its efforts to build drone
aircraft and its chemical or biological weapons programs. But Iraq
admitted in 1995 that a MIG-21 remote-controlled plane tested in 1991
was intended to carry a biological weapons spray system.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these holes and gaps in Iraq's declaration are mere
accidents, editing oversights or technical mistakes: They are
material omissions," the U.S. fact sheet concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Zilinskas, a former U.N. inspector who now heads the
chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation program at the
Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, said
Iraq's biological weapons program requires the most explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest gaps are how much did they produce, and what happened
to it," he said. "They need to document what they destroyed, plus how
and where."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they would begin giving limited intelligence
to U.N. arms inspectors. The decision came after U.N. officials and
some U.S. allies complained that Washington was refusing to provide
evidence for its claims that Iraq is developing nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll give them places to look, things to look for, questions to
ask," a U.S. intelligence official said of the inspection teams.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Sergei V. Lavrov, suggested that
U.S. intelligence may be crucial if the Bush administration is to
convince other Security Council members that Hussein is lying.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been hearing allegations that Iraq does continue its
[weapons of mass destruction] programs," he told reporters at the
U.N. "We've heard it many times. We've never seen any evidence. We
don't know if it's true or not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   State Department responds</TE>
<TE>   Examples of omissions from Iraq's weapons declaration, according
to the U.S. State Department:</TE>
<TE>   Anthrax and other biological agents</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Special Commission concluded that Iraq did not verifiably
account for, at a minimum, 2,160 kilograms of growth media. This is
enough to produce 26,000 liters of anthrax -- three times the amount
Iraq declared; 1,200 liters of botulinum toxin; and 5,500 liters of
clostridium perfrigens -- 16 times the amount Iraq declared.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic missiles</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has disclosed manufacturing new energetic fuels suited only
to a class of missile to which it does not admit.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq claims that flight testing of a larger diameter missile falls
within the 150-kilometer limit. This claim is not credible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear weapons</TE>
<TE>   The declaration ignores efforts to procure uranium from Niger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chemical and biological weapons munitions</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, the U.N. Special Commission reported that Iraq
failed to provide credible evidence that 550 mustard gas-filled
artillery shells and 400 biological weapon-capable aerial bombs had
been lost or destroyed. The Iraqi regime has never adequately
accounted for hundreds, possibly thousands, of tons of chemical
precursors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mobile biological weapon agent facilities</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi declaration provides no information about its mobile
biological weapon agent facilities. Instead, it insists that these
are "refrigeration vehicles and food testing laboratories."</TE>

sifting through the wreckage found high-grade explosives and a
rocket-propelled grenade.</LD>
<LD>   The blast ended a months-long manhunt for Asif Ramzi, a suspect in

<HD>A 'Lincoln' Climbs to Top in Elitist S. Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- In a country where elites zealously guard their power, the
man who won South Korea's presidential election is a novelty. A
maverick who likes to compare himself to Abraham Lincoln, Roh Moo
Hyun beat tremendous odds to become a lawyer, then an assemblyman and
now the president-elect.</LD>
<LD>   Roh was born in 1946 in the town of Kimhae near the southern city
of Pusan into what school records described as "a small farming
family of the lower classes who are enthusiastic about education."</LD>
<LD>   Too poor to afford higher education, Roh attended only high
school. He nonetheless managed to teach himself enough law to pass
the tough South Korean bar exam. He went into a legal practice in
Pusan, where he quickly gained a reputation as a firebrand. His
clients included labor activists, radical students who staged a
takeover of the U.S. Consulate in Pusan in the 1980s and a student
charged with national security violations for his North Korean
sympathies.</LD>
<TE>   Roh gained prominence on the national political scene in 1988
when, as a freshman assemblyman, he starred in televised
investigations into corruption in South Korea's military
dictatorship. But he broke with his mentor, Kim Young Sam, a former
opposition figure and later president, in 1990 to protest a political
deal between Kim and the then-ruling conservative party.</TE>
<TE>   Roh's stand nearly cost him his political career. He lost a race
for mayor of Pusan as well as his seat in the National Assembly. He
reentered the assembly in 1998, this time in the party of President
Kim Dae Jung.</TE>
<TE>   In his presidential campaign, Roh unabashedly praised Kim's
policies, while managing to distance himself from personal scandals
that have made Kim deeply unpopular with voters.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from two terms in the assembly, Roh has relatively little
experience in the administrative side of government. The only
high-level post he has held was an eight-month stint as minister for
maritime affairs and fisheries from 2000 to 2001. He has seldom
traveled outside South Korea and has never visited the United States,
a point of criticism during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In a radio interview in April, Roh said he didn't want to go to
the U.S. like other South Korean politicians just to take a picture.
"This is a legacy of the colonial mentality -- this idea that a
future leader of Korea must be well known in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign, Roh's views about the United States have
been a point of controversy -- and nearly lost him the presidential
election. Chung Mong Jun, the backer who repudiated Roh on the eve of
the election, said he was withdrawing his support because of a
comment by Roh that Chung said suggested that South Korea might have
to play a mediating role to prevent the U.S. from starting a war with
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1990, Roh supported calls for the withdrawal of the
37,000 U.S. troops from South Korea, but he says those views have
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a man of dogma or ideology. You have to make concessions
as a responsible politician. If you are too principled, it is not
possible to govern. The main principle you have to respect is never
to lie," Roh said in April to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Roh has also said in interviews that he has great respect for the
democratic values of the United States but that he objects to aspects
of the Bush administration's handling of Iraq, North Korea and
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In another controversial position, Roh has pushed for the capital
to be moved out of Seoul to ease overcrowding and high real estate
prices. And he has also been criticized for his support of tax audits
of media companies that have been opposed to the Kim administration.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from remarks by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
announcing that Iraq's arms declaration fails to meet a U.N.
resolution:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The inspectors ... said that in some cases they even have
information that directly contradicts Iraq's account.</LD>
<TE>   Our experts ... have found it to be anything but currently
accurate, full or complete.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, thousands of the document's pages are merely a
resubmission of material it gave the United Nations years ago,
material that the U.N. has already determined was incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Before the inspectors were forced to leave Iraq, they concluded
that Iraq could have produced 26,000 liters of anthrax. That is three
times the amount Iraq had declared.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Iraqi declaration is silent on this stockpile, which alone
would be enough to kill several million people.</TE>
<TE>   The regime also admitted that it had manufactured 19,180 liters of
a biological agent called botulinum toxin. The U.N. inspectors later
determined that the Iraqis could have produced 38,360 additional
liters. However, once again, the Iraqi declaration is silent on
these....</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi declaration also says nothing about the uncounted,
unaccounted precursors from which Iraq could have produced up to 500
tons of mustard gas, sarin gas and VX nerve gas.</TE>
<TE>   It should be obvious that the pattern of systematic holes and gaps
in Iraq's declaration is not the result of accidents or editing
oversights or technical mistakes. These are material omissions that,
in our view, constitute another material breach.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this declaration fails totally to move us in the
direction of a peaceful solution.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration sought Thursday to banish any
perceptions that a frowned-upon candidate had won the South Korean
presidency, stressing its eagerness to work with President-elect Roh
Moo Hyun to improve U.S.-South Korean relations.</LD>
<LD>   "The United States continues to have very strong and good
relations with the people and the government of South Korea,"
presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said. "We're friends and we're
allies.... It is the role of America's great democracy to honor and
respect the elections of every nation in the world and work with
those leaders."</LD>
<LD>   Senior officials downplayed differences between the Bush
administration and Roh, whose campaign speeches advocated a softer,
diplomatic approach to North Korea. The losing candidate,
conservative Lee Hoi Chang, has for years called for a tough stance
against the communist state. He was thus seen as a more sympathetic
interlocutor for the Bush administration, which demands that North
Korea renounce its nuclear weapons program as a condition for
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   "We view his election as an opportunity to work with him and his
government to build an even stronger relationship between our two
countries for the new century," said James A. Kelly, assistant
secretary of State for East Asian affairs. Kelly confronted North
Korean officials in October with U.S. suspicions that Pyongyang had a
secret uranium enrichment program, and described himself as shocked
when the officials admitted it.</TE>
<TE>   "President-elect Roh has also expressed his strong support for the
U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance as a deterrent against the threat
from North Korea, and for the regional stability that the alliance
provides," Kelly added. "Together we hope to further modernize and
improve this alliance."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly also downplayed the anti-American flavor of the South Korean
presidential campaign, instead presenting it as a generational
changing of the guard to which America must adapt. He could hardly
have been more diplomatic Thursday as he recalled the not-so-distant
days of South Korea's military dictatorship and lauded the nation's
democratic transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that South Korea is "the single country in the world most
connected on the Internet," Kelly added: "These are technically
competent, sophisticated people, and yet it was only 15 years ago we
were wondering about a presidential election -- there was doubt
whether there would even be a presidential election, whether if the
'wrong' candidate was somehow elected, the army was going to let that
stand." Kelly was referring to a 1987 crisis in which strongman Gen.
Chun Doo Hwan tried to dictate election rules in order to ensure that
the presidency went to a military successor. Massive street
demonstrations forced Chun to allow direct presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   Once Roh names his Cabinet, U.S. officials "will sit down and look
at them face to face and find out what it is that we agree on and
what it is we disagree with," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer insisted that it has always been President Bush's
position that the South Koreans, the Japanese and other neighbors
should be the ones to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear
program. Fleischer rejected the notion that there is "daylight"
between the administration's position and Roh's policy of dialogue
with the North.</TE>

<HD>Davis Has No First-Term Regrets -- Well, Maybe Just One</HD>
<DH>Governor cites school gains, defends reaction to energy
crisis. He jokes about saying Legislature exists to do his will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday that he's finishing his first term in
office with no regrets. But he would like to purge one remark from
public memory: his prickly suggestion nearly four years ago that the
Legislature exists to implement his vision.</LD>
<LD>   Davis made the confession in a good-humored chat with reporters,
during which he reflected on his first-term achievements and laid out
his aims as California confronts a daunting financial crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The 55-minute session, a day after the governor announced that
California's budget shortfall had soared to $34.8 billion, was billed
as a year-end round-table with reporters.</LD>
<TE>   At times serious and contemplative and at other times
lighthearted, Davis defended his most debated decisions, including
his handling of the energy crisis and his decision to use a number of
one-time fixes in addressing a budget shortfall earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   He said the one-time fixes -- rather than massive program cuts --
made sense earlier this year because experts were forecasting a more
rapid economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   His critics have suggested that the Democratic governor was
putting off difficult decisions until after the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me if I would have done anything different the last
four years, the answer is no," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could have been able to communicate more clearly to
people why we were doing things," he said -- "why the energy crisis,
for example, was so difficult to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Davis challenged a suggestion that he had been "shocked" by his
shaky, five-point victory in November over Republican challenger Bill
Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "I never said that," Davis said, provoking laughter when he
playfully suggested that the questioner was quoting himself.</TE>
<TE>   The governor cited progress in public education as his proudest
achievement in his first term.</TE>
<TE>   And as he confronts the state's growing budget deficit, he said,
he is exploring a way for future governors to set aside money during
times of surplus to avoid cycles of fiscal feast or famine.</TE>
<TE>   Davis later mined one of his most quoted verbal missteps for more
laughs when he was asked to discuss the unfinished business from his
first four years in the governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he deadpanned, "despite my efforts, the Legislature still
will not implement my will!"</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he hosted about two dozen children from the St.
Patrick's Home for Children in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had been scheduled to continue a Capitol holiday tradition
by delivering gifts to children at the home.</TE>
<TE>   But Msgr. Edward Kavanagh, director of St. Patrick's, demanded
that Davis and his aides first sign a vow expressing their opposition
to abortion and "begging for mercy" for their "sinful deeds."</TE>
<TE>   Davis arranged for the children to receive the gifts at the
Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "He's entitled to his point of view, and I'm entitled to mine," he
said in response to Kavanagh's criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unapologetically pro-choice, and I'm not changing my
position. I don't want the children to be disappointed, so I invited
them here," the governor added.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Church personnel files released Thursday detail more shuffling of
allegedly abusive priests by the Boston Archdiocese, including one
who was mired in sexual abuse allegations for 28 years before
retiring.</LD>
<LD>   The files were made public by lawyers suing the archdiocese on
behalf of people who claim they were sexually abused by priests.
Lawyers for most of the approximately 450 people were expected today
to submit estimates of how much they believe their clients should
receive.</LD>
<LD>   One of the attorneys, Carmen Durso, said archdiocese lawyers would
have until Jan. 15 to respond. Then the plaintiffs would decide
whether to attempt to reach a settlement through mediation, Durso
said.</LD>
<TE>   Bishop Richard G. Lennon, 55, the interim leader of the
fourth-largest U.S. archdiocese, has called on both sides to suspend
litigation activities so they can focus on settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   Durso and two other attorneys who represent alleged victims said
they welcomed Lennon's call for jump-starting settlement talks but
were unwilling to suspend litigation.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the archdiocese did not return calls Thursday
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations against five priests were in the latest release of
personnel documents the church was forced to give to the plaintiffs'
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers expected to release more documents today, at which
point they will have made public 18,000 pages of files detailing
claims against 83 priests.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's files included allegations against the Rev. Philip
Breton, who died in 1984. He was sent to 12 parishes, was suspended
twice and spent three months on retreat in Canada from the time he
was ordained in 1936 until his retirement in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The papers indicate Breton was suspended in 1950 after allegations
surfaced he was sexually involved with "a boy (or boys)" in Hampton
Beach, N.H. The next year at St. Louis de France in Lowell, Breton
was removed after the parish priest wrote that Breton's presence was
a source of scandal and that he was a "menace" to boys.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, parishioners in Beverly sent letters to the archdiocese
concerning more allegations. "This whole business apparently was part
of his decision to retire early in 1978," another church memo read.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 12 Years for Tossing Dog 23 Stories, Other Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A man who threw his girlfriend's dog off her 23rd-floor balcony was
sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison for animal cruelty and other
charges related to stalking the woman.</LD>
<LD>   John Jefferson, 43, pleaded guilty Dec. 5 to robbery, burglary,
stalking, criminal contempt and animal cruelty. The judge said two of
the 12 years were for killing the dog, Ribsy.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had pets all my life," Judge James Yates said. "I was just
as sickened as anyone else when I read the stories."</LD>
<TE>   The judge also ordered five years of parole supervision for
Jefferson and signed an order of protection that directs him to stay
away from ex-girlfriend Eugenia Miller for the next 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson tossed the 16-year-old black-and-white terrier-poodle
mix to its death May 26 during an argument with Miller. Ribsy landed
in the concrete plaza below and died instantly. Jefferson barricaded
himself inside the apartment and threatened Miller with a knife,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry," Jefferson said in court Thursday. "I was totally
messed up, emotionally disturbed. I just lost it."</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson pleaded guilty to burglary in connection with his
forcible entry into the apartment, and his plea to the robbery charge
was for a May 22 holdup at knifepoint. The stalking charge arose from
his harassment of Miller earlier.</TE>

<HD>Establishment of Latin Emmys Is Heading to Arbitration</HD>
<DH>Perturbed at its L.A. counterpart's inactivity, the N.Y.
academy will take steps to set up a telecast to honor
Spanish-language TV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bicoastal family feud between the nonprofit groups that share
stewardship of the television industry's most prestigious honor
erupted Thursday over the push to establish a Latin Emmy Awards
ceremony, intended to celebrate the best in Spanish-language
programming.</LD>
<LD>   Frustrated by the inactivity of its West Coast counterpart, the
New York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said
it will proceed with plans to present the Latin Emmys next year. The
organization is seeking arbitration to ensure it can do so, retaining
David Boies -- the litigator who led the Justice Department's suit
against Microsoft -- to press its case.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Price, president of the national academy, contends that the
rival Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, based in North
Hollywood, has engaged in "stalling tactics" to block the awards,
leaving him no other recourse.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a complex issue," he said, calling the proposed
telecast an opportunity to acknowledge "an overlooked area of good
professional work," pointing to large Latino populations -- and
commensurate viewing of Spanish-language television -- in cities such
as New York, Los Angeles and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   However, West Coast officials say the matter isn't that simple.</TE>
<TE>   They cite a variety of concerns -- some raised by Latino media
representatives -- including the appearance of segregating
Spanish-language fare, equitable judging procedures, the propriety of
the name itself, and eligibility of programs produced outside the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Moctesuma Esparza, a producer of such films as "The Milagro
Beanfield War," called the concept of Latin Emmys "wrong-headed" --
unlike the Latin Grammys, which speak to a specific genre of music.</TE>
<TE>   If the academy wants to present Spanish-language Emmys, he said,
call them "Emmys en Espanol," and clearly distinguish them from
Latino talent in English-language fare -- such as "The George Lopez
Show," a comedy on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   "This is confusing ethnicity with language," said Esteban Torres,
a former California congressman and chairman of the National Latino
Media Council, saying there would never be an "Irish Emmys" or
"Jewish Emmys."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Raul Mateu, a senior vice president at the William Morris
Agency who chaired the Latin Emmy organizing committee, called such
concerns "much ado about nothing," saying that the name is merely a
working title and that "Emmys en Espanol" is a possibility. The
larger issue, he said, is to provide overdue recognition for "the
fastest-growing segment of the broadcasting business."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has roots that were planted 25 years ago, when the two
academies underwent an acrimonious divorce after the Los Angeles
group questioned its sister academy's integrity over membership
standards and voting procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the New York academy oversees Emmys for news,
documentaries, sports and daytime programs, while the Los Angeles arm
orchestrates the nationally televised nighttime Emmys and Los
Angeles-area awards. Because the two share rights to the Emmy
statuette, neither can initiate a new national award without the
other's approval, provided it is not "unreasonably withheld."</TE>
<TE>   Todd Leavitt, president of the western academy, said there is
nothing unreasonable about exercising caution, given the issues yet
to be resolved -- among them the fact that most popular
Spanish-language soap operas, or telenovelas, viewed in the U.S.
originate in Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   However, Price maintains further delay is unnecessary. The two
leading Spanish-language networks, Telemundo and Univision, have
agreed to alternate broadcasting the ceremony, he said, and his
organization's board signed off in June.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Sokol, chief operating officer for Telemundo, said the
network wanted to mount the awards next fall -- probably in New York
or Miami -- but had no desire to get caught in a legal skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to do the show," he said. "Currently,
Spanish-language programming is not recognized at all by the
traditional Emmy ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   The last Spanish-language program to earn an Emmy on the national
level, for news, occurred in 1998. Spanish-language broadcasters have
fared somewhat better in local balloting, where they face a more
level playing field with their English-language competition. In July,
for example, Univision station KMEX won the Los Angeles Emmy for best
daytime newscast, while Telemundo's KVEA received an award for
investigative reporting.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Univision, the most-watched Spanish-language
network, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, the exchange is a setback to talk of
reconciliation between the academies, which was seen as a possibility
after John Cannon, the New York body's longtime president, died last
year. The initial split was spurred in part by West Coast criticism
of Cannon, who was known to run the academy like a private fiefdom.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Jogger Rape Convictions Thrown Out</HD>
<DH>At D.A.'s urging, judge overturns the verdicts of five men.
Courtroom is filled with cheers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A Manhattan judge threw out the convictions of five men in the
Central Park jogger rape case on Thursday, agreeing with prosecutors
that newly discovered DNA evidence had implicated another man in the
brutal attack.</LD>
<LD>   Supreme Court Judge Charles Tejada, noting that "the duty of the
prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict," dismissed the
rape and assault convictions in the notorious 1989 crime that exposed
the city's racial tensions. He based his decision, which was widely
expected, largely on a Dec. 5 recommendation by Manhattan Dist. Atty.
Robert M. Morgenthau that all of the convictions be overturned.</LD>
<LD>   The case was thought to have been settled long ago, when two
juries convicted five black and Latino teenagers in the beating and
rape of a white 28-year-old investment banker. Although she lost
nearly 80% of her blood, the woman, now 41, made a miraculous
recovery and will publish a book next year about her experience.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy resurfaced this year when Matias Reyes, a serial
killer and rapist serving a life sentence, confessed that he alone
had attacked the jogger. The district attorney's office quickly
reopened the case, and determined that DNA evidence linked Reyes to
the attack. Although the five defendants had confessed to
participating in the crime, prosecutors concluded that the accused,
who were 14 to 16 at the time, might have prevailed in their original
trials if Reyes' involvement had been known.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada's courtroom, which was packed with supporters of the five,
exploded in cheers when he announced his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's justice that I've wanted for my son," said Sharonne Salaam,
mother of defendant Yusef Salaam, at a news conference outside the
Manhattan Criminal Court Building. "I want justice for him, and I
want accountability for the police and the D.A., all those who chose
to sidestep justice in order to solve this crime. They had every
opportunity to find the guilty and they chose not to."</TE>
<TE>   All of the original defendants have completed their prison terms,
which ranged from seven to 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Warren and other attorneys representing the men said they
would immediately begin plans to file civil lawsuits against the
city. Saying "a battle to seek justice" was just beginning, Warren
charged that police and prosecutors used abusive, illegal tactics in
convicting Salaam, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson
and Kharey Wise.</TE>
<TE>   However, New York police officials have strongly defended their
actions in the original investigation, saying the boys were not
coerced into making confessions.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Detectives Endowment Assn., a labor organization,
tried but failed Thursday to get a higher court to block Tejada's
ruling. They said they still believed the five defendants had
participated in the attack and would consider seeking an appeal of
the judge's decision.</TE>

<HD>4 Boys Who Fell Through Thin Ice Are Mourned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Parents and teachers wept alongside agonized family members Thursday
as a city grieved for four boys who died after falling through thin
ice and becoming trapped.</LD>
<LD>   The boys, ages 7 to 11, were recalled as heroes during a funeral
service that drew hundreds of mourners. Three of the children drowned
Saturday trying to save a fourth from the icy Merrimack River.</LD>
<LD>   "All of these boys shared a sense of responsibility to each other
and to their friendship," schools Supt. Wilfredo Laboy said in a
eulogy. The accident happened as a group of boys was walking home
from the nearby Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greater Lawrence.</LD>
<TE>   William Rodriguez, 11, was the first to fall through, said three
children who survived. As the others tried to save him, 7-year-old
Christopher Casado, 9-year-old Victor Baez and 8-year-old Mackendy
Constant became trapped under the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "They are heroes in our eyes," Father Jorge Reyes told mourners at
the funeral Mass at St. Mary's Church.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds packed the church, including parents who brought their
children and teachers who wore green-and-white ribbon wreaths in
memory of the boys. U.S. Sen. John F. Kerry and Rep. Martin T.
Meehan, whose district includes the town, also attended.</TE>
<TE>   Later Thursday at a cemetery, mourners' cries filled the frigid
air, and friends and emergency personnel carried several women away,
including one mother who strained her arms back toward the gravesite,
calling for her "baby."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody feels the pain," said Canes Monta, 35, Mackendy's
uncle. "They need somebody who's strong. I feel weak, but I need to
be strong for them."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher's parents, who are Protestant, held a separate service
for him at a funeral home.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Restel, 8, and his brother, Christian, 7, came with
their mother, Annabel Rivera, 31.</TE>
<TE>   "They were my best friends," Christopher said of the four boys.</TE>

<HD>3 Illinois Death Row Inmates Pardoned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>URBANA, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Gov. George Ryan on Thursday pardoned three men wrongfully convicted
of murder, including Rolando Cruz, whose case has served as a symbol
of flaws in the death penalty system.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan made the announcement as he spoke before the University of
Illinois College of Law concerning the state's death penalty system.
Ryan has been considering commuting the sentences of about 140 men on
death row. The men he pardoned Thursday already had been released.</LD>
<LD>   The pardons, which were widely expected, came a day after federal
prosecutors released papers alleging that Ryan had personal knowledge
of wrongdoing by aides in the secretary of state's office he ran
before being elected governor in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Ryan has the power to grant clemency to all 160 inmates facing
execution in Illinois, but he has said recently that a blanket
clemency is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor, who did not seek reelection, leaves
office Jan. 13.</TE>
<TE>   His latest actions come after months of pleas from lawyers and
others who are convinced that Illinois' death penalty system is
hopelessly flawed, and outcries from the families of victims of some
of the most terrible crimes in the state's history.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan gained national prominence when he halted executions nearly
three years ago, calling the state's death penalty system "fraught
with error" after the courts found that 13 men on death row had been
wrongly convicted since the state resumed capital punishment in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   He pushed for a sweeping overhaul of the way capital cases are
handled. Ryan later raised the possibility that he would commute the
sentences of everyone facing death. That led most of the condemned
inmates to file formal petitions for clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz served 11 years in prison, including seven on death row, for
the 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico. He was
acquitted at a third trial, and DNA tests cleared him.</TE>
<TE>   Also pardoned was Gary Gauger, wrongly convicted of killing his
parents; and Steven Linscott, who was convicted of murdering a young
woman in suburban Chicago on the strength of a dream he related to
police. Authorities considered it a confession. Linscott also was
exonerated by DNA evidence.</TE>

<HD>Medical Groups Criticize Bush's Smallpox Vaccine Plan</HD>
<DH>They say the president has not convinced them that the
threat justifies the risk to personnel or the strain on public health
resources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper and Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Some of the nation's leading medical organizations
warned Thursday that the government's massive smallpox vaccination
program will strain already overburdened public health and emergency
medical systems.</LD>
<LD>   Speakers representing state and local public health agencies,
nurses, emergency room physicians and the nation's hospitals said
President Bush had not convinced them that the threat of a
bioterrorism attack using the smallpox virus was great enough to
merit his program's substantial diversion of public health resources
and its health risks to medical personnel.</LD>
<LD>   Their testimony came at the end of a long day of technical
presentations to an advisory panel set up by the Institute of
Medicine at the request of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</LD>
<TE>   The plan Bush announced Dec. 13 calls for the vaccination of
500,000 military personnel and 439,000 health-care workers who would
volunteer to be members of smallpox response teams -- the doctors,
nurses and public health workers who would treat and investigate
smallpox cases. Vaccine would be made available to all Americans
starting in 2004, but Bush stressed that the government was not
recommending the vaccine for the public.</TE>
<TE>   The health-care providers reminded committee members that Bush's
vaccination plan will be implemented in the real world, where there
is a severe nursing shortage, emergency rooms are overburdened,
public health agencies are strapped for cash and Americans face far
more common health threats than smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   "As critical as it is that we be prepared to respond to a smallpox
attack, it cannot come at the expense" of other public health
programs, said Dr. George E. Hardy, executive director of the Assn.
of State and Territorial Health Officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuberculosis, E. coli and measles are not taking a furlough,"
warned Patrick M. Libbey, executive director of the National Assn. of
County and City Health Officials.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday, the Pentagon had vaccinated 174 people.
Vaccination of response team members is expected to begin as soon as
late January, and inoculation of up to 10 million fire, police and
other medical and emergency personnel is scheduled to begin sometime
after that.</TE>
<TE>   All the medical group representatives urged the government to slow
down. Hardy warned that moving from the first phase of the program to
a broad vaccination plan without taking the time to reevaluate "has
the real potential to do more harm than good."</TE>
<TE>   The American Hospital Assn. and the American Nurses Assn. said the
government's plan failed to protect workers against being sued and to
compensate them for medical expenses incurred and work time lost to
the vaccine's side effects. They called on the administration to
create a federal compensation fund.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday marked the first time that health-care providers
publicly expressed doubts about the need for the vaccination program
and the effect it might have on routine medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Hardy estimated vaccinating health-care workers alone would cost
from $600 million to $1 billion. "That money is going to have to be
found," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jonathan L. Burstein, an assistant professor at Harvard
Medical School who spoke for the American College of Emergency
Physicians, said more than 60% of ER doctors would be willing to be
vaccinated right away if they were convinced that the threat of a
smallpox attack was real.</TE>
<TE>   Short of that, he said, the doctors are worried that the vaccine's
side effects, which might require them to take time off from work,
and the necessary safety precautions, which include avoiding close
contact with people having weakened immune systems, could jeopardize
patient care.</TE>
<TE>   Another cautionary voice was heard Thursday from a group of
California scientists who concluded that vaccinating the public
against smallpox would kill more people than it saved in all but very
large-scale bioterrorist attacks. But vaccinating only health-care
workers would save lives in more modest attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We concluded that as long as there's not substantial likelihood
of attacks across the country, it's not a good idea to launch a
smallpox vaccination campaign," said Dr. Samuel Bozzette, lead author
of the study and an investigator at the Rand Center for Domestic and
International Health Security in Santa Monica. "On the other hand, it
does seem prudent to vaccinate health-care workers who are at much
greater risk."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that 60% of the public and 90% of health-care workers
would be vaccinated, the scientists estimated that 484 members of the
public and 25 health-care workers would die as a result of their
vaccinations. But most experts think that many fewer Americans would
volunteer to be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   The authors found that large-scale vaccination would cause more
deaths than smallpox in a case in which an infected terrorist
wandered through a city spreading virus.</TE>
<TE>   In another paper released by the New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Thomas Mack, professor of preventive medicine at USC, argued that
given the risks of the vaccine, large-scale vaccination of even
health-care workers is a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Mack said it makes more sense to manage outbreaks through
monitoring and isolation and keeping smallpox patients away from
hospitals, where infections are most likely to spread.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Territory Alters Entry Ban After Outcry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American Samoa, an isolated U.S. territory in the South Pacific,
hastily revised a 5-month-old security order Thursday that had
angered Arab American groups and U.S. lawmakers with an immigration
ban on travelers of "Middle Eastern descent."</LD>
<LD>   After discussions with officials at the Interior Department, which
oversees U.S. territories, American Samoa Atty. Gen. Fiti Sunia
issued an alert that bans entry permits for citizens of 24 countries,
most in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, without special
permission from Samoan authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The list includes countries designated by the State Department as
sponsors of terrorism, such as Iraq and Iran, as well as Asian
countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines that are believed to
be home to Al Qaeda-linked terrorist cells.</LD>
<TE>   The revision is aimed at deflating controversy that had erupted
around the original order, issued in August.</TE>
<TE>   It banned entry to those of Middle Eastern heritage and urged
airlines and border officials to "take special note" of visitors with
"Middle Eastern surnames and features."</TE>
<TE>   The measure, which initially attracted little notice outside seven
islands that have relatively few visitors, had in recent days
prompted an outcry from the Arab American Institute and others.</TE>
<TE>   American Samoa Gov. Tauese P. F. Sunia -- the attorney general's
uncle -- said in a statement Thursday that the territory "does not
condone discriminatory practices."</TE>
<TE>   He said the original order was never intended to restrict entry
for U.S. citizens or Samoan residents.</TE>
<TE>   A Samoan resident, Michael Homsany, had petitioned the territory's
highest court to halt the order because he feared he would not be let
back into the islands because of his Arabic heritage.</TE>

<HD>12 Charged With Illegal Iraqi Transfers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Six people were arrested and six others indicted on Thursday for
allegedly funneling $12 million in cash or goods to Iraq, violating
sanctions dating back to the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   In a federal grand jury indictment, the United States alleged that
12 individuals used a Seattle-based money wire transfer company to
send funds to Iraq through third countries between April 2000 and
January 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "Our investigation has revealed that this group that was indicted
today moved roughly $28 million out of the United States over the
space of about 30 months," U.S. Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner
told a news briefing in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "Of that amount, we have been able to trace at least $12 million
of those funds or goods that ended up in Iraq via third-party
intermediaries."</TE>
<TE>   Customs agents arrested Iraqi-born Hussain Alshafei in the Seattle
suburb of Edmonds, Wash., and five alleged accomplices in Missouri,
Virginia, Texas, Tennessee and Arizona, according to the U.S.
attorney's office for western Washington, which added there was no
suggestion of terrorism in the alleged illegal money transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Six additional suspects residing in Britain, Iraq, Jordan and the
United Arab Emirates were also named in the indictment, which
describes a vast network of people steering money to Iraq through
Alshafei Family Connect Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to say whether those individuals had yet been
apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   A phone call to AFCI seeking comment was not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Customs agents in January raided AFCI, which says it helps Iraqi
emigres send money home to their families, for allegedly violating
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and other
restrictions on dealings with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an ongoing investigation and terrorism is not involved,"
said John Hartingh, spokesman for U.S. Atty. John McKay.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. sanctions imposed in 1990 prohibit direct or indirect fund
transfers to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, the suspects could be forced to pay a penalty equal
to the $12 million in question and forfeit other personal property,
including bank holdings.</TE>

<HD>60 Hurt as Midday Tornado Tears Into Mississippi Town</HD>
<DH>Newton's residential areas are largely spared but the
crowded business district is devastated. Power and phone service are
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A powerful tornado crashed through the east Mississippi town of
Newton on Thursday, blowing out windshields, toppling trees and
battering stores filled with holiday shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   At least 60 people were injured, two critically, said Amy Carruth,
spokeswoman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. No
deaths were reported. As evening fell, parts of Newton -- located 60
miles east of Jackson -- were without power and phone service.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of chaotic and it looks pretty bad," Carruth said.
"We've had storms all day, and the wind over Newton happened to pick
up at the right place at the right time to form the tornado. But it
didn't go on a long path and was very confined. It hit the ground,
then went back up into the sky and was gone."</LD>
<TE>   Most of the residential areas in the old railroad town were
spared, but the business district is a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wal-Mart and the La-Z-Boy furniture plant -- Newton's
largest employer -- big plate-glass windows were blown to bits.
Shopping carts at two grocery stores were flung from one end of the
parking lot to the other, crashing into vehicles already pummeled by
flying debris.</TE>
<TE>   "Trees are across the roads, roofs are partially collapsed, power
lines are down and everywhere there's debris," said Kim Beatty, who
was downtown when the tornado hit. "It's a mess."</TE>
<TE>   Beatty was attending a holiday lunch with about 75 Newton city
employees when the restaurant's lights began to flicker. Plates
filled with barbecued chicken, potato salad and field peas were
quickly forgotten as the sound of rain was replaced with an ominous
rumble.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone looked outside the window and yelled, 'Get down and cover
your head.' That's how fast it happened," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At Newton High School, Beatty's 16-year-old daughter, Lauren, was
in the middle of an English exam when the rain began to blow sideways
against the windows. "We saw the tornado coming," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a big, white swirling cloud. Leaves were blowing and
trees were uprooted right outside. It seemed to come out of nowhere.
We all ran out into the hallway for cover. We were scared."</TE>
<TE>   The tornado's roar died down after one long minute, she said. "We
waited for a few minutes, then the principal came down the hall and
said, 'It's safe to go back into class.' Our teacher said, 'Ya'll
have got to calm down and take this test as best you can.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lauren collected herself and managed to write three pages on
Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" before class was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove declared a state of emergency in
Newton, clearing the way for the state to assist the town's 4,000
residents.</TE>

<HD>Social Security Plan Would Aid Mexicans</HD>
<DH>U.S. negotiating deal to pay retirement benefits to workers
who contribute into the system but have trouble collecting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is taking steps toward a possible agreement
that would allow thousands of Mexicans legally employed in the United
States, and some who are working here illegally, to collect Social
Security benefits -- a program long sought by Mexican officials.</LD>
<LD>   Many Mexicans who have worked legally in the United States
routinely collect U.S. retirement benefits. But many encounter
problems.</LD>
<LD>   An accord to resolve these snags would put tens of thousands of
Mexicans onto the rolls of the U.S. retirement system, officials say.
It would increase the flow of dollars into Mexico, while putting new
pressure on the program's trust fund as the first wave of the U.S.
baby boom generation nears retirement.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, an agreement could ease some of the tensions
that have developed between the Bush administration and Mexico, and
provide Mexican President Vicente Fox evidence that the United States
was beginning to tackle a difficult cross-border problem.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush had made improved U.S.-Mexican relations one of his
top foreign policy objectives when he first took office. But that
effort got pushed aside after last year's terrorist attacks. Tensions
have developed between the two governments. Mexican officials have
complained that there has been a lack of progress on complex
immigration issues, while the White House was perturbed by Mexico's
reluctance to support Bush's toughened policy toward Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But an accord on the Social Security issue could help restore some
of the optimism that both countries expressed when Bush and Fox took
office a few months apart.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Buchan, a deputy White House press secretary, said Thursday
the Social Security Administration and other government agencies had
begun discussions on an agreement with Mexico similar to pacts with
20 other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Such agreements delve into complex and arcane rules governing
retirement payments and benefits made all the more difficult to
resolve when payments cross borders.</TE>
<TE>   At least four issues are at the center of the problem:</TE>
<TE>   * A Mexican worker in the United States may not have been employed
in this country long enough -- 10 years -- to collect the retirement
benefit. But under a new agreement, that worker may be able to
combine time worked in Mexico with time spent on the job in the
United States to reach the mandatory 10 years of work.</TE>
<TE>   * Some people work legally in both countries. When Mexicans retire
in Mexico, their Social Security checks are mailed to their Mexican
homes. But when the retired workers die, family members seeking to
collect survivor benefits are forced to prove annually, in visits to
Social Security offices in the United States, that they are entitled
to the benefits. This creates administrative headaches and a personal
hardship for the beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   * An American working in Mexico may be required to pay retirement
taxes in Mexico as well as the United States. An agreement could make
the dual payments unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   * An estimated 4 million to 5 million Mexicans work illegally in
the United States, supplying nonexistent Social Security numbers to
their employers. When the Social Security system receives the fake
numbers attached to employers' payments of Social Security taxes, the
data -- and what some experts estimate as billions of dollars in
payments -- are set aside because accounts for the workers have not
been established.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration experts say that under the sort of agreement under
consideration, some of these workers could eventually be able to
collect retirement payments if they achieve legal status in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security Administration says it is in the preliminary
stages of figuring out with Mexican authorities the number of people
the program would cover.</TE>
<TE>   Determining the number of potential beneficiaries is one of the
first steps to be taken before State Department officials and Mexican
counterparts can begin negotiating an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Our actuaries are working on the numbers," said Jim Courtney, a
spokesman for the Social Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   He said the United States has reached retirement-pay agreements
with 20 countries over the past 19 years that provide an average of
$162.80 a month to 94,022 beneficiaries. The agreements have been
negotiated with most of the countries of Western Europe, as well as
Canada, Chile, South Korea and Australia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia Munoz, the vice president for policy of the National
Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group, said the question of
cross-border retirement benefits had become "a very real issue" in
the U.S.-Mexican relationship. It highlights broader U.S.-Mexican
labor issues involving immigration and the dependence on Mexican
labor in U.S. agriculture and other commerce, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz said the readiness of the U.S. government to take the
initial steps that could lead toward an agreement suggested that
"there's a constructive relationship" between the United States and
Mexico, and that "the countries are willing to work on long-standing
issues."</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Americans to Aid Needy</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After packaging canned peaches and spinach for a holiday-season
charity food drive, President Bush exhorted Americans Thursday to
give more heartily of their time and money to help the needy.</LD>
<LD>   "More Americans need to volunteer," Bush said, fellow volunteer
and First Lady Laura Bush by his side. "There are more who hunger and
less who are giving."</LD>
<LD>   Apologizing that "sometimes I get a little wordy" on the topic,
Bush nonetheless delivered a stern message before the volunteers he
briefly helped to bag food collected by the Capital Area Food Bank
from the White House and federal offices.</LD>
<TE>   The president was put in charge of doubling up the plastic bags,
then putting two cans of spinach and peaches in each. "I'm bag man,
peach man, and spinach man," he boasted. He asked the nation to
follow suit and make this holiday season "a season of service" to
those who hurt and go hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who are poor, those who suffer, those who have less hope,
are not strangers in our midst, they're our fellow citizens. And in
this time of joy and time of blessing, we got to remember that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Repeating a favorite refrain, Bush said government has a role in
addressing social ills.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said: "Government can spend money but government cannot
put hope in people's hearts or a sense of purpose in people's lives.
Government can help but government should never crowd out the great
compassion defined in programs such as this right here."</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department reports that last year about 11.5
million U.S. households did not have enough food to meet basic needs.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Newborn Was Infected With West Nile While in Womb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>A brain-damaged baby girl born last month in upstate New York was
infected with West Nile virus while in the womb, marking the first
known instance of West Nile transmission in the uterus, and raising
fears that the virus can cause lasting neurological problems in
newborns.</LD>
<LD>   In a weekly health update, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention said the baby tested positive for the virus after her
birth. The infant's mother, a 20-year-old resident of Syracuse, had
suffered from fever, headaches and other symptoms of West Nile two
months earlier and later tested positive for the virus, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   CDC officials said the baby was born with birth defects, including
loss of brain matter. They said they could not be sure that the
presence of the virus led to the abnormalities.</LD>
<TE>   The CDC officials held out hope that mother-to-fetus transmission
may ultimately prove to be rare, noting that the only other pregnant
woman carefully tracked after being diagnosed with West Nile gave
birth to a healthy baby with no evidence of the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the case adds a new and frightening avenue of
infection for West Nile, the mosquito-borne virus that has spread
dramatically across the nation since it first appeared in the United
States in late 1999. On Thursday, the CDC issued a special warning
encouraging pregnant women to wear protective clothing and use insect
repellent during mosquito season to reduce the risk of infection.</TE>
<TE>   That was just the latest warning triggered by the West Nile
epidemic, which has killed record numbers of people and animals this
year. Health officials have already warned that the virus can be
transmitted via transplated organs, blood products and probably
breast milk.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC on Thursday also presented the first two cases of
workplace transmission of West Nile in laboratory workers who
accidentally infected themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Additional routes of infection and unexpected medical
complications often pop up as more people succumb to a newly arrived
virus, said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases. "When you have the thousands of cases like
we've had this season, then you start to see the rare components, or
at least unusual components, that you might not otherwise see," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the growing list of problems attributed to West Nile
-- including the newborn's brain damage, which Fauci suspects was
indeed caused by the virus -- should energize the quest to develop a
vaccine for people, he said. The only West Nile vaccine now licensed
by the Food and Drug Administration is for horses.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile outbreaks have occurred in several European and Middle
Eastern nations in recent decades, but this year's U.S. epidemic was
the largest ever, according to a CDC report.</TE>
<TE>   The two cases of occupational transmission both occurred in
microbiologists. One got infected from an accidental needle puncture
in the finger while working with live virus and suffered few
symptoms. The other, who got infected through an accidental scalpel
cut while performing a necropsy on a dead blue jay, was sick for a
week with chills, fever and a body rash.</TE>

<HD>People Are Same, but Different</HD>
<DH>Humans can be sorted into five groups based on ancestry,
major genetic study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>People the world over are almost identical, yet still so different
genetically that they can be easily sorted into five major groups
based on ancestry, new research shows.</LD>
<LD>   In the largest study so far of human genetic variation, an
international research team separated people by the major migrations
of ancient humankind, from Africa into Eurasia, East Asia, Oceania
and the Americas, in a way that overturns conventional notions of
race.</LD>
<LD>   With growing assurance, scientists are overturning deep-seated
prejudices over what makes human beings different -- skin color,
facial features, physique -- even as they risk creating new
prejudices founded in the molecular biology of human genetic
variation.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers investigating human variation effectively heighten the
importance of genetic differences, even as they discount
misconceptions about racial distinctions and emphasize the unity of
all humans.</TE>
<TE>   "The core question," said biomedical ethicist Mildred Cho at
Stanford University, "is why is it we keep looking at genes and
variations and organizing them into categories?"</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has a reason.</TE>
<TE>   Many researchers are eagerly sifting the raw ore of human genetic
variation for DNA sequences that could lead to more effective
medications or better treatments for disease. Others hope to use
racial profiling as a diagnostic tool to identify those at greater
risk of chronic diseases or adverse reactions to prescription drugs.
Some just want to better understand human evolution.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, there is less genetic difference between human
beings than between any two members of almost any other mammalian
species, scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   But advances in biotechnology have made those minor differences
more important and more lucrative than ever. Last month, researchers
launched a $100-million effort to map as many of those variations as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   The latest research, published today in Science, highlights a
paradox of modern genetics, several scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is the same; everybody is different," said Mary-Claire
King, an expert in human genetics at the University of Washington in
Seattle. "That is the paradox."</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, researchers pored through the biochemical scrawl
of the human genome like a travel diary that records the migrations,
matings, illnesses, wars of conquest and mishaps shaping the human
species.</TE>
<TE>   Mapping the patterns of human variation, the research team led by
USC geneticist Noah Rosenberg analyzed DNA samples from 1,056 people
from 52 populations in five major geographic regions of the world:
Africa, Eurasia (Europe, the Middle East, and Central and South
Asia), East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for patterns of human ancestry, the research team used
distinctive segments of DNA called micro-satellites that are passed
down from generation to generation. They do not code for genes. Their
only known virtue is that they are among the most variable parts of
human heredity.</TE>
<TE>   In all, they analyzed 377 of these DNA markers.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have identified between four and 32 variations of each
DNA marker. Some variations occur more frequently in certain parts of
the world.</TE>
<TE>   With a powerful statistical computer program, the researchers
could accurately identify the ancestral continent of virtually every
person based solely on his or her DNA. They could arbitrarily change
the number of genetic groupings by altering the parameters of the
computer program.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that there were several major genetic clusters, which
correspond largely to the major geographic regions," Rosenberg said.
The research drew on efforts by scientists in France, Russia, and in
U.S. at Stanford, the University of Chicago and Yale University.</TE>
<TE>   The genetic groups they identified represented the slow process of
adaptation and mutation as humanity spread across the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This analysis tells you the great swath of human history, more
elegantly, more completely and better than anyone has done it
before," King said.</TE>
<TE>   Such studies are stirring a fierce debate over the proper place of
racial categories in medical research and public health.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the New England Journal of Medicine concluded in an
editorial that " 'race' is biologically meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   Nature Genetics warned of the "confusion and potential harmful
effects of using 'race' as a variable in medical research."</TE>
<TE>   But as a matter of public health, racial labels have traditionally
been a measure of life and death.</TE>
<TE>   Infant mortality has been about twice as high for blacks as for
whites since 1950; Native Americans have substantially higher rates
of death from unintentional injuries than any other group; and,
compared with whites, native Hawaiians are more likely to die from
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks, Ashkenazi Jews, Chinese, Asian Indians and other groups in
America can have different -- and potentially dangerous -- reactions
to common medications such as heart drugs, tranquilizers and
painkillers. Many common diseases have a genetic component.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of any reliable scientific definition of race, such
categories can easily be misleading or misconstrued.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing birth and death certificates for 120,000 babies who died
in the early 1980s, for example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention found that many had been identified as one race at
birth and another at death.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers also may find an inherited, racial linkage where none
exists, or overlook the medical effects of what people eat, where
they live and how they are treated. Even when groups are closely
related genetically, ethnic variations in diet can radically alter
reactions to medications and other important medical characteristics,
research shows.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the danger," said Arno Motulsky, a geneticist at the
University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the genetics of human variation, humans differ
most importantly in ways largely invisible to the eye, researchers
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The physical characteristics so often taken as hallmarks of racial
origin -- skin color, hair texture or the shape of nose and lips --
are poor clues to ancestry, according to a new DNA analysis of the
people of Brazil, published this week in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Working in one of the world's most multicultural societies, where
Africans, American Indians and European settlers have intermarried
for centuries, the Brazilian scientists sought to determine how much
physical appearance could predict a person's genetic ancestry. They
conducted DNA analysis of several hundred Brazilian men who
categorized themselves by skin color and other features.</TE>
<TE>   On average, Brazilians with white skin owed almost a third of
their genes to African ancestry, while those with dark skin could
trace almost half their genes to European origin, the researchers
determined.</TE>
<TE>   "Our study makes clear the hazards of equating color or race with
geographical ancestry and using interchangeable terms such as white,
Caucasian and European on one hand, and black, Negro or African on
the other," said geneticist Sergio Pena at the Federal University of
Minas Gerais in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not make any sense to use someone's physical appearance
to guess about their predisposition to hypertension or drug
metabolism or anything," Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   As immigration and intermarriage makes the world a more
cosmopolitan place, Cho said: "in the future we will all be like
Brazil."</TE>

<HD>Floyd's Situation Now Is a Real Cliff-Hanger</HD>
<DH>Dodgers offer three-year, $15.5-million deal to free agent,
who rejects arbitration from Red Sox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cliff Floyd rejected an offer of salary arbitration from the Boston
Red Sox minutes before Thursday night's 9 p.m. PST deadline, clearing
the way for the free-agent outfielder to sign a multiyear deal with
the Dodgers or Baltimore Orioles.</LD>
<LD>   But if Floyd is to be reunited with Dodger manager and longtime
admirer Jim Tracy, who managed Floyd in double-A ball in 1993, Floyd
probably will have to take a pay cut.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers were in serious negotiations with Floyd's agent
Thursday, but according to a source, their highest offer was for
three years and about $15.5 million, an average of a little more than
$5 million a year.</LD>
<TE>   To remain under the new $117-million luxury tax threshold without
cutting payroll elsewhere, the Dodgers, who also are negotiating with
free-agent first baseman Fred McGriff, can't offer Floyd much more
than $5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd made $6.5 million in 2002, the final year of a four-year,
$19-million deal, and he rejected a three-year, $24-million offer
from the Red Sox earlier this winter. Had he accepted arbitration
from the Red Sox, Floyd probably would have made $9 million or more
next season.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles, who lost out on Hideki Matsui when the Japanese
outfielder agreed to a three-year, $21-million deal with the New York
Yankees on Thursday, jumped into the bidding for Floyd, offering a
three-year deal believed to be in the $19.5-million range.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets also made a run at Floyd Thursday but were
unable to clear enough payroll -- they were trying to deal
outfielders Jeromy Burnitz and Roger Cedeno to Colorado for pitcher
Denny Neagle -- to make a serious bid for Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   "If he decides to play for the Dodgers, it's because he really
wants to play here," General Manager Dan Evans said. "You're not out
of it until you're told you're out of it, and we haven't been told
that.</TE>
<TE>   "But we also have some real interesting trade possibilities
involving a number of positions. We have a lot of different things to
explore. Our phone bill is going to have a few more pages than usual
this month, but that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd hit .288 with 28 home runs and 79 runs batted in during a
whirlwind 2002 season. He was traded from Florida to Montreal in an
eight-player, three-team deal on July 11 and from Montreal to Boston
on July 30.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, their farm system thin on prospects, offered Floyd
arbitration on Dec. 7 so they would receive a first-round draft pick
from the team that signed him, but by the winter meetings, they
seemed to be regretting that move.</TE>
<TE>   Few teams except the Dodgers showed serious interest in Floyd
until late this week, and Floyd's father said Tuesday that if Cliff
didn't sign a multiyear deal with the Dodgers by Thursday, he would
accept arbitration from the Red Sox. But Floyd chose instead to
reject arbitration and keep his options open.</TE>
<TE>   He still has until Jan. 8 to negotiate a deal with Boston, but new
Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein said Floyd won't return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear Cliff is going to go in another direction, but
I don't know more than that," Epstein said. "I'm disappointed he
won't be back, but at the same time, I'm excited about the payroll
flexibility and the draft picks we'll receive."</TE>
<TE>   If Floyd signs with the Dodgers, he would play first base, a
position he is not totally comfortable with -- he has played only 116
games there in his nine-year big league career. The Dodgers have also
explored trade possibilities for an outfielder, with the intention of
moving right fielder Shawn Green to first base.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the organization remain reluctant to move
Green, the team's best hitter, to a position he has played only one
game in his career, and some have reservations about Floyd, a corner
outfielder, at first base.</TE>
<TE>   But Tracy, who managed Floyd in Montreal's farm system a decade
ago, has pushed hard for Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't shy away from the fact that I got very close to this
individual," Tracy said. "That [1993 season] was a very special year
for me."</TE>
<TE>   The knock on Floyd is that he is injury prone -- the 6-foot-4,
240-pounder has not been on the disabled list since 2000, but he has
missed several games because of minor injuries over the past two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no denying the left-handed hitting Floyd's power, and
Floyd has above-average speed for a big man. In addition to his 28
home runs in 2002, Floyd hit 43 doubles, scored 86 runs and stole 15
bases.</TE>

<TE>   Price: $14.99</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Gibson's dramatic home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series
has been described in many ways. But never quite the way it is in
this collection of baseball poetry, believed to be the first of its
kind.</TE>
<TE>   Philomene Long, who once titled a collection of her poems "Memoirs
of a Beatnik Nun," offers the longest (9 minutes 13 seconds) and most
intriguing poem of the 12 on this CD, which gives new meaning to
"poetry in motion."</TE>
<TE>   Long, in her poem titled "Marcus Aurelius at a Dodger Game: Kirk
Gibson Up to Bat," is at Game 1 of the 1988 Series with the 2nd
century Roman emperor and philosopher. Long, through Aurelius, offers
a different perspective, to say the least, and Long reads the poem
with conviction and drama.</TE>
<TE>   Long's reading was part of a session held in Donald R. Wright
Auditorium at Pasadena Central Library in August, and this CD comes
from that session. The host of the affair was Michael C. Ford. Other
poets taking part included Harry E. Northrup, Joel Lipman, Fred Voss,
Joan Jobe Smith, Eloise Klein and Gerald Locklin.</TE>

<HD>Dorrell Is Homecoming King</HD>
<DH>The former Bruin receiver gives a lot of the credit to
Donahue for setting him on the path that led to his dream job as head
coach at UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl Dorrell was nicknamed "Sweetness" as a UCLA receiver for his
smooth, fluid style. But he never fully understood the meaning of the
word until returning to his alma mater 15 years after graduating to
become football coach.</LD>
<LD>   Sweet memories came flooding back to Dorrell when he stepped onto
Spaulding Field to meet his new team Thursday. And the sweet smiles
of former teammates and friends greeted him when he was introduced at
a news conference in the Morgan Center.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after arriving at UCLA as a player, a quiet, reserved
Dorrell became homesick.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after arriving at UCLA as coach, a quietly confident
Dorrell realized he was home.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe a debt of gratitude to my background [at UCLA]," he said.
"A lot of the same people who supported me as a student-athlete are
in this room today. This institution is a family. It's something dear
to my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell reflected on how he entered coaching at the urging of
Terry Donahue shortly after graduating from UCLA. Donahue, the Bruin
coach, told Dorrell that he had the makings of a coach.</TE>
<TE>   So Dorrell left his entry-level job in athletic administration and
joined the Bruin staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry said, 'Hey, Karl, I think you have the qualities to be a
good coach.' He saw something in me that I obviously didn't see,"
Dorrell said. "He ended the discussion saying, 'You never know, you
might be the UCLA head coach someday.' "</TE>
<TE>   Someday came more quickly than most observers imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, in his third year as a Denver Bronco assistant, beat out
New Orleans Saint assistant Mike Riley and Kansas City Chief
assistant Greg Robinson for the job, making an indelible impression
on Chancellor Albert Carnesale and Athletic Director Dan Guerrero in
an interview Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell becomes only the fourth African American football coach in
Division I-A, but the decision-makers said his skin color had little
bearing on the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl Dorrell was, in my view and in Dan Guerrero's view, the best
candidate for the position," Carnesale said. "We never considered,
gee, he's African American, we'd better hire him."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they chose a man whose maturity, integrity and fitness
for the job became abundantly clear during the interview. That quiet,
homesick 18-year-old is the coach who will lead the Bruins into the
post-Bob Toledo era.</TE>
<TE>   "You can spot his passion without him standing up and waving his
arms," Carnesale said. "I don't pretend to be an expert on football.
What I do pretend to be able to do is pick first-rate people. I've
made two picks in the last year, a dean of athletics [Guerrero] and a
dean of football [Dorrell]."</TE>
<TE>   It was Guerrero who called Dorrell and left a somber-sounding
message: "Hey, Karl, I'd like for you to call me back. I have
something to do at 3 p.m. and I would like to touch base with you
before that time."</TE>
<TE>   When Dorrell, who turned 39 Wednesday, retrieved the message after
Bronco practice, he figured he'd been passed over.</TE>
<TE>   "I called back half-disheartened, thinking he's going to let me
down real slow," Dorrell said. "He asked how practice went and how my
birthday was going.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he said, 'Maybe this will make your birthday better. I'd
like you to become the head coach at UCLA.' "</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later Dorrell accepted a six-year rollover contract with
a base salary of $600,000 and incentives that could hike the package
over $1 million a year. It is the highest compensation ever paid to a
UCLA coach.</TE>
<TE>   He will begin work after the Broncos play the Oakland Raiders on
Sunday. First order of business is to assemble a staff. Next will be
a focus on recruiting. He will not coach the Bruins in the Las Vegas
Bowl on Christmas but will watch the game.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell said he will hire at least one assistant who has been a
head coach. It is believed he will pursue Washington assistant head
coach Steve Axman, a former head coach at Northern Arizona and UCLA
assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Coach Gary Barnett said Thursday that he expects Dorrell
to request permission to talk to Buffaloes' assistants Jon Embree and
Brian Cabral.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell has plenty of candidates to choose from close to UCLA as
well. Nearly every current assistant has expressed a desire to stay
and Dorrell said he will speak with all of them. And at least two
friends and former teammates of the new coach who attended the news
conference want to join the staff -- former NFL and UCLA standouts
Ken Norton Jr. and James Washington. Neither has an extensive
coaching background.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a challenge for Dorrell to accommodate friends and
evaluate longtime loyal assistants while building the best possible
staff. He is not afraid of hiring assistants older and more
experienced than himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to bring in a bunch of 32-year-olds and say, 'OK,
guys, let's go do it,' " he said. "I'm receptive to a wide range of
people. I want diversity and experience."</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge will be to end off-the-field problems. Although
the current team had no serious incidents during the season, problems
ranging from the illegal use of handicapped parking placards to NCAA
violations to barroom brawls contributed to Toledo's firing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a firm believer in having open lines of communication with
players," Dorrell said. "This is a family atmosphere. My goal is to
have the type of relationship where they can come to me with
anything."</TE>
<TE>   As a player from 1982-86, Dorrell was known as a straight arrow.
As his career progressed he became a respected team leader as well as
an outstanding receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl might have been the quietest person on the team," said David
Norrie, a quarterback during Dorrell's career. "It got to the point
his first year that I wondered whether he was happy, and he told me
he was homesick [Dorrell went to Helix High near San Diego].</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say much in the huddle, but he said a lot after the
snap with his actions. And when he did say something, nobody took it
lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Now he returns as coach, still boyish-looking, still a straight
arrow. He walked onto Spaulding Field and felt tingles. It was as if
he had never left.</TE>
<TE>   "I flashed back to 1986 when I practiced there," he said. "It felt
the same. It was an unusual feeling, like I'd been gone only a day or
so."</TE>
<TE>   Now Craig Bragg and Tab Perry are making catches for UCLA. They
were among a handful of players who introduced themselves to the new
coach after practice.</TE>
<TE>   They don't quite know what to expect. But Dorrell assured them he
is in their corner.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be a grassroots type of coach, very hands-on," he said. "I
believe in the players and they will believe in me."</TE>

<HD>Kings' Win Over Ducks Is Too Much</HD>
<DH>After blowing two-goal lead in third period, L.A. wins,
5-4, on power-play goal by Smolinski.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go ahead, analyze this.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Bryan Smolinski chipped in a rebound to give the Kings
a 5-4 victory over the Ducks on Thursday, the 18,118 at Staples
Center were fairly worn out. Sorting this mess was going to take
time, for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom line was easy. The Kings extended their unbeaten streak
against the Ducks to nine games. The Ducks had their five
game-winning streak ended.</LD>
<TE>   Getting there was the hard part.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a rivalry now," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were playing their second game in as many nights, short
one defenseman, down two goals in the third period Thursday. Pack up
the gear and warm up the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>
<TE>   Only the Ducks don't travel in those bottom-feeding circles any
longer.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya ignited a three-goal outburst with a short-handed goal
on breakaway fresh out of the penalty box -- where he had been
serving an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Stanislav Chistov,
scoreless in the last 13 games, took a brilliant no-look pass from
Adam Oates to score the go-ahead goal with the Ducks' third
power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   Break out the video gear, send out for pizza. A midnight-oil video
session was on tap for the Kings, with the working title: What the
Heck Happened?</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>
<TE>   Only the Kings, as they have much of the season, found a way.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were without leading goal scorer, Adam Deadmarsh, who
was out dizziness problems and were already saddled with second,
third and fourth lines that were marked by inconsistency.</TE>
<TE>   "Some times funny things happen," King center Jason Allison said.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Chartrand was the one doing the chuckling. He redirected a
Jaroslav Modry shot to tie the score, 4-4, 11 minutes 48 seconds into
the third period. It was Chartrand's second goal of the game, his
first goals since the second game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski then entered the picture. The Ducks were called for too
many men on the ice with 2 minutes 55 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   It cost them.</TE>
<TE>   Allison fired a rebound on net that Jean-Sebastien Giguere blocked
only to have the puck plop at Smolinski's feet. The Ducks' defense,
worn out from over work, were in no position to stop his goal at
17:31, which was a healthy sigh of relief for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's huge," Smolinski said. "They had the game, but they were
so tired. Obviously, they played last night. I think on the bench we
kind of collected ourselves and kind of went back to playing our
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' defense was already spread thin because their top
defenseman, Keith Carney, was out with a stomach virus, leaving them
with only five healthy defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   "When a guy like Carney goes out five minutes before the game,
that's a pretty big blow," defenseman Niclas Havelid said. "But I
thought we played pretty well with only five defensemen. But not
having Carney changed the game a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were riding a winning streak that saw Giguere post three
shutouts and go 237 minutes 7 seconds without allowing a goal, the
third longest streak in NHL history.</TE>
<TE>   They were testing their new-found abilities in the first of three
consecutive games that the Ducks against Pacific Division teams and
remained winless against the division (0-5-2).</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there was honor in this defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight, we got behind the eight ball pretty early," Babcock
said. "We had a couple of tough breaks on penalty calls."</TE>

<HD>Swamped in New Jersey</HD>
<DH>Nets turn Finals rematch into a mismatch, 98-71, as Lakers
shoot 30%, Bryant misses 21 of 29 shots and O'Neal gets four
rebounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal left without even a glance, pushed through the door
that led to the bus that led to the rest of the season, and did not
look down and did not look to the side. Only straight ahead.</LD>
<LD>   To what though?</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, his Lakers, NBA champions the last three years, lost
again Thursday night to the New Jersey Nets, 98-71, at Continental
Airlines Arena. Six months before, these same Nets had a center or
three, and were overmatched four times in four games, and by the end
were simply glad the beating was over.</LD>
<TE>   And now it is the Lakers who measure progress in vague areas such
as not giving up too soon, not being too tense and not being so far
into this thing it can't be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   They are 10-17 and afterward Jason Kidd, who wrecked them with 27
points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, was kind enough to admit the
Lakers are "one of the best 10-17 teams out there," so right there
with the Chicago Bulls and Golden State Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd added, "I sure wouldn't want to play them in the first round
of the playoffs." The Lakers used to say that about, say, the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter or two from being one-third of the way through the
season that was supposed to be for a fourth consecutive title, the
Lakers, 2-12 on the road, are in a virtual tie for last place in the
Pacific Division. They set a Los Angeles franchise record for lowest
field-goal percentage in a game (30.2%) for the second time in a
month.</TE>
<TE>   They were outscored, 30-12, in a fourth quarter that began with
them down by nine ,and then nearly everyone, from Coach Phil Jackson
down, claimed to be somewhat satisfied with the end-to-end effort.
Getting better, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part we haven't been competitive all year," forward
Robert Horry said. "We can play for one quarter, then we just lay it
down. That's not going to cut it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he ever thought about, ahem, missing the playoffs, Horry
said crisply, "Every day."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, ever prideful, came home to New Jersey and left the
basketball game with about three minutes to play, behind by 21
points.</TE>
<TE>   He had 19 points and four rebounds in 37 minutes. On some nights,
better nights, he gets four rebounds in two possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, sagging with a sore throat and general fatigue,
withdrew about a minute later, behind then by 23. Prodded by Jackson
to be more aggressive with his offense early, Bryant missed 21 of 29
shots and scored 21 points, six in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   So, on the night Mike Bibby returned to the Sacramento Kings'
starting lineup, the Lakers remain 10 1/2 games out of first place in
the division, further behind in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   They conclude the trip tonight against Philadelphia and Sunday at
Toronto after barely showing up Tuesday in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been critical for a while in that this is not the way to
start a season," said Rick Fox, who did not score in 21 minutes.
"We're in a place we're unaccustomed to. We haven't handled it well
off the floor or on the floor. It's playing with our confidence. It's
playing with everything. We're digging ourselves a situation that's
very tough to fix."</TE>
<TE>   Holiday bells rang. The Nets led by 17 points with a little more
than five minutes left. The crowd stood and cheered and waved towels,
six months after they slunk away, having been blown out of the Finals
in a week.</TE>
<TE>   During practice Wednesday afternoon, after the media was herded
away and before the Lakers took the floor, Jackson had called
together the players and the coaches.</TE>
<TE>   And they talked. For half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson talked. Coaches talked. A few players talked.</TE>
<TE>   They decided the hole was large enough. They decided that the last
seven weeks, half of it without O'Neal, was real, was a problem, and
that they would not let it kill their season, as grim as it appeared,
as grim as it felt.</TE>
<TE>   They put their feet down. Drew the line. All those things.</TE>
<TE>   Then they lost by 27, on the day they all said they wouldn't yet
press for personnel changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Bryant said, "it's important for us to be patient.</TE>
<TE>   "It was better tonight. Totally honest. It was better. We didn't
hang our heads."</TE>
<TE>   And Jackson agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give these guys the opportunity to play hard
together," he said.</TE>

<LD>The delightful news conference/revival meeting at UCLA Thursday
reminded me of my favorite story about opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1978. Clifford Alexander, the Secretary of the Army, had
just been handed a proposed list of candidates for promotion to
general.</LD>
<LD>   He scanned the list and noticed that, even though the Army was
filled with soldiers of many races, all the general candidates were
white.</LD>
<TE>   He handed the list back to his subordinates and asked them to
double-check the files to make sure they weren't overlooking others
of equal achievement whose careers may have suffered from old
prejudices or stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   He asked them to look not only in the usual places, but in those
odd corners where talent might be blocked or hidden. He asked them to
look at these candidates not with preference, but with fairness.</TE>
<TE>   When they came back with a new list, it contained the name of
Colin Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Something similar happened at UCLA this week, and our entire
sports community is better because of it.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Dorrell wasn't hired as the new Bruin football coach because
he was black. He was hired because, after initially embracing the
safe, white choice of Mike Riley, UCLA officials weren't afraid to
keep looking.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell wasn't hired to make a statement about the mission of
diversity. He was hired to make a statement about the pursuit of
excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell wasn't the first candidate, or most traditional candidate,
or even the most popular candidate. But he was the best candidate, so
UCLA found him, even if it meant looking in an unusual spot, at an
unusual background, for a guy with an ethnicity shared by only three
other coaches among the 117 Division I-A football teams.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't this how true equal opportunity works? Hire the right person
no matter what their race or religion, even if it means breaking down
doors and rolling the dice?</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, the Denver Bronco receiver coach, just turned 39. He has
no head coaching experience at any level. When he played, he was a
receiver, a guy who lines up yards from any other teammates and
usually doesn't make a good coach.</TE>
<TE>   But he has studied under such notable coaches as Mike Shanahan,
Rick Neuheisel, Bill McCartney, Bruce Snyder and Terry Donahue.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped teams to three Rose Bowls, two Fiesta Bowls and two
Cotton Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, he is a former Bruin who never let anyone forget
it. So he deserved at least an interview.</TE>
<TE>   And when UCLA finally gave him that interview, even though it was
nearly a week after Riley's interview and seemed meaningless, he
dazzled them.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I am, if somebody opens the door, I'm going after it,"
Dorrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The same interview was offered to Mike Price, then of Washington
State. But he pulled his name out of consideration because he thought
the Bruins had already decided on Riley and were making a token
gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, if it's a token interview, I'm going to
make a second interview," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And so he did, barging his way into the office of Chancellor
Albert Carnesale, impressing him the way Athletic Director Dan
Guerrero impressed him last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It had nothing to do with race," Carnesale said. "He impressed me
with his quiet maturity, poise, leadership. He showed a passion that
was not about jumping up and down and waving his arms. He was a guy
with the right perspective."</TE>
<TE>   So was Carnesale, who has made two major athletic hirings, and
both have been minorities, and both seem like good fits.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it like, I have hired a dean of athletics, and a dean
of football," he said. "I have hired teachers."</TE>
<TE>   The lessons offered by Dorrell will be many, and varied, things
that others could not have taught.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a global community where we should celebrate
diversity," Guerrero said. "The fact that we see things through
different filters should be celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   "That Karl is African American will enrich our entire community.
He'll be a role model."</TE>
<TE>   College football, that most racially prejudiced of sporting
endeavors, could use one.</TE>
<TE>   Four black coaches among 117 teams? Even in a world of elitist NFL
owners and redneck baseball bosses, that's pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue, I know it is, that's part of our society," Dorrell
said. "Not every place is on equal ground."</TE>
<TE>   But while toiling as an assistant coach for 15 years, from Orlando
to Flagstaff, with only one other head coaching interview on his
resume, Dorrell never said a word.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, you just have to work," he said. "Sometimes you
have to work harder or longer, but you just keep working."</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged. "Life is not fair, I know that."</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes, life works. Sometimes, America's great melting pot
opens and something wonderful slips out.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, in the course of 24 hours, a man can go from a freezing
field in Denver to the warmth of a loud ovation among old friends.</TE>
<TE>   I've never before heard so many fans cheer at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   I've never before seen such smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "We all thought Mike Riley was the guy, we thought the new
athletic director would make the safe choice," former Bruin Ken
Norton Jr. said. "We're thrilled that he kept looking, and made the
right choice."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Dorrell will be a good head coach is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   But he has already said that, unlike Steve Lavin, he will not be
afraid to hire veteran assistants with head coaching experience.</TE>
<TE>   He also has said that he'll be wary of players trying to take
advantage of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "They can buddy up to me all they want," he said. "But they better
bust their butt."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, not much can be predicted about this new Bruin coach
in this new Bruin world. The only thing certain is, a man who
deserved a chance has been given one. For now, that's victory enough.</TE>

<HD>Housing Project Receives Key Vote</HD>
<DH>Ventura County OKs Ahmanson study, giving builder the
go-ahead to seek permits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The developer of Ahmanson Ranch secured a crucial but mixed blessing
Thursday from Ventura County supervisors, who agreed the proposed
community abutting Los Angeles County admirably balances the region's
housing needs and environmental concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The board's 4-1 vote gave owner Washington Mutual Bank the green
light to seek the state and federal permits required before
construction. But waiting at those agencies and in court will most
likely be a persistent coalition of environmentalists, celebrities
and neighboring cities opposed to the project.</LD>
<LD>   "We always hope there won't be litigation, but that might be a
false hope here," said Steve Weston, the developer's chief attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, almost immediately after the Board of Supervisors voted to
certify a second environmental study of the 3,050-home project,
officials in Calabasas and the city and county of Los Angeles said
they will probably file legal challenges next month to overturn the
supervisors' decision. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said he remains
concerned the project would degrade the surrounding environment.</TE>
<TE>   The project's neighbors contend the updated study is flawed
because it did not update 10-year-old traffic studies or fully
consider the recent discovery of a contaminated well near the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County "has clearly shown blatant disregard for its
neighbors and their best interests," Los Angeles City Councilman
Dennis Zine said. "This project is a disaster in the making."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch's critics say they would prefer to meet the
developer at the negotiating table, not in a courtroom, to craft a
deal preserving the ranchland as a park.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that it is not only in the best interest of the public
but in the best business interest of Washington Mutual Bank to sell
this land to a conservancy at a fair price," said Chad Griffin,
campaign manager for Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's vote maintains, if not boosts, the enormous value of
the ranch's 2,800 undeveloped acres. Estimates range from $100
million to $500 million, but Washington Mutual insists it has no
intention of selling.</TE>
<TE>   "Our plans are the same as they always have been," Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to develop Ahmanson Ranch was first approved in 1992
by a different group of Ventura County supervisors. As part of the
deal, the National Park Service and the state Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy became owners of 10,000 acres of Ahmanson and adjacent
ranches, preserving the grassy hills and oak savanna overlooking the
San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   That did not satisfy open-space activists, who have unsuccessfully
challenged the project in court and before government boards ever
since. Their cause got a lift in recent years from film director Rob
Reiner and friends, who have bankrolled the campaign and enlisted
state legislators, members of Congress and even Bill Clinton and Al
Gore to oppose the $2-billion development.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Judy Mikels said Thursday the "very
slick" campaign failed to change her mind on Washington Mutual's
"exceedingly good project."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disconcerted by outside officials getting into local
issues," she said. "They'll get their chance."</TE>
<TE>   Before it can build its community, Washington Mutual must secure
permits from the state Department of Fish and Game, state Regional
Water Quality Control Board, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. To varying degrees, all of those stops
are potential roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental study Ventura County supervisors evaluated
Thursday was a supplement to the original 1992 analysis. It was
primarily a plan for protecting the endangered red-legged frog and
San Fernando Valley spineflower, which were discovered on the
property three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the development's opponents used the public hearing to
reexamine traffic projections and other effects.</TE>
<TE>   They also asked supervisors to order a study of perchlorate, a
cancer-causing component of rocket fuel, that was detected in July in
a well proposed for irrigating the development's two golf courses.
The opponents cited bygone rocket-testing at Boeing's Santa Susana
Field Laboratory as the likely source of the contaminant. Scientists
at the lab dispute that argument.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-day parade of experts hired by opponents and the
developer, supervisors expressed concern over perchlorate
contamination in California but doubted the chemical poses any danger
to the Ahmanson project.</TE>
<TE>   Just destroy the well, the supervisors told the developer, and
find another way to water the project's golf courses and don't tap
any nearby wells if they are contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Opponent Griffin said the supervisors had ignored an opportunity
to protect the public from perchlorate. "They chose to pass the buck"
to state and federal agencies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors' decision followed 16 hours of testimony. So
voluminous were the documents that Supervisor Frank Schillo could
barely be seen over boxes of paper as he explained his support for
the development.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo is leaving office in 17 days, and Ahmanson's opponents had
hoped to delay the supervisors' vote until the inauguration of his
successor, slow-growth ally Linda Parks.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the 4-1 vote suggested the delay would not have
helped the opposition. Board Chairman John Flynn and Supervisor Kathy
Long joined Schillo and Mikels in certifying the environmental study
and a tract map of the development's first phase.</TE>
<TE>   The lone dissenter, Steve Bennett, said he wanted to see an
updated traffic study. Traffic has not been measured since the 1992
analysis, and Washington Mutual maintains the projections are close
enough to today's reality.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual move Thursday, the supervisors added to their
approval a requirement that the developer "consider" ways to assist
Ventura County in creating affordable housing for its many farm
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We need your help," said Flynn, who proposed the requirement.</TE>

<HD>Tribe Risks Rejection, Pushes Plan for Casino Near Capital</HD>
<DH>Foes fear approval would lead to gambling in cities; Pomo
hope to better their lives.</DH>

<DL>WEST SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Out where the rumbling interstate carves the edge of town, a
horseshoe-shaped vacant lot has become the latest proving ground for
California's venture into high-stakes gambling.</LD>
<LD>   The Upper Lake Pomo tribe hopes to build a $200-million casino and
hotel on a 67-acre plot it has optioned to buy, just up the highway
from a couple of billboards hawking Nevada gaming palaces.</LD>
<LD>   If it succeeds, the largely impoverished tribe of 150 would be
swimming in wealth. It would also accomplish something few tribes
have before, setting down gambling roots in an untapped urban market
far from its home on the languid shores of Clear Lake, 80 miles
northwest as the eagle flies.</LD>
<TE>   Foes worry that it could set a dangerous precedent, kicking off a
land rush of tribal casinos -- long relegated to California's rural
outskirts -- into the state's metropolitan core. With more than 50
California tribes still seeking federal recognition and many more
still hunting for a land base, the state could face ballooning
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Pomo tribe's casino, planned as a virtual replica of the
golden statehouse dome just across the Sacramento River, has drawn
opposition from U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Gov. Gray
Davis. They worry that voters who supported Native American gaming on
the 2000 statewide ballot didn't envision high-stakes gambling
invading California's largest cities.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to deal us right out of the game," said David
Rosenberg, the governor's senior advisor for intergovernmental
affairs. "If they can build in West Sacramento, what's to stop some
other tribe from saying they want to do gaming in downtown Los
Angeles or in the middle of Hollywood or in the heart of San
Francisco?"</TE>
<TE>   Those are misleading words, said Carmella Icay-Johnson, the
soft-spoken tribal leader of the Upper Lake Pomo. Blustery foes are
making her tribe out to be a boogeyman, she said, arguing that the
Pomo's plans for a casino on the urban edge won't set a precedent.
Instead, it is their one-shot opportunity to wrest free of their
dreary lives in rural Lake County.</TE>
<TE>   Backing the Pomo is a troika of Sarasota, Fla., businessmen who
stand to gain 30% of the proceeds for financing, building and running
the casino.</TE>
<TE>   The promoter is Roy Palmer. An erstwhile Chicago attorney and
inveterate character, Palmer is white-haired, favors a walrus
mustache and wears bow ties and loud sports coats. Native American
gambling has been very, very good to him.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, he formed Buffalo Brothers Management Inc. to help
the St. Croix Chippewa of Wisconsin develop two casinos. The
corporation's fee was huge: 40% to run the casino, an additional 30%
off slot machines they leased the tribe. Disgruntled tribal members
sued, saying they were being taken. In 1994, the St. Croix bought
Palmer out for a reported $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, ever buoyant, says the dispute was overblown, cooked up by
a rival casino outfit. At 67, Palmer says, he has now stepped out of
Florida retirement -- "I was playing tennis seven days a week,
reading books, taking naps" -- mostly out of a desire to help the
Upper Lake Pomo.</TE>
<TE>   The proceeds reaped by Palmer and his partners -- fellow Florida
retirees Robert Roskamp and Philip Kaltenbacher, former chairman of
New Jersey's Republican Party -- will go toward philanthropy, Palmer
said. If the tribe succeeds, it would have a lucrative market of 1.5
million residents in the Sacramento region at the doorstep of its
casino, right beside busy Interstate 80. The highway links the Bay
Area -- and millions more potential customers -- with the Lake
Tahoe-Reno area, which has already seen its casino business plummet
as California's tribal gambling receipts have soared to $5 billion a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone fighting us is fighting out of fear,"
Icay-Johnson said. "But we feel we've been wronged over the years,
and this could help fulfill our dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many tribes in the West, the Pomo tell a story of
centuries of suffering. Their people endured the Spanish, then the
Russian foray into Northern California, the brutality of the Gold
Rush and the arrival of modern civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1907, the federal government established a small ranch
on Clear Lake's north shore for the cluster of homeless Native
Americans who made up the tribe. Fifty years later, the U.S. reversed
course, promising the land to individual members if the tribe
disbanded. Within years, much of that land was lost to unpaid taxes
or sold off.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1983, the Pomo joined about two dozen other Northern
California tribes that regained federal recognition through the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   That old legal case is now at the heart of the tribe's casino
push. The Pomo are angling in federal court to reopen the old deal as
a way to sidestep the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which
largely restricts casino development to land a tribe held before the
act's passage. The act also requires that tribes get state permission
if casino land is acquired after 1988; the Pomo hope to avoid that
caveat as well, skirting an almost certain rejection by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Icay-Johnson says a Pomo casino on Sacramento's edge would set no
precedent for other tribes. Casino foes disagree, saying the case
would blow open the doors to California cities.</TE>
<TE>   To their dismay, the Upper Lake Pomo have for weeks engaged in
settlement negotiations with Interior Department officials, who face
a deadline today to say in court whether they will oppose the tribe's
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the tribe's three wealthy backers have mounted an
aggressive lobbying push at Interior. During the first half of the
year, they paid Washington lobbyists $160,000.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe would appear to face an uphill fight. Interior Secretary
Gale Norton last month said she was troubled by the increasing push
by tribes to establish casinos in urban settings. She also rejected a
Louisiana deal that would have allowed a tribe to build a casino 150
miles from its historic lands.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, foes of the West Sacramento casino worry that the resolve
of Interior officials could melt, said Mike McGowan, a supervisor in
Yolo County, which includes West Sacramento. "If the federal
government is not going to fight the tribe on this, then all the rest
of us are helpless."</TE>
<TE>   California officials, meanwhile, are going to the mat.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said in a Dec. 6 letter to Norton that a West Sacramento
casino represents a dangerous precedent that would serve only to
encourage other tribes and their financiers to seek sites "near major
highways and urban areas." She called it "a radical distortion of the
will of California voters."</TE>
<TE>   West Sacramento, a town of 30,000 just across the river from
California's capital, is abuzz over the pitfalls and prospects of a
lucrative casino. The City Council recently approved a deal that
would eventually pour $14 million a year from the casino into
municipal coffers to offset the costs of police, fire and other
services. But earlier this month, a citizens group turned in a
referendum petition in hopes of reversing the council deal.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Bakus, a West Sacramento attorney, sees a lot to worry about
-- traffic, vice, all the sorts of problems the little city has for
years tried to fix.</TE>
<TE>   He also fears the tribe would have a stranglehold on city
politics. "We might as well make the city one big Indian reservation,
because they could buy any election we have," he said. "I'm not sure
I want to see Roy Palmer as the next kingmaker of West Sacramento."</TE>

<HD>Judge Might Delay Special O.C. Election</HD>
<DH>Measure V -- which allows voters to fill the vacancy on the
Board of Supervisors -- is flawed, jurist says. He may void county's
new charter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge on Thursday threw into disarray plans for a
Jan. 28 special election to fill a vacant Board of Supervisors seat,
saying the ballot measure that made the vote possible is seriously
flawed and may be thrown out.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Banks suggested that the election
could be postponed until he makes a final decision on the validity of
Measure V, which voters approved to give voters -- rather than the
governor -- the power to fill board vacancies.</LD>
<LD>   If he finds the charter is unconstitutional, the election would be
called off, raising the possibility that Gov. Gray Davis would
ultimately appoint a supervisor.</LD>
<TE>   County attorneys will ask the board in a special meeting today
whether they want to spend money on the election -- a minimum of
$292,000 -- given Banks' warnings.</TE>
<TE>   By law, supervisors cannot stop or postpone the election on their
own but can ask the judge to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really in limbo," said board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad,
who said she's still reviewing the court proceedings and hasn't
decided how to vote. "It puts the county in an awkward position, and
it puts the candidates in an awkward position."</TE>
<TE>   Banks' comments came three days after the registrar of voters
finalized the Jan. 28 ballot and as the five qualified candidates
were out campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V was approved by Orange County voters in March. Before
then, the county was governed by the general laws of the state.
Measure V created a county charter, allowing Orange County to craft
some of its own regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, written by outgoing Supervisor Todd Spitzer,
contained a single provision allowing voters to fill board vacancies
instead of the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V won broad support from the local Republican party
because without a charter, Davis, a Democrat, would appoint Spitzer's
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Banks on Thursday faulted Measure V, saying it gave voters the
mistaken impression that any future changes in the charter would be
made only by a vote of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Except for filling board vacancies, the charter simply carries
over all other state laws and regulations. And those rules, the judge
said, can be changed by the state Legislature without approval from
county voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that this type of deficiency ... exposes the
entire measure to challenge and to possible failure because what the
voters were told may clearly be incorrect," Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge will take up the matter again on Jan. 21. He said he
might postpone the election on his own if the trial is delayed beyond
that date -- a warning to the county's attorneys to cooperate on
pre-trial matters.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ruled that no other candidates could run if the
election is postponed.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit challenging Measure V was filed by several citizens,
headed by Joe Kerr, chief of Orange County's firefighters union.
Their lawyers argued that the new charter failed to follow seven of
the eight state constitutional guidelines on how counties may
establish home rule.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, as well as county attorneys, said the measure met all
constitutional requirements, and also should be upheld because it put
decisions in the hands of voters.</TE>
<TE>   He said Thursday that supervisors already authorized spending
money on the election, so it should go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the measure was designed to boost the political
fortunes of former Assemblyman Bill Campbell, one of the announced
candidates. Spitzer endorsed Campbell, and some believe Spitzer
sponsored Measure V to help Campbell. Spitzer has denied political
motives.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the five candidates seeking the 3RD District seat are
Republican, as are most of the district's registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates for supervisor are former Tustin Councilman
Jim Potts; Robert Douglas of Orange, a reserve deputy sheriff;
Douglas Boeckler, a supervising veterans representative from Orange;
and William A. Wetzel, an educator from Orange.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Stymied on D.A.'s Fund</HD>
<DH>Rackauckas' office has withheld data, saying providing the
documentation would jeopardize investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's auditor says he cannot tell whether a fund overseen
by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas was spent inappropriately because the
office has not provided him with detailed documentation on its use.</LD>
<LD>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom started investigating the
fund in October, four months after the Orange County Grand Jury said
the office's chief investigator inappropriately billed the fund
repeatedly for bar tabs.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas wrote Sundstrom last month to say that all expenses
billed to the special fund were related to criminal or civil
investigations. He did not identify the people who were entertained
or provide further detail, saying such disclosure would jeopardize
investigations, Sundstrom said.</LD>
<TE>   In June, the grand jury accused Investigations Chief Don
Blankenship of using the fund to pay for meal and alcohol expenses
during meetings with politicians, lobbyists, clergy and reporters.
According to the report, Blankenship billed the fund 38 times for
tabs he ran up at the Elks Club in Santa Ana. Some expenses were for
food and alcohol, but most were exclusively for alcohol, the report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury concluded that the spending violated a 1994 office
policy that stated that money from the special fund Blankenship
tapped should be used primarily for investigations or cases.
Blankenship billed the fund more than $4,600 between 1999 and 2001,
according to the grand jury report, which did not say what portion of
that spending it found questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas sent the auditor a memo from Blankenship that --
contradicting the grand jury -- indicated that all alcohol and food
purchases the chief billed to the fund involved "criminal or civil
investigations or cases."</TE>
<TE>   Because the district attorney did not provide detailed
documentation, the auditor said, he could not resolve the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney is telling me I'd jeopardize criminal
investigations by getting access to those documents. Given that, I
have to take him at his word," Sundstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom said he is now considering asking the state attorney
general's office to investigate because he believes its staff would
have better access to the internal records.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm somewhat uncomfortable because there's a discrepancy between
what the grand jury reported and the [district attorney's findings],"
Sundstrom said. "I might want a third party to give it a fresh look."</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's officials did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office did provide receipts for three
meals totaling about $135. Rackauckas said those expenses were
incurred during meetings about proposed DNA evidence legislation that
could impact Orange County cases. The receipts -- two check stubs and
one credit-card receipt -- listed dollar figures but not whether
alcohol was purchased. "They don't do much for us," the auditor said.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom's letter said he does not plan to pursue any of the
other records Rackauckas has declined to provide, saying he
understands the need to keep criminal investigations confidential.
Sundstrom does not have subpoena power that would compel the district
attorney to turn over the records. He initiated the review as part of
his duties as the elected auditor-controller, not at the direction of
the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, the auditor told Rackauckas that he will work with
district attorney staff to develop a policy "that will provide us
with greater assurance that special appropriations funds are being
used properly."</TE>
<TE>   It is a violation of county policy for employees to bill the
county for alcohol, except in rare instances, such as when detectives
drink to blend in during an undercover operation.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom said he would have sought reimbursement from the
district attorney if he had proved the fund was used on alcohol
expenses not related to investigations.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, the auditor also criticized Rackauckas for letting
the fund finance Blankenship's attendance at training seminars and
conferences, expenses that the auditor said should be billed to the
office's general fund.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Elementary Schools May Get Sixth Grade Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is considering a shift of
sixth-grade classes next year from some middle schools to as many as
124 elementary schools that now end at fifth grade, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The reconfiguration, proposed to begin in July, is supposed to
help ease crowding in middle schools and add more instruction days
for students on year-round calendars. It would take advantage of a
demographic shift that has left some elementary campuses with more
room for students than the upper levels.</LD>
<LD>   "The big population bulge that went through the system is now
entering high schools, so we're not quite so impacted at the
elementary schools," said Merle Price, the district's deputy
superintendent for instruction.</LD>
<TE>   As word of the possible change has started to spread through the
district, it is drawing mixed reactions. The teachers union opposes
it, saying it would be disruptive. Some parents and principals
welcome it, saying it would help sixth-graders academically and keep
them in the more sheltered elementary school environment for another
year.</TE>
<TE>   "If sixth-graders can fit in an elementary school, there is an
advantage to it," said Gordon Wohlers, chief of staff for Supt. Roy
Romer.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified has raised average test scores at the elementary
level for four years in a row, an achievement officials believe has
been driven by reading and math reforms. It will be easier to stay on
target with such efforts if some sixth-grade students remain in the
smaller elementary school setting, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want more personalization," said Wohlers. "Rather than having
middle school students see six teachers every day, we're trying to
reduce that so ... the teachers get to know the children better."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which officials stress remains under study, is expected
to be presented to the Board of Education in January. It could affect
about a third of the district's 425 elementary campuses and 19 of its
74 middle schools.</TE>
<TE>   The primary goal is to switch elementary and middle school
students who are currently on a three-track, 163-day schedule, onto a
four-track 180-day schedule. The calendar change could put more
middle school students on campus at the same time, so it would be
helpful to transfer sixth-graders to elementary campuses, Wohlers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the demographic shift, some elementary campuses have extra
space because of the opening of a handful of new primary centers that
include kindergarten through second-grade students.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified has 415 elementary schools that run from kindergarten
through fifth grade. Ten other elementary schools still enroll
sixth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Campa, principal of the 700-student O'Melveny Elementary
School in San Fernando, said she was surprised when she was notified
recently that her school might be asked to include sixth-grade
students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're an overcrowded school already," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Verna B. Dauterive, principal of the 450-student Franklin
Elementary School in Los Feliz, said she is delighted by the prospect
of giving sixth-grade students a better learning setting.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have extra space and we welcome the sixth-graders," she
said. "We really prefer to have our sixth-graders with us, even
though they're a little taller and all of that. They still need the
nurturing that elementary school students [get]."</TE>
<TE>   Elementary schools will be excluded from becoming K-6 campuses if
doing so would cause more students to be bused, worsen crowding or
put more students on year-round calendars, Price said.</TE>
<TE>   The district's last grade-level reorganization began in 1985 and
took more than seven years to complete, Price said. High schools
began enrolling students in grades nine through 12, instead of
starting with 10th grade. Middle schools, which previously enrolled
grades seven through nine, switched to grades six through eight.</TE>
<TE>   The changes were implemented, in part, because college admissions
requirements are based on a ninth- through 12th-grade system, Price
said.</TE>
<TE>   John Perez, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the
union opposes the plan because it will complicate the lives of
parents and teachers. The last reconfiguration took years for staff
and families to get used to, he said. He added that there has not
been enough teacher or community input.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed four-track system would work like a college quarter
system, said Larry Carletta, a district administrator involved in the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   There would be four 60-day blocks of instruction, and each student
would attend three of them, he said. Students would have shorter
vacations and more continuous stretches of class days, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A common criticism of three-track calendars, and some four-track
schedules, is that B-track students, who end one school term on June
27, then start a new one on July 1, are given unequal educational
opportunities. B-track has the most erratic schedule and the fewest
magnet and advanced placement courses available.</TE>
<TE>   But Wohlers said the district will try to work with each school to
see which configuration is most suitable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a one-size-fits-all," he said. "And, of course,
nothing is final yet."</TE>

<HD>INS Arrest Numbers Inflated, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Officials accuse groups of exaggerating figures involving
immigrants from Muslim countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justice Department officials, after days of refusing to disclose the
number of men and boys from Muslim countries arrested this week at
INS offices, insisted Thursday that groups with a "bias against the
system" had exaggerated the figures.</LD>
<LD>   Groups representing Iranian and Arab immigrants in Southern
California estimated Wednesday that between 500 and 700 men and boys,
mostly Iranians, had been arrested in Southern California when they
appeared at Immigration and Naturalization Service offices in
response to a government order to register and be fingerprinted. INS
officials, speaking anonymously Wednesday, said that they did not
dispute those figures.</LD>
<LD>   But Jorge Martinez, a Justice Department spokesman, said the total
number of people detained in Southern California was "in the low
200s." Most of those have been released, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "As of midafternoon today, less than 100 people were in detention.
Those numbers keep dwindling down," he said. Many people were being
released on bail and told to report back at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who escorted clients to INS offices and groups
representing Iranian and Arab immigrants, however, continued to say
that the number of people who had been detained was higher than the
INS figure. They agreed, however, that most have been released on
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez also denounced reports that detainees had been treated
badly -- shoved into overcrowded cells or hosed down with cold water
-- calling the charges made by lawyers and relatives of detainees
"preposterous allegations."</TE>
<TE>   "I think these are people who obviously have some bias against the
system blowing things out of proportion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation with arrests in Southern California was "unique," he
said, because of the region's large Iranian population and because
many people here had waited until the registration deadline to come
forward. Many people had to be detained until the INS could complete
background checks, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Under INS rules, men and boys older than 16 from certain countries
who are in the United States on temporary visas are required to
register. Citizens of the first five countries covered -- Iran, Iraq,
Syria, Libya and Sudan -- were required to register by Monday of this
week. People from an additional 13 countries are required to register
in January.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's response came as criticism of the INS'
handling of the registration program continued.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice) wrote INS acting Commissioner Michael
J. Garcia urging him to quickly hold a series of town hall meetings
to explain the INS actions. The INS handling of the detentions could
"set back our nation's fight against terrorism," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the individuals who complied with the INS registration
could be resources for our war; now they have been alienated."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez defended the detentions, which he called temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority was visa overstays or other immigration
violations," he said. "It is the INS' duty to detain and process
these individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the appropriate action that they have to take. We want to
make sure that we're not letting people back into the community who
pose a threat to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, many civil liberties groups and immigrants'
rights advocates have questioned both the Justice Department's
numbers and the rationale for the detentions. Because of the arrests,
the registration program has hurt national security efforts, not
helped them, the groups say.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California, the Iranian American Lawyers Assn., the Council
on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim Public Affairs Council and
the Japanese American Citizens League were among the groups that
called on the government to end the registration program or extend
registration deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Salam al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, said his organization faced a credibility problem with some
of those it serves after announcing the registration requirements on
its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Members of our community are angry with us and feel that we
should apologize," Al-Marayati said. "We've been helping law
enforcement open doors throughout the community and telling people
that they should not fear the government; they're here to protect us.
So this is a major setback."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati said he had been told by an immigration lawyer that as
many as 1,000 people had been arrested in Southern California. He
said he believed that terrorists might benefit from all the
commotion.</TE>
<TE>   "They have driven people into hiding now," he said of the INS.
"And if there are any more [Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed] Attas and
sleeper cells, well, now they can bury themselves amidst all this
noise when before they might have been easier to detect."</TE>
<TE>   Others said terrorists would not have complied with voluntary
registration anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has confused immigration policy with national
security policy and is treating them as if they are the same thing,"
said Hussein Ibish, communications director for the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The detentions seem likely to be challenged in court.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Karen K. Meade, a Cleveland attorney representing four
men from Syria and Iran, filed suit asking a federal judge to stop
the INS from trying to deport them. The men were taken into custody
by the INS Monday after registering, but later released on bail. The
suit contends that the special registration program improperly
discriminates against people based on ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Sedeghat, an attorney in Sherman Oaks, said he plans to file
a federal lawsuit soon contending that the INS has conducted the
registration program in an unconstitutional manner.</TE>

<HD>Fullmer Might Lose His Wings</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels could bid farewell to designated hitter Brad Fullmer
today.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels and Fullmer's agent, Arn Tellem, were believed to be
discussing a contract that would avoid an arbitration hearing. As of
Thursday, the Angels were leaning toward releasing Fullmer if they
could not reach a contract agreement by today's deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels want to keep Fullmer, but they do not want to risk a
hearing in which an arbitrator could award him a salary of as much as
$5 million. He made $3.75 million last season.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman declined to discuss the situation.
Tellem did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, 27, hit .289 with 19 home runs and 59 runs batted in last
season. The Angels have discussed alternatives as a left-handed
designated hitter, including David Ortiz, whom the Minnesota Twins
released this week. The Twins didn't want to risk arbitration with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, 27, who made $950,000 last season, hit .272 with 20 homers
and 75 RBIs last season. He batted cleanup in all but one game of the
American League championship series against the Angels, hitting .313.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels signed utility infielder Benji Gil to a one-year
contract worth $725,000, avoiding arbitration. They are expected to
offer contracts to three arbitration-eligible players -- infielder
Adam Kennedy and pitchers Jarrod Washburn and Scott Schoeneweis --
but not to reliever Al Levine. Levine started last season as setup
man to closer Troy Percival but did not make the playoff roster.</TE>

<LD>A gambling investigation at Florida State centers on former Seminole
quarterback Adrian McPherson, who was kicked off the team last month
after he was accused of stealing a check.</LD>
<LD>   University Vice President John Carnaghi said Thursday that police
"are investigating rumors and hearsay regarding a single, former
football player, Adrian McPherson. The investigation does not
currently extend to any other student-athletes at FSU."</LD>
<LD>   McPherson's lawyer, Grady Irvin Jr., said his client has never bet
on a sporting event. McPherson started four games, going 3-1.</LD>
<TE>   "We will not participate in this unbelievable rumor that is being
fueled by persons known, persons unknown and a salivating media,"
Irvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about rumors of on-campus gambling, Florida State asked
for assistance last month from the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement. The agency assigned members of its Tallahassee office
along with investigators from its seven regional offices to assist.
After a four-week investigation, no other students or athletes have
been implicated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John L. Smith said becoming coach at Michigan State was "like a
dream come true." The manner in which he left Louisville was the
difficult part.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 54, signed a six-year contract to coach the Spartans after
guiding the Cardinals against Marshall in the GMAC Bowl on Wednesday.
Louisville lost, 38-15.</TE>
<TE>   During the game, several Cardinal fans received calls saying Smith
might be headed elsewhere. Word trickled to the Louisville bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I come off at halftime and everybody knows," he said. "It was not
pretty and I apologize for that. That was my fault. I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was in a more jovial mood when asked about the mysterious
"L" in his name, saying he would divulge this only once: the L stands
for "Lansing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Craig Ochs, a former Colorado quarterback who transferred to
Montana, told the Rocky Mountain News that he had a falling out with
Gary Barnett after the coach interrupted a team prayer. "He told me
he was sick and tired of how I prayed," Ochs said. Barnett's reply:
"I just felt like we needed a little more pep in our prayer. I went
up to him the next day and thought I had explained to him why I did
what I did and those sorts of things, but apparently he didn't take
it the same way I meant it." ... Marshall's former athletic
compliance director, Dave Ridpath, filed a $1-million lawsuit against
the school and Coach Bob Pruett, charging the coach with making false
statements to NCAA investigators regarding the monitoring of
employment of athletes by multimillionaire booster Marshall
Reynolds.... East Carolina's new coach reportedly will be Florida
defensive coordinator John Thompson, 47.... Bowling Green promoted
offensive coordinator Gregg Brandon, 46, to head coach.... Washington
defensive backs coach Bobby Hauck reportedly is set to be named the
coach at Montana.... Maine linebacker Stephen Cooper pleaded guilty
in federal court to possession of steroids, a misdemeanor.</TE>

<HD>Virus Forces Carney to Miss Game</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks had to play without their best defenseman against
the Kings on Thursday at Staples Center when Keith Carney sat out
because of a stomach virus.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, already without Ruslan Salei, who has a strained muscle
in his right side, played with five defensemen.</LD>
<LD>   Carney and Salei each average more than 20 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Duck officials will consider recalling a defenseman from minor
league Cincinnati. The Ducks do not play again until Sunday, when
they face Phoenix at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea Keith was ill and I was led to believe that
[Salei] was ready to play," General Manager Bryan Murray said. "We'll
have to see how Keith is. But we were playing with five defensemen,
then [defenseman] Niclas Havelid gets hit with a high stick that
doesn't get seen and we were without him half the first period."</TE>
<TE>   Havelid played only 5 minutes 37 seconds in the first, leaving the
defense duties to Kurt Sauer, Fredrik Olausson, Pavel Trnka and
Vitaly Vishnevski.</TE>
<TE>   Salei sat out for the ninth time in 10 games. There is no
timetable for his return.</TE>
<TE>   -- Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Jamie Storr has gotten most of the starts against the
Ducks the last two seasons, King Coach Andy Murray started Felix
Potvin in goal Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings playing only three games this week, the nod went to
a rested Potvin, who was 14-3-6 all-time against the Ducks before
Thursday. Storr is 6-2-4 against the Ducks in his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Adam Deadmarsh, who has been experiencing dizziness,
sat out his second consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Players Skeptical of Kings' Money Woes</HD>
<DH>Norstrom, Schneider dismiss Leiweke's assertion that team
may have to be sold as rhetoric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King players dismissed as rhetoric Thursday club President Tim
Leiweke's contention that the franchise is on thin ice financially
and Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz may be forced to sell if he
continues to lose money.</LD>
<LD>   Leiweke, refuting a Forbes magazine report that pegged the club's
operating income for last season at a $7-million profit, said this
week that the Kings haven't made money since Anschutz assumed
ownership in October 1995 and, in fact, have taken a $103-million
bath.</LD>
<LD>   They will continue hemorrhaging money, he said, unless the NHL and
the players' union dramatically revamp their collective bargaining
agreement, which expires in 2004. Anschutz will sell, he added, if
significant changes are not made.</LD>
<TE>   "The closer we get to 2004, the more of these kinds of articles
you're going to see," team captain Mattias Norstrom said. "It's
pretty much saying it's in the players' hands, that if they want to
kill the sport, go ahead and do it.</TE>
<TE>   "My only comment to that is, we're in a marketplace that the teams
themselves created -- paying the salaries at this level, what they're
paying for free agents. You only pay as much as the market
tolerates."</TE>
<TE>   Said defenseman Mathieu Schneider of Leiweke's comments: "It's
just negotiations. Obviously, they're setting themselves up. They
want a salary cap; it's no secret. And we don't; that's no secret.
Those things aren't going to change, and after that everything
becomes negotiable."</TE>
<TE>   According to documents shown The Times by Leiweke and Dan
Beckerman, chief financial officer of Anschutz Entertainment Group,
which owns the Kings and Staples Center, the Kings have enjoyed
strong revenue growth since Anschutz took over, built Staples Center
and moved the club into the $400-million building.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, payroll and other expenses have soared.
The average NHL player salary, for example, has nearly doubled from
$984,000 in the 1996-97 season, Anschutz's first full season as
owner, to $1.7 million this season. Leiweke said the Kings are
spending 86% of every new dollar on salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Counter the skeptical players: Something doesn't add up.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard time personally seeing that smart businessmen like
[Anschutz and Leiweke] would go into a situation like Staples Center,
like the Kings, without seeing an upside," Norstrom said. "I have a
hard time seeing them going into hockey and not having a vision that,
'This is something that's going to be a good business for us,'
building Staples Center and doing everything they've done for us in
this beautiful practice facility [in El Segundo]....</TE>
<TE>   "So I would be surprised if they were losing money."</TE>
<TE>   Added Schneider: "We've seen it before. It's posturing."</TE>

<LD>MIAMI AT MINNESOTA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Saturday, 10:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   TV: Channel 2.</LD>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Welcome back, Carter. Or maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Cris Carter returns to Minnesota, where he spent 12 seasons
and caught 1,004 passes -- and will gladly recount every one for you,
so pull up a chair. The Dolphins need this game to retain first place
in the AFC East, but other than that, Carter contends, and pretends,
that this game is no big deal for him. "I've proven myself over the
years," he says. "I don't have to do anything in Minnesota that could
solidify me. I'm very secure in my ability as a player. Do I want to
be on the field and play? Of course. Do I feel like I can make a
difference in the game? Of course. That goes without saying."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's headline: "Vikings Glad Carter's Gone -- That Goes
Without Saying"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Saturday, 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Snake prepares to leave the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Home, sweet home has recently soured for Jake Plummer, the
once-celebrated Snake who has seen the best of Sun Devil Stadium
(Arizona State's 11-1 season in 1996) and the worst (Arizona
Cardinals, most Sundays, 1999-2002). With his contract up after this
season, Plummer could be playing his final home game at Sun Devil
Stadium against the 49ers. "Which of you guys has my bus ticket?"
Plummer joked with Cardinal beat writers this week. Cardinal Coach
Dave McGinnis says Plummer deserves to be a starting quarterback in
the NFL, "absolutely." But in Arizona? Not so absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's headline: "Another Plummer Bummer"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHILADELPHIA AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Saturday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: How low can Campo go?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: "He just keeps firing away," Eagle Coach Andy Reid said,
"and that's important." Fortunately for Cowboy Coach Dave Campo, Reid
was talking about Eagle quarterback A.J. Feeley, who is 3-0 heading
into his fourth NFL start, and not Cowboy owner Jerry Jones, who has
shown uncharacteristic patience with Campo after seasons of 5-11,
5-11 and 5-9 with two losses to go. But Dallas' 37-7 loss to the
Giants probably forced Jones' hand to push the door open. "At this
point in the season," Jones said after the defeat, "we should be
better. And we're not."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's headline: "Jones Running Out of Patience, Campo Running
Out of Job"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT AT ATLANTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 10 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Mike versus Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: This week's "Young Guns" episode -- Michael Vick meets Joey
Harrington -- was canceled when Harrington was hospitalized and
treated for an irregular heartbeat. The doctors say Harrington is
fine, but he won't play again this season, so the Lions will turn
their last two games over to Mike McMahon, the team's one-time
"quarterback of the future." On paper, this appears to be a blowout
-- especially with the Falcons at home and needing a victory to
clinch a playoff berth. But Seattle-Atlanta had the same look and the
Falcons lost in overtime. McMahon, Matt Hasselbeck? Is there any
difference?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Finally, Quick Vick Lumbers Into Playoffs"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BUFFALO AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: "Second String" and other yuletide fairy tales.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Just in time for the holiday season, TNT is serving up a
movie called "Second String," in which a backup quarterback leads the
Buffalo Bills to triumph in the Super Bowl. (Yes, that's TNT, not the
Science Fiction Channel.) Gil Bellows plays the Buffalo quarterback
-- good to see his career has taken off since "Ally McBeal" -- but
only in the movie. Believe it or not, that's still Drew Bledsoe on
the field for the real Bills, despite that 11-for-33 performance
against San Diego and a 73 quarterback rating in Buffalo's last six
games. Brett Favre, first string now and forever, wins this one with
ease.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Real Bills Discover Reality Bites"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Carr, bracing for impact.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: David Carr is the only man to take a center snap in the
history of the Houston Texans. Or, to put it another way: Help! In 14
games, Carr has been sacked 70 times, two shy of the NFL record for
quarterback abuse set by Randall Cunningham in 1986. Word is that
Texan beat writers have started a ghoul pool, betting on which
offensive lineman will give up the historic 73rd sack, which very
likely will happen against the Redskins. At the same time, running
back Stephen Davis probably plays his last home game for the
Redskins, Redskin running backs having been rendered obsolete by
Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Carr Only Hurts When He Loses"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICAGO AT CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Carolina by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Doesn't speak softly, carries a big kick.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Because the NFL has not canceled the game and reporters
covering the Bears and Panthers need something to write about,
all-pro Panther punter Todd Sauerbrun, an ex-Bear, conducted
interviews this week detailing his five unhappy years in Chicago.
Sauerbrun, as cocky as a 1995 rookie as he is now, said the Bears
initially tried to break him: "They wanted to make me dirt on the
bottom of their shoe and build me up from there. I don't agree with
that. They went about it all wrong and got nothing out of me." As
Panther-Bear bulletin-board fodder goes, that's as good as it's going
to get.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Sauerbrun Kicks Bears When They're Down"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   N.Y. GIANTS AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Not the greatest game in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Forty-four years ago, these two teams played the Greatest
Game Ever Played, the Colts defeating the Giants in overtime to win
the 1958 NFL championship. In that game the Colts handed the ball in
the clutch to Alan Ameche. Now it's ... James Mungro? That's what the
Colts did last Sunday after trailing Cleveland at the half, 16-0.
Mungro replaced Edgerrin James in the second half and scored twice as
Indianapolis rallied for a 28-23 victory. This time, the Colts and
Giants play for more modest stakes -- wild card, anyone? -- but the
Giants are 0-4 against teams with winning records. Oh-and-five,
anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Giants' Playoff Bid Another Thing of the Past"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TENNESSEE AT JACKSONVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Rock and Rolle, Part Two.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Two seasons went careening off in different directions when
Tennessee cornerback Samari Rolle laid his helmet-to-helmet hit on
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell on Oct. 13. Tennessee, 1-4 at
the time, went on to win that game, and seven more, during an 8-1
run. Jacksonville never really recovered; the Jaguars began that game
3-1 and are 3-7 since. Rolle was fined $7,500 for the play, but it
appears Brunell and the Jaguars paid the bigger penalty. Jaguar Coach
Tom Coughlin admits the hit adversely affected his team: "We didn't
function as well as we had been going in."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Once Again, Titans Rolle"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Hobbling to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Marty Schottenheimer returns to Kansas City, scans the old
place and what does he find? Two teams resembling shells of their
former selves. Schottenheimer's Chargers, once 6-1, have lost five of
seven games and quarterback Drew Brees hasn't thrown a touchdown pass
in a month. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have blown out an offensive
backfield -- fullback Tony Richardson is on injured reserve and
Priest Holmes is doubtful because of a hip injury. "I would say
there's a good chance it's over," Coach Dick Vermeil said. He was
talking about Holmes' season. And probably the Chiefs' as well.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Schottenheimer Wins Shell Game"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT CINCINNATI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Ebenezer Scrooge, Carson Palmer see their futures,
shudder mightily.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Sorry to throw a wet blanket over Palmer's Heisman Trophy
celebration, but after the Bengals lose to the Saints on Sunday,
Cincinnati will have the No. 1 pick in the 2003 draft. Oh, right.
Party over. Jon Kitna, the current Cincinnati quarterback, could have
warned Palmer to run, save yourself, it's too late for me -- but
instead opted for: "As an organization, we don't expect to win....
Until you expect to win and do the things that are necessary to win
-- until you give your players reason for optimism -- you're going to
have a tough time." Well said. Reminder: It's still not too late to
tank the Senior Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bengals Ghosts of Laughingstock Present"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Seattle by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Next year's quarterback controversies today.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Sneak previews for 2003: St. Louis Coach Mike Martz tries to
decide between Kurt Warner and Marc Bulger as his No. 1 quarterback,
Seattle coach-to-be-named tries to decide between Trent Dilfer and
Matt Hasselbeck. Most amazing stat of 2002: As starting quarterbacks
for the Rams, Warner is 0-6 and Bulger is 6-0. Less remarkable, but
still worth noting: Hasselbeck is 4-5 with a very bad defense since
replacing the injured Dilfer in October. Hasselbeck ranks fifth in
the NFC with an 85.5 passer rating -- ahead of Michael Vick and Aaron
Brooks. Too bad for Mike Holmgren this didn't happen sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bulger Still Undefeated, Rams Still Under

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Oakland by 4.</TE>
<TE>   The slant: Gannon tries to make up for lost time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Last Sunday in Miami, the Dolphins, playing to preserve the
honor of Dan Marino, limited Rich Gannon to 204 yards to take a bite
out of Gannon's pursuit of Marino's single-season passing record.
Gannon now must average 338 yards over the Raiders' last two games to
break Marino's mark of 5,084 yards -- while maneuvering Oakland into
the playoffs, no longer a sure thing after the loss to the Dolphins.
With a 2-0 finish, Denver still can win the AFC West title, but the
Bronco defense yields a 64.4 completion percentage. Good news for
Oakland, better news for Gannon.</TE>

<TE>   CLEVELAND AT BALTIMORE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Two 7-7 elevens.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The game of the year, if you're looking for symbolism in
this 16-week-long toast to mediocrity. Cleveland, supposedly a team
on the rise under Butch Davis, and Baltimore, supposedly a team
shattered by salary-cap attrition, are both at the same point at this
late stage in the season: 7-7 and very much in the running for the
AFC North title. In fact, if Pittsburgh loses to Tampa Bay on Monday
and the ravaged Ravens sweep their last two games against Cleveland
and Pittsburgh, Baltimore will own first place. The Browns blew a
16-point lead in a 28-23 loss to the Colts last Sunday but that was
at home. On the road, they're 5-2.</TE>

<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: So they gave Chrebet the damn ball. See what happens?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Before last Sunday in Chicago, the Jets were riding a 5-1
run and wide receiver Wayne Chrebet was none too happy about it,
whining about not getting the ball enough. Hmm, maybe the old vet has
a point, the Jets thought, so they gave him the ball, over the
middle, in the final 75 seconds of a must-win game, with the Jets
down by seven. Chrebet tried to hurdle four Bear defenders, fumbled
the ball in the process ... and, class, why weren't we passing the
ball to Mr. Chrebet again? Now the Jets must beat the Patriots in New
England. In New Jersey, the Jets lost to the Patriots, 44-7.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: Still, you know, Flowers has a point.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Old insults, like holiday fruitcake, never die -- they
continue to make the rounds until somebody gets fed up and decides to
do something about it. So Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp has been popping
off about Lee Flowers' year-old sound bite in which the Pittsburgh
safety dismissed the Buccaneers as "paper champions." Sapp says
Flowers "doesn't have the credentials to talk [trash], so I wonder
where it's coming from. You would never know that man unless he gets
on TV and they put his name under his face." But, really, what has
Tampa Bay won? Nothing of note. Up to and including this game.</TE>

<HD>Redskins, Jansen Agree to Six-Year Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redskin right tackle Jon Jansen agreed to a six-year, $25-million
contract Thursday to stay in Washington, where he has missed only one
play in four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The deal includes an $8-million signing bonus and keeps the 1999
second-round draft pick from Michigan from becoming a free agent at
the end of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "For most of the year, I just didn't see it working out," Jansen
said. "It was my inexperience with negotiations. I'm extremely happy
that it did.</LD>
<TE>   "I sometimes wish I could have played 25, 30 years ago, when the
decisions seemed to be a lot easier. Obviously, it's nice now because
the money's a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Jansen is a major victory for the Redskins, who didn't
want to have to find a new tackle with so many other pressing needs
in the upcoming off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "Rock," Jansen had wrestled with testing the open
market, particularly because his power-blocking mentality hasn't been
an easy mesh in Coach Steve Spurrier's pass-dominated offense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big news," cornerback Champ Bailey said. "To keep a guy like
that, that's the type of thing we need around here. He's a big-time
player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New England Patriots put starting cornerback Otis Smith on
injured reserve and released defensive tackle Steve Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who hurt his shoulder in the fourth quarter of New
England's 24-7 loss at Tennessee on Monday night, had started 13 of
the team's 14 games and had two interceptions. He also forced two
fumbles and recovered one.</TE>
<TE>   With Smith out for the season, his spot could be taken by Terrell
Buckley, the primary backup at cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Martin signed as a free agent last April and had played in all 14
games. He started the first four but only one of the last 10.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old Smith is in his 12th NFL season and fourth with
the Patriots. He also played four seasons with Philadelphia and
four-plus with the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, 28, had 17 tackles, only one in the last five games as
part of a defensive line that has been vulnerable to the run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A bolt of lightning struck near the Oakland Raiders' practice
facility in Alameda, forcing the team to cut practice short.</TE>
<TE>   Thunderstorms, with heavy rain and high wind, pounded Northern
California and knocked out power and toppled trees in the Bay Area.
Raider Coach Bill Callahan called a halt to the rain-drenched workout
as a precaution after the lightning strike sent players and coaches
scurrying for cover.</TE>
<TE>   "It came out of nowhere," Callahan said. "A bolt came out and it
was time to go in. We were in the midst of almost completing the
entire practice."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ottawa Senators are making their surge to the top of the Eastern
Conference look easy.</LD>
<LD>   Magnus Arvedson scored twice, and Daniel Alfredsson had four
assists as Ottawa beat the San Jose Sharks, 9-3, Thursday night at
Ottawa, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Despite being outshot, 33-23, the Senators had their highest
scoring game of the season and won their second straight.</LD>
<TE>   Ottawa has gone 14-2-3 since a 7-1 loss in Boston on Nov. 9. The
Senators tied the Bruins -- who lost, 5-3, in Washington -- for first
overall in the conference with 42 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's not easy to do and I think we remind ourselves
before we go out every game," Alfredsson said. "We want to give
ourselves a chance to win every night. We know we're going to go
through streaks where we're not going to be as successful, but
putting a streak like this together the last 20 games it allows you
to come over those slumps and bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 minutes, I thought we would settle down, but we didn't,"
Shark Coach Ron Wilson said. "You lose 2-1, you lose 9-3 -- you still
lost."</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks are 4-2-0-1 since Wilson was hired Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Pittsburgh 1 -- Joe Nieuwendyk scored his first goal
in 21 games and set up New Jersey's second goal with an uncontested
faceoff win, and the Devils ran Pittsburgh's losing streak to a
near-record 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Tverdovsky and Brian Gionta also scored at Pittsburgh as the
Devils stopped a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Edmonton 1 -- Patrick Roy stopped 31 shots at Denver
to help Tony Granato win his NHL coaching debut.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado came out hitting from the start to win for only the
fourth time in 16 home games.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 3, Nashville 1 -- Matt Cooke's two assists sparked the
Canucks at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   With four seconds left in the game, Sami Salo scored an empty-net
goal. It was the first empty-net goal allowed by Nashville this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 1, Detroit 1 -- Philippe Boucher's goal 4:43 into the third
period lifted Dallas into a tie at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third tie this season between two of the better teams
in the Western Conference. Dallas is first with 45 points (18-7-8-1)
and Detroit is fourth with 41 (17-8-6-1). Dallas leads the Pacific
Division and Detroit tops the Central.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 5, Boston 3 -- Peter Bondra scored two goals, and the
Capitals weathered a furious comeback at Washington to hand the
Bruins their fifth straight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Olaf Kolzig had 36 saves for the Capitals, who took a 4-0 lead
into the third period but needed a late goal by Steve Konowalchuk to
secure the win.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 4, Minnesota 2 -- Minnesota native Mark Parrish
scored two goals for the Islanders at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 3, Calgary 0 -- Marc Denis made 29 saves for his fifth
career shutout, and Lasse Pirjeta scored twice at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Jose Theodore stopped 41 shots,
and Yanic Perreault scored two goals at New York. Doug Gilmour
assisted on both of Perreault's goals, giving him seven points in the
last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Tampa Bay 1 -- At Tampa, Ed Belfour came within 96
seconds of his sixth shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Maple Leaf Coach Pat Quinn earned his 543rd win, moving him past
Billy Reay into fifth place on the career list.</TE>

<HD>Rivalry Finally Holds Real Meaning</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the road to the Stanley Cup will lead through Southern
California this spring -- and not because the Detroit Red Wings'
plane got diverted here.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, who expect to make the playoffs every year, and the
Mighty Ducks, hoping to revive their fading memories of postseason
play, played a spirited and meaningful game Thursday at Staples
Center that might be remembered as a turning point for one or both.</LD>
<LD>   With a sellout crowd of 18,118 aware of the implications of every
shot and every save, the Kings rallied for a 5-4 victory on Bryan
Smolinski's power-play goal with 2:29 left in the third period,
extending their supremacy over the Ducks to 6-0-3 dating to March 24,
2001. The Santa hats worn by some fans in the stands said this was
December, but the intensity and pace suggested it was a playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's game represented everything good about hockey and about
each of these teams, promising the birth of a real rivalry based on
competitiveness and not merely geography.</TE>
<TE>   You want drama? How about the Ducks rallying from a 3-1 deficit to
take a 4-3 lead at 7:15 of the third period?</TE>
<TE>   Resilience? How about the Kings pulling even with 8:12 left on a
goal by Brad Chartrand, who had his back to the net when he
redirected a shot by Jaroslav Modry past J.S. Giguere? And Smolinski,
the first to admit he had a disappointing second half last season and
hasn't exactly burned things up this season, shoveling home a
bouncing puck to touch off roars seldom heard in the cavernous arena?</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd missed that one, I probably would have been traded right
away," Smolinski said.</TE>
<TE>   So often in the last few seasons, the two teams were headed in
opposite directions when they met and one or the other was in too
deep a hole for the two points to have really meant much. That wasn't
the case Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They really came out and took it to us at the start of the game
and we were scrambling and not playing our game," Duck winger Patric
Kjellberg said. "We started doing that in the third and that's the
way we should have started the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really aggressive, and now we know that's the type of
hockey we have to play."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya's prolonged, from-the-gut scream of exhilaration and
relief after he beat King goalie Felix Potvin to the glove side on a
third-period breakaway to cut the King lead to 3-2 said everything
anyone needed to know about the emotional temperature on the ice. And
just when the Ducks seem to have assumed control of the game, the
Kings wrenched it back. Ziggy Palffy took a hit but got the puck to
Modry, whose shot from the blue line was somehow redirected by
Chartrand past Giguere to tie the game at 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   "It truly is a character-builder," Chartrand said. "You're going
to have these games in the year where we had it going great and we
faltered. But to actually pick up shows what kind of team we have. It
took quite a bit of momentum on their part to get that lead, and to
get it back, on our part it took a lot of character."</TE>
<TE>   Each of their three games this season has been that way. With any
luck, every game they play against each other -- and everyone else --
will have playoff implications. That would be the best thing to
happen to the NHL since a tearful Wayne Gretzky headed south of the
border to join the Kings in 1988 and sparked a hockey renaissance
that led to the Ducks' birth in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams are in the top eight in the Western Conference, flying
above .500 and clawing to stay there in a conference that never
affords an easy night. Thursday's game was a good reference point for
both teams to measure how far they've come -- and how great a
distance they must still travel to legitimately challenge the teams
above them.</TE>
<TE>   "I really respect the way they play," Duck General Manager Bryan
Murray said of the Kings, who ended his team's five-game winning
streak. "They're a hard team to play."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings certainly don't give up much against the Ducks. Their
victory Thursday vaulted them past the Ducks and into seventh place
in the West -- for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never played in a game like this," Duck rookie Kurt Sauer
said. "But now I know for me, personally, I have to play better. This
is a tough loss."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are still deeper than the Ducks, better able to play a
physical game without losing their discipline, and steadier on
defense. They've gotten timely contributions from many sources,
reducing the offensive load Palffy and Jason Allison must carry. But
the Ducks aren't much behind, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rucchin, too long underestimated when he had Kariya and
Teemu Selanne on his wings, is enjoying his finest NHL season.
Youngsters such as Sauer and Stanislav Chistov have made significant
impacts and play with poise.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks brought out the best in the Kings on Thursday. The Kings
brought out the best in the Ducks. Hockey fans can't ask for more.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd be improved," Murray said. "We thought we'd be
deeper and that we had more speed and skill and as long as they
called obstruction, we'd benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "I like where we are. I'd like to be higher in the standings,
sure. But our attitude now around the whole organization is that
we're on the way up."</TE>
<TE>   So, apparently, are the Kings. Which can only mean things are
looking up for local hockey fans.</TE>

<LD>Two months ago, 100-meter world-record holder Tim Montgomery made an
interesting observation while discussing his relationship with Marion
Jones.</LD>
<LD>   "My father and mother always told me the company that you keep is
what you're going to be," he said. "If you keep bad company, you're
going to end up bad. Being in good company, such as an athlete like
Marion, is going to bring out the good side of me."</LD>
<LD>   What does it say, then, that both have been seen training in the
company of Charlie Francis, banned for life by Athletics Canada after
admitting he'd provided steroids to disqualified Seoul 100-meter gold
medalist Ben Johnson?</LD>
<TE>   It's the second curious move for Jones and Montgomery. Last week,
Jones left coach Trevor Graham, saying, "I have a huge need for
specific biomechanical analysis that can assist me in the
identification of certain fundamental technical deficiencies, the
correction of which may be required from time to time to improve my
performances."</TE>
<TE>   She chose as her new coach Derek Hansen, a little-known Canadian
who specializes in plyometrics and stretching techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery, who set the world record of 9.78 seconds in September,
joined Jones in switching to Hansen. Both were photographed this week
working with Hansen and Francis at York University in Toronto, but
Francis told Canadian reporters he doesn't comment about anyone he
coaches. Charles Wells, the agent for Jones and Montgomery, couldn't
be reached Thursday. He'd said this week, before Jones and Montgomery
were spotted with Francis, that Jones would continue to live and
train in Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Francis gave damning testimony about Johnson during a 1989 inquiry
into Johnson's positive test for anabolic steroids after being
clocked in 9.79 seconds at Seoul. Francis and Johnson's doctor, Jamie
Astaphan, testified that Johnson had taken steroids and human growth
hormone since 1981. In his book "Speed Trap," Francis said the
success of East German athletes at the 1976 Olympics convinced him
that drugs were necessary for success. He was also known as a savvy
coach, however.</TE>
<TE>   "If these American athletes want to train with the best coach in
the world and get the best advice, they can come to him and he can
offer that service," Johnson told the Canadian Press. "Charlie has an
eye to see what they're doing wrong, what they can achieve, where
they can make some necessary adjustment, who is going to help them
get that extra yard. And that yard will be a hundredth of a second."</TE>
<TE>   Jones largely escaped the taint surrounding her ex-husband,
shotputter C.J. Hunter, who was banned for two years in 2000 after he
tested positive for nandrolone. For Jones, admittedly disappointed
she hasn't improved the personal-best 100-meter time of 10.65 seconds
she set in 1998, the lure of running a hundredth of a second faster
could be strong enough to outweigh the potential stigma of working
with Francis.</TE>
<TE>   Puck Boom Hits Home</TE>
<TE>   If Wayne Gretzky hadn't played for the Kings, Brett Sterling might
not be where he is today, preparing to play for the U.S. in the World
Junior Hockey Championships next week in Halifax and Sydney, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling, 18, was born and raised in Pasadena. Now a freshman at
Colorado College, he was 4 when Gretzky was traded by Edmonton to the
Kings in 1988 and benefited from the boom Gretzky triggered in ice
and roller hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "Back when I started, there really wasn't anything going on in
Southern California in terms of youth hockey," Sterling said. "As I
hit my teens, a lot of programs were getting underway.... I was a
King fan. I always have been. My cousin and my older brother played
and I started playing because of them. Playing in the NHL has been my
dream, and every year I get a little more optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Sterling, who left home after his sophomore year in high school to
participate in the U.S. national development program, will be
eligible for the NHL draft next June. He's merely 5 feet 8 and 165
pounds, but he impressed U.S. junior coach Lou Vairo during a summer
training camp for young U.S. and Finnish players at Lake Placid, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this guy is very special," Vairo said. "He's a great
competitor and has a wonderful sense of how to get open.</TE>
<TE>   "The easiest thing in the world is to teach a guy how to play
defensively. You can't teach someone how to score.</TE>
<TE>   "I predict he will have a wonderful future in the game. I'd take a
chance on him anytime."</TE>
<TE>   The 10 teams were divided into two groups of five for the junior
tournament. The top three from each group will advance and cross over
to play teams from the other group.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which finished fifth last year, opens next Thursday at
Sydney against defending champion Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an honor any time you get to put on the USA crest,"
said Sterling, whose parents, Bill and Terry, will be in Canada to
watch him. "To play with and against the best guys in the world is a
big thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Leaps of Faith</TE>
<TE>   Miki Ando of Japan became the first female skater to land a
verified quadruple jump in competition when she did a quadruple
salchow at last weekend's Junior Grand Prix Final at The Hague, the
Netherlands. Ando, 14, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran coach John Nicks, an advocate of raising the technical
ante for women, applauded Ando's feat. Under his guidance, Sasha
Cohen landed several quad salchows in practice but not in
competition. Cohen has since left Nicks for Tatiana Tarasova and put
the quad on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," Nicks said. "As soon as one person makes a
breakthrough, a lot of people will follow through the door. The first
guy did a triple axel [in 1978] and then 10 did it and now it's a
requirement."</TE>
<TE>   Yukari Nakano of Japan and Ludmila Nelidina of Russia landed
triple axels in October at Skate America, the first women to perform
the 3 1/2-revolution jump in competition in a decade. But the real
test will be if they -- and Ando -- can avoid the injuries such jumps
often inflict on young bodies.</TE>
<TE>   One such victim is Naomi Nari Nam of Irvine, out of competition
since the 1999-2000 season because of hip problems. Nicks said she
resumed serious training about three months ago and is regaining her
triple jumps.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect her to be competing next year," he said of Nam, 17.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes' first TV
special, "Sarah Hughes, a Life in Balance," will air on NBC
Wednesday. The hourlong show details how her life has changed since
Salt Lake City and includes four new routines choreographed by coach
Robin Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's water polo team, which lost the Olympic gold
medal at Sydney on a late goal by Australia, lost the title game of
the FINA Women's World Cup last weekend on a goal by Agnes Primasz of
Hungary with 45 seconds to play. The U.S. had the best goal
differential in the tournament, plus-16, on 37 goals for and 21
against.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If there were any doubts about the return of an El Nino winter, they
were whitewashed this week.</LD>
<LD>   "Here we go again," Nicole Belt, spokeswoman for Sierra-at-Tahoe,
said Thursday morning as the ski area's staff was bracing for Round 2
of a season that may go 15.</LD>
<LD>   From Dec. 13 through Tuesday, the Lake Tahoe-area resorts received
five to 10 feet of powder. Another storm was expected Thursday night
and yet another was spiraling shoreward from the Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   "Christmas certainly came early to Lake Tahoe!" exclaimed John
Wagnon, vice president of marketing at Heavenly Ski Area.</TE>
<TE>   It came early elsewhere as well. After slamming through the Tahoe
region, the storm almost buried the Mammoth Lakes area. Mammoth
Mountain Ski Area, at one point Monday, was getting three inches of
powder per hour and was left with a blanket up to six feet thick on
the higher slopes.</TE>
<TE>   So fast and furious was the swirling wind-driven storm that the
California Highway Patrol temporarily closed the 40-mile stretch of
U.S. 395 between Bishop and Mammoth.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of accidents, but fortunately none of them were very
serious," Officer Brian Donnelly said.</TE>
<TE>   With more wild weather expected this weekend and beyond, Donnelly
said skiers and snowboarders en route for the holidays should "bring
chains and have enough supplies in your car in case you get stuck at
a closure or in the snow itself."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone getting stuck should also make sure the exhaust pipe is
clear to lessen the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   As for conditions on the mountain, resort spokeswoman Kellie Hines
said Mammoth would be operating at 100% beginning today, with a base
depth of seven-plus feet.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby June Mountain opened Tuesday and all but the lower
black-diamond runs will be open.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, storm totals have been measured in inches rather than
feet but that could change this weekend. Resort operators are braced
for a white period leading up to Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking to receive a foot to a foot and a half," said John
McColly, spokesman for Mountain High in Wrightwood. Mountain High's
East Resort opens today, giving skiers and snowboarders two mountains
for the price of one, but with only 13 open trails covered with a
one- to two-foot base of mostly machine-groomed packed powder.</TE>
<TE>   In the Big Bear Lakes area, Snow Summit and Big Bear Mountain,
which are now operating under the same ownership, are reporting
similar conditions and expect being 100% operational by Christmas
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Snow Valley has two trails open but expects to expand operations
soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No boys allowed: A "Girls Learn To Ride" snowboarding clinic will
be held Saturday at Mountain High. It's open to girls and women ages
12 and up and includes a two-hour lesson, a full-day lift ticket and
equipment rentals. Sessions are at 9 a.m., 10, 11 and noon. Cost is
$29 and a portion of the proceeds will benefit breast cancer
research. Details: www.girlslearntoride.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stocking stuffer: Actually, "Mammoth: the Sierra Legend," would be
a better fit under the tree. The book, written by Martin Forstenzer
and due in stores this week, gives a comprehensive history of the
Eastern Sierra community and region -- and their many personalities,
including ski-area founder Dave McCoy -- in a coffee-table-book
format that also features stunning photography. Cost is $49.95.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: Weather.com's ski section, located at
www.weather.com/ski, provides forecasts and condition reports for 600
domestic and 180 international resorts. New this year is a feature
highlighting the resort that receives the most new snow on a given
day.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Rosie' Discovery</TE>
<TE>   The future of long-range fishing out of San Diego got a little
brighter the last two weeks, thanks to the discovery of an uncharted
bank by Capt. Roy Rose of the Royal Polaris.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to fish Mexico's highly productive Revillagigedo Islands,
which remain closed under new rules imposed by the government, the
skippers have had to search for alternatives this season, meeting
with mixed success.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, during an 18-day trip that ends this morning when the vessel
pulls into Fisherman's Landing, traveled first to an area above
Alijos Rocks off Baja California, where his 15 passengers caught 37
wahoo and a few large tuna before nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   Rose then left for Hurricane Bank, a chancy move considering the
location of the seamount: 1,000 miles south of Point Loma and more
than 300 miles west of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hit-or-miss spot and Rose and his group mostly missed,
catching only a smattering of tuna, the largest weighing about 180
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Then Rose headed for Morgan Bank 100 miles northwest of Cabo San
Lucas "and found nothing," according to Frank LoPreste, the boat's
owner.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they went west and found a shallow area that we've never
known about," LoPreste said. They struck a long-range fisherman's
equivalent of gold: giant yellowfin that bit over a period of 4 1/2
days.</TE>
<TE>   The fish came over the rail at an average size of 140-190 pounds,
with several topping 200. All 15 passengers caught at least one fish
weighing at least 180 pounds. Two tuna estimated at 300-plus pounds
were lost at the rail and another that wasn't seen as closely was
lost after a 3 1/2-hour fight from a skiff.</TE>
<TE>   There is one catch to the discovery of "Rosie Bank." Rose isn't
telling anyone where it is.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's going to stay that way until [the other captains] catch
him there," said LoPreste, whose next trip, to Clipperton Island by
way of Rosie Bank, starts Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Spirit of the Season</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's inaugural Fish for the Homeless event was canceled by
Mother Nature, whose high winds kept seven party boats and perhaps
hundreds of private vessels at bay.</TE>
<TE>   However, it was hardly a lost cause. Organizer Philip Friedman of
www.976tuna.com said Southland fishermen came through by making
donations of about 100 pounds of fish they had in their freezers,
along with "a few turkeys, canned goods, rice, flour, beans and other
staples."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest donor was Mario Ghio of Sportsman's Seafood in San
Diego, who offered 300 pounds of filleted bluefin and yellowfin tuna,
yellowtail and mahi-mahi.</TE>
<TE>   The food was delivered to three Southland shelters. A similar
event is scheduled for April 15.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Orange County developer Al Baldwin recently returned from the
bowhunting trip of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   After scouting for 11 days on Mexico's Tiburon Island, Baldwin, of
Fountain Valley, spotted a huge ram about 10 a.m., then spent several
hours getting into position before letting his arrow fly.</TE>
<TE>   The arrow went straight through the heart. The measurement of 176
3/8 inches makes the ram one of the largest ever taken with archery
gear.</TE>

<HD>Pro Bowl Overlooks 9-5 Titans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Tennessee Titans just got new incentive in their quest for an NFL
title.</LD>
<LD>   No Pro Bowl players.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm quite sure a lot of players on this team deserved it, but
that's how it works," quarterback Steve McNair said after the AFC
South leaders were ignored in Pro Bowl balloting announced Thursday.
"We don't have any control over that. But it's a team thing now for
us. To solve all this, we just got to go to the Super Bowl and win
it."</LD>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Eagles, leading the race to be top-seeded in the
NFC playoffs, had the most Pro Bowlers with seven, including
three-fourths of their secondary. San Francisco and Miami, two other
division leaders, each had six.</TE>
<TE>   But the Titans, leading the AFC South at 9-5, were ignored in
voting conducted in thirds: one-third by players, one-third by
coaches, one-third by fans on NFL.com.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we had players who had seasons worthy enough to be
selected over there, we just go on," Coach Jeff Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Tennessee, the expansion Houston Texans had two
players chosen, and the 1-13 Cincinnati Bengals had one, fullback
Lorenzo Neal, who used to play for the Titans. The other teams
without players chosen were .500 or worse: Cleveland, Detroit and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "That we're 11-3 helps," said Philadelphia cornerback Troy
Vincent, who was selected along with cornerback Bobby Taylor and
safety Brian Dawkins. "The team success gives you momentum, and
defensively we've been playing well."</TE>
<TE>   The selections cover two generations.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland wide receiver Jerry Rice, 40, was chosen for the 13th
time, the first time he has made it since 1999, when he played for
the 49ers. Raider safety Rod Woodson, 37, was chosen for the 11th
time. San Diego linebacker Junior Seau made it for the 12th straight
season.</TE>
<TE>   The game is Feb. 2 in Honolulu.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Be forceful, Karl Dorrell.</LD>
<LD>   Be charismatic. Be smart in hiring your assistant football
coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Be able to offer the star high school football talent of Southern
California substantial and immediate playing time. And a good chance
of playing in a good bowl every year.</LD>
<TE>   Be present. Show up at Long Beach Poly or Mater Dei. Show up as
often as possible, staying within recruiting rules, of course. To say
hello, to talk, to just hang out and let players know you, know what
you are about, know that you have the strength of your convictions,
that you believe in yourself. Talk a lot about how you wouldn't let
yourself be pushed aside in the UCLA hiring process, how you wouldn't
accept just a token, polite interview, that you were going to be
heard and considered.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful too. If a player has already given a commitment to
another school, don't try to change that commitment. Some high school
coaches have taught their players that the commitment means
something. If you just can't help yourself, be respectful and
low-key.</TE>
<TE>   Be aware of how lucky you are to have UCLA to sell. You start out
with a big recruiting advantage. UCLA is it. Its campus, its
academics, its conference, its history. You have a lot of good will
on your side immediately, but you already know this and it's one
reason you fought so hard for this job. You are a Bruin. It can be
great to be a Bruin.</TE>
<TE>   What you don't have to worry about is being African American.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High school coaches and players are saying Dorrell's race is
neither a recruiting plus nor a minus. That Dorrell played college
and pro football and that he has been an assistant coach with a
successful NFL team, those are pluses. That he understands the area,
appreciates the talent base, has a previous tie to UCLA, those are
pluses.</TE>
<TE>   And this ought to work out fine, because Dorrell made it clear
Thursday at his introductory press conference that he got this job
because of his coaching qualifications, not racial qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go by skin color," said Brandon Mebane, a defensive
tackle at Crenshaw High. "I'm looking for a great school, a great
coaching staff, a great environment. Skin color doesn't matter to me.
Maybe it does to some people but not to me."</TE>
<TE>   Mebane, who has visited Cal, Oregon and Washington, is African
American. It's a positive, Mebane said, to see an African American
get a head-coaching job at a premier program and it will be nice if
Dorrell succeeds, he added. But UCLA's being one of only four
Division I-A schools with African American head coaches won't
influence his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be interested in talking to UCLA now because I'd like to see
what the new coach is about," Mebane said. "But I'd feel that way
whoever got the job."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, a defensive tackle and guard for Long Beach Poly,
said, "I think it's great that an African American got the UCLA job.
But I don't see how his being African American makes a difference in
recruiting. What matters is that he's a man who obviously worked hard
to get to UCLA and now I hope to meet him and find out about him."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is planning on visiting Ohio State, Florida State and maybe
Nebraska. And now, UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be the color of Dorrell's skin that Brown pays attention
to, though. It will be the feeling he gets. USC, under Pete Carroll
and some previous coaches, has had great success in recruiting Poly
players. UCLA, under Bob Toledo, didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's because it's been more of a close feeling, a
family thing, that you get off USC coaches," Brown said. "At UCLA, it
seemed like things were cold and people weren't really happy. USC,
it's in the middle of South Central, it feels like it's more for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Biggins, director of recruiting for Student Sports, an
Internet publication, said that race "might be a little bit
overblown. A kid I just spoke to about this said it didn't matter if
the coach was black, white or green. All that matters to the kid is
that he respected and believed in the coach."</TE>
<TE>   Poly Coach Raul Lara said the race of a coach might matter.</TE>
<TE>   "But if it does," Lara added, "it matters very, very little. What
does matter? How a coach presents himself. Who he hires for his
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "When John Robinson was at USC the last time, he had great success
here. Robinson loved our kids and our kids related to him. For
whatever reasons, Paul Hackett didn't pick up any of our guys. Pete
Carroll has done a phenomenal job of getting our kids. Bob Toledo?
Honestly, I've never seen him over here. What we liked about Robinson
and Carroll? That they are honest and truthful and you can see they
really care for the kids. Kids can sense that. It's not the skin
color, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said football recruits pay
attention to many things.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't, honestly, think that race of the coach is a factor
at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What kids look at, Rollinson said, are "where do they fit in as
far as playing early and what kind of recent history the team has in
going to bowl games. And how they relate to the assistants is
important too."</TE>
<TE>   Rollinson said he would not look kindly on a new coach contacting
players who had already given commitments. "I just don't think that's
right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that when Hackett took over at USC, Hackett contacted
Mater Dei fullback Mike McNair, who had already committed to Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul did it well," Rollinson recalled. "He told Mike he felt he
had to make one pitch about the new direction he wanted to take the
program. That's not so bad. Mike listened. But he kept his word and
went to Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA didn't hire Dorrell because of his race. It hired Dorrell
because of his spirit, his toughness, his charisma, his enthusiasm,
his heart, his willingness to have taken small jobs at smaller
places, his work ethic, his relentless belief in himself.</TE>
<TE>   Those qualities are what Dorrell must sell to recruits. Thank
goodness players are smart enough to know what matters. It's not the
race. It's the man.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers have won three consecutive NBA championships, but they are
struggling at 10-17 after Thursday night's one-sided loss to the New
Jersey Nets, whom they swept in last year's NBA Finals.</LD>
<LD>   With Shaquille O'Neal slowed by a toe injury, Kobe Bryant has
embraced his role as team captain and leads the league in All-Star
voting released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Question: What is your assessment of where the team is, and why
has this season been so turbulent?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It's always tough to get four in a row. There's always
going to be ups and downs just in trying to repeat. So it really
magnifies trying to get four. It's much harder. That, plus all the
pieces of the puzzle weren't here at the start of the season. Guys
were injured and Shaq wasn't here. Our chemistry hasn't been there
all season so it's a matter of working on that. So we're just going
through a process right now, and it's been rough. We're just trying
to toughen things out and get through it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can this team be what it was or are you concerned?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, our focus isn't about being where we were but being the
best that we can be. We have to forget about our past successes.
That's how we've approached every season that we've won. We haven't
looked at what we did the previous year. We're just trying to
maximize our potential for this season and we have a ways to go.
We've got to try and continually get better so when we go into the
playoffs we have a nice head of steam. So, yes, for the moment I'm
concerned, but not for the long term. We will get it together.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What caused you to lash out at your teammates?</TE>
<TE>   A: I was just trying to light a fire underneath them. It wasn't
out of frustration. I think a lot about what I do. So it was
important to try and light a fire to try and get them going. Some of
them took it the right way and some of them didn't. Like Samaki
[Walker]. I talked to him. Maybe I was a little too hard on him in
the media, but I was just trying to get him and these guys going. It
was never personal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was it effective?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think they got the message. Sometimes the guys have sent
messages to me. I have tried to learn from what they have said. I
didn't always agree, but I tried to understand what they were telling
me. So it goes both ways.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How is your relationship with Shaq these days?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's been great. No problems. I'm really glad that he is back
out there doing the things he used to do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What did you think of his recent dissatisfaction and statements
about the team?</TE>
<TE>   A: He spoke his mind. I had no problem with it. Just like when I
said what I did, some guys took it OK, others didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does it bother you that you work as hard as you do in the
off-season, that you prepare and want to improve and that other guys
don't work as hard and they need more work on their game than you do?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I mean, this is who I am. This is what I do. This is one of
the reasons I was able to jump from high school to the pros, because
I work so hard on my game. I don't expect them to go out and spend
eight hours in the gym, in the summertime, like I do. I expect them
to just work hard at their jobs, be professionals, be in the best
possible condition they can be in and play the game the right way.
But I don't expect them to go out there and do what I do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do the Lakers need another player? Should somebody else be
added?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know. That's totally up to [General Manager] Mitch
[Kupchak] and [Coach] Phil [Jackson]. That's their job, not mine. My
concern's really just to maximize the potential of the players that
we have here. I'm the one who's trying to orchestrate on the floor,
making sure I'm reading these guys well. If they feel they need to
bring in somebody else then that's totally up to them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You just mentioned why you were able to go from high school to
the pros. LeBron James is in all likelihood going to make the jump
next season. What do you think of his game and him coming straight
into the NBA?</TE>
<TE>   A: I wish him luck. He has a great deal of talent. I haven't had a
chance to see him play in person yet, but I've seen highlights of him
on television. He appears to have all the skills and he loves to play
the game. I've spoken to him a couple of times and he's a very mature
person.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will you play in the Olympics in 2004 and will you qualify this
summer if that's part of the condition to play in Athens?</TE>
<TE>   A: If I'm healthy I'm definitely playing in the Olympics. As far
as playing in the games this summer to qualify, I don't know. It's
such a long season. But we'll see. I definitely want to represent my
country.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How come you haven't signed the contract extension that the
Lakers have offered?</TE>
<TE>   A: No reason really. I'm just being patient.</TE>
<TE>   Q: By being patient do you mean the longer you wait the better you
think it will be because you expect the salary cap to go up?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's not something I've spent a lot of time thinking about.
I've got a lot of other things on my mind right now. I'm trying to
win ballgames. My wife and I are expecting our first child. I've also
got a shoe contract to deal with first. So those things are what I've
been concentrating on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think that the organization is surprised that you
haven't thought much about it or signed the extension yet?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I don't think so. Mitch and I have talked about it a little
bit and he knows this is the place I want to be, so he's not sweating
it.</TE>

<HD>Study Gets No Kick Out of Penalty Kicks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report in the British Medical Journal has recommended, not
altogether tongue-in-cheek, that soccer should abandon penalty kicks
as a method of settling ties because they are bad for fans' health.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at the universities of Bristol and Birmingham who
studied the effect of England's 1998 World Cup games discovered that
heart attacks increased by 25% when England lost to Argentina in a
penalty shootout after a tense, two-hour game.</LD>
<LD>   They blamed tension among the 24 million British television
viewers who watched the game.</LD>
<TE>   "These findings support the view that heart attacks can be
triggered by emotional upset, such as watching your football team
lose an important match -- particularly those in which there is a
penalty shootout," the Journal stated.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from the issues of sporting fairness, perhaps the lottery
of the penalty shootout should be abandoned on public health
grounds."</TE>
<TE>   Matthaeus Apology</TE>
<TE>   Lothar Matthaeus, Germany's 1990 World Cup-winning captain, has
apologized for calling the Austrian club Rapid Vienna "a snake pit"
in a magazine article published shortly before he was fired in May
after coaching Rapid to its worst record in 103 years.</TE>
<TE>   Matthaeus sued the club, claiming unfair dismissal. That suit was
settled out of court in Vienna on Thursday for an undisclosed sum but
with Matthaeus' public apology a part of the bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Abreu's Escape</TE>
<TE>   Sebastian Abreu, Cruz Azul and Uruguay national team striker,
escaped serious injury but his unidentified passenger was killed when
the pickup truck Abreu was driving skidded off the road in the rain
in Montevideo and struck a light post. Abreu, 26, suffered minor head
and shoulder injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   China 2003</TE>
<TE>   The field for the fourth FIFA Women's World Cup, in China next
year, grew to 10 teams with the qualification of Ghana and Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   Ghana edged Cameroon, 3-2, in overtime in the semifinals of the
African Women's Championship to secure its place. Nigeria romped past
South Africa, 5-0, in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Change</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian national championship, which has experimented with
various and often bizarre formats, will adopt a conventional league
system starting next season, with the 24 clubs playing each other
home and away and the team with the most points being declared the
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian Wait</TE>
<TE>   Medellin, which has not won the Colombian league championship
since 1957, is within one game of claiming the title. A goal by
defender Robinson Munoz and an own goal by Julio Valencia earned
Medellin a 2-0 victory over Pasto in front of 45,000 fans at Estadio
Atanasio Girardot in Medellin in the first game of the two-game title
series.</TE>
<TE>   The second game is scheduled Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Chilean Range</TE>
<TE>   Long-range shots in the 49th minute by Marcelo Espina and in the
86th minute by Ignacio Quinteros beat Universidad Catolica's American
goalkeeper, Jonny Walker, and gave Colo Colo a 2-0 victory in the
opener of the two-match Chilean league championship series in front
of 40,000 at Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Dies</TE>
<TE>   Georgian broadcaster Kote Makharadze, who achieved fame throughout
the former Soviet Union during more than 44 years as a soccer
commentator, died at 76 after suffering a stroke.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Braswell knew this game would be trouble. He walked into the
Cal State Northridge locker room and felt as if he had entered a
comedy club.</LD>
<LD>   Winners of four consecutive games heading into Thursday, the
Matadors seemed a little too loose for their coach's liking, and it
showed in a lackluster first half.</LD>
<LD>   But the Matadors recovered for a 74-71 victory over Loyola
Marymount in a nonconference game before 1,051 fans at Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   Ian Boylan scored a career-high 27 points, Curtis Slaughter added
22 points against his former school and the Matadors (6-2) ended up
getting the last laugh despite irritating Braswell.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad we had this game tonight.... It was somewhat of a
wake-up call for us to understand we just can't show up and win,"
Braswell said. "I sensed there was a lot more smiling, giggling and
laughing than normal. These guys are usually a little more serious
than that."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge made 10 of 34 shots (29.4%) in the first half and
trailed, 32-31.</TE>
<TE>   But the Matadors went on a 28-8 run over a 10-minute span in the
second half, finishing it with Slaughter's three-pointer for a 63-52
lead with 6:10 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (5-5) didn't fade and pulled to within three, but
Charles Brown's three-point attempt at the buzzer fell short.</TE>
<TE>   "For a young team, we showed incredibly great poise," said Loyola
Marymount Coach Steve Aggers, whose lineup at one time included four
freshmen and a sophomore. "Games like this against quality opponents
on the road help you when conference play rolls out."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Andy Osborn scored a career-high 23 points for Loyola
Marymount, which played without center Jason Dickens, out because of
strep throat.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount forward Miroslav Neskovic left the game in the
first half with a right knee injury, initially diagnosed as a torn
meniscus. Neskovic will undergo an MRI examination today.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge plays Saturday at Southern Illinois, which lost to
Connecticut in the Sweet 16 last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure we took care of business at home, to give
us some confidence when we play on the road," said Slaughter, who
left Loyola Marymount after his sophomore season because he was
academically ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Stanford 84, UC Irvine 57 -- Julius Barnes, Stanford's only
senior starter, scored 24 points, and the Cardinal avoided its first
three-game losing streak outside the Pacific 10 Conference since 1969
with a victory at Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Childress added 11 points and 10 rebounds for Stanford (6-3),
which had lost three of its previous four games since an upset
victory over nationally ranked Florida in the Preseason NIT. Dan
Grunfeld added 12 points and Rob Little 11.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Ethington scored 13 points to lead the Anteaters (3-3), who
had won three in a row. Jordan Harris added 12.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford scored a season-high for points, and UC Irvine was held
to a season low.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For almost 30 minutes Thursday, UCLA looked as if it might run the
Baylor Bears all the way back to Waco, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   But it was the visiting Bears who had the finishing kick, zipping
past the Bruins, 89-77, before 693 at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third straight loss for the Bruins (4-4), who were
looking for redemption after being routed by Baylor last year, 92-59.</LD>
<TE>   The Bears, who had 22 points from forward Steffanie Blackmon,
improved to 9-1.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin freshman Nikki Blue led all scorers with 26.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA used full-court pressure to force the visitors into some
quick turnovers and ran out to a 25-12 lead. The Bears spent the rest
of the first half cutting into the Bruins' lead and had reduced the
margin to 45-39 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins still led, 67-63, at the 11:15 mark of the second half
when Baylor took over, using a 17-2 run to leapfrog ahead, 80-69.
UCLA never got closer than six points after that.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had a scare when leading rebounder Julia Pitts went for
a steal, landed awkwardly and crashed into the scorer's table in the
first half. Pitts was helped to the locker room and was initially
diagnosed with a sprained left knee. She is scheduled to undergo an
MRI examination today.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Terry</TE>
<TE>   USC 80, Southern Methodist -- Junior Rometra Craig made her season

<KH>TV-RADIO LARRY STEWART</KH>
<HD>Davie an Expert on This Topic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Davie, in his first season with ESPN as a college football
commentator, is just learning the television business. One thing he
has learned, though, is not to talk about himself. The way he sees
it, he's there to call the game.</LD>
<LD>   "It bothers me when I see analysts who make the game more about
themselves than the teams on the field," he said.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Day, Davie, along with play-by-play announcer Mark
Jones and good friend and fellow commentator Mike Gottfried, will be
working the Las Vegas Bowl, UCLA against New Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, Davie concedes, he may have to talk a little about
himself. What happened to him at Notre Dame is very similar to what
happened to Bob Toledo at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2001, on the Monday after Notre Dame's last
regular-season game, Davie was fired. Earlier this month, on the
Monday after UCLA's last regular-season game, Toledo was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Davie and Toledo coached together at Texas A&amp;M under R.C. Slocum
for five years. Davie was the defensive coordinator, Toledo the
offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship has been an interesting one. It became somewhat
acrimonious after Toledo was fired by Slocum after a 24-21 loss to
Notre Dame in the 1994 Cotton Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult situation," Davie said. "Our defense was
nicknamed 'The Wrecking Crew,' and it got a lot of attention. I think
Bob had a hard time accepting that and he said some things after he
was let go."</TE>
<TE>   Davie also recalled a quote attributed to Toledo after Davie had
been named head coach at Notre Dame in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a quote in the Los Angeles Times that somebody sent to
me," Davie said. "Bob said something like, 'Bob Davie always thought
he was an expert on everything. Now we'll see how much of an expert
he is.' "</TE>
<TE>   A check revealed this quote from Toledo about Davie: "You know,
he's never been a head coach before. Like anything else you do for
the first time, there's going to be trial and error. When you're an
assistant, you think you've got all the answers. Then you become a
head coach and you find it's not the same."</TE>
<TE>   Davie said that he had seen Toledo at various functions and never
mentioned the quote, adding that they had always been cordial to each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Bob, he's a nice man," Davie said. "As far as I'm
concerned, we've always had a good relationship."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had not talked to Toledo since Toledo's firing.</TE>
<TE>   "Once things settle down, I may give him a call," Davie said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, he can empathize with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult," Davie said. "For eight years, I was down on that
field with Notre Dame [three as an assistant, five as the head
coach]. And then suddenly, I'm not down there."</TE>
<TE>   Davie said his ESPN job has helped ease the pain. He was hired not
long after going to Bristol, Conn., for an audition in May.</TE>
<TE>   "This job has let me focus on the games I'm announcing rather than
Notre Dame's games," he said. "I know there are former coaches who
say they don't pay any attention after they're gone. But you can't
help but pay attention."</TE>
<TE>   What has also helped is a positive attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you're hurt, but I figured out early on that it was in my
best interest to quickly get over it," Davie said. "There's no reason
to be jealous, no reason to be bitter. You find out if you worry
about things you can't control, it affects your mood, and that's no
good for anybody. You have to stay positive and move on.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my opportunity, and I'm proud of what I did. We won the
[American Football Coaches Assn.'s] Academic Achievement Award my
last year and we had a 100% graduation rate my last year. But we went
5-6 and I got fired."</TE>
<TE>   Big-Time Treatment</TE>
<TE>   Although Davie believes New Mexico's multi-look defense could give
UCLA problems and make things interesting, nobody is calling the Las
Vegas Bowl a big game. So why does ESPN have a three-man announcing
team assigned to it?</TE>
<TE>   Davie said he had been assigned the game all along and that he
lobbied to be paired with Gottfried after they'd worked together in
the studio last month.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked to work a game together, and this is the one we got,"
Davie said.</TE>
<TE>   He and Gottfried have been friends since Davie was a tight end at
Youngstown State and Gottfried was the offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be fun," Davie said.</TE>
<TE>   The one negative is being away from home on Christmas. Davie, 47,
who still lives in South Bend, Ind., has a daughter who is a freshman
at Illinois and a son who is a freshman in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll celebrate Christmas on Dec. 26," Davie said.</TE>
<TE>   NBA on ABC</TE>
<TE>   Christmas Day isn't usually regarded as a big day for sports
viewing. But besides UCLA's bowl game appearance, which may or may
not interest you, the day marks the return of the NBA to ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit at Orlando will play on ESPN at 11 a.m., before the Las
Vegas Bowl, and then ABC has an NBA doubleheader beginning at 3 p.m.
The Boston Celtics and New Jersey Nets will play in the first game,
then Sacramento will play the Lakers in the 5:30 nightcap from
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 30 years since the NBA was on ABC. Keith Jackson and
Chris Schenkel did the play-by-play then and Bill Russell was the
lead commentator. ABC used four cameras then. The network will have
21 at Staples Center on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton, who will work the Laker game with Brad Nessler, was
still at UCLA when ABC last televised the NBA. In those days, Walton
stuttered and rarely talked. These days, having conquered that
problem, he rarely shuts up.</TE>
<TE>   So what would have been the odds 30 years ago of Walton's being
where he is today?</TE>
<TE>   "About the same as me becoming Richard Nixon's press secretary,"
Walton said.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Decision</TE>
<TE>   CBS' Billy Packer was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to film a
commercial. His flight home to Charlotte, N.C., wasn't leaving until
11:50 p.m., so he could have attended the UCLA-Northern Arizona game
that night but decided against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it would be much of a game," Packer said. "Then
after arriving in Charlotte, my cab driver says he's a UCLA grad and
that the Bruins lost. I was stunned."</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   In Bryant Gumbel's HBO interview with Martha Burk about her
campaign to have a woman admitted as a member at Augusta National,
Gumbel doesn't mention that he is a member of Burning Tree, an
all-male club in the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   "We were aware of Bryant's affiliation with Burning Tree," HBO
Sports President Ross Greenburg said. "Bryant delivered a solid and
objective piece, asking all the relevant questions."</TE>
<TE>   An HBO spokesman said Gumbel, off the air, told Burk about his
affiliation and both agreed it was a different situation. Burning
Tree, for one thing, does not conduct a public event, as Augusta does
with the Masters.</TE>

<LD>Freshman quarterbacks Matt Moore and Drew Olson know the competition
to determine who will start next season begins now. And in the Las
Vegas Bowl, they will compete on even terms.</LD>
<LD>   Olson will play the first and third quarters. Moore will play the
second and fourth.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm glad we are doing it this way," Moore said. "I'd prefer
knowing when I'll be in the game."</LD>
<TE>   Moore forfeited his redshirt status when he played the entire game
in a victory over Stanford one week after senior Cory Paus and Olson
were injured against California. Moore also played in relief of Olson
against Arizona, USC and Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Olson went the whole way to beat Washington, played well against
Arizona and struggled along with the entire team in losses to USC and
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin seniors are excused from practice today, the team's last

<HD>Dupree Must Get His Life in Order</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With final exams finished, Coach Henry Bibby does not expect any
eligibility problems at USC for the spring semester.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean junior forward Jerry Dupree is in the clear
... yet.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not just grades with Jerry," Bibby said Thursday. "My thing
is, 'Is Jerry ready mentally to start handling his responsibilities
for life?' Not, 'Is he ready to play basketball?'</LD>
<TE>   "If his life is squared away, he's going to be ready to play
basketball. We need Jerry in the right frame of mind to come back and
play and I'm not going to bring him back until [then]."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who has served a six-game suspension imposed by Bibby,
dropped a fall semester class and fell below full-time student
status, and is awaiting the posting of grades Tuesday to see whether
he pulled himself out of academic probation. He attended Thursday's
practice but did not participate. He will not be in uniform for the
Trojans' game Saturday against La Salle.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter," Bibby said. "On this day he's probably 70%
back mentally of where I would like him to be with his thinking about
life. When he gets back to 100% of making the commitment to Jerry
Dupree and to the school, then Jerry is welcome back with open arms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our role -- to help these kids get focused. Jerry has ...
one more year after this year, and what is he going to do if he
doesn't have someone that's going to be on him to make him focus?"</TE>
<TE>   Dupree has admitted that he has trouble keeping priorities
straight.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know, still to this day, there's so many things
out there," he said of why he is not allowed to participate in team
functions. "All I know is, I'm not playing and that's all that really
matters right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The MRI exam of junior center Jonathan Oliver's injured left ankle
was negative, but he has yet to return to practice since injuring it
Dec. 11.</TE>

<HD>USC Digs Out a Win, Reaches Final</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Two years ago at the NCAA women's volleyball semifinals, USC dug
itself a hole and could never get out of it. With their championship
dreams on the line Thursday night, the Trojans were in a similar spot
against Florida.</LD>
<LD>   The result couldn't have been more different. USC shook off its
initial deficit and advanced to its first national title match in 20
years with a 24-30, 30-25, 30-26, 30-24 victory over the Gators at
New Orleans Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The victory set up a grudge match with Stanford on Saturday. The
Cardinal advanced with a relatively easy 30-25, 30-27, 30-24 victory
over Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   "We all get pumped up to play Stanford," said junior April Ross.
"Just the fact that it's the championship match. I don't think we can
think that there's a more exciting match to play."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans (30-1) haven't played in a final since 1982 when they
lost to Hawaii. They can thank a deep and talented lineup getting
there this time.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Keao Burdine had a team-leading 16 kills, and three
others totaled at least nine over the four games.</TE>
<TE>   But it was what USC did defensively that changed the tone of the
match. After Florida jumped to a 10-3 lead and essentially wrapped up
the first game, the Trojans made some adjustments, particularly at
the net.</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Emily Adams and outside hitter Lauren Killian began
to shut off the hitting lanes for Florida. The Trojans totaled 24
blocks in all, with Adams and Killian each getting eight.</TE>
<TE>   "Blocking against a team like this definitely gets you fired up,"
said Adams, an All-American for the first time. "Once we started
getting a lot more in and getting a lot of touches off the hits, we
just got into our rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' height at the net provided a problem for the Gators
(34-3) as the match wore on. Florida committed 17 of its season-high
44 hitting errors in the final game, mostly in trying to hit away
from the blocks with cross-court kills that went wide.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere I was hitting, there were two blockers," said
Florida's Aury Cruz, who had 19 kills but also 12 errors.</TE>
<TE>   USC was also strong on the back row as defensive specialist Nicole
Davis and setter Tracy Lindquist continually kept balls alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We took some really good swings that came back at us," Florida
Coach Mary Wise said.</TE>

<HD>Now Is the Time for All Good Feds to Come to the Aid of
States</HD>
<DH>To boost economy, help them avoid new taxes and spending
cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William G. Gale</AU>
<BD>William G. Gale is a senior fellow with the Brookings
Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever emerges from the current tax cut debate in Washington, you
can be sure that politicians will call it a stimulus package. But the
tax cuts the Bush administration is promoting would fail miserably as
stimulus. Some of them could make things worse.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, there is a simple way to boost the economy now and
improve future prospects as well.</LD>
<LD>   We have had record amounts of stimulus in the last two years. The
Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 500 basis points, to the
lowest level in several decades. Federal spending increased by 6%,
and tax revenue fell by 13% as a share of the economy.</LD>
<TE>   Although most economists believe that tax cuts are a poor way to
boost the economy in the short run, the administration claimed that
its $1.35-trillion tax cut in 2001 was an insurance policy against
stagnation. Of course, the economic fallout from the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks could not have been forecast. Nevertheless, a mere
two years later, we are left with only a sputtering economy and a
vastly increased budget deficit. Now we are being asked to drink more
tax-cut snake oil.</TE>
<TE>   A new subsidy for business investment would generate little new
activity; it would just pay companies to do things they would have
done anyway. The cost of investing has already fallen dramatically
because of the generous depreciation rules enacted this year and
steep declines in interest rates and inflation. But investment has
been flat or falling. Businesses already have more excess capacity
than at any time in the last 20 years; why should they buy new plants
and equipment when they are not even using what they own?</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, tax cuts aimed at promoting saving work in the wrong
direction. Raising the contribution limit on retirement savings
accounts might boost saving a little, but it also would reduce
spending. Expanding deductions for capital losses would encourage
people to unload their losing stocks, generate a wave of selling and
push the market down.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting dividend taxes makes sense as part of a broader
deficit-neutral effort to clean up loopholes and problems in the
corporate tax, but not as stimulus. The stock market effect would be
muted because half of dividends already escape income taxes. The
stimulus would be even smaller because dividends go mainly to
high-income households that probably would save the money.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the silliest notion is that making the 2001 tax cut
permanent -- it is in effect through 2010 -- would boost the economy
now. In fact, it would significantly raise estimates of long-term
deficits and increase uncertainty about Social Security and Medicare.
This would raise interest rates now and hurt the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Another option being talked about is immediate tax cuts for
consumers. But the 2001 rebate appears to have been very weak
medicine; it barely shows up in the aggregate spending figures.
Phasing in the upper-income tax-rate cuts scheduled for 2004 or 2006
would provide little help to households in the bottom 60% of the
income distribution, which would be most likely to spend the money.
Accelerating the expansion of the lowest bracket or the child credit
or cutting payroll taxes would probably work better because these
measures would be directed more to lower-income households.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to boost the economy right now would be to increase
federal aid to the states, which are facing their worst financial
crisis in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the federal government, which is able to run a deficit, the
states must balance their budgets. During a recession, revenue falls
and spending needs rise, so states raise taxes or cut spending. This
helps restore their budgets but provides a negative stimulus to the
overall economy. This year it has cost in the range of $40 billion to
$50 billion, with higher costs expected in 2003. And because the
states are cutting spending on education, health and infrastructure,
the long-term ramifications will be negative. Several states are
cutting their prison budgets by releasing inmates early.</TE>
<TE>   An administration that purports to care about economic growth and
"leaving no child behind" should help states maintain critically
needed spending on education and other investments. This would boost
the economy now and augur well for the future.</TE>

<LD>Trent Lott stood on an old wood bridge spanning the Pascagoula River.
He watched as the muddy water slowly made its way to the Gulf of
Mexico. Some things move slow in Pascagoula.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly he became aware of a stranger standing to his right.</LD>
<LD>   "This bridge doesn't feel very safe," the little old man said.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't," Lott agreed, adding, "there aren't many wood bridges
left in Mississippi."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you'd be surprised," the stranger corrected with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Lott looked further into the night. The bridge shook with the
wind, and he grabbed the rail with both hands. "There's a bridge of
reinforced steel spanning this river." Frantically he looked closely
at the bridge. Where was the interstate bridge?</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on?" Lott asked softly.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't you just say you wished Strom Thurmond had been elected
president?" the old man asked nervously.</TE>
<TE>   "No. I said I wish that I never said that I wished Strom Thurmond
had been elected president."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh dear, I've made a little bit of a mess, I suppose," the old
man said, looking up to the stars. "Well, since we've gone to all
this trouble, how about a trip to Oxford to see your alma mater?"</TE>
<TE>   The little old man took Lott's hand, and they found themselves
standing in the middle of Ole Miss.</TE>
<TE>   The old man suggested they take a look at the law school, now
located in the administration building. They poked their heads in a
cavernous classroom, where three young white men listened to an
ancient professor with a tubercular cough lecture on states' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, appalled, grabbed the little old man. "What year is this?"</TE>
<TE>   "2002," the old man replied.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened?" Lott demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "They just can't attract the students they once could. And a
degree here doesn't mean much outside of Mississippi. These three
students," he pointed into the classroom where the students appeared
to be sleeping as an old, shabby black man swept the floor around
them, "are Jefferson Davis Scholarship students. They may be small in
numbers, but ... "</TE>
<TE>   "This all seems like ... " Lott interrupted, "like the past."</TE>
<TE>   "William Faulkner, a good chap, once said, 'The past is never
dead. It's not even the past.' Or something to that effect."</TE>
<TE>   Lott considered this and shuddered. "That sounds like something
Colin Powell would say."</TE>
<TE>   "Who's Colin Powell?" the old man asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Never mind. Take me to Canton," Lott ordered.</TE>
<TE>   The little man grabbed his arm. "OK, off we go."</TE>
<TE>   They settled onto a field on the outskirts of Canton. It was a
nice field. Lott saw the town and the I-55, but no factory or exit
ramp. "Where, where's the Nissan factory?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's not here," the old man said. "It was never built."</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean it was never built? I helped bring that factory
to Mississippi. And with it 3,900 jobs. Good jobs."</TE>
<TE>   "Nissan couldn't build their factory here. People -- all kinds of
people -- have moved elsewhere, to places where they felt more
welcome and where there were jobs. And immigrants aren't allowed in
Mississippi. So you see, how could you expect Nissan to build a
factory where there wouldn't be enough workers? You can't blame them
really. It's sound business."</TE>
<TE>   Lott began to lose control.</TE>
<TE>   "Take me back! Take me back I tell you!"</TE>
<TE>   "To Ole Miss?"</TE>
<TE>   "To the bridge. Please!"</TE>
<TE>   And they disappeared from the field. Lott found himself again on
the bridge. He saw the Ingalls shipyard in the distance. Lots of
lights, lots of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He realized the bridge was not made of wood and was steady, well
built. He looked down at his hands, which trembled terribly.</TE>

Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998). E-mail: ehutch

<DL></DL>
<LD>During the 1999-2000 Congress, the National Assn. for the Advancement
of Colored People gave one senator a near rock-bottom rating on its
scorecard of senators' votes on civil rights issues.</LD>
<LD>   That senator was not Trent Lott; it was Oklahoma Republican Don
Nickles.</LD>
<LD>   Though he has virtually called for Senate Republicans to dump Lott
as Senate majority leader, Nickles at times has even exceeded Lott in
his zeal to torpedo civil rights protections.</LD>
<TE>   Lott and Nickles opposed the creation of a federal holiday for
Martin Luther King Jr. and voted to abolish affirmative action in
federal hiring.</TE>
<TE>   But on the King holiday, Nickles went further and insultingly
suggested that the holiday should be an unpaid holiday, celebrated on
a Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Though Lott has publicly recanted his opposition to the King
holiday and affirmative action, Nickles has not.</TE>
<TE>   But Nickles is not the only top Republican -- and possible
successor to Lott if he steps down as majority leader -- to wallow
near the bottom on the Senate civil rights scorecard.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell
opposed expanded hate-crime protections, greater funding for
minority-owned businesses, efforts to end job discrimination by
sexual orientation and affirmative action in federal hiring.</TE>
<TE>   These three men have drawn raves from the American Conservative
Union. If Senate Republicans dump Lott or if he steps down, one of
the three could succeed him.</TE>
<TE>   These are Republican power brokers. Nickles, the incoming Senate
majority whip, called for the Jan. 6 GOP meeting to decide whether
Lott should step down. Frist headed the Senate Campaign Committee and
said Thursday that he is willing to replace Lott as majority leader
if he has sufficient backing from his colleagues. McConnell has
supported Lott but, as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee for four years, he is on the list of successor contenders.</TE>
<TE>   These men are not shoot-from-the-lip, bellicose, confrontational
race-baiters like Lott. They are quiet, respectable, gray-flannel
opponents of civil rights. And this makes them even more terrifying
than Lott.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what's even more frightening is that such men are a big reason
the Republicans have resuscitated the party from its century of near
extinction in the Deep South.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation came in 1964. Republican presidential candidate
Barry Goldwater rode the first tide of white backlash. He opposed the
1964 civil rights bill, railed against big government and championed
states rights. Despite his landslide loss to Lyndon Johnson,
Goldwater deeply planted the seed of racial pandering that would be
the centerpiece of the Republican's "Southern strategy" in the coming
decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Richard Nixon picked the hot-button issues of busing and
quotas, adopted a policy of benign neglect and subtly stoked white
racial fears. He enshrined in popular language racially tinged code
words such as "permissive society," "welfare cheats" and "subculture
of violence."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan picked up the racial torch by launching the first
major systematic attack on affirmative action programs and gutting
many social and education programs. He refused to meet with the
Congressional Black Caucus, attempted to reduce the power of the
Civil Rights Commission over employment discrimination cases and
opposed the extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the elder George Bush made escaped black convict Willie
Horton the poster boy for black crime and violence and turned the
presidential campaign against Michael Dukakis into a rout. He branded
a bill by Sen. Ted Kennedy to make it easier to bring employment
discrimination suits a "quotas bill." He further infuriated blacks by
appointing archconservative Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole waltzed through his
failed campaign against Bill Clinton in 1996 barely acknowledging
racial issues. He flatly rejected an invitation to speak at the NAACP
convention.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Republicans had a golden opportunity to loudly
denounce race-baiting extremist groups when it was revealed that Lott
and former Georgia Rep. Robert Barr had snuggled up to the
pro-segregation Council for Conservative Citizens. The GOP --
including Nickles, McConnell and Frist -- was stone silent on the
group.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has also subtly stoked the racial fires. He spoke
at racially archaic Bob Jones University, ducked the Confederate flag
fight and the racial profiling issue and refused to support tougher
hate-crimes legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is his handling of the Lott debacle. When Lott attended
a second Strom Thurmond birthday bash at the White House, there is no
indication that Bush rebuked Lott for his remarks. It took nearly a
week, and a firestorm of public outrage, before Bush finally
condemned him.</TE>
<TE>   Lott apologists worry that with him out as Senate leader, the GOP
conservative agenda will go to pot. With Nickles, McConnell or Frist,
and Bush as gatekeeper of that agenda, there's no danger of that.</TE>

<HD>Mapping Out Peace in the Mideast</HD>
<DH>'Quartet' needs to alter plan to move from conflict to
Bush's solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Ross</AU>
<BD>Dennis Ross, director of the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, is a former U.S. envoy to the Middle East.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In my 20 years involved in Middle East diplomacy, there have been
many times when the effort toward peace appeared futile to the
parties involved. But none of those times had the ring of
hopelessness that I see in the region today.</LD>
<LD>   It is clear that Israelis, after two years of violence, believe
they have no partner for peace among the Palestinians. For their
part, Palestinians question whether the current Israeli government
has any plan other than to try to extinguish their aspirations
through force.</LD>
<LD>   Neither side believes that any change is possible as long as
Yasser Arafat remains leader of the Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Israelis believe that Arafat legitimizes terror and has never
reconciled himself to their existence. Palestinians understand that
he offers nothing but tired slogans. But they part company on what to
do about Arafat. Israelis want him out; Palestinians want him
marginalized. Palestinian reformers, in particular, are leery of
appearing as tools of the U.S. or Israel. They do not want to take on
Arafat frontally; instead, their answer is to push for elections at
the municipal and legislative levels.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is compounded by the fact that they will not be able
to hold these elections while the Israeli military occupies nearly
every city in the West Bank -- and the Israelis will not withdraw the
army if the result would be a new wave of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, if Palestinians won't act to stop terror against Israelis,
then the military won't pull out, there won't be elections, there
won't be reform, and Arafat will not be marginalized the way the
reformers envision.</TE>
<TE>   Left to their own devices, nothing between these antagonists will
change. That alone is a powerful argument for a "road map" of
sequential and reciprocal steps.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, President Bush laid out a vision for a post-Oslo
resolution of the conflict. The so-called quartet -- the United
States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- has
worked to develop a road map for moving from the current situation of
conflict to Bush's two-state solution. Following the logic of Bush's
speech, the road map is supposed to be built on performance.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the road map that quartet members are presenting
today is flawed, making performance unlikely and the president's
goals unachievable. The map has three basic failings.</TE>
<TE>   First, it commits to the Palestinian strategic goals: End the
occupation and accept an independent, democratic and viable
Palestinian state. But there is nothing comparable in the road map
that responds to Israel's strategic goals. Israel needs not a
cease-fire but a renunciation of violence that makes clear there is a
legitimate and an illegitimate way to pursue the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   At no time during the Oslo process were those who carried out acts
of terror against Israelis ever treated as enemies of the cause by
the Palestinian leadership. The road map, like Oslo before it, makes
no effort to de-legitimize terror and violence. Until they are
de-legitimized, those tactics will continue, and those in the
Palestinian security services called on to make arrests will be seen
as doing the quartet's or Israel's bidding.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the road map spells out no real responsibilities of Arab
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders would make it easier for Palestinian reformers to
declare the illegitimacy of terror if they would join them in
proclaiming that those who are not prepared to resolve all
differences through peaceful means are enemies of the Palestinian
cause.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Arab leaders could help Palestinian reformers by
endorsing a Palestinian prime minister to hold executive power. Few
steps would more profoundly signal that Arafat's time is past.</TE>
<TE>   These would not be easy steps for Arab leaders to take. But
certainly the Israelis are being asked immediately to take difficult
steps -- dismantle settlement outposts erected since March 2001 and
freeze all settlement activity.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. is being asked to carry the burden of making sure
that the road map is implemented. So when Arab leaders come to
President Bush -- as they will after a war with Saddam Hussein, to
challenge Bush to be as successful in peace as in war -- the
president must be armed with a road map that requires Arab leaders to
assume their responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the road map now creates the illusion of specificity.
Though it contains seven pages of reciprocal obligations, my
experience with the parties tells me that they will interpret each
point differently.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians will have one definition for ending incitement,
the Israelis another, the Europeans possibly a third. The same for an
Israeli settlement freeze. The same for arrests that Palestinians are
supposed to carry out.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than providing criteria for evaluating performance by each
side, each benchmark will itself become a focal point for debate --
and that will lead to one more dead-end in peacemaking.</TE>
<TE>   The road map need not be a lost cause. But its strategic premise
must be corrected, Arab leaders must do their part, and each
benchmark must be defined with a common meaning. Then Bush's vision
might finally have a mechanism to make it a reality.</TE>

<HD>Paean to Poinsettias</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years ago when Johnny Carson hosted "The Tonight Show," around the
holidays the entire stage overflowed with proud poinsettias whose
reds and greens exploded on color TV. Do you remember that? We don't
either. But that's among the oft-told stories surrounding this
unusual seasonal flower, America's best-selling potted plant and a
living synonym for the holidays. But the flower's ubiquity and
enduring popularity are due in large part to the gardening and
marketing skills of a little-known Californian, Paul Ecke Jr.</LD>
<LD>   By clever planting, cutting, hybridizing, forcing, twisting,
positioning and selling, Ecke and his father turned this once
pedestrian roadside Mexican plant into a red-and-green symbol of joy,
an American holiday staple. They even tortured some plants with
X-rays to produce double and triple blooms and exotic hues like
purple and orange.</LD>
<TE>   Ecke asked around. He learned that men have two tendencies when
visiting florists: One, they're feeling guilty about something and,
two, they buy cut flowers. Women, on the other hand, prefer potted
plants any time; in fact, women buy eight of 10 potted plants
year-round. Poinsettias are potted plants. A year-round business is
better than a seasonal one; ask cranberry growers. So Ecke built on
his father's homespun horticultural skills to breed poinsettias that
last months longer, which was savvy, not subversive. Not only did
months of life lengthen the sales season, they could produce bumper
crops of props for colorful photo layouts in women's magazines, which
prepare their year-end holiday issues months before.</TE>
<TE>   Come Thanksgiving, photos of gorgeously lush, appropriately
red-and-green potted plants started appearing in millions of homes
far from the Eckes' Encinitas ranch. Eckes also offered regiments of
plants as free TV scenery.</TE>
<TE>   All of this prompted millions of buyers to want poinsettias and
thousands of florists to seek them from the main U.S. supplier, which
is, yep, the Eckes' operation. If you were into plant genealogy, you
could trace about 80% of the 65 million poinsettia plants grown
annually to Eckes' place.</TE>
<TE>   The plant wasn't native to California. The Aztecs used it as red
dye and a fever-reducer. They called it cuetlaxochitle, which doesn't
exactly sing in English. In the 1820s along came Joel Poinsett (note
that last name), America's first ambassador to Mexico and a botanist.
He took some cuetlaxochitle back to South Carolina for propagation --
and renaming. The rest is history. So, sadly, is Paul Ecke Jr. He
died of cancer at 76 last May, when poinsettias once didn't prosper.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first holiday season in 80 years without a Paul Ecke
Sr. or Jr. peddling poinsettias. But judging by the nation's
bountiful holiday decorations this week, the flower of their
imaginations and agricultural acumen blooms on.</TE>

<LD>In the aftermath of 9/11, the national consensus was that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service had to have better control
over who was in the country legally or illegally. However, it was
important that regaining control of immigration not trample on human
rights, especially of those already caught in the INS paperwork limbo
as they became permanent legal residents.</LD>
<LD>   For people who voluntarily showed up to register at INS offices in
Southern California this week, the system seems to have buckled.
Reports in The Times and other media say that hundreds of men, from
teens on up, were handcuffed, shackled and, according to their
lawyers, even hosed down in jail. INS spokesperson Francisco Arcaute
denies that the detainees were hosed down but admits that "following
standard procedures, those who were transported from one location to
another may have been belly-handcuffed."</LD>
<LD>   Most important for national security, after an experience like
this, can the INS expect that people will show up for the next
registration?</LD>
<TE>   This unfortunate episode began last month when Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft issued an order requiring males 16 or older from 18 Mideast,
North African and other Muslim countries and who are not permanent
U.S. residents to go to an INS office. There, he said, they would be
registered, photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed. Those who
did not comply would face criminal charges or deportation, or both.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, immigrants with expired visas or who didn't bring
adequate documentation of their immigration status were detained. The
INS, saying they were in violation of immigration laws, refuses to
say how many or who they are. All such information should be made
public. As of Thursday, most detainees were being released after
clearing a background check.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for many of the largely Iranian detainees claim they
were already following INS regulations closely. Given the proven
incompetence of the INS with paperwork, the complaints sound
feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for example, the suit filed in Cleveland by four men who
went to register and were detained. "The three men," the Plain Dealer
reports, "responded to an amnesty offer from the INS last year and
admitted that they were in the country illegally, paid a fine and
filed for permanent residency. They are still waiting for the
paperwork to come through and therefore are technically in violation
of immigration laws."</TE>
<TE>   The INS and the Justice Department need a much better way to do
business.</TE>

<LD>The South Korean presidential election campaign that ended Thursday
was remarkable for its outspoken opposition by both major parties to
the United States, whose 37,000 troops in South Korea help protect
that nation and guarantee security across East Asia. The victor, Roh
Moo Hyun, was less friendly toward Washington than his opponent and
more willing to continue his predecessor's "sunshine policy" of
accommodation with North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration said during the campaign that it could
work with either candidate, but it faces tougher going with Roh, who
will take office in February. Roh, the candidate of the ruling party,
boasted of never having visited the U.S. and promised not to "kowtow"
to Washington.</LD>
<LD>   He first gained attention as a lawyer for human rights activists,
criticizing the U.S. and its support of authoritarian rulers 20 years
ago. He was the favorite of the young, who have grown up in a nation
of peace, affluence and reconstruction from the 1950-53 war that
killed about 3 million people, many of them civilians, and more than
36,000 U.S. troops.</LD>
<TE>   Communist North Korea's surprise admission in October that it is
continuing a nuclear weapons program brought different responses from
Seoul and Washington. Roh wants to keep providing financial aid and
investment to the North and maintain cultural exchanges; Washington
demands that North Korea first end the nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea should not be allowed to play close allies against
each other in this way. The Bush administration is spending a great
deal of time and attention on Iraq, a nation without nuclear weapons.
It needs to pay more attention to the Korean peninsula, where North
Korea may already be a small nuclear power. Washington and Seoul must
join Japan to decide a joint strategy toward the north. At some point
the United States will also have to talk with Pyongyang and try to
resurrect an agreement in which the North agrees to outside
verification that it has stopped developing nuclear weapons in return
for resumed U.S. aid, such as fuel oil shipments, and a nonaggression
pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Washington and South Korea need to separately discuss the status
of U.S. troops in the country. The acquittals last month of two U.S.
soldiers whose mine-clearing vehicle ran over and killed two
schoolgirls led to large anti-American street rallies. Moving troops
from Seoul to other cities would ease tensions; so would modestly
reducing the number of U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   Roh is unlikely to jeopardize the U.S. relationship, but he and
other South Koreans want more, and more respectful, consultation from
Washington. The United States needs assistance from South Korea in
approaching the North, even if one plays the bad cop and the other
the good cop. High-level talks with Roh and his aides should begin
even before he assumes office. The Korean peninsula is too dangerous
a place to be pushed to the background.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "Dolores Mission Sees Homeless Men as Modern-Day
Versions of Juan Diego" (Dec. 14). As a proud Catholic, I can stop
for a moment and read in The Times an article that represents the
true church of today. It is filled with people like Father Michael
Kennedy, doing similar things every day, not asking for anything in
return. He is quietly leading his parishioners by example, as do
thousands of priests, nuns and lay people in the church.</LD>
<LD>   I have always felt through this dark period in the church that the
real strength of the people who serve will overshadow the negative.
Father Kennedy stated, "Who we really think is important is not
important in God's eyes." That is the message of my church.</LD>

<LD>Re "Most Unconvinced on Iraq War," Dec. 17: Good work, guys. Since
you've determined that 72% of the public believes the president has
not provided enough evidence to justify a war, you've given him a
clear mandate. He must find some or fabricate it, fast. Otherwise, he
can't go in with guns blazing, as he so obviously desires. Whatever
"evidence" he comes up with will be as suspect as his motives in the
eyes of the world. One thing is certain, for him, peace is not an
option.</LD>

enjoying Saddam Hussein-like popularity among those in his party, and
the Republicans polled obviously never listened to their mothers when
they warned, "If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you
follow them?"</TE>

<TE>   Wow, it turns out 97% of Republicans approve of Bush's job
performance!</TE>
<TE>   With that knowledge, we suspected that almost any question asked
would get at least a 50% approval rating. Sure enough, further down
the list is "environmental issues" -- 48% said yes.</TE>

<HD>Los Alamos Remains Committed to Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Dec. 10 editorial, "Barn Door Open at the Lab," unfairly
tarnishes the reputations of Los Alamos National Laboratory and its
work force of over 12,000. I know of no workforce more committed to
national security than the dedicated people at Los Alamos. So to
suggest that laboratory employees and management are tolerant of a
climate of theft is grotesquely unfair. We never have tolerated, and
never will tolerate, such an attitude.</LD>
<LD>   Our audits have accounted for 99.8% or more of our $1-billion
inventory of equipment. Compare that record to the best practices in
private industry, where they often write off a higher percentage of
total inventory. We acknowledge there have been times that a few
employees have betrayed our trust. The laboratory has taken
appropriate disciplinary action, including termination, where
individuals have been shown to be involved in wrongdoing. We always
cooperate fully with those investigating any wrongdoing. In addition,
we have recently made improvements in our business systems that, we
are confident, will greatly inhibit the potential for future abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Regarding the two former employees who claim the laboratory has
retaliated against them for uncovering these problems, I remain
convinced that the decision to end their employment was the right one
and that the several investigations now underway will eventually make
it clear that no cover-up has taken place.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there has been no indication of any compromise of
national security. For example, by comparing individual serial
numbers, we have determined that none of the computers reported as
missing contained any classified information. The laboratory's
compelling mission of enhancing global security, particularly in the
wake of Sept. 11 and the current war on global terrorism, remains as
important as ever to our nation. We believe that continued confidence
in Los Alamos National Laboratory is justified.</TE>

<LD>So, we find that CSX Corp., which President Bush's soon-to-be
Treasury Secretary John Snow headed, didn't pay taxes for two out of
the last four years (Dec. 11). The real crime seems to be not the
forgiven loan of Snow's for $24 million for a stock deal that didn't
work out or his selling of stocks just before financial problems
arose, but that a company making a pretax profit of over a billion
dollars not only doesn't owe taxes but, actually, in some cases, got
money back!</LD>
<LD>   The defenders of CSX and Snow said the taxes avoided and deferred
were perfectly legal. I don't doubt that they were, but how did
something like this, so business-biased, get to be legal? Are the
people in our country who actually work and pay their taxes the last
of the "suckers"?</LD>

<LD>Re "Too Far to the Left for Far Right," Dec. 17: As an African
American and a Democrat, I don't know if I am more amused or
distressed that so many Republicans and others are now screaming for
Sen. Trent Lott's (R-Miss.) head because of his recent gaffe. Had
there been any credible commitment to people of color in the
Republican agenda, someone with Lott's record on civil rights would
never have been the face of its leadership in the first place. When
will the political leadership in this country, both Republican and
Democratic, learn that racism is not what people think or say, but
rather that racism is what people do?</LD>

and that Confederate President Jefferson Davis was not the man Lott
should most admire.</TE>

<TE>   Fellow Democrats, shut up! The more Lott says, the deeper the hole
he digs for himself and even more for the Republican Party. Let him
survive. With Lott leading the GOP, every one of George W.'s bad
policies and bad bills will fail to pass. They will all be
scrutinized for the bigotry they are born of and badly fail the
fairness test. We need Lott; keep quiet and let him stay.</TE>

<LD>Re "State High Court Endorses Davis' Denials of Parole," Dec. 17:
What a terrible decision by the California Supreme Court. Why let the
courts and juries hear evidence if their sentences of second-degree
murder can be changed, in effect, to first-degree murder without the
benefit of parole by the governor without his hearing testimony
firsthand?</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, why pay the state Board of Prison Terms commissioners
over $90,000 a year if their recommendations are almost always
reversed by the governor? With our huge budget deficit, it makes no
sense to keep deserving prisoners in prison for life at a big cost to
the taxpayers while severe cuts are made in education and health
care. Hopefully the U.S. Supreme Court will eventually rule fairly on
this very bad decision.</LD>

<LD>Re "Manzanar Restoration a Step Toward Honesty," letters, Dec. 15: Of
particular interest to me is the letter from Carolyn Brouwers, who
uses the book "Farewell to Manzanar" as a teaching tool. She says
that her students are surprised to learn of this bit of history. I
suggest that their reading of "Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic
Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission" (Bataan Death March),
by Hampton Sides, and "Flags of Our Fathers" (Battle of Iwo Jima), by
James Bradley with Ron Powers, would also be enlightening and would
somewhat balance their education. I have a degree of sympathy
concerning Manzanar, but keep the perspective that it was part of a
very large picture.</LD>

<LD>I don't wonder that many of those nice postal baskets are missing
("Return to Sender. Please." editorial, Dec. 15). I recently picked
up my vacation mail in one (the collection and care of vacation mail
is one of the nicest things the post office has done, in my opinion),
and when I had emptied it at home, I put the basket outside on the
mailbox for the carrier to pick up. The next day it was still there,
and the next. I thought perhaps the carrier couldn't see it because
he didn't leave his vehicle when he delivered the mail, so I put it
on top of the box where he couldn't open the box without moving the
basket aside. Still there! I waited the next day, watching him
deliver the mail and fill the box, and when he started to drive away,
still leaving the empty basket, I yelled at him and asked, "Don't you
want to take the empty basket?" He looked pained and said, "Yes." And
he took it.</LD>

<HD>Suits Expected Over Ahmanson OK</HD>
<DH>City and county of L.A., as well as Calabasas, plan to take
legal action against Ventura County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city and county of Los Angeles and the city of Calabasas are
expected to file lawsuits against Ventura County, following its
approval of the Ahmanson Ranch environmental study, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and Councilman Dennis Zine
expressed support for legal action seeking to overturn the
environmental study, which they said fails to comply with state law
by not thoroughly reviewing the potential impacts of the project on
traffic, water quality and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the county
would very likely join a lawsuit by others or file its own legal
challenge.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed in the Ventura County Board of Supervisors'
decision," Yaroslavsky said. "They had ample evidence the decision
was wrong, but they went ahead anyway."</TE>
<TE>   In Calabasas -- which like the city and county of Los Angeles
would border the 3,050-home project -- the City Council on Wednesday
authorized attorney Katherine Stone to take legal action against
Ventura County to stop the Ahmanson Ranch development.</TE>
<TE>   Stone plans to file court papers within weeks arguing that the
Ventura County supervisors' decision harms the region's welfare by
violating environmental, water-quality and other state laws.</TE>
<TE>   The study also fails to adequately address ground water pollution
issues that have been raised in recent weeks, officials for the city
and county of Los Angeles and Calabasas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Ventura County] Board of Supervisors knows the [Los Angeles]
position on this issue," Hahn said. "We have made that clear.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that the environmental review of this project is grossly
inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky also said it appeared Ventura County officials acted
on the belief that they would receive all the tax benefits from
having such a major development, but have none of the negative
environmental impacts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they adequately considered the issue of
perchlorates," Yaroslavsky said, referring to a toxic chemical found
recently in a well on the Ahmanson property.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is life-and-death," said Calabasas Mayor Lesley
Devine, referring to potential ground water contamination by
perchlorate and radioactive material that opponents believe was not
adequately examined.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever legal mess Ventura County is getting itself into, it is
nothing compared to the mess [developer] Washington Mutual is getting
into" if health problems result from the project, Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said he was "saddened" to learn of the Ventura County
supervisors' vote and cited the problem of potential ground water
pollution in likening the project to the Belmont Learning Center,
which was stopped in part because of toxic contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need another Belmont, Love Canal, or a gridlocked 101
Ventura Freeway," Zine said. "The Ventura County Board of Supervisors
has clearly shown blatant disregard for its neighbors and their best
interests. This project is a disaster in the making."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn added that the study failed to "address the traffic impacts
on the 101 Freeway or streets in the western San Fernando Valley."</TE>
<TE>   "Legally, what we are going to be asking for is a finding by the
court that the current environmental studies aren't adequate and to
send this back for further environmental review," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council voted Dec. 11 to authorize the city
attorney to prepare a lawsuit, and set a Jan. 7 meeting to discuss
the lawsuit again.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said the city attorney has authority to file a lawsuit sooner
if necessary, but Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker, noting the
deadline for filing is Jan. 18, said he will probably wait until
after he can brief the council Jan. 7 on the proposed litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure the client understands what I am doing and
why," Pritsker said.</TE>
<TE>   Pritsker said he may file a lawsuit in the second week of January
in Superior Court, asking a judge to approve a writ of mandate that
would set aside the action by Ventura County supervisors as flawed
and order the board to do additional traffic studies based on new
information from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Pritsker said he would meet with attorneys for Calabasas and Los
Angeles County to coordinate legal strategies and to decide whether
an injunction should be sought to prevent grading on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Although some Los Angeles City Council members have questioned
whether a lawsuit is justified, Zine said it is essential in
protecting his West Valley district from harm. "We now have no choice
but to move forward with legal action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said, ideally, the developer will decide to scuttle the
project and preserve the property as open space, but said short of
that, the city must go to court to protect its interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the council and I have both urged the city attorney," he
said, "and the city attorney concurs, that if this action is taken,
the city should pursue legal action."</TE>

<HD>Community Colleges Consider Bond Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To help it cope with the state budget crisis, the Los Angeles
Community College District is considering whether to put a bond
measure of $500 million to $1 billion on the election ballot next
year.</LD>
<LD>   The district's board is likely to decide at its Jan. 8 meeting
whether to move ahead with the ballot issue, which would follow
Proposition A, a $1.25-billion measure approved by voters in April
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Warren T. Furutani, president of the district's board, said the
idea for a new bond issue had been prompted largely by the budget
crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The Davis administration has proposed midyear cuts of $215 million
for the state's community colleges, a reduction expected to hit the
oversubscribed, nine-campus Los Angeles district particularly hard.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking into every possible way to limit the impact of the
cuts," Furutani said.</TE>
<TE>   District officials, who are already struggling to deal with high
enrollment and aging facilities, expect more state spending cuts next
year because of the depth of California's budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The district's administration has begun to explore a bond measure
of $500 million to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the proceeds would be used to pay off the cost of
energy-saving projects completed in recent years at Los Angeles City
College and at Pierce College in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bond money, officials said, would probably also be used to
refinance property-acquisition debt and possibly to pay for
construction of a satellite campus planned for the Glassell Park
area.</TE>
<TE>   One of the aims, officials said, is to refinance current debts
with lower-interest bond financing. In all, such refinancing could
save the district $7 million a year from its general fund, according
to the district's chancellor, Marshall "Mark" Drummond.</TE>
<TE>   He said the bond money also could be used to purchase the
district's downtown headquarters, which the system rents for $2
million a year.</TE>

<HD>FAA Says Burbank Airport Doesn't Need New Terminal</HD>
<DH>Agency believes airfield is operating safely, and asks that
$42 million for project site be returned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank Airport can continue to operate safely without a new
passenger terminal, and tens of millions of dollars allocated for a
relocation site must be returned since the project has been
abandoned, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</LD>
<LD>   "Our long-standing support for the relocation of the terminal was
based on our interest in bringing the airfield up to current design
standards," FAA Administrator Marion C. Blakey wrote in a letter
Thursday to airport officials. "However ... we believe that
operations in the present location can continue safely in the future
as in the past."</LD>
<LD>   Blakey also asked that the Burbank-Glendale-Airport Authority
return the money -- totaling $42 million in grants and fees -- it has
received to purchase land for the new terminal. The money has already
been used as part of the $86 million the airport spent on a
relocation site, said airport spokesman Victor J. Gill. No timetable
was set for returning the money.</LD>
<TE>   Blakey noted in her letter "the difficult history" behind the
authority's more than 20-year effort to replace the airport's aging
terminal without being able to reach consensus on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, airport commissioners voted 5-4 to abandon the
relocation efforts, citing strong community opposition. Commissioners
said the only way they would resurrect the project is if the FAA
mandated a move for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Portions of the airport's 72-year-old terminal are within 300 feet
of a runway, while current building standards mandate a buffer of at
least 750 feet. Airport officials have been working toward moving the
terminal since at least 1980.</TE>
<TE>   But Blakey said in her letter to authority President Chris Holden
that the FAA would not force the relocation issue.</TE>
<TE>   "As the airport operator, it is your decision whether to continue
to pursue this project or to terminate it," Blakey wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials say they believe that the FAA's position kills any
chances that the new terminal project can be revived.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put this chapter behind us," Holden said. "Rather than the
salmon swimming upstream, it's better we put the project to bed."</TE>
<TE>   It was Holden's concerns that prompted Blakey's letter. Holden
wrote to the FAA administrator on Nov. 4, asking for guidance on the
terminal issue, saying that "the debate over this project tears at
the fabric of this community."</TE>
<TE>   "I write to you at this time because the authority has reached the
point where it believes the terminal relocation no longer appears to
be achievable," Holden wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Burbank voters approved Measure A, which prohibited the
City Council from approving new airport construction unless a
mandatory flight curfew was imposed. A judge later declared the
initiative unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But a majority of airport commissioners believed Measure A
reflected community sentiment about airport operations. Moreover,
Measure B, another voter initiative passed in 2000, gives Burbank
residents the right to veto plans for a new terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the FAA's response to Holden's concerns, some Burbank
officials said Thursday they believe the terminal relocation is still
a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   The letter doesn't forbid the city from going forward with a new
terminal, said Burbank City Councilman David Golonski. "We're still
at the same place we were yesterday," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank officials have been pushing to revive the
terminal-relocation project because they believe a new and safer
building would give them greater leverage in asking the FAA to permit
nighttime flight curfews to reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   Golonski said he would still like to "put together a package" for
federal approval that would include a new terminal and restrictions
on nighttime flights. He said he plans to be part of a delegation,
along with other officials from Glendale and Pasadena, to go to
Washington in January to meet with FAA officials about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Lombardo, vice president of the authority, agreed with
Golonski that the decision over a new terminal is "still in the hands
of the airport authority and the three cities."</TE>

<HD>Judge May Delay Special Election in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Measure V -- which allows voters to fill the vacancy on the
Board of Supervisors -- is flawed, jurist says. He may void county's
new charter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge on Thursday threw into disarray plans for a
Jan. 28 special election to fill a vacant Board of Supervisors seat,
saying the ballot measure that made the vote possible is seriously
flawed and may be thrown out.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Banks suggested that the election
could be postponed until he makes a final decision on the validity of
Measure V, which voters approved to give voters -- rather than the
governor -- the power to fill board vacancies.</LD>
<LD>   If he finds the charter is unconstitutional, the election would be
called off, raising the possibility that Gov. Gray Davis would
ultimately appoint a supervisor.</LD>
<TE>   County attorneys will ask the board in a special meeting today
whether they want to spend money on the election -- a minimum of
$292,000 -- given Banks' warnings.</TE>
<TE>   By law, supervisors cannot stop or postpone the election on their
own but can ask the judge to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really in limbo," said board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad,
who said she is still reviewing the court proceedings and hasn't
decided how she will vote. "It puts the county in an awkward
position, and it puts the candidates in an awkward position." Banks'
comments came three days after the registrar of voters finalized the
Jan. 28 ballot and as the five qualified candidates were out
campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V was approved by Orange County voters in March. Before
then, the county was governed by the general laws of the state.
Measure V created a county charter, allowing Orange County to craft
some of its own regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, written by outgoing Supervisor Todd Spitzer,
contained a single provision allowing voters to fill board vacancies
instead the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V won broad support from the local Republican Party
because without a charter, Davis, a Democrat, would appoint Spitzer's
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Banks on Thursday faulted Measure V, saying it gave voters the
mistaken impression that any future changes in the charter would be
made only by a vote of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Except for filling board vacancies, the charter simply carries
over all other state laws and regulations. And those rules, the judge
said, can be changed by the state Legislature without approval from
county voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that this type of deficiency ... exposes the
entire measure to challenge and to possible failure because what the
voters were told may clearly be incorrect," Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge will take up the matter again on Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   He said he might postpone the election on his own if the trial is
delayed beyond that date -- a warning to the county's attorneys to
cooperate on pre-trial matters.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ruled that no other candidates could run if the
election is postponed.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit challenging Measure V was filed by several citizens,
headed by Joe Kerr, chief of Orange County's firefighters union.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyers argued that the new charter failed to follow seven
of the eight state constitutional guidelines dictating how counties
may establish home rule.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, as well as county attorneys, said the measure met all
constitutional requirements, and also should be upheld because it put
decisions in the hands of voters. He said Thursday that supervisors
already authorized spending money on the election, so it should go
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the measure was designed to boost the political
fortunes of former Assemblyman Bill Campbell, one of the announced
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer endorsed Campbell, and some believe Spitzer sponsored
Measure V to help Campbell. Spitzer has denied political motives.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the five candidates seeking the seat are Republican, as
are most of the district's registered voters.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Stymied on D.A.'s Fund</HD>
<DH>The O.C. prosecutor's office has withheld documentation,
saying providing the data would jeopardize investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's auditor says he cannot tell whether a fund overseen
by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas was spent inappropriately because the
office has not provided him with detailed documentation on its use.</LD>
<LD>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom started investigating the
fund in October, four months after the Orange County Grand Jury said
the office's chief investigator inappropriately billed the fund
repeatedly for bar tabs.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas wrote Sundstrom last month to say that all expenses
billed to the special fund were related to criminal or civil
investigations. He did not identify the people who were entertained
or provide further detail, saying such disclosure would jeopardize
investigations, Sundstrom said.</LD>
<TE>   In June, the grand jury accused Investigations Chief Don
Blankenship of using the fund to pay for meal and alcohol expenses
during meetings with politicians, lobbyists, clergy and reporters.
According to the report, Blankenship billed the fund 38 times for
tabs he ran up at the Elks Club in Santa Ana. Some expenses were for
food and alcohol, but most were exclusively for alcohol, the report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury concluded that the spending violated a 1994 office
policy that states that money from the special fund Blankenship
tapped should be used primarily for investigations or cases.
Blankenship billed the fund more than $4,600 between 1999 and 2001,
according to the grand jury report, which did not say what portion of
that spending it found questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas sent the auditor a memo from Blankenship that --
contradicting the grand jury -- indicated that all alcohol and food
purchases the chief billed to the fund involved "criminal or civil
investigations or cases."</TE>
<TE>   Because the district attorney did not provide detailed
documentation, the auditor said, he could not resolve the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney is telling me I'd jeopardize criminal
investigations by getting access to those documents. Given that, I
have to take him at his word," Sundstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom said he is now considering asking the state attorney
general's office to investigate because he believes its staff would
have better access to the internal records.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's officials did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>

<HD>Dolly Dawn, 86; Popular Big-Band Singer in '30, '40s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dolly Dawn, a popular big-band vocalist and recording star of the
1930s and '40s who was known for her deft touch with rhythm tunes and
ballads, has died. She was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Dawn, who performed for a time as Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol,
died of kidney failure Dec. 11 in the Actor's Fund Nursing Home and
Assisted Living Care Facility in Englewood, N.J. She had suffered
from diabetes in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   As featured vocalist with the George Hall Orchestra, which
broadcast live six days a week from the Taft Hotel in New York City
over CBS radio in the 1930s, Dawn scored a string of hit records.</LD>
<TE>   They included "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie," "Every Minute of the
Hour," "Robins and Roses," "Says My Heart," "My Own" and "Little
Yellow Basket."</TE>
<TE>   Replacing Loretta Lee as the band's vocalist in 1935, the
ebullient and endearing Dawn was an immediate hit, reportedly
inspiring show business columnist Walter Winchell to coin the phrase
"singing like a canary."</TE>
<TE>   Dawn's lively rendition of "You're a Sweetheart" became the
nation's most popular record in early 1938 and one of her signature
tunes.</TE>
<TE>   She periodically had multiple hits at the same time, and made
guest appearances on "Your Hit Parade" and the Bob Hope, Edgar Bergen
and Milton Berle radio shows.</TE>
<TE>   Dawn also appeared in musical shorts, and she had her name and
face on more than 400 pieces of sheet music.</TE>
<TE>   Ella Fitzgerald, who became a lifelong friend, credited Dawn as
one of her influences.</TE>
<TE>   "Dolly could swing and also break your heart with a ballad," said
Alan Eichler, a talent manager and friend who booked Dawn into the
Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood and the Biltmore Hotel in
downtown Los Angeles in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just a sincerity in everything she did," said Eichler,
"and physically, she looked like a dolly. She had bright, carrot-red
hair and a cherubic face and wore bright red lipstick."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of Italian immigrants, Dawn was born Theresa Maria
Stabile on Feb. 3, 1916, in Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   She grew up in Montclair, N.J., where her father at one point ran
a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she was a teenager, she was singing under the name
Billie Starr on a local weekend radio show and had won first place in
an amateur talent contest in Newark conducted by Hall.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years later, after learning that Hall's female
vocalist was leaving the band, Dawn arranged to audition for the
bandleader.</TE>
<TE>   Hall was considering a number of new stage names for his young
singer when Harriet Mencken, a columnist for the New York
Journal-American, met her.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you're as dimpled as a dolly, and as fresh as the dawn,"
Mencken said. "What about Dolly Dawn?"</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s, Hall began featuring Dawn with a small group of
musicians from the main band, which gave rise to the billing "Dolly
Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol."</TE>
<TE>   At the height of her success, Dawn was simultaneously under
contact to two rival record labels: RCA's Bluebird label with the
George Hall Orchestra, and Vocalion, Columbia's jazz label, as Dolly
Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol -- which, Eichler said, "was unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Before hiring Dawn, Eichler said, the George Hall Orchestra had
been a popular yet uninspiring dance band at the Taft Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the one who gave it its zip," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Hall decided to stop leading his band and serve just as its
manager, he staged an elaborate ceremony at New York's Roseland
Ballroom on July 4, 1941, where he officially turned over the band's
leadership to Dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just a gimmick," Eichler said. "When she took over the
band, she actually learned to conduct."</TE>
<TE>   But in less than a year, as musicians began to be drafted, Dolly
Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol disbanded. Dawn pursued a solo career, but
it never matched her previous success.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1950s, her career was in decline. In 1975, spurred by
RCA's release of a two-disc collection of her original recordings
with the George Hall Orchestra, Dawn experienced a resurgence of
popularity in New York City's jazz and cabaret clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Larry Taylor of the Chelsea Music Society, a musical
librarian who had archived her work, organized a series of concerts
for Dawn at Caroline's, the Latin Quarter and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The concerts led to two new albums: "Smooth as Silk" and "Memories
of You" (Audiophile), in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1986 "Memories of You," Los Angeles Times jazz critic
Leonard Feather wrote: "One of the pleasant surprises of the season
is Dawn's reemergence as a first-rate, jazz-influenced singer."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Dawn performed occasionally in New York clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame at a
ceremony in West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Aunt Dolly got up and sang a song, 'Exactly Like You,'" recalled
Peter Sando, Dawn's nephew. "It was beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Dawn, who never married, also is survived by her sister, Ida Sando
of Spring Lake, N.J.</TE>

<HD>UCI Selects Acupuncture Expert for Chair</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A UC Irvine professor and expert in acupuncture's effects on the
heart and circulation has been chosen for the Lawrence K. Dodge
Endowed Chair in Integrative Biology.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. John Longhurst, a professor of medicine and cardiology, was
named to the chair created with a $1.2-million gift from Dodge and
his wife, Kristine. Dodge was chief executive and founder of American
Sterling Corp. of Irvine, a mortgage, insurance and banking firm.</LD>
<LD>   Longhurst said he hoped his work would lead to better treatment
for high blood pressure and heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   His research has shown that acupuncture releases endorphins that
relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure, which can reduce the
risk of heart disease. Now, he is investigating how acupuncture
affects the nervous system and control of blood flow and blood
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The research is another example of the UCI College of Medicine's
study of nontraditional treatments. In 1999, Broadcom Corp.
co-founder Henry Samueli and his wife gave the university $5.7
million to establish the Susan Samueli Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine. It supports much of Longhurst's work.</TE>

<HD>El Toro's Airport Buffer Retained by State Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Believing that an airport at El Toro still has a pulse, an obscure
state commission decided Thursday to continue a 40-year-old buffer
zone limiting development around the closed Marine base -- even
though voters have rejected plans for a commercial airport and the
military says it will never return to the site.</LD>
<LD>   The Airport Land Use Commission voted 6 to 1 to maintain a
14,000-acre noise and crash zone that restricts construction beneath
the base's old flight paths. Commissioner Denny Harris cast the only
"no" vote.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't feel this is an issue of whether El Toro becomes an
airport," said commission Chairman Gerald Bresnahan. "But if it ever
becomes an airport, will the surrounding communities be protected?
... We need more certainty" before removing the restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   The vote was in line with recommendations from the commission
staff, which concluded that the restrictions should remain because an
airport on the former base has not been ruled out. Commission members
also contend that the rules should be maintained until the military
turns over the property for civilian use, a process that could take
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from cities surrounding the base say the old military
buffer zone has become an impediment to developing thousands of
acres.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say that under state law, local governments can
override the commission's actions, but they must assume full
liability for noise or property damage if an airport is built at El
Toro or the base reactivated. In this case, they say, they must
assume liability under what they consider to be an outdated buffer
zone.</TE>
<TE>   Builders have been eyeing that land since the base closed in July
1999 as the site for homes and commercial buildings, which would be
allowed if the restrictions were lifted or modified.</TE>
<TE>   During the public hearing Thursday, opponents of the buffer zone
told the commission that it was highly unlikely that El Toro would
ever become a commercial airport or be reopened as a military
installation.</TE>
<TE>   In March, voters rejected the county's plan for a commercial
airport and rezoned the 4,700-acre base for a large park and other
uses. The Navy, which owns the property, says jet fighters will never
fly there again. Even the county and the city of Newport Beach, two
staunch supporters of converting El Toro into an airport, have halted
planning for the project.</TE>
<TE>   "The action defies common sense. The buffer zone remains outdated
and is no longer valid for a make-believe commercial airport that is
no longer being planned," said Lake Forest Mayor Richard Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said the commission should either scrap the restrictions
or develop a new buffer zone for a civilian airport -- smaller and
less restrictive than for military air bases.</TE>
<TE>   "Procedures have not been followed [for] a civilian airport," said
Lake Forest Councilman Peter Herzog. "It is time to move on. The war
over El Toro is over."</TE>

<HD>Donald C. Hensman, 78; Architect Styled Home Designs for
the Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald C. Hensman, whose award-winning designs helped further the
development and influence of the Modernist style in Southern
California architecture, died Dec. 9 at his Pasadena home. He was 78.
The cause of death was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   In decades-long collaboration with architects Conrad Buff III and,
later, Calvin C. Straub and others, Hensman created hundreds of
contemporary homes ranging from budget-minded dwellings to opulent
celebrity sanctuaries.</LD>
<LD>   Among them were two of the legendary Case Study Program houses,
No. 20 and No. 28. Conceived by John Entenza, editor and publisher of
the avant-garde monthly magazine Arts &amp; Architecture, the Case Study
project was intended to foster the creation of modern, easily
constructed and affordable housing prototypes.</LD>
<TE>   Hensman's partnership with Buff and Straub "produced a number of
very graceful and elegant and inexpensive modern homes in the area,"
said Elizabeth A.T. Smith, chief curator of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago and author of a book about the Case Study
houses. "It was [Hensman's] and his colleagues' use of materials, and
especially their integration with the sites, which made him an
attractive and appropriate figure for inclusion in the Case Study
Program."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of USC, where he later taught, Hensman was strongly
identified with what the architectural writer Esther McCoy termed
"the Pasadena School." This was a generation of architects, many
associated with USC's School of Architecture, who combined an
interest in new technology and experimental solutions with a
sensitivity to the Southern California landscape and the history of
modernism. Their work also took into account California architectural
predecessors, such as Greene and Greene and the Craftsman tradition
of design.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, they responded to the crisis in affordable housing
that followed World War II, when millions of U.S. servicemen and
women came home looking for work and low-cost but stylish
contemporary dwellings. Hensman and his partners directed many of
their efforts toward meeting that challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very symbolic of that whole Case Study Program, the idea
of being responsible not just to the wealthy people, but to the broad
middle class," said Victor Regnier, a USC architecture professor.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Pierre Koenig of Los Angeles, a fellow Case Study
designer, said Hensman's risk-taking approach to architectural
practice, like that of many colleagues, had been influenced by his
wartime years.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd all been in the armed services," Koenig said, "so we were
older and we had a lot of experience in back of us, good and bad. And
so we were willing to take chances. That was one of the key elements
of the growth of architecture in Southern California. The war put
everything in perspective, so nobody was much afraid of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Omaha, Neb., in 1924, Hensman attended Hollywood High
School, leaving in 1943 to join the U.S. Navy. He became a parachute
rigger in the New Hebrides.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving an honorable discharge in February 1946, he
decided to take advantage of the G.I. Bill by attending Los Angeles
City College. He soon transferred to USC, where he received his
bachelor's degree in architecture and became president of the Scarab
Society, a national honorary architectural fraternity.</TE>
<TE>   It was at USC in 1948 that Hensman first met Buff, commencing an
intensely productive working partnership that lasted until Buff's
death in 1988. Before graduating from USC, both men began their
professional careers by designing more than 600 tract and model homes
near Long Beach for Brittain Development.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Hensman was named an assistant professor within USC's
design curriculum and was chairman of the joint USC/American
Institute of Architects education committee. Among the students of
Hensman and Buff are Frank Gehry, designer of the Guggenheim Museum
in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles;
and Jon Jerde, whose projects include the Bellagio Hotel in Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every California architect educated since the early 1950s
has been influenced by the work of Hensman, Buff and Straub in one
way or another, Regnier said. "They formed the dominant philosophy of
the [USC] School of Architecture in the 1950s," she said. "It was
their thinking and their passion for architecture in Southern
California after the war that made people come to school at the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena architect and friend Randell L. Makinson said that
Hensman was "an extraordinary detailer" who often sketched out ideas
spontaneously on the back of cocktail napkins or whatever else was
handy. Recalling the symbiotic workings of the Hensman-Buff
partnership, Makinson said it was not unusual to see the two men
"using two soft pencils, drawing on the same drawing at the same
time, and dialoguing, creating together."</TE>
<TE>   "Conrad liked being inside, and Donald loved being outside,"
Makinson said. "So the aspect of Don often out on the construction
site and being able to carry the whole philosophy of the drawing
clear out to the site, and Conrad sticking pretty close to the office
-- that worked out very well."</TE>
<TE>   Described by friends as intensely loyal to people and institutions
he cared about, Hensman acquired a number of celebrity clients. Even
after retiring in 1998, he continued to design and build homes on a
smaller scale.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a really sweet personality -- funny, and a very
passionate and caring individual," Regnier said.</TE>
<TE>   Hensman is survived by nephews Brad Traughber of Nipomo, Calif.,
and Chris, Mike and Mark Traughber of San Pedro; and nieces Betsy
Allen of San Francisco and Melinda LaVoy of Rhinelander, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   A new book chronicling the work of Hensman and Buff is expected to
be published by the USC Architectural Guild Press next year.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the USC School of
Architecture for the Donald C. Hensman Publication Fund, USC School
of Architecture, Watt Hall, Room 204, Los Angeles, CA 90089.</TE>
<TE>   A celebration of Hensman's life is scheduled for 2 p.m. on Jan. 11
at the USC School of Architecture.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Foundation Gives Dropout Purpose</HD>
<DH>Roger Morales credits Bresee Foundation, a literacy and
academic achievement program, with salvaging his life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, Roger Morales was a high school dropout with no future,
except maybe a stint in jail for a burglary arrest. That was before
the 18-year-old found himself at the Bresee Foundation, near his
inner-city neighborhood at the border of the Koreatown and Westlake
districts.</LD>
<LD>   These days Morales has his high school diploma. He is studying at
Glendale College and eyeing a career in medicine.</LD>
<LD>   "My plans are to major in biology and go on to be a doctor," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Before, all I was hearing were the negative things in the
neighborhood that make you think you're another Latino statistic. And
I started acting like that. I had no hope.</TE>
<TE>   "At Bresee, they showed me how to change my life, to let me see
the choices I have to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   The literacy and academic achievement program that Morales entered
in January is a cornerstone of the Bresee Foundation, a nonprofit
organization established in 1982 by the Los Angeles First Church of
the Nazarene. It is named after Dr. Phineas Franklin Bresee, a
Methodist minister who founded the church in Los Angeles in 1895.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also offers health services, job training and
cultural and recreational activities for more than 3,000 residents of
the Koreatown, Westlake, Pico Union and Mid-Wilshire neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60% of the foundation's annual $1.8-million operating
budget comes from fund-raising. This year, it received $15,000 from
the Los Angeles Times' Holiday Campaign. The money was spent on
literacy and academics.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of those in the foundation's service area live below
the poverty line, said John Wolfkill, associate director. He said the
area suffers from a 56% school dropout rate.</TE>
<TE>   "Bresee is sending kids to college," Wolfkill said. "We give $500
to $1,000 scholarships, and this year we sent 20. But there are many
we can't serve.... You could easily have 10 organizations like ours
serving this area."</TE>
<TE>   Bresee's tutoring and literacy program typically boosts students'
reading levels more than a grade and a half over six to eight months,
foundation leaders said.</TE>
<TE>   Older students are exposed to the college experience through field
trips and an annual college fair.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also holds SAT preparation workshops.</TE>
<TE>   Morales said he had been referred to Bresee through a first-time
offender's court program.</TE>
<TE>   "I got caught for commercial burglary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me a chance to go to counseling instead of jail," he
said. "I was skeptical, but I took the chance, and it's the greatest
thing that could have happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   The annual Times Holiday Campaign was established in 2000 and is a
part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund. The McCormick Tribune
Foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on the
dollar, and the foundation and The Times absorb all administrative
costs.</TE>

<HD>Koreans in L.A. Give Roh's Win Mixed Reviews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many leaders in Southern California's large Korean American
immigrant community, the election of human rights lawyer Roh Moo Hyun
as South Korea's president Thursday was foreboding news -- a sign of
rising anti-American sentiment and, potentially, a strained future
relationship between their homeland and their adopted land.</LD>
<LD>   But, among the younger generation and more liberal Korean
Americans, Roh's victory was welcomed as signaling a new era of
equality in South Korea and possibly a more equitable relationship
with the United States, whose military presence in Korea dates to
1945.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a new beginning for Korea," said the Rev. Kris Kim,
pastor of the Church of Peace near Koreatown. "Finally, the Korean
people will have a chance to nurture a civil society."</LD>
<TE>   But Koreatown businessman Walter Ik Hyun Cho, who supported losing
candidate Lee Hoi Chang of the Grand National Party, said he is
concerned about the future relationship between the two longtime
allies.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger generation that helped elect Mr. Roh doesn't
understand how important the United States is to [South] Korea and
the security of the Korean peninsula," Cho said. "They did not
experience the Korean War. They don't understand North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Whether for or against Roh, Korean immigrants agreed on one thing:
Now that South Korean voters have spoken, they want to support the
new leader.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed by Roh</TE>
<TE>   Many are impressed at the achievement of Roh, the first South
Korean president to be elected without attending college. For
Koreans, to whom education is an obsession, the victory of a man who
passed the bar through self study is a notable accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Kee Whan Ha, president of the Korean American Federation of Los
Angeles, who had remained publicly neutral during the campaign, said
Thursday he had supported Roh all along.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he could come to the United States as soon as possible to
see how we live, set up a good relationship with Los Angeles and the
United States," said Ha, a wealthy businessman who holds a doctorate
in electrical engineering from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown is planning a community celebration for Roh later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Roh's victory comes at a time of increased anti-American sentiment
in South Korea, in part because of a highly publicized case in which
two Korean girls were run over and killed by a U.S. military vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The acquittal of two American soldiers by a U.S. military court
has led to mass demonstrations in South Korea and smaller
demonstrations here.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Arrogance Seen</TE>
<TE>   On three nights over the last 10 days, Korean Americans, joined by
non-Korean activists, held candlelight vigils to draw attention to
what they say is an example of the way the U.S. government deals with
its weaker ally.</TE>
<TE>   At one recent protest, demonstrators filed in front of a makeshift
altar that displayed pictures of the girls, who were walking to a
friend's birthday celebration on a winding country road when they
were struck.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Han Sang Ryul, chairman of a South Korean delegation that
tried unsuccessfully to deliver petitions about the deaths to the
White House earlier this month, said his group believes President
Bush should make a public apology to the South Korean people and to
the bereaved families and turn the two soldiers over for trial in a
Korean court.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the protesters also want to see revisions in the agreement
that governs the U.S. troop presence in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has already conveyed his "sadness" and "regret" through the
U.S. ambassador in Seoul and in a telephone call to South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung last week.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, "when a Japanese girl was raped by U.S. soldiers on
Okinawa, President Clinton was quick to apologize," said Korean
American attorney Tong S. Suhr.</TE>
<TE>   He said it pains him that, despite South Korea's loyalty as a U.S.
ally, America has not treated Korea as well as it has Japan, its
former enemy.</TE>

<LD>The war on terrorism reached Woodland Hills last week. The federales
threw a net over a 39-year-old construction worker, a working Joe
with a Christmas tree in the living room and two American cars in the
driveway.</LD>
<LD>   This country and western fan happens to be a British citizen who
was born in Iran and moved to California four years ago. Kourosh
Reyhanyfar reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
last week to reregister, and like dozens if not hundreds of other
men, his reward for compliance was a trip to jail.</LD>
<LD>   "If there are any terrorists out there, they are probably laughing
at these law-abiding people who went and turned themselves in," says
Babak Sotoodeh of the Alliance of Iranian Americans in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar's wife, a registered nurse in pediatric intensive care
at Northridge Hospital, became hysterical when he called from
downtown L.A. to tell her he was in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   What happened? she demanded.</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is that homeland security is in the hands of
buffoons.</TE>
<TE>   One day, U.S. ally Armenia was on the list of countries whose
visiting nationals were required to update their visas. The next day,
Armenia was struck without explanation. Egypt still isn't on the
list, even though a Sept. 11 ringleader was Egyptian.</TE>
<TE>   You feeling any safer yet?</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar heard about the INS reporting requirement last week on
the radio. He told his wife, Sepideh, that after going by the book
since arriving from England early in 1999, they shouldn't play loose
with immigration law. Besides, what did he have to fear?</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar took off work from a window installation job Thursday,
waited his turn at the downtown Los Angeles INS office, and was told
to come back Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   He went back and told his story. He and his wife came here on
tourist visas and decided to stay, applying for extensions every six
months. In the middle of the third extension, they took advantage of
a change in the law and paid $1,000 each to apply for a green card.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, they got work permits, Social Security numbers
and driver's licenses. Sepideh, who had been a nurse in England, went
to work at Northridge Hospital Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Cut to Friday's INS inquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked why I didn't complete the third visa extension, and I
explained the situation," Reyhanyfar says. "I did this, I did that,
we got our work permits, and now we are waiting for our green cards."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands are in the same boat, but that doesn't seem to matter to
the INS.</TE>
<TE>   After stonewalling for a week, the INS claimed that reports of its
ethnic cleansing campaign have been greatly exaggerated. The agency
claims it had to lock some people up because it couldn't process the
crush that showed up too close to the Dec. 16 registration deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar beat the deadline by three days, but that wasn't good
enough for this Alice-in-Wonderland agency. The Valley carpenter knew
he was in trouble when he saw two officers go by with an Iranian in
custody, and his inquisitor told them, "I've got another one."</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar says he was cuffed and led down a hall like a common
criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "We went from the eighth floor to the basement, past many people,
and it was humiliating to be in handcuffs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar and roughly 20 others were taken to a holding area. He
sat on a bench, hoping he'd be able to make bail, get home by
dinnertime, and sort it out later.</TE>
<TE>   No chance.</TE>
<TE>   He says that roughly 15 hours later, around 3 a.m., he was
fingerprinted and loaded onto a bus for a ride to an INS detention
center in Lancaster. Drivers flashed the lights on and off and
blasted the radio, he says, making it impossible to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   In Lancaster, he was ordered to strip naked for a search. They
confiscated his belongings and gave him a blue and yellow prison
suit, and Reyhanyfar got bunk No. 48 in a 50-bed barracks. Reyhanyfar
had injured his neck in a recent car accident and asked for an
aspirin or a pillow, but says he got neither.</TE>
<TE>   And these guys fled the ayatollah?</TE>
<TE>   "I just couldn't believe it," says Reyhanyfar, who had no idea
when he might be released. The only comfort was that everyone else
was just as miserable and confused as he was. A teenager, locked up
with his father, was in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nightmare. I wasn't angry so much as I was shocked and
humiliated. I kept phoning my wife and I would get choked up. I
didn't expect to be treated like a terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Reyhanyfar was held three more days. He was released Monday night
on $1,500 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried so loud when I drove to Lancaster to get him," Sepideh
told me Wednesday evening as she and some 3,000 others demonstrated
outside the federal building on Wilshire Boulevard. She held a sign:
"What happened to liberty and justice for all?"</TE>
<TE>   Now the Reyhanyfars are in limbo as Koroush awaits an unscheduled
court hearing. He has no idea whether he'll get a green card. Or be
deported.</TE>
<TE>   Mix politics with bureaucratic bungling and epic butt-covering,
and this is what you get.</TE>
<TE>   You get real terrorists eluding capture here and abroad while the
feds bag Kourosh Reyhanyfar, a taxpayer and family man who hasn't set
foot in Iran since he fled 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Ok, they have a job to do," Reyhanyfar said Wednesday night after
putting his 12-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son to bed. "But I
think they could be doing it in a different way."</TE>

<HD>Jury in Ventura County Date-Rape Trial Watches Explicit Sex
Video of Suspect</HD>
<DH>Woman, who seems to be unconscious in the tape, testifies
she wasn't aware of the encounter until after the defendant's arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As date-rape suspect Andrew Luster watched calmly, Ventura County
prosecutors on Thursday showed a graphic videotape of his explicit
sex acts with a woman who appeared to be unconscious.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the half-hour tape, Luster, now 39, moves the woman's
body around like a doll, placing her in various positions for sex.</LD>
<LD>   The woman's eyes remained closed, her mouth open and her arm above
her head for most of the tape. Only once, when he sodomizes her, does
she show expression, wincing and jolting sideways before falling back
onto a bed.</LD>
<TE>   Watching on a personal video monitor, Luster, a Mussel Shoals
surfer who lives on a family trust account, showed no emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Seven women and five men on the jury also sat stone-faced as the
images were played.</TE>
<TE>   At various points, Luster can be seen inserting objects, including
a candle, a plastic sword and a lighted marijuana cigarette, into her
vagina. The woman, now 29 and identified only as Tonja Doe, was not
present when the tape was played.</TE>
<TE>   But she tearfully testified later in the day, telling jurors she
was not aware of the tape-recording, or the sexual encounter, until a
detective showed it to her after Luster's arrest two years ago. "I
was horrified," she said. "It was unbelievable to me. It still is ...
I had no idea."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives found the tape during a July 18, 2000, search of
Luster's home after a 21-year-old college student, identified as
Carey Doe, reported that he drugged and raped her there after a night
of partying in Santa Barbara. Ventura County sheriff's deputies
seized 17 homemade videotapes from Luster's beach house and spent
months trying to identify women on the tapes, a detective testified
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, rape charges were filed on behalf of Carey, Tonja and
a third woman identified from the videos.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, a great-grandson to cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with 87 criminal counts, including rape, sodomy, sexual
battery, drug possession and poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys maintain that Luster engaged in consensual sex
with the women and that the women are lying. As for the videos, the
defense has suggested that the women shown on the tapes pretended to
be asleep while filming pornographic movies with Luster in his
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   But Tonja testified that she has no memory of having sex with
Luster on Oct. 17, 1996, when the tape was allegedly made. A former
Arizona resident, Tonja told jurors she was visiting her younger
sister, a UC Santa Barbara student, at that time. She said they met
Luster and another man at a Santa Barbara bar and went to the
suspect's house.</TE>
<TE>   At Luster's suggestion, Tonja said, she agreed to try a substance
known as gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, which she said he described
as an herbal supplement. Within half an hour, she testified, she
began to feel numb and remembers feeling like she was going to pass
out. The next thing she recalls, she said, is waking up the next
morning in Luster's bed, her clothes askew. "I had my clothes on, but
they were shifted," she said. "I was very confused. I felt like maybe
he had done something to me."</TE>

<HD>Jury in Luster Rape Trial Sees Sex Video</HD>
<DH>Woman in the tape says she wasn't aware of the encounter
until after the suspect's arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As date-rape suspect Andrew Luster watched calmly, Ventura County
prosecutors on Thursday showed a graphic videotape of his explicit
sex acts with a woman who appeared to be unconscious.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the half-hour tape, Luster, now 39, moves the woman's
body around like a doll, placing her in different positions for sex.</LD>
<LD>   The woman's eyes remained closed, her mouth open and her arm above
her head for most of the tape.</LD>
<TE>   Only once, when he sodomizes her, does she show expression,
wincing and jolting sideways before falling back onto a bed.</TE>
<TE>   Watching on a personal video monitor, Luster, a Mussel Shoals
surfer who lives on a family trust account, showed no emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Seven women and five men on the jury also sat stone-faced as the
images were played.</TE>
<TE>   At various points, Luster can be seen inserting objects, including
a candle, a plastic sword and a lighted marijuana cigarette, into her
vagina.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, now 29 and identified only as Tonja Doe, was not
present when the tape was played.</TE>
<TE>   But she tearfully testified later in the day, telling jurors she
was not aware of the tape-recording, or the sexual encounter, until a
detective showed it to her after Luster's arrest two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horrified," she said. "It was unbelievable to me. It still
is ... I had no idea."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives found the tape during a July 18, 2000, search of
Luster's home after a 21-year-old college student, identified as
Carey Doe, reported that he drugged and raped her there after a night
of partying in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sheriff's deputies seized 17 homemade videotapes
from Luster's beach house and spent months trying to identify women
on the tapes, a detective testified Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, rape charges were filed on behalf of Carey, Tonja and
a third woman identified from the videos.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, a great-grandson to cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with 87 criminal counts, including rape, sodomy, sexual
battery, drug possession and poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys maintain that Luster engaged in consensual sex
with the women and that the women are lying.</TE>
<TE>   As for the videos, the defense has suggested that the women shown
on the tapes pretended to be asleep while filming pornographic movies
with Luster in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   But Tonja testified that she has no memory of having sex with
Luster on Oct. 17, 1996, when the tape was allegedly made.</TE>
<TE>   A former Arizona resident, Tonja told jurors she was visiting her
younger sister, who was a UC Santa Barbara student, at that time.</TE>
<TE>   During her visit, she said, they met Luster and another man at a
downtown Santa Barbara bar and went to the suspect's house.</TE>
<TE>   At Luster's suggestion, Tonja said, she agreed to try a substance
known as gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, which she said he described
as an herbal supplement.</TE>
<TE>   Within half an hour, she testified, she began to feel numb and
remembers feeling like she was going to pass out.</TE>
<TE>   The next thing she recalls, she said, is waking up the next
morning in Luster's bed, her clothes askew.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my clothes on, but they were shifted," she said. "I was
very confused. I felt like maybe he had done something to me."</TE>
<TE>   She told jurors that Luster explained that she had fallen asleep
and he carried her to his bedroom so she could be more comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   She said she believed him, and went out with him again during her
visit.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually struck up a romance, and she moved in with him.
But within four months, she said, she broke off the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, he just began to give me the creeps," she said. "I
didn't trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Tonja said in the months that followed, Luster stalked her and
took her to court to reclaim money he had spent on her.</TE>
<TE>   It was years later, she testified, that she learned that he had
taped a sexual encounter from the first night they had met.</TE>
<TE>   "I detest him," she said. "I can't believe he would ever do this
to me. He is sick. He is evil."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys are expected to begin their cross-examination
this morning.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Ticked On When Fake Watch Didn't Live Down to Its
Advertising</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I told of a couple who came across a sign that said, "Genuine Fake
Watches" in Hungary. Which caught the interest of Dennis Thompsett of
Beverly Hills, inventor of the "Genuine Fake Russian Watchski" (see
photo).</LD>
<LD>   The gadget, decorated with a garish Soviet red star, hammer and
sickle, is described as "unusually inaccurate ... totally unresistant
to water ... guaranteed for 20 years not to work ... [and accompanied
by] the world's most brutal user manual." And not cheap, either, at
$299.</LD>
<LD>   Strangely enough, Thompsett said, when he initially advertised the
gadget, it was make-believe -- he advertised it to gather marketing
research for his ad agency.</LD>
<TE>   Alas, he said, "the watch was so ugly that it caught on." He had
to start having the timepieces manufactured. George Bush the elder
even bought one.</TE>
<TE>   And Thompsett survived a kind of reverse expose by the Wall Street
Journal, which found that the Genuine Fake Russian Watch-ski actually
works pretty well. That's the media for you -- always stirring things
up.</TE>
<TE>   But where were we? Oh, yes. Thompsett wonders whether the
Hungarian shop is selling one of his genuine fake watches or merely
an imitation genuine fake watch.</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's featured properties (see accompanying)
include a house that guarantees unusual privacy for bathers (from
Betty Wielkiewicz of Tujunga) and a house that frankly has some
drawbacks (Linda Vandercook of Laguna Beach).</TE>
<TE>   Ex-husbands and other animals: I'm still hearing from readers
about librarian Cindy Mirallegro's campaign to have "wasband"
accepted as a synonym for ex-hubby.</TE>
<TE>   Lila Wolkoff of L.A. pointed out that "to espouse" means to marry,
which leads her to conclude that "to expouse" would be to divorce.</TE>
<TE>   And there's no reason why a synonym for a divorced person couldn't
be "expouse," I suppose.</TE>
<TE>   Another type of ex: Margaret Kogon of Burbank says that after her
niece Andrea got married, "instead of introducing her new spouse as
her 'husband,' she started introducing him as her 'ex-boyfriend.'
Hey, it's technically correct ...."</TE>
<TE>   McMystery: Rob Mack of Rancho Palos Verdes reports that a neon
McDonald's sign out his way "suddenly became 'McDo' as five letters
mysteriously faded to black." Someone named Mack would notice such a
thing, I think. Another oddity was that Mack would see the sign while
returning from his church, whose pastor is named MacDonald (first
name Byron). Anyway, there's an ex-Mac in the area. The eatery shut
down. McDo became McDon't.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The L.A. Business Journal reports that Encino's Skin
Spa offers massages of oils mixed with coffee grounds ($100 for an
hour; no free refills). But what about a decaf rubdown for us older
folks?</TE>

<HD>Shedding Light on Officers Who Help Prosecute</HD>
<DH>With cases overturned in the Rampart scandal in mind, the
D.A.'s office now tells jurors of any misconduct in a testifying
officer's past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Rampart police scandal costing taxpayers millions of
dollars, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley earlier this
month implemented a long-awaited policy aimed at ensuring that jurors
know the background of officers scheduled to testify in court.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 cases have been overturned since problems were
uncovered in the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division,
where officers in an anti-gang unit were caught lying in court,
planting evidence, stealing drugs, beating suspects and covering up
unjustified shootings.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley's policy "may have brought some of the [Rampart] issues to
light a lot sooner," said Lael Rubin, special counsel to Cooley. "I
wouldn't be so bold to say it would have prevented Rampart, but it
would have raised some red flags."</LD>
<TE>   By making it easier for lawyers to obtain disciplinary records of
law enforcement witnesses, Cooley hopes his policy will reduce the
time and money wasted on cases that were later overturned, as well as
leave no doubt in jurors' minds about officer credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But legal experts differ over whether the plan goes far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are required to give the defense information that
could be used to impeach a government witness, such as a police
officer or coroner, under federal law. California law, however,
protects most police personnel records from being made public.
Throughout the years, confusion resulted because neither prosecutors
nor defenders understood their roles, attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really the first time in this office's history that there
has been a comprehensive, uniform and widespread policy," Rubin said
of Cooley's office, which is the state's largest prosecutorial
agency. " ... It's not an easy task."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin said the policy explains lawyers' obligations and rights as
well as the procedural methods for obtaining disciplinary records.
The D.A.'s office has worked closely with law enforcement agencies in
deciding which information -- prior convictions, evidence of racial
bias, established patterns of using excessive force -- should be
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy, the district attorney's office established a
computer system for lawyers seeking records of police misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The D.A.'s new computerized "Brady Alert System," named after the
U.S. Supreme Court decision which requires disclosure, is a secure
but small database that contains court records on officer
convictions, as well as information that a judge deems pertinent
after reviewing files from a law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of information in there is, frankly, pretty small,"
Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Many criminal defense lawyers argue that Cooley's policy is too
limited to be effective. "Nothing has changed whatsoever," said Gigi
Gordon, a defense lawyer who served on Cooley's committee but quit,
dissatisfied. "It's business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley acknowledged that the topic can be confounding. "Hardly
anyone understands it, even lawyers," he said with a laugh. "But we
think we got it down.... It is a model for the state of California."</TE>
<TE>   And for the nation. Even if the D.A.'s computer system lacks
enough relevant data, the fact that it exists is "quite laudable,"
said Lawrence Goldman, a criminal defense lawyer in New York City and
president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Assn. of Criminal
Defense Lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   For years, prosecutors have claimed ignorance rather than turn
over relevant material that the defense was not aware of, Goldman
said. "If there's a database, prosecutors can't claim ignorance," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the burden is on the defense to seek information
from an officer's personnel files if lawyers suspect those records
contain material that would raise questions about the officer's
credibility. In such cases, police are required to submit the records
to the judge, who determines what should be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   That still occurs under Cooley's policy. What changes is that
prosecutors assume the lead role.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's policy requires prosecutors who become suspicious of an
officer called to testify in court to request a review of law
enforcement personnel files. When an officer with a history of
misconduct is summoned to court, a judge then decides what
information will be disclosed to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have determined that part of the disciplinary record
of Rafael Perez, the convicted drug thief at the center of the
Rampart scandal, had not been disclosed and was not used to impeach
him when he testified in cases before the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Cooley announced that his office had rejected
prosecution in 82 Rampart cases partly because it would require
testimony from police witnesses who lack credibility, including Perez
and Nino Durden, another main player in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Rampart also prompted Cooley's predecessor, Gil Garcetti, during
his last few months in office, to propose a similar data bank. The
Police Protective League responded by filing a lawsuit claiming that
the action violated police privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley killed Garcetti's data bank soon after he took office in
December 2000. He formed a committee of prosecutors, police officers
and a representative of defense lawyers to devise a new policy.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have accused the district attorney's office of
bowing to political pressure from police unions. During the last
several years, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties have restricted
access to police disciplinary records, a move considered necessary to
comply with state laws protecting officers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooley's policy provides a good balance," said Elizabeth
Tourgeman, a Santa Monica attorney who represents local police unions
and state legal defense fund for peace officers. "At this point, I
don't see any need to litigate."</TE>
<TE>   The policy was well received when it was presented last summer to
prosecutors from the state's 58 counties, said Larry Brown, executive
director of the California District Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They're studying how L.A. County fares before starting their own
Brady policies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   They were impressed that Cooley's office "attempted to grapple,
which is by all accounts, a difficult issue," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   But L.A. County Deputy Public Defender Mark Harvis said there are
too many problems with the system. He cited a requirement that
prosecutors ask a judge to issue orders forbidding the defense from
sharing any disclosed information with other lawyers, or using it in
any other case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Steve Cooley's heart is in the right place," he said.
"But [the policy] doesn't breed fairness or confidence in the
system."</TE>

<HD>Ill at Ease With Role of Fill-In Parent</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you parents do it?</LD>
<LD>   I'm sitting at home Saturday in the late afternoon, with nothing
more to do than see who won the Heisman Trophy, when the phone rings.
It was a friend of 25 years, calling from New Jersey to say his son
Dan, a college freshman, missed his flight home for the holidays
because he was sicker than a dog in his dorm room in Valencia. Could
I "check things out?"</LD>
<LD>   No problem. I phoned Dan.</LD>
<TE>   "Dan, how you doing?"</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-h-h.... Not too good."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you need anything?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   "Want me to come get you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think so."</TE>
<TE>   Two freeway-clogged hours later, I'm staring at what I described
to his father as a "crumpled mass of humanity," obviously quite ill
and weak. Dan slept all the way back to Huntington Beach, oblivious
to the fact he was now reliant on someone who at midlife had never
taken care of anyone other than a cat named Peaches.</TE>
<TE>   True, I've crowed that I'd have been a fantastic father and
lamented the missed opportunity. But my thoughts of parenthood are
those of trips to the zoo, saying funny things and reading bedtime
stories.</TE>
<TE>   I forgot about this part.</TE>
<TE>   With only chocolate syrup in the refrigerator, I stopped for soup,
crackers and 7-Up, adding bread and peanut butter for myself. I
skillfully prepared the soup and crackers. Dan nibbled and then eyed
my peanut butter sandwich. I fixed him half a sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, a crucial error.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, ominous noises emanated from upstairs where Dan
was sleeping. En route to the bathroom, he'd walked into my bedroom
closet instead. Reversing course, the sick, disoriented lad headed
for the hallway but bumped face-first into a wall.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he made the bathroom ... oops.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the details, other than to say I'm now down one
bathroom rug and several cleaning rags. "Maybe we should light some
incense," Dan said, sheepishly.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday began auspiciously. Freezing the night before, Dan now was
roasting. Good, he was getting over the chills.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling like a good care-provider, I added applesauce and Jell-O
to his diet, the latter a treat I hadn't made in 35 years. For
reasons still unclear, the powder didn't fully dissolve in the bowl,
and Dan refused to take a second bite. Offended, I was tempted to
serve him more chunky peanut butter.</TE>
<TE>   He watched nighttime TV with me and hit the sack about midnight.</TE>
<TE>   At 2 a.m., with me in a dead sleep in the spare bedroom, he
knocked on the door.</TE>
<TE>   "My fingers are tingling," he said. I was stumped for a reply.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I can stand up," he said, sinking to his knees in
the doorway. "Why don't you try some Jell-O?" I suggested. He
returned to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Later I found Dan in a near stupor, huddled fully clothed under a
blanket. I spoon-fed applesauce to him. I sensed his recovery had
ended.</TE>
<TE>   Way out of my league, I called 911. Five paramedics soon were in
the bedroom giving Dan oxygen and wheeling him into an ambulance for
a trip to the hospital, with me trailing behind. I phoned his father
and told him things were going great.</TE>
<TE>   One very slow IV drip and several tests later, a freshly hydrated
Dan and I left the hospital around 6 a.m. Dan went back to sleep; I
went to work three hours later.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, Dan was nearing his old self. On Wednesday, he flew
home to New Jersey. Dan bought dinner Tuesday night; his father
thanked me profusely.</TE>
<TE>   No need to thank me, fellas. All in a day's work.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, who won the Heisman?</TE>

<HD>Ian Hornak, 58; Painter Was Known for Photo-Realism Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ian Hornak, an American painter known for landscapes and still lifes
rendered in the photo-realist tradition, died Dec. 9 at a hospital in
New York. He was 58. The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Hornak, born in Philadelphia, received his art training at the
University of Michigan and Wayne State University.</LD>
<LD>   He moved to New York City in 1967, where he kept a studio for many
years. He did most of his painting at his home in East Hampton, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   He had his first one-man show at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New
York in 1971 and soon caught the attention of prominent critics.</TE>
<TE>   John Canaday, writing in the New York Times in 1974, said Hornak
was "right at the top of the list of romantically descriptive
painters today."</TE>
<TE>   A draftsman from an early age, Hornak was fascinated by the
Renaissance masters and by photography.</TE>
<TE>   His work, exhibited mainly in New York galleries, has been
described as evoking a ghostly double-exposure effect.</TE>

<HD>Sale of Thousand Oaks Water Utility to German Corporation
Approved</HD>
<DH>PUC disregards objections of the city, which fears higher
rates and cuts in service after the $4.6-billion deal for local
company's parent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dismissing city fears of rising rates and reduced services, the state
Public Utilities Commission on Thursday approved the sale of Thousand
Oaks' largest water company to a foreign corporation.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey-based American Water Works Co., which owns
California-American Water Co., will be sold to a German corporation,
RWE. Cal-Am serves more than 20,000 households in Thousand Oaks,
mostly west of Moorpark Road.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Thousand Oaks has fought the sale because of concerns
about reduced service and rate hikes for customers, who already pay
one-third more than those served by a city-owned water system.
Officials also maintain that it is bad public policy to allow such a
crucial utility to be owned by foreign interests.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a sad day for California water policy," said Deputy City
Manager Scott Mitnick, in San Francisco on Thursday for the PUC vote.
"Their business plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it's hard for
anyone outside the company to say that it's beneficial for the
company or the customers."</TE>
<TE>   The company maintains that the transaction benefits the more than
56,000 customers it serves in Thousand Oaks by prohibiting general
rate hikes for at least three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't foresee raising rates in Thousand Oaks for at least five
years," said Cal-Am spokesman Kevin Tilden. "We're not going to
commit to that legally, but right now we just don't predict that will
be happening. Our last rate increase was in 1997, and that was for a
third of one percent, so we have a very good record in that area."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials are not convinced. They say rates will surely
rise after RWE and its London-based subsidiary, Thames Water Aqua
Holdings, spend $4.6 billion for American Water Works -- a 65%
premium over book value, they say -- along with absorbing the U.S.
corporation's $4.1 billion in outstanding debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We see absolutely no upside for our residents and have some
serious concerns about this. Increased costs for one, further removal
of management," said City Councilman Dennis Gillette, who lobbied PUC
officials last week on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Nader's watchdog group Public Citizen also has challenged
the sale, saying it increases the profit motive in delivering a
valuable natural resource.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this move as the 'Enronization' of our water systems. It's
a real ominous development for California and the nation," said
Juliette Beck, an organizer in the group's Oakland office. "We've
been concerned based on their track record around the world and also
in their home countries. We fear deteriorating service, escalating
rates and erosion of local control of water resources."</TE>
<TE>   The city is worried the deal could lead to diminished service
levels in terms of water pressure, system reliability, service
response times and infrastructure upgrades. By merging with an
international conglomerate, Tilden said, Cal-Am expects to cut costs
with enhanced economies of scale, to learn from the new parent's
worldwide experience running water and waste water systems and to
strengthen its bond rating, allowing it to pay less when it borrows
money for capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "We do see this as being a benefit for ratepayers, allowing us to
hold off rate increases for a longer period," Tilden said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the city and Cal-Am both purchase their water from
Calleguas Municipal Water District, Cal-Am customers pay on average
nearly 33% more. A survey of 18 water providers in Ventura County
shows Cal-American with the highest rates, averaging nearly $104
every two months for a typical household.</TE>
<TE>   A second private water provider, California Water Service Co.,
charges its customers, on average, less than $79 bimonthly.</TE>
<TE>   Tilden pointed out that, unlike the city, Cal-Am pays about
$200,000 a year in property taxes and some $240,000 in fees while his
company does not charge extra for most service calls for customers,
as the city does.</TE>

<HD>1 Slain, 3 Held in Chase, Gunfight</HD>
<DH>Bratton clarifies call for curbs on police pursuits, saying
officers must use training, experience and 'sixth sense.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pursuit that began with a speeding violation morphed into a deadly
shootout early Thursday in which suspected gang members fired a
shotgun and an automatic weapon at officers, leading Los Angeles
Police Chief William J. Bratton to clarify his earlier call for
restrictions on such chases.</LD>
<LD>   In tempering his earlier remarks, Bratton said officers should
always be allowed to use their training, experience, instincts and
"sixth sense" to decide how to confront criminals.</LD>
<LD>   The chase ended when four people in the fleeing car crashed into a
truck. One man was shot to death by officers in the chase, which
began with a minor traffic violation -- the type of event that
Bratton said Tuesday should not justify a pursuit.</LD>
<TE>   Three of the four suspects are known gang members. One is wanted
by federal authorities, and another was being sought for a state
probation violation.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton praised the performance of the 14 officers involved in the
chase as heroic. "It was only through the grace of God that more
lives were not lost," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said the incident had not changed his plan to "prohibit to
the greatest degree possible officers initiating a pursuit based on
an infraction." He said Thursday's pursuit would have been justified
under even the more restrictive proposed policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always going to be an exception to any policy," Bratton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso, who argued earlier this
week for even more stringent controls on chases than Bratton, said
that whatever policy is adopted, there need to be good-faith
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings a different side of the story," Caruso said of
Thursday's incident. "We've talked about when an innocent person is
injured. But there's a legitimate argument that with the actions of
the officers, a crime was prevented, and we have to take that into
account. No matter what policy we adopt, it has to allow the ability
for the officers to use their judgment to initiate a pursuit, even if
it's not technically in policy."</TE>
<TE>   The nearly half-hour gun battle began at 2:30 a.m. near Country
Club Drive and Western Avenue when seven-year Police Department
veteran Peter Galen, 32, and his partner, Roger Fontes, 31, with four
years on the force, saw a speeding car, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   When they tried to pull the vehicle over, the driver wouldn't
stop, touching off a minute-long chase. The car stopped at 12th Place
and Serrano Avenue. As officers pulled up, the suspects opened fire
at close range with a handgun, a shotgun and a fully automatic
assault rifle, then continued their flight, police said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers returned fire through the windshield of his
patrol car. Other units picked up the chase at Vermont Avenue and
Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects opened fire again at a parking garage near the
intersection. Officer Ralph Camarillo, 29, a six-year veteran
returned fire, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit continued across the city for 20 minutes before the
car clipped a large truck in the 1800 block of South Olive Street and
plowed into a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Bratton proposed using helicopters and
supervisors whenever possible to take control of chases, while
banning pursuits that began with minor offenses, such as speeding.</TE>
<TE>   Such pursuits account for 60% of police chases.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the three surviving suspects will be charged with
attempted murder of a police officer and may be prosecuted for the
death of their friend.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton commented on the shooting after meeting with six members
of Congress in which city leaders asked for more federal help to stem
the tide of gang violence by avoiding cutbacks in the Housing
Authority Police and continuing funding for a program that
coordinates law enforcement in high-crime areas.</TE>
<TE>   The city leaders met in Mayor James K. Hahn's office with Reps.
Howard Berman (D-Woodland Hills), Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles),
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-Carson),
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and Diane Watson (D-Los
Angeles). They pledged to seek more federal help for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also met separately with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) on the same issue.</TE>

he left his last job as a police chief in Washington state under a
cloud.</LD>
<LD>   Stan Reeves departed from the 206-officer Vancouver, Wash., Police
Department in May for what he said were health reasons.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day, Washington authorities launched an inquiry into
allegations that he intervened in the arrest of a woman who had been
stopped for drunk driving, and into allegations that he had harassed
the same woman, a former neighbor with whom he acknowledged having a
romantic relationship.</LD>
<TE>   MTA officials said they were aware of the investigation when they
hired Reeves on Dec. 9 as the agency's first chief of transit police,
at an annual salary of $140,000. Eight days later, on Tuesday, he
submitted his resignation, officials said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's no longer employed by us," said MTA spokesman Marc Littman,
when The Times inquired about an anti-harassment restraining order
placed on Reeves in Washington. "He gave his resignation. There's
nothing else we can say. We have to leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Littman said the agency could not discuss the reasons for Reeves'
departure, citing a policy against the disclosure of personnel
matters.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for MTA legal chief Steve Carnevale would not say
whether Reeves was given severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, 52, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   When MTA Deputy Chief Executive John Catoe hired Reeves, he told
The Times that his "concern about the allegations is zero," and said
Reeves would do a superb job.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves was hired on a conditional basis, pending a state-required
background check.</TE>
<TE>   He was to oversee all aspects of security at the MTA, guiding the
way officers and deputies from the Los Angeles Police Department and
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are deployed to provide
security for the transit agency's buses, trains and property.</TE>
<TE>   Littman said the MTA will wait several months, until contract
negotiations with the agencies are finished, before hiring another
chief.</TE>

<HD>Jury Unable to Agree in Threat Case</HD>
<DH>Jurors can't decide whether the violent rhetoric of South
Gate Treasurer Albert Robles was criminal. Mistrial is declared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the criminal trial of South
Gate Treasurer Albert Robles, after jurors said they were deadlocked
on all seven felony counts.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-man, two-woman jury in Norwalk split almost evenly on
charges that Robles had threatened to kill two state legislators, a
political consultant and a South Gate police lieutenant.</LD>
<LD>   Some jurors said later that the panel agreed that limits should be
placed on violent political rhetoric, but that they were not
convinced that statements Robles had made, including talk of killing
and raping political enemies, amounted to criminal conduct.</LD>
<TE>   The mistrial ended an unusual proceeding in which jurors were
asked to test the legal boundaries between heated political language
and physical threats.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that Robles doesn't deserve a "free pass"
because he's an elected official. Defense attorneys said anything
Robles had said should be taken in a political context.</TE>
<TE>   The political backdrop, jurors said, didn't factor into their
deliberations as much as the gender of the targets.</TE>
<TE>   Juror John Jones said the jury leaned toward not-guilty verdicts
on the counts related to statements directed at men. Jones, a UPS
worker, said jurors had perceived the language as "macho" talk, and
didn't think the men feared Robles.</TE>
<TE>   But the jury at one point voted 10 to 2 for a guilty verdict
regarding threatening language directed at state Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier). According to a witness, Robles said that, if he could
get away with it, he would rape Escutia and kill her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia had testified that she had been so concerned for her
safety and that of her family that she had not gone to South Gate, a
working-class city in her district, for nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The man threatened each of these people," said juror Ron Millier,
50, an unemployed factory worker who voted guilty on all counts. "You
don't threaten to kill people. You don't threaten to rape people. Not
in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Robles, who did not testify, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he shook hands with one of the jurors in a hallway
crowded with friends, city employees and family members.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors typically retry cases after mistrials. Sandi Gibbons,
a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said a decision
would be made in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Brown, Robles' attorney, filed a motion to dismiss the
charges. Superior Court Judge John Torribio said he would hear the
matter in early January.</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors seek another trial, and the judge denies the
defense's motion to dismiss the charges, a new trial could begin
within two months.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, southeast Los Angeles County officials
portrayed a political landscape filled with crude politicians who
pepper their closed-door conversations with threatening rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   One witness, former Assemblyman Mervyn M. Dymally, chuckled when
describing how violent language -- sometimes death threats -- is
common in private conversations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of humorous and hypocritical," he said, referring to
the contradictions between many politicians' private and public
images.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, 37, the perceived political boss of South Gate, has long
cultivated a tough-guy image, drawing a mix of admiration for his
boldness and scorn for his alleged bully tactics.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested in April, three months after investigators found
numerous weapons, including a semiautomatic assault rifle, in his
two-story townhouse. The weapon case is being tried separately.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, three witnesses said they had relayed
threatening remarks from Robles to people identified as victims:
Escutia's husband, Leo Briones; Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh
(D-Los Angeles); and South Gate Police Lt. Vincent Avila.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, prosecutors must prove that a statement was
intended as a threat and caused fear. They also must prove it was
unconditional. Prosecutors do not have to prove intent to carry out a
threat.</TE>
<TE>   According to two jurors interviewed after the trial, the jury
almost acquitted Robles on the alleged threat against Firebaugh.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Robles told a witness that he wanted to take
Firebaugh to Tijuana and put him in the trunk of a car before blowing
his brains out.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said that, because Firebaugh didn't report the incident
until months later, he didn't seem frightened.</TE>
<TE>   They also said Firebaugh's admission that he hadn't wanted to be
perceived as a victim influenced their votes.</TE>
<TE>   The jury at one point reached an 11-1 vote for acquittal on the
threat against Firebaugh before deliberations broke down, jurors
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the Escutia-related counts, where Robles preceded the violent
language with, "If I could get away with it," two jurors held out
against a guilty verdict. They said the statement was conditional
because he used the word "if."</TE>
<TE>   But 10 jurors thought Robles had crossed the line, even though
they thought Escutia's husband didn't seem too concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Briones didn't take it that seriously, but his wife took it a
whole different way," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the jurors, information about the city's past
violence against political figures, including a shooting and
firebombing, made some jurors lean toward guilty verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate's super-heated political landscape is "far too
explosive," Millier said.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's the way politics is," Jones said, "I ain't going to be
no politician."</TE>

<HD>22 California Members of House Demand Federal Action on
Water</HD>
<DH>They want more done for Salton Sea, which is key to
Imperial Valley- San Diego dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>With a federal cutback in California's water supply just days away,
22 members of Congress from the state sent a blunt letter Thursday
demanding that the Bush administration do more to solve the problem
at the heart of the crisis: the failing health of the Salton Sea.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, to Interior Secretary Gale Norton, accused her
department of failing to fulfill a federal mandate: to develop a plan
to prevent further damage to the ailing sea from a proposed sale of
water from Imperial Valley to San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the federal government's contribution to saving the water
deal "has been limited mainly to the issuance of threats and
provocations that have impeded, rather than encouraged, agreements
among Southern California water agencies."</LD>
<TE>   The letter was signed by Republicans and Democrats, including some
considered polar opposites, such as Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon)
and Rep. Bob Filner (D-Chula Vista). Hunter represented the Imperial
Valley for two decades, but the area is now in Filner's district.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed in the letter," said Assistant Interior
Secretary Bennett Raley.</TE>
<TE>   He said the same group sent a letter in May acknowledging that the
federal government has no choice except to enforce an agreement
between California and six other states to reduce Southern
California's share of the Colorado River unless an agreement to
transfer water from the Imperial Valley to San Diego is signed by
Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Straddling Imperial and Riverside counties, the Salton Sea, a
fetid body of salty water that nevertheless supports millions of fish
and migratory birds, has proved the major stumbling block to the
proposed mega-water deal between the Imperial Irrigation District and
the San Diego County Water Authority.</TE>
<TE>   And unless that deal is signed by Dec. 31, Norton has vowed to
reduce the supply of surplus Colorado River water sent to the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for distribution
to local agencies serving 17 million people in six counties.</TE>
<TE>   Directors of the Imperial Irrigation District, the nation's
largest agricultural irrigation district, have refused to sign the
deal until they are assured that the agency will not be billed later
for hundreds of millions of dollars for projects to restore the
Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Norton has said the district cannot receive such assurance.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), soon to be chairman of the
Senate Agriculture and Water Committee, said the Imperial district is
caught in "a classic Catch-22": asked to fallow land to save water
but also to keep the Salton Sea, which is dependent on agricultural
runoff, at its current level.</TE>
<TE>   If the sea's level declines, it will become smaller and saltier,
endangering millions of fish and birds, as well as increasing air
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of how much it will cost to slow down the sea's
inexorable deterioration into hyper-salinity have ranged up to $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have $1 billion in discretionary funding in the
department budget," Raley said.</TE>

budget deficit, saying that Gov. Gray Davis had announced an
additional $25 billion in cuts. In fact, Davis has proposed about $10
billion in budget cuts, leaving a remaining deficit of $25 billion.</CX>

<HD>4 Families to Split Big Share of Farm Deal</HD>
<DH>Secretary of State Bill Jones and his relatives are among
those who would accept millions for land saturated with salt by lack
of drainage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Four prominent farming families, including California Secretary of
State Bill Jones and his relatives, would receive $70 million  from
the federal government as part of a proposed settlement announced
last week that would fallow 32,400 acres of damaged farmland.</LD>
<LD>   Exhibits filed in U.S. District Court here also show that the four
families would receive an additional $19 million from the private
water district that acted on their behalf to provide federal water to
irrigate farms now saturated with salt and selenium.</LD>
<LD>   The families had argued that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and
their own Westlands Water District failed to build a drainage system
to remove the toxic runoff of water irrigating what is an ancient
seabed on Fresno County's west side. This failure to finish one of
the biggest irrigation projects in the West doomed their land, they
said, making fertile fields a boggy wasteland.</LD>
<TE>   The 18-page proposed settlement, made public last week, never
listed the total amount each family would receive, stating only that
19 families would share the $140 million from the federal government
and the water district to idle their land. Critics who had called the
proposed deal a "taxpayer bailout" said it was troubling to learn
that four families controlling 21,900 acres would be collecting
two-thirds of the money.</TE>
<TE>   If a federal judge approves the settlement and Congress
appropriates the money, the Wolfsen family and its partnerships and
trusts, for instance, would receive $40 million for idling nearly
10,000 acres of spoiled land, court documents show.</TE>
<TE>   "What this settlement does is put four families ahead of the
entire state of California when it comes to solutions for restoring
rivers and fisheries and improving water supply and quality," said
Barry Nelson of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a San
Francisco-based environmental group that filed a formal objection
Thursday with the U.S. District Court here. The group has fought for
years to get some Sierra water, now diverted for farming, returned to
California rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Carter, president of Save Our Streams, acknowledged that
some of the farming families had suffered serious damages and were
entitled to a settlement, but he said much of the harm had been
caused by Westlands Water District. "Their own water district
continued to deliver water to the saltiest land and this ended up
polluting their good land.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you look at this settlement, the federal government is
paying the lion's share and Westlands gets to keep the development
rights to the land and the water that went with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones, who leaves office in January after failing in a bid
for governor, deferred comment to Theodore Chester, a Los Angeles
lawyer representing the 19 families. Chester said the environmental
community and some members of Congress were misrepresenting the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to paint this as if it's a big federal subsidy and
that misses some very big points," he said. "It misses the fact that
their farms have been destroyed by the government's failure to
provide drainage. This settlement isn't a payout for the land alone
but for the damages suffered over 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Peck, the matriarch of one of the San Joaquin Valley's
most prominent farm families, said the money wouldn't begin to cover
the costs -- both monetary and emotional -- caused by the federal
government's decades-long failure to provide a drain. She has watched
the buildup of salt kill her family's 500 acres of almonds and blight
its cotton and melon fields.</TE>
<TE>   Now she's seeing what she considers a tragedy taking place on the
same land from which her father, Russell Giffen, and grandfather,
Wylie Giffen, produced a bounty: Entire stretches of the valley's
west side are reverting to desert.</TE>
<TE>   She said the $18-million deal for the 5,000 acres she and her late
husband, Sumner Peck, had farmed would cover a mountain of farm debt
and lawyer's bills and maybe give the next generation -- eight
children and 25 grandchildren -- enough money to start anew.</TE>
<TE>   "People hear about all these millions and think we're
celebrating," she said. "But five generations of Giffens and Pecks
have farmed the west side. This was some of the best ground anywhere.
We built it up with our own hands, and now we're losing our way of
life.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do? My sons are in their 40s and 50s. We
just can't up and leave and move to Oregon."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of west side farming have long contended that the canals
and dams provided by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation were a form of
taxpayer subsidy. They say wealthy families divided their empires
into smaller trusts to evade a federal law that limited the water to
960 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones, his family's trusts and partnerships control 3,200
acres and would receive more than $10 million for idling their land.
The O'Neill family controls 4,600 acres and would receive more than
$19 million.</TE>
<TE>   Peck said her family had never divided its acreage into multiple
trusts to make them eligible for federal crop subsidies. And people
who say her water is subsidized are using what cities pay -- $300 an
acre-foot -- as a benchmark. Farms aren't cities, she said. She has
paid the government $50 to $90 an acre-foot to irrigate the family's
5,000 acres, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People call us 'corporate farmers,' but look at us," she said,
pointing to five of her sons and daughters wearing blue jeans and
chinos and work shoes as they gathered inside the living room of her
home in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "They all got their hands in the dirt. They farm from sunup to
sundown every day, putting every penny we've got on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Peck, the lead plaintiff in the 10-year-old lawsuit, said she
first noticed the damage from rising salt in the water table in 1977.
A healthy field of black-eyed peas suddenly started turning yellow.
Over the next decade, a plume of salty water bubbled higher and
higher beneath the rich soil.</TE>
<TE>   The family spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to stave off the
problem. They built their own plumbing system to shunt the drainage
water to makeshift ponds and installed drip irrigation. All the
while, she said, they waited for the federal government to make good
on its promise for a real drain to the San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Half the Peck ranch has now died as a result of salts.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times in life do you make an agreement with your
government and see it completely done away with?" she said. "We
wanted a drain, not a settlement. It's a sad day."</TE>

<HD>Suit Over Massive Irvine Project Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Judge rules that the environmental review of a plan to
build a community of 35,000 was adequate. 'It's a shame,' a critic
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County Superior Court judge has rejected a lawsuit to halt
Irvine's plan to build a community of 35,000 residents -- a
population that equals that of San Juan Capistrano -- on land around
the closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Beach-based group Defend the Bay had challenged the
7,743-acre project in July, saying the city's environmental review
was inadequate and failed to consider the effect of the increased
traffic, loss of agricultural land and other factors.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling released Thursday, Judge C. Robert Jameson dismissed
that argument and found that Irvine had conducted an adequate
environmental review and had addressed concerns about traffic,
additional police protection, environmental effects and other issues.
The judge said the evidence backs the city's assertion that Irvine
Co.'s Northern Sphere development would have a beneficial effect.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Agran praised the ruling and said Northern Sphere will
be "the crown jewel of our planned community." He said the City
Council had approved the development after more than 50 public
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The plan permits the construction of 12,350 homes and more than 7
million square feet of commercial space on county land that the city
plans to annex near the Irvine Spectrum. The development will provide
housing for 35,000 residents, about a quarter of Irvine's current
population.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Caustin, executive director of Defend the Bay, said the
project is far too dense and will destroy the region's charm by
paving over thousands of acres of farmland. "It's a shame, and I
respectfully disagree with the judge," he said. "When it's built out
in 20 years, we're going to look back and say, 'Boy, what happened?'

<LD>An Orange County Superior Court judge has rejected a lawsuit to halt
Irvine's plan to build a community of 35,000 residents -- a
population that equals San Juan Capistrano -- on land around the
closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Beach-based group Defend the Bay had challenged the
7,743-acre project in July, saying the city's environmental review
was inadequate and failed to consider the effect of the increased
traffic, loss of agricultural land and other factors.</LD>

<TE>   Mayor Larry Agran praised the ruling and said the Northern Sphere
community will be "the crown jewel of our planned community." Agran
said the City Council had approved the development after more than 50
public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The plan permits the construction of 12,350 homes and more than 7

respectfully disagree with the judge," he said. "When it's built out
in 20 years, we're going to look back and say, 'Boy, what happened?'
It's the Los Angeles-ization of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Caustin acknowledged that the ruling clears the way for the
development and said that mounting other legal challenges would be
difficult. "I think the council represented the Irvine Co. very
well," he said, criticizing the political influence of the
development corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. spokesman John Christensen said the judge tossed out
the lawsuit because the evidence showed the city was careful, fair
and responsive to its constituents when it reviewed the development
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling validates the integrity and thoroughness of the
city's environmental assessment process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Agran said the project will include 1,800 units of much-needed
affordable housing and thousands of acres of open space and
recreational areas. Plus, the community will be next to the so-called
Great Park, which county voters approved to replace a commercial
airport at the base.</TE>
<TE>   "The Northern Sphere was always envisioned and approved in
conjunction with our anticipation that the El Toro property would be
converted into a Great Park," he said. "We're glad it will come
sooner rather than later."</TE>

<HD>New Storm Beats Up N. California</HD>
<DH>Wind and rain cause power outages and traffic problems. The
front was expected to reach the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A potent storm set to drench Southern California early this morning
hammered the northern part of the state Thursday, dropping
temperatures to near freezing on the coast, stalling traffic and
tripping power supplies from Mendocino to Monterey.</LD>
<LD>   The gusty wind and torrential rain was expected to arrive in the
Los Angeles area about midnight, with the heaviest rainfall between 2
a.m. and 5 a.m., said Mark Lenz, a National Weather Service
meteorologist.</LD>
<LD>   Up to two inches of rain was expected along the coast and between
two to four inches in the foothills. Lenz said the storm was likely
to diminish by tonight, with heavier rain returning by Saturday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   As of 8:30 p.m. Thursday, the storm was lashing Interstate 5, the
state's principal north-south highway, in the Tehachapi Mountains
with heavy rain, sleet and winds gusting up to 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be a good situation up here tonight," said Fran
Jensen, at Interstate Towing in Lebec. "The rain is going to be
freezing on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Power companies Thursday braced for possible outages. Southern
California Edison stockpiled fuses, transformers, wire and other
supplies, readying for a repeat of the service disruption to 126,000
customers during the storm that hit Southern California Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the north were hit by outages Thursday. According to
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Northern California's largest utility
company, more than 67,400 customers were without power by Thursday
evening. The storm began to subside in most areas Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   For many coastal range communities, the violent storm, accompanied
by wind gusts of more than 60 mph, was the second blow in less than a
week. A heavy winter storm that began last Friday softened the coast
with downpours that caused several Northern California waterways,
including the Russian, Eel and Navarro rivers, to reach flood stage.</TE>
<TE>   According to PG&amp;E spokesman Brian Swanson, 19,000 customers were
still without power from that first storm when the new front swept in
shortly after noon Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the hardest hit communities was Carmel Heights, an affluent
hillside enclave with 450 people on California 1 three miles south of
Carmel.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a challenging week," said Andrew Davidson, general
manager of the luxury 142-room Hyatt Highlands Inn, which was without
electricity for two days earlier in the week and again Thursday.
Davidson spent the afternoon distributing 12-hour glow sticks to the
rooms, which cost up to $1,000 a night.</TE>
<TE>   Carmel Heights resident Sharon Kolbrener said she and her husband
lost power in the earlier storm and had it knocked out again Thursday
morning when the high winds toppled giant oak and Monterey pine
trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It had been very dry here," Kolbrener said from her candlelit
home. "The first storm saturated and loosened the soil, and the winds
this morning knocked down trees right and left, crumbling the power
lines."</TE>
<TE>   A repair crew trying to reach the trouble area was stranded,
Swanson said, when large trees fell on both sides of their vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to pull the crew out for a while until it was deemed
safe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To the relief of National Weather Service meteorologists who
feared flash-flooding, temperatures were much lower in Thursday's
storm. This meant that most of the precipitation above 1,000 feet was
snow, which limited the rush of water downhill to swollen rivers.
Snow was recorded in the Sonoma Valley as low as 100 feet, covering
recently harvested vineyards with a white blanket.</TE>
<TE>   Among the hardest hit spots were the Point Arena and Gualala
communities on the Mendocino coast. Gualala, which in the local
Native American language means "water flowing down," lived up to its
name Thursday as it was drenched with downpours and pelted with
hailstones.</TE>
<TE>   Weather Service spokeswoman Kayda Muckey in Sacramento said the
heaviest rainfall was recorded in the Bay Area city of Vallejo, at a
rate of two inches an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, we've managed to get by with a few traffic accidents and
some local flooding," said Vallejo Police Lt. Dave Jackson.</TE>

<HD>Rooftop Cross in San Clemente Not a 'Sign,' Says Judge Who
Rules It's Legal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The law works in mysterious ways.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ruled Thursday that a cross is not a sign, at least not as
defined in San Clemente's sign ordinance.</LD>
<LD>   Surf shop owner Richard Landingham can keep a 10-foot cross with
two U.S. flags and red holiday lights on the roof of his business,
Orange County Superior Court Judge Frances Munoz ruled Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Jeff Goldfarb said the ruling essentially
"has afforded Mr. Landingham the opportunity to be the only person in
the city to legally mount a sign on his roof."</TE>
<TE>   Landingham put up the cross and lights shortly after the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as a memorial to those killed and an
expression of his Christian faith. But city officials said it
violated the sign ordinance, which prohibits all rooftop signs,
regardless of their message.</TE>
<TE>   The two parties have been at odds over the cross for more than a
year, and the city took him to court. A week ago, a jury deadlocked
on whether the cross is an illegal sign but found Landingham guilty
of not obtaining a permit for the cross or for a business sign on the
side of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz, noting the jury's confusion over the legality of the cross,
said that as written, the city's sign ordinance did not clearly apply
to Landingham's cross. But she upheld the permit offenses, fined him
$715 and placed him on unsupervised probation for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Landingham, who owns LAP Extreme surf shop and has arranged to pay
the fine in 10 installments, still claimed victory Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The city's sign ordinance is meant, he said, to regulate
advertisements pertaining to a specific business. "I don't sell
crosses. It's my religion; it has nothing to do with my business."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, said Landingham, is that "the judge said I don't
need ... any permits for the cross whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   City officials were assessing the ruling late Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Economy Takes Toll on Toy Giveaway</HD>

<LD>The line began forming at 7 a.m. Thursday, and by early evening it
reached around the block in downtown Los Angeles. Thousands of
mothers and children waited patiently to claim a special Christmas
treat: their choice of one of 5,000 toys distributed at what has
become a bittersweet tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Five thousand coupons, printed in English and Spanish, had been
distributed to needy children in the area by neighborhood service
organizations. Each was numbered and redeemable for one toy of the
child's choosing.</LD>
<LD>   Blanca Ruiz, 30, was second in line. She had arrived early at the
offices of Central City Neighborhood Partners, the nonprofit group
that hosted the giveaway, to ensure that her daughter, Erica
Paniagua, 9, got what she wanted: something Barbie-related.</LD>
<TE>   "It's beautiful, this event," Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Children were greeted by an odd assembly of volunteer elves: a
group of Aztec dancers, a couple of politicians and a crew of
firefighters from Fire Station 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants a SpongeBob?" asked fireman Rick Villata, waving a
palm-sized package in the air. "He talks!"</TE>
<TE>   "I do!" said Christian Ortega, 12.</TE>
<TE>   Fireman Paul Pham tried to sell the fabric-covered binders that
sat in a stack on the floor, largely ignored by kids coveting Barbie,
race cars and Disney stuffed animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Pokemon?" offered Ryan Kendal, also with Fire Station 11, holding
a toy aloft.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Mercado, 10, chose a Harry Potter Snake Bites Candy Maker
instead.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles Democrat whose office
organizes the toy drive, said that, after 9/11, he asked the
firefighters to join the event, now in its fifth year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 10,000 toys were distributed. This year, despite large
donations by Megatoys, Albertsons and Kodak, only 5,000 toys were
stacked along the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "With the bad economy, it's been hard to organize the toys,"
Cedillo said. Gesturing to the children clutching coupons, he added:
"But that's when they need it most."</TE>
<TE>   It took Erica Paniagua less than a minute to choose her gift: a
stylishly-dressed Kayla doll, made by Mattel and touted as a "friend
of Barbie." As carolers sang "Jingle Bells," she took her mother's
hand and walked outside.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Council Boosts Spending for Study on Truck Traffic
Safety</HD>
<DH>The city is considering asking Caltrans to restrict the
number of big rigs going through town, but wants more information
first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Moorpark City Council has authorized spending more money on a
consultant to analyze the safety of truck traffic on California 118.</LD>
<LD>   Moorpark hired Parsons Inc. of Pasadena in June to investigate
what it would take to persuade the California Department of
Transportation to adopt restrictions on the number of big rigs that
barrel down the town's main thoroughfare, also known as New Los
Angeles Avenue. County transportation officials estimate that about
3,700 trucks travel the road daily.</LD>
<LD>   Parsons told the council last month that the state could restrict
trucks on California 118, despite its designation as part of the
national highway system, provided there are sufficient safety
reasons.</LD>
<TE>   The council Wednesday night agreed to spend about $7,000 more, up
to $28,100, to have Parsons research accident data on California 118;
determine whether any existing hills, curves and dips cause safety
concerns as far west as Saticoy; and search for environmentally
sensitive areas that could be harmed by truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The company will also investigate whether similar applications
have been successful and review information on the effect diesel
emissions have on areas near schools and children, for possible use
in a future application to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Public works Director Kenneth C. Gilbert said the council also
wants to review health and attendance records at Flory Elementary
School, the school closest to California 118, to determine whether
its students have an unusually high number of absences or illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The city is moving carefully before it goes through the expense of
applying for Caltrans restrictions, he said, because such an
application could cost several hundred thousand dollars.</TE>

<HD>Twins Clear for Trip Home</HD>
<DH>Doctors who separated the girls expect them to return to
Guatemala next month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twins girls who arrived in Los Angeles six months ago with their
skulls fused at the top have been cleared by doctors to return to
Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   However, the sisters, Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej
Alvarez, will end their journey much differently than they began it:
as independent youngsters.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did doctors at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital succeed in
separating the conjoined twins, but the girls have shown signs in
recent weeks that they are coming into their own.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors say Maria Teresa, who has struggled the most since the
surgery and was recently fitted with a hearing aid, now turns her
head, follows people with her eyes and even cries.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more emotion," said Dr. Henry Kawamoto Jr., the
lead plastic surgeon for the medical team.</TE>
<TE>   The pediatric neurosurgeon who coordinated the separation, Dr.
Jorge Lazareff, said, "Before, we had Maria de Jesus and her sister.
Now we have two individuals, Maria de Jesus and Maria Teresa."</TE>
<TE>   A feeding tube has helped Maria Teresa gain weight.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a little butterball right now," Kawamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   When the girls and their parents, Alba Leticia Alvarez and
Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, will fly home is up to Guatemalan officials,
who have requested more time to prepare for their arrival, Kawamoto
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lazareff said he expects the girls, who are 17 months old to
return home the first or second week of January. They are likely to
stay in a Guatemala City hospital for a few weeks before the family
moves into an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   In Guatemala, the girls will undergo physical therapy to learn to
crawl, sit and balance themselves. They also face the prospect of
future medical procedures to stretch their scalps so that they may
eventually have full heads of their thick, dark hair.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Lazareff said that by the end of next year there may
be no significant differences between the twins and other children.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lazareff said he's holding his breath for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time one of my patients leaves the hospital, I always wonder:
Will they go back to school? Will they play soccer? Will they learn?"
he said. "Only when I see those things will I close the book on
them."</TE>

<HD>Bombing Suspect Will Fight Extradition</HD>
<DH>Fearing Thailand would return him to Vietnam, Van Duc Vo
reverses legal strategy. Supporters hail anti- communist as a hero.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 42-year-old Baldwin Park man who was arrested last year on
suspicion of trying to bomb the Vietnamese Embassy in Thailand has
decided to fight extradition rather than risk being returned to his
homeland, his attorney said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Van Duc Vo, who appeared in federal court in Santa Ana on Thursday
as hundreds of supporters rallied outside the courthouse, had earlier
agreed to be extradited to Thailand.</LD>
<LD>   His attorney said Vo worries that Thai officials might return him
to Vietnam, where he fears he would be put to death.</LD>
<TE>   After two hours of argument, U.S. Magistrate Arthur Nakazato said
he needed more time to decide whether Vo should be extradited. He set
no date for his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, about 300 flag-waving supporters touted him
as a hero who should be released.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a terrorist. He has sacrificed his life," said Thanh
Pham, 74, of Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   Vo, a member of a Little Saigon-based organization dedicated to
overthrowing Vietnam's communist government, was arrested in October
2001 as he stepped off a jet at John Wayne Airport and has been held
at the Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center on suspicion of
conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that on June 19, 2001, Vo and another man
placed a backpack filled with explosives outside the Vietnamese
Embassy in Bangkok and tossed a brown box over the fence. The box
contained 11 pounds of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate -- the same
type of mixture used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombings, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The packages were linked to a detonator that was supposed to be
activated by a cellular phone. Prosecutors said the detonator
malfunctioned and did not explode.</TE>
<TE>   In a jailhouse interview with The Times, Vo said he planted the
bombs to send a message to the Vietnamese communist regime but
defused the boxes when he realized the U.S. Embassy was nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Vo was given the option of pleading guilty and serving 10 years in
prison or be extradited to Thailand. Vo, who has maintained his
innocence, agreed to be extradited after hearing that Thai officials
did not plan to file charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   But he said when he realized Vietnam's communist regime wanted him
to face charges there, he feared Thai officials would hand him over
to Vietnam, where he said he would most likely be put to death.</TE>
<TE>   Vo's brother, Vinh Tan Nguyen, 49, is accused in a similar
attempted bombing and is being held in Manila.</TE>

<HD>Matsui Decides Pinstripes Suit Him Best</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hideki Matsui, intent on wearing the famous Yankee pinstripes, became
the biggest Japanese baseball star to join the major leagues,
reaching a preliminary agreement Thursday on a $21-million,
three-year contract with New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I was nervous for a while because it hadn't been decided what
team I would play for," Matsui said at a news conference in Tokyo.
"Now, I'm relieved and ready to give my best.</LD>
<LD>   "The Yankees have a great baseball tradition and great players.
It's the ballclub that would most challenge me. That's where I wanted
to show my abilities."</LD>
<TE>   A three-time most valuable player of Japan's Central League, the
28-year-old power-hitting outfielder seemed set on joining the
Yankees since August, when New York sent its assistant general
manager to Tokyo to scout him.</TE>
<TE>   The Yomiuri Giants, who drafted Matsui in 1993, were said to have
offered a $33-million, four-year deal to keep him.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui had a .304 average in Japan with 332 homers in 1,268 games,
and led the Central League last season with 50 homers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Maddux accepted Atlanta's offer of salary arbitration, the
equivalent of signing a one-year deal for the 2003 season. The
four-time Cy Young Award winner had been a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Unless they agree on a contract, Atlanta and Maddux will exchange
proposed salaries for a one-year deal in January and will argue their
cases before arbitrators the following month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unable to find an acceptable deal on the free-agent market,
catcher Ivan Rodriguez is exploring a possible move to Japan....
Cleveland signed pitcher Jason Bere to a $1-million, one-year
contract.... Right-hander Terry Adams accepted salary arbitration
with Philadelphia.... Reliever Antonio Alfonseca and the Chicago Cubs
agreed to a $4-million, one-year contract.... Outfielder Ricky Ledee
agreed to an $850,000, one-year contract with the Phillies.... Former
major league manager Whitey Herzog underwent heart triple-bypass
surgery and was recovering in St. Louis hospital's intensive-care
unit.</TE>

<LD>Two steps forward and one giant leap backward.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the Clippers stand today, after superb play during
victories over the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets but another
in a string of fourth-quarter belly flops during Wednesday's loss to
the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers had a chance to reach the .500 mark before Christmas,
but by squandering a 14-point lead and losing to the Trail Blazers,
the best they can do is a 13-15 mark at the holiday break.</LD>
<TE>   "It really is a shame," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We played good
basketball and we let that game slip away. In a way, it is a step
back. We had a good roll going there. If we win that game, our
confidence is soaring."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have won five of their last eight games, their most
successful stretch this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller did not practice Thursday because of a
sprained left ankle and his status for tonight against the Phoenix
Suns will be determined at game time.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard Eric Piatkowski also did not practice and will not
play tonight or Saturday against the Denver Nuggets because of a
lower abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   The team's medical staff hopes a five-day layoff after Saturday's
game will give each player a chance to recover. Miller has been
hobbled since Nov. 29. Piatkowski injured himself Dec. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has sat out only once; Piatkowski will be sidelined for a
total of six games.</TE>

<HD>Barboza Displays Rare Air</HD>
<DH>Long Beach Wilson sophomore is already one of nation's best
and doesn't show a hint of anxiety in handling the attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a brief moment during an otherwise ordinary day at practice, a
split second that Coach Susan Pescar will remember for a long, long
time.</LD>
<LD>   Cynthia Barboza was in the middle of a hitting drill -- doing
nothing more than what her coach had told her, really -- when she
went up and pounded a volleyball straight down on the other side of
the net.</LD>
<LD>   Forget the 10-foot line. This one would have gone down inside the
10-inch line, if such a thing existed.</LD>
<TE>   It was a big swing for a sophomore. Her coach was stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this flash of watching her in the Olympics [in 2008] and
seeing her do that," said Pescar, the coach at Long Beach Wilson
High. "She was so far over the net."</TE>
<TE>   Barboza's reaction? She walked to the end of the players' line, as
if it had been a typical swing on a typical day.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, nice hit," one of her teammates said. Practice continued.</TE>
<TE>   It was that type of season for the sometimes shy 6-foot outside
hitter, who has been selected The Times' girls' volleyball player of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Barboza's statistics and the Bruins' accomplishments spoke
volumes.</TE>
<TE>   She averaged 6.1 kills and 1.2 blocks per game, and Wilson
advanced to its first state Division I championship match.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Barboza never seemed fazed by anyone or anything.</TE>
<TE>   Her reputation always preceded her on the road, where hostile fans
jeered when she made a mistake and booed when she drilled a kill.</TE>
<TE>   She ignored it all. And Wilson (36-4) almost always won.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had a lot thrown in her lap, but she'd done a good job of
not letting it get to her," Pescar said. "She's got extreme talent
and has had to deal with a lot of things because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Barboza's talents are already known across the U.S. She was
selected the top sophomore in the nation by Student Sports magazine
and is a member of the U.S. junior national team.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, Barboza helped lead the U.S. youth national team to a
gold medal at the NORCECA youth girls' volleyball championship with a
sweep of the Dominican Republic. Barboza was the youngest player on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain View St. Francis, ranked No. 1 in the nation by Student
Sports, swept Wilson in the state championship, 16-14, 15-9, 15-13,
but Barboza held her own with 15 kills.</TE>
<TE>   She had 26 kills and seven blocks in a five-game victory over Los
Alamitos in the semifinals of the Southern Regional in the state
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That victory helped to alleviate the pain of a somewhat surprising
loss to the Griffins in the Southern Section Division I-AA
championship, perhaps the only thing that didn't go as planned for
Wilson and Barboza this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to end our season with two losses to the same
team," Barboza said. "We were pretty excited when we heard we were
going to have a rematch."</TE>
<TE>   Barboza will be back next season, and the season after that. High
school teams will have to get used to her. Then the college world
might have to adjust.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless she gets hurt or something unforeseeable happens, she
could be the next Logan Tom, taking volleyball to the next level in
this country," Pescar said, referring to the Stanford senior who
starred for the U.S. Olympic team two years ago before her sophomore
season in college.</TE>
<TE>   "The old saying, 'You ain't seen nothing yet' is probably true."</TE>

<LD>There's nothing more awkward or uncomfortable for a sportswriter than
interviewing an athlete from the losing team after a big game.</LD>
<LD>   The athlete is usually dejected, in no mood to talk and wants time
to recover in private.</LD>
<LD>   But sportswriters have deadlines and can't wait 30 minutes for an
athlete to come to terms with the reality of defeat.</LD>
<TE>   It's into this minefield of emotions that sportswriters plunge,
trying to do their job while taking into consideration the
psychological turmoil they're witnessing.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is even more difficult when dealing with teenagers,
many of whom aren't mature enough to handle defeat in a dignified
manner.</TE>
<TE>   But defeat is also an opportunity for all athletes to display
class, earn respect and prove they are ready to move to the next
level.</TE>
<TE>   College coaches never know for sure how a freshman is going to
handle the jump from high school, but I have developed my own
measuring stick, and it's based on how well players handle
sportswriters in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, I have interviewed many high school football
players, trying to get a feel for their mental toughness and maturity
level.</TE>
<TE>   It's been inspiring to see how most have responded.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kyle Boller of Newhall Hart was one of the best
quarterbacks in the country. He was a senior in his first year as a
starter. He was playing a nonleague game against Loyola. In the
game's final minute, he moved the Indians into position for a
potential game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   But a botched snap with 15 seconds left resulted in a missed
20-yard field-goal attempt and a 23-22 victory for Loyola. Afterward,
most of Hart's players were devastated, but not Boller. He answered
questions with the maturity of a college senior. Within months, he
was the starting quarterback at California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Casey Clausen of Mission Hills Alemany was the
quarterback in a 45-14 playoff loss to Santa Ana Mater Dei.
Afterward, teammates were in tears. Clausen was upset too, but he
stood on the field, shaking hands, answering questions and letting
everyone know that his career wasn't over. Within months, he was the
starting quarterback at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, a player will flunk the test by refusing to answer
questions. That doesn't make them a bad person, just someone who
probably isn't ready to handle the pressures that come with playing
college sports.</TE>
<TE>   This season, receiver Whitney Lewis of Ventura St. Bonaventure
passed the test. His team had its 43-game winning streak ended by
Hart, 31-6. But Lewis was calm and cooperative, knowing there would
be many good days ahead for him and his teammates. Last week, St.
Bonaventure won the Division IV championship.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Brian White of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills passed the
test. I went up to him after a loss to Villa Park, and he spoke
intelligently about the frustration of defeat and not performing
well. He's got a scholarship to Colorado, and his maturity is going
to help him in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Mark Washington of Long Beach Poly passed the test. His
team had just lost to unbeaten Concord De La Salle, 28-7. He was
disappointed and frustrated. He stood in the middle of Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley, praising his opponent and demonstrating maturity
and class.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Sean Norton of Hart also passed the test. He was
sobbing after his team's 10-6 loss to Mission Viejo in the Division
II final on Saturday but gathered enough fortitude to offer his
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Intruding on what should be a private moment of reflection gives
me no pleasure, but seeing a teenager rise up in a difficult moment
to show courage reveals a lot about their character.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, I approached Kyle Pollock, the quarterback for Arroyo
Grande, after his team had lost to St. Bonaventure, 35-20, in a
Division IV playoff opener.</TE>
<TE>   Pollock is a 14-year-old freshman who had never played a down of
varsity football, yet he played the entire game, making perfect
handoffs, completing two of his three passes and never losing his
poise.</TE>
<TE>   Most players would be distraught after losing their first varsity
start, but not Pollock. He was excited. He knew he had done his best,
and afterward he didn't hide or wallow. He spoke calmly and
confidently.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to take three more years of high school football to
learn if Pollock is truly ready to play in college, but he's already
passed my test, which tells me plenty.</TE>

<LD>A couple of trainers good with layoff runners will square off with
two comebackers in today's third race at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Tracemark, who registered his biggest victory in the $150,000
California Derby on April 13 at Bay Meadows, and High Wire Act are
among five scheduled to go 1 1/16 miles in the $58,000 allowance. The
race is the first leg of a pick six with a carry-over of $77,376.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Ed McGrath, the father of Mark McGrath, the lead singer
of the band Sugar Ray, and trained by Craig Dollase, Tracemark hasn't
run since finishing sixth in the Swaps Stakes on July 14.</LD>
<TE>   Second in two Grade III races before that Swaps flop, Tracemark
has trained well enough for his return and a wet track, a definite
possibility given the weather forecast, shouldn't bother him.</TE>
<TE>   High Wire Act, a 6-year-old End Sweep gelding owned by Sid and
Jenny Craig and trained by John Shirreffs, has run only 13 times, but
he is a threat to lead this small field all the way. He has run well
fresh before. In June 2000, he returned after more than 15 months and
won a 6 1/2-furlong race over this track.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Some tough $10,000 claimers will get together in
today's fourth at Hollywood Park. The 6 1/2-furlong race attracted
recent winners J. Cash, Armed 'N Crafty, Valiant Vision and five
others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Alfredo Marquez. The trainer has won with six of 12
starters at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bernard Hughes. The Florida trainer is one for 110 in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using George Bailey and Liberty
Run in the fifth, Another George, Champ's Gold and Blushing Ciel in
the sixth and Rapidough, Way To The Top and Devil's Horn in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/81. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $2.80/$456.40. Total money bet: $544.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Lakers have held internal discussions regarding turning over
parts of their roster, and there are strong indications from outside
the organization that attempts have been made to initiate trades or
talks that would lead to trades.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak said Thursday that he had not yet
begun that process, however, and that he stands by recent comments
that he would continue assessing the team at least through December.
Several hours later, the team fell to 10-17.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to let these guys roll and let them figure it out,"
Kupchak said.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the team's record and Phil Jackson's near-nightly
observations that players lack energy, Kupchak said, "We are not
shopping a single person. Not one phone call."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker losses reached 17, with road games against Philadelphia and
Toronto and a Christmas Day game against Sacramento dead ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "How many losses before you get desperate?" Jackson said. "Twenty
losses at this time of year would be devastating for us to overcome.
We know that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant leads the NBA in All-Star balloting after the first
returns.</TE>
<TE>   In a curious balloting, Shaquille O'Neal ranks first among
conference centers, but only about 9,000 votes ahead of the
runner-up, Houston's Yao Ming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's cancellation of his scheduled David Letterman appearance
created a stir that apparently included telephone calls from the show
to Bryant's agent and the NBA commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours before the taping, Bryant's throat was so sore his
voice was inaudible from more than a couple of feet away, and team
personnel defended the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a PR guy's dream for six years for me," Laker official
John Black said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't expect to add power forward Horace Grant,
released last week by the Orlando Magic, soon.... Power forwards
Samaki Walker, who started, and Robert Horry combined for 20
rebounds....The Nets scored 28 points on the fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   At Philadelphia</TE>
<TE>   5 PST, Ch. 9, ESPN</TE>
<TE>   Site -- First Union Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330)</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 10-17, 76ers 17-9.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. 76ers (2001-02) -- 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Lakers continue on their tour of those they
vanquished in recent NBA Finals. The 76ers won a game two Finals ago,
and the Lakers have won eight Finals games since. Allen Iverson
averages 28.5 points, second in the league to Tracy McGrady.</TE>

<LD>If He Roves hadn't veered out badly Nov. 15, the 2-year-old appaloosa
would have won his career debut in the Classics Futurity for
owner-breeder Ed Allred and trainer Curley Ortiz.</LD>
<LD>   The son of Geneo JJ stayed straight three weeks later and
graduated cleverly. He'll try for a repeat against six others in the
$20,600 Star of Stars Futurity at 4 1/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   He Roves, who will race coupled with the Allred-owned Funny
Secret, will be facing Key To The Gold, the beaten favorite in the
common race Nov. 15; Fooled You Twice; Mamas Silver Bullet; Fair
Queen, who won at 16-1 when helped by He Roves' antics, and Really
Julie.</LD>
<TE>   Later in the card, trainer Paul Jones has two chances to add to
his record victory total when he sends out Cee A Dash and Red Hot
Blitzer in the $13,000 Diamond Bar Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who began the week with 165 victories, two more than the
record of 163 he established in 2001, will saddle a third of the
field in the 350-yard Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Kens Rawhide. 2. Cash No Check. 3. Think Mile. 4. He
Roves. 5. Chasen Moms Dream. 6. Willyacrossmyvalle. 7. Knowntoman. 8.
Toasting My Dad. 9. Babe With Rhythm. 10. Regards To Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  Use Kens Rawhide, Head Light Jr and Seranoide in the first,
Cash No Check, Moonlighting Special and Bluegrass Blurr in the
second, Be A Winner JJ and Think Mile in the third and single the He
Roves-Funny Secret entry in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Halloween Moon had trouble in his latest and
could rebound in the fifth for trainer Jesus Nunez. Got Any Id Bout
What lost all chance at the break Dec. 5 and shortens up in the 10th.</TE>

<HD>Kings Get Bibby Back, but Finally Lose at Home</HD>
<DH>Guard scores 17 points in first game of season, but
Sacramento falls to San Antonio, 83-81.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Tim Duncan had 23 points and 14 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs
spoiled Sacramento's perfect home record and ruined Mike Bibby's
return, beating the Kings, 83-81, Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Jackson scored 18 points as the Spurs followed a victory
in Seattle by winning in the NBA's toughest road arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings had won their first 13 games at Arco Arena, where
they're 80-14 over the last three seasons, but they gave one of their
most lifeless performances in years on the same night their
injury-plagued roster became nearly whole.</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento shot less than 35% from the field and never found a
rhythm. The Spurs were barely better, committing 18 turnovers, but
Duncan had another outstanding game and San Antonio hung on when the
Kings made several turnovers and poor shots in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs didn't have a field goal in the final 3:36, but the
Kings botched repeated opportunities to get back in the game. With 12
seconds left and Sacramento down 81-78, Bobby Jackson inexplicably
drove the lane and made a wild pass that was intercepted by Stephen
Jackson, who made two free throws with 10.1 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, who missed the Kings' first 27 games after breaking his
foot in the preseason, got a standing ovation at the first mention of
his name at Arco Arena. He made a long jumper on Sacramento's first
possession and finished with 17 points on seven-of-12 shooting,
including two three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's return should have given a mental lift to the Kings, but
they came out cold and never warmed up. Chris Webber had 23 points
and 12 rebounds, while Bobby Jackson had 21 points off the bench.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>With apologies to Jefferson -- that's Richard of New Jersey, not
Thomas of Virginia -- this dog may not be dead, but it has seen
better days.</LD>
<LD>   Before the struggling Lakers met the not-red-hot-themselves Nets
Thursday night in the (chortle) Rematch of Last Season's Finalists,
Laker Coach Phil Jackson noted that 20 losses at this time of year
"would be devastating for us to overcome."</LD>
<LD>   Then the Lakers went out and notched Loss No. 17, convincingly,
98-71.</LD>
<TE>   That's with two games left on this trip, including the second game
of a back-to-back tonight in Philadelphia, and a 2-12 road record,
having beaten only the Clippers in Staples Center and the Grizzlies
in Memphis (in overtime).</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Lakers aren't trying to return to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson got Kobe Bryant, who had been eerily quiet, to go back to
firing, which Bryant did manfully, taking 29 shots, even if he wasn't
really up to it, with a cold so bad he had to cancel his David
Letterman appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe better health would have helped, or Jackson forgot to
mention they needed Bryant to hit a good percentage of them, too. He
only made eight.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lakers shot 30.2%, their low in the three-season-plus
Jackson era, so even if they were determinedly upbeat afterward --
that itself an improvement in their behavior of recent weeks -- you
can't really say they have turned the corner yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pretty patient guy when I have to be," said Bryant, turning
over a new leaf. "Right now, it's important for us to be patient.
We're playing hard.... We haven't packed it up. We're going down to
Philly tomorrow and see if we can't play better....</TE>
<TE>   "It was better tonight. We didn't hang our heads, even when we
made mistakes, even when we were down 15, 17 points. Nobody hung
their head. We kept playing. We actually started playing even
harder."</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal was, as he has been for almost two weeks, silent
on the subject, or any other, but at least neither of them demanded a
trade for the other 10 guys on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   It was just the usual, slouching into a new town under their
traveling black cloud, to massive skepticism....</TE>
<TE>   You think Byron Scott was going to worry about a team with O'Neal
and Bryant getting off to a slow start?</TE>
<TE>   Scott's Nets, who ran away from the East a year ago, started the
night tied for fourth in the conference, coming off defeats in
Detroit and (wince) Madison Square Garden, where the ever-blunt Scott
noted "We got the ... beat out of us."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's new center, Dikembe Mutombo, acquired to help them deal
with O'Neal, as opposed to all the little Nets Shaq stepped on last
spring, wasn't able to pick up the new offense, or catch enough of
their passes with his none-too-soft hands. That was before he broke
his right wrist and was lost until spring.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo is 36 and is making $53 million for this season and the
next two, which means the Nets would be hard-pressed to get rid of
him, or bring in another big man.</TE>
<TE>   So if the Lakers thought they had "problems," Scott wasn't
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're having a little ... derailment, I guess you can say, for
a few games, or whatever, a quarter of the season, and people are
going crazy," Scott said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still the best team in this league until somebody can
prove it differently in June."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, of course, the Lakers ran the Nets over in a 4-0
sweep, when Scott had his team try to single-cover O'Neal, who
averaged 36 points, shot 59.5% and won his third Finals MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said he watched Games 3 and 4, in which the Nets at least
came close, over and over last summer and reached a conclusion:</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq cannot be stopped," he said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, with Bryant reasserting himself and the Nets
swarming all over O'Neal when he did get the ball, Shaq got only 13
shots and scored a modest 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those nights for the Lakers. The effort was there
(including a big performance on the offensive boards by usually
serene-in-winter Robert Horry) but little else was.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did things go their way, as they saw it.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, feisty referee Joey Crawford hit Horry with
a fast technical foul. While Jason Kidd was shooting it, Jackson
growled the length of the floor, "That's bull, Joey!" Or something
like that.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford turned around and gestured for Jackson to wait until Kidd
had made the free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Then Crawford turned back to Jackson and gave him a T, too.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, in another discussion, Crawford told Horry, "Relax,
Rob."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson growled: "You relax. You're the one we're worried about."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Lakers congratulated themselves on their fight, but
after their last surge was repelled early in the fourth quarter, it
became a Net rout, replete with uncontested dunks.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Jackson noted, he tried to pull Shaq with eight
minutes left for "another fight, another day," but the big guy wanted
to stay in, and did until only 3:03 remained.</TE>
<TE>   That was a good sign, too, said Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   All these good signs ... what could go wrong now?</TE>
<TE>   Tonight we'll see.</TE>

<LD>Oracle BMW Racing beat U.S. rival OneWorld Challenge in the first
race of their semifinal repechage in sailing's Louis Vuitton Cup
Thursday off Auckland, New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   The winner will meet Swiss team Alinghi in the final for the right
to challenge Team New Zealand in February in the 31st America's Cup.</LD>
<LD>   OneWorld of the Seattle Yacht Club is carrying a one-race penalty
after it admitted to having secret information on the design of rival
syndicates. Oracle has to win three more races to advance to the
final, while OneWorld needs five victories.</LD>
<TE>   Oracle took advantage of a stronger breeze on the first leg to
sail into a lead it never surrendered.</TE>

<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Not only will Pete Sampras keep playing tennis, but the 14-time
Grand Slam tournament champion is bringing back Paul Annacone as his
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Annacone resigned Thursday as managing director of USA Tennis High
Performance after a year of running the program aimed at developing
stars of the future. Vic Braden, a top coach who has taught tennis
for the last 20 years, is among the candidates to replace Annacone.</TE>
<TE>   A state appeals court ruled Andrew Sanchez, the former Cal State
Northridge pitcher who suffered a fractured skull when he was struck
by a line drive in 1999, can sue the bat manufacturer, USC, the
Pacific-10 Conference and the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez is seeking punitive damages against Hillerich and Bradsby,
maker of the Air Attack 2, the bat used by USC's Dominic Correa when
Sanchez was injured. Medical expenses and lost earnings are also
sought in the suit, which was originally dismissed on a summary
judgment by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   In the Court of Appeal's opinion of reversal, Justice Gary
Hastings wrote Sanchez's attorneys established "use of this
particular bat significantly increased the inherent risk that a
pitcher would be hit by a line drive." A kinesiologist declared the
ball that struck Sanchez was traveling close to 107.8 mph, depriving
the pitcher of the NCAA-required .39 second reaction time.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer Fernando Vargas has been ordered to perform 20 hours of
community service for violating his probation by traveling out of
California without permission.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kosglow won when her opponent fell just before the finish and

<TE>   Olympic ice dance gold medalists Marina Anissina and Gwendal
Peizerat have withdrawn from the Champions on Ice tour on the advice
of their attorney and will remain in France, according to
Collins-Marshall Management, which represents them.</TE>
<TE>   Anissina was implicated in the alleged plot to fix the outcome of
the ice dance competition at Salt Lake City, and she would probably
have faced questioning from U.S. law enforcement officials if she
visited the U.S.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Norm Chow, USC's offensive coordinator, said last week that he was
intent on remaining with the Trojans and helping Pete Carroll win a
national championship.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans' success and Chow's work with Heisman Trophy
winning quarterback Carson Palmer has kept him on the list of several
athletic directors seeking head coaches.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, after the Trojans' first full-squad practice for
their Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game against Iowa, Chow said he met with
Kentucky Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart on the West Coast last
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I have not heard one word since," Chow said. "Obviously, they
aren't too interested in me. I'm trying to focus on Iowa."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky is seeking a replacement for Guy Morriss, who guided the
Wildcats to a 7-5 record before resigning to become coach at Baylor.
The Wildcats were not bowl eligible because of NCAA sanctions and
will be on probation for two more seasons with scholarship
reductions.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saint assistant Mike Riley, who was hired by Barnhart
at Oregon State, California Coach Jeff Tedford and West Virginia
Coach Rich Rodriguez also have been contacted by Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Barnhart has said that he wanted a coach in place by Christmas and
that it would not be unreasonable for the coach to earn a salary
similar to basketball Coach Tubby Smith, about $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chow also is expected to be sought by Louisville, which lost John
L. Smith to Michigan State on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC posted signs forbidding autograph seekers from approaching
players on their way to and from Howard Jones Field, but about dozen
staked out a spot across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and his family were escorted to Heritage Hall by three
security officers after practice.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people tugging on him right now," Carroll said.
"He needs to just be with us and finish this thing off right.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take good care of him and make sure he's not distracted by
stuff from the outside. We just want to make it a normal preparation
-- as normal as you can make it when you're the Heisman Trophy guy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior middle linebacker Mike Pollard took virtually every
repetition because his backup, freshman Oscar Lua, is scheduled to
have knee surgery on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting all I can right now," Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll had said that fullback Lee Webb might return to linebacker
and back up Pollard, but the more probable scenarios include moving
weakside linebacker Melvin Simmons to the middle and replacing him
with Bobby Otani. Or, strongside linebacker Matt Grootegoed could
play in the middle or on the weakside with freshman Dallas Sartz
taking his place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Arbet and Ronald Nunn, who were projected as the Trojans'
starting cornerbacks, each took another step in their rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Arbet, who had foot surgery at the end of training camp, took part
in several coverage drills. Nunn ran a series of 25 sprints for the
first time since having season-ending knee surgery after the third
game against Kansas State. Nunn has had three operations on his right
knee.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Children May Settle Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The three children of Ted Williams are expected to get approval today
for each to receive $215,000 payments from a trust, a move that could
end a legal fight among them over whether to keep the Hall of Famer's
body permanently frozen.</LD>
<LD>   During a brief hearing, Citrus County Circuit Judge Patricia
Thomas was expected to approve changes to the division of the
$645,000 irrevocable insurance trust among Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell
and her stepsiblings, John Henry Williams and Claudia Williams.</LD>
<LD>   The early distribution of the trust could end Ferrell's legal
objections to her stepsiblings' decision to store their father's body
at a cryonics lab in Scottsdale, Ariz., last summer, a source
familiar with the case told Associated Press on condition of not
being identified.</LD>
<TE>   The siblings weren't expected to attend the hearing today in
Inverness, about 50 miles north of Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   The trust was written so that the money wouldn't be distributed
until 10 years after the slugger's death.</TE>
<TE>   No one answered the phone at Ferrell's house Thursday night and
her attorney, Richard Fitzpatrick, had an unlisted number.</TE>
<TE>   "She has asked for the trust to be distributed and everybody has
agreed to it," said Robert Goldman, an attorney for John Henry and
Claudia Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell sued to have the court decide whether her father's ashes
should be scattered in the ocean off Florida, as he declared in his
1996 will.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry and Claudia Williams have maintained that they signed a
handwritten pact with their father in November 2000 agreeing that
their bodies would be frozen.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams had his father's body moved to an Alcor Life
Extension Foundation facility in Arizona shortly after his death on
July 5 at age 83. Cryogenic supporters say bodies might one day be
thawed and brought back to life. Most experts say that is highly
unlikely.</TE>

<LD>It doesn't take much, but as an indicator for the Kentucky Derby, the
Hollywood Futurity is more of a litmus test than the Breeders' Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The winners of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile have won no Kentucky
Derbies; Real Quiet, who won the Hollywood Futurity in 1997, returned
the next year to win the Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Only three horses -- Spend A Buck, Alysheba and Sea Hero -- that
even ran in the Breeders' Cup have won the Derby. Including Real
Quiet, the most recent, five Futurity runners have won the Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Into this history Saturday will step six 2-year-olds who will try
to win Hollywood Park's 22nd running of the Futurity. In the field
are Kafwain and the Maryland shipper Toccet, both no match for
Vindication in the Breeders' Cup about two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Kafwain, Vindication's stablemate, ran second at Arlington Park,
where Toccet was ninth and his trainer, John Scanlan, blamed the poor
showing on drawing the outside post position in a 13-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   Toccet also drew the outside for the Futurity, but the field is
less than half as big and post positions should be no factor in the 1
1/16-mile race.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Breeders' Cup, Toccet returned to his home track, Laurel
Park, and won the Laurel Futurity by 6 1/4 lengths over a sloppy
track. Possible rain might enhance Toccet's chances at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owner-breeder Daniel Borislew's colt, after breaking his maiden by
10 lengths at Laurel in August, won easily in allowance company
before winning the Grade I Champagne at Belmont Park three weeks
before the Breeders' Cup. The Hollywood Futurity is also a Grade I,
but even a win Saturday would not wrest the Eclipse Award away from
Vindication, who is undefeated in four starts. Vindication is
expected to begin his 3-year-old campaign at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, who trains Vindication, has won the Futurity three of
the last five years -- starting with Real Quiet -- and will send out
Domestic Dispute besides Kafwain. With Victor Espinoza riding,
Kafwain drew the rail. Outside him in the gate, in order, will be
Domestic Dispute, with David Flores; Logician, Mike Smith; Coax Kid,
Pat Valenzuela; Roll Hennessy Roll, Alex Solis; and Toccet, Jorge
Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   As an unraced 2-year-old, Kafwain was bought at auction for
$720,000 in February by the Thoroughbred Corp., which also raced the
Baffert-trained Point Given, winner of the 2000 Futurity. Baffert's
other Futurity winner was Captain Steve in 1999. Kafwain has won the
Best Pal at Del Mar and the Norfolk at Santa Anita. He ran his first
three races at Hollywood, where he left the maiden ranks in June and
ran fourth in the Hollywood Juvenile in July.</TE>
<TE>   After the Laurel Futurity, Chavez said that he was optimistic
about Toccet's future as a Triple Crown contender. An Eastern rider
who seldom rides at California tracks, Chavez won the 2001 Kentucky
Derby with Monarchos. Chavez ranks fifth nationally this year with
purses totaling $13.3 million.</TE>

<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, chasing Wayne Lukas' one-year purse record,
withheld two of his 2-year-olds, Peace Rules and the stakes-green
Ghostzapper, from the Futurity. In Saturday's other stake at
Hollywood, the $150,000 Dahlia Handicap, two of the 11 entrants --
Tates Creek and Surya -- come from the Frankel barn. Tates Creek,
winner of eight of 12 starts, is the high weight with 122 pounds.
Frankel's horses have earned $17,481,421, or $360,930 less than
Lukas, in 1988.</TE>
