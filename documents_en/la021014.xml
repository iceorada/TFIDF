<LD>When you want to challenge your abdominal muscles and kick up the
intensity of your workout, try doing your crunches on a large
stability ball. It will train your abs to use strength, control and
balance with every crunch.</LD>
<LD>   1. Sit on top of a stability ball. Walk your feet forward away
from the ball and position your middle to lower back on the top of
the ball. Place your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Your
knees should be over your ankles and your thighs parallel to the
floor. Place your hands behind your head. Lie back so your upper body
is extended over the ball. Inhale.</LD>
<LD>   2. On the exhale, contract your abdominals by pulling your navel
toward your spine. Curl forward, bringing your chest and ribs toward
your hips. Hold the peak of the contraction for two beats and slowly
lower your upper body back to the ball. Repeat 16 to 20 times, rest
for 30 seconds and repeat for two more sets.</LD>

<HD>Good luck, Mr. Bratton --you're gonna need it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iwant to be among the first to simultaneously congratulate and
sympathize with Bill Bratton for his appointment as chief of police
in the City of Angles.</LD>
<LD>   He has won what a recent poll has shown to be one of the three
worst public jobs in L.A., along with those of archbishop and school
superintendent.</LD>
<LD>   I'd meant to begin my first day in this shady new location with an
upbeat piece, but the presence of a new boss for the LAPD has been on
my mind. Such a nice boy, such a terrible job.</LD>
<TE>   Chiefs come and go in this town like fleas on a dog, and we manage
to savage every one of them. Bratton is the fifth man to hold the
post in the 30 years I've been here, excluding the interim chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   The others have been Ed Davis, Daryl Gates, Willie Williams and
Bernard Parks. Gates lasted the longest, 14 years, which probably
explains why the department has been in such disarray for so long.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton seems like a good man and I hate to see him become just
another blue-plate special in a city where chiefs are eaten
regularly. If he's as smart as everyone says, he'll change his mind
about the job, leave town and open a hardware store in Wichita.</TE>
<TE>   Little Jimmy Hahn gave him a big public hug and is leading him
around like a beauty queen, but Bratton must know by now that a
politician's hug is like the first nibble of a shark on a diver's leg
to see if he's edible.</TE>
<TE>   The poll? It was the newly established ECB Poll, which stands for
Elmer, Cinelli and Barkley. I'm Elmer, a name hung on me because I
tend to slur. People think I'm saying I'm Elmer Teenez. Barkley is
our dog, who indicates approval or disapproval by the movement of his
tail. Cinelli, of course, is my wife and the CEO of ECB. The poll
began with a discussion of the new chief and my assertion that, even
if asked, I would never accept the job he just took.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you really think anyone would ask you to be a police chief?"
Cinelli said. "No offense, dear, but that would be like recruiting
Homer Simpson to become the president of Yale."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion escalated from whether I could run the Police
Department to why anyone in his right mind would want to run it. Once
Little Jimmy's hug is forgotten, no one is going to be truly happy
with what Bratton does, even if we said we'd wanted him to do it in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Being school superintendent is a lot worse," Cinelli said. "All
those parents and teachers and PTAs and unions after you like a pack
of dogs. Look what happened to the last guy, what's his name,
Zacarias. He began as God's gift to education and ended up flattened
like a tortilla. When they ask you to be chief and me to be
superintendent, let's both decline."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough time for Mahony</TE>
<TE>   The job currently held by the Pope of L.A. -- that would be
Cardinal Roger Mahony -- was the third position we discussed. Not
only has he found himself between God and a hard place for several
months due to a rash of priestly perversions, but now his beloved
cathedral, the Taj Mahony, has come into question. A guy can't even
build a monument to himself anymore without someone complaining.</TE>
<TE>   Priests are wondering out loud how come the archdiocese could
spend $190 million for that funny-looking cluster of buildings,
claiming it was fully funded, and then announce a budget cut of $4.3
million because there isn't enough money to go around. Mahony, who
can be slicker than wet grass on a downhill slope, replied that one
had nothing to do with the other. They were just caught up in a
budget emergency.</TE>
<TE>   A group of activists called the Catholic Workers Community
picketed during construction of the cathedral because they felt the
money spent on the building could best be used to house the homeless
and feed the hungry. Mahony argued that no charity would suffer due
to construction. But as it turns out, programs are going to have to
be shut down and people fired. A lot of priests are becoming
suspicious that maybe one did have something to do with the other.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that priests are speaking out against the guy whose ring
they've been kissing for many years indicates that the honeymoon may
be over for Mahony too. If the priests are after him and the
activists are after him and the D.A. is after him, can the nuns be
far behind?</TE>
<TE>   There may be worse jobs in town, but those are the final choices
of the ECB Poll. I wouldn't take any of them, although I have
wondered how it would feel to be in charge of something other than
the dog and three angelfish.</TE>

<HD>Jack Johnson stirs subtle waves of folk and reggae</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Johnson isn't afraid of hero worship, especially when it comes
to his own heroes. So his sold-out concert at the Greek Theatre on
Friday was often less about himself than a celebration of the
musicians who have influenced his disarming folk-based rock.</LD>
<LD>   There were songs by Bob Marley, Taj Mahal and Jimmy Buffett and
onstage appearances by contemporary heroes Ben Harper and G. Love &amp;
Special Sauce, joining Johnson for songs that were quietly emotional
and rich with personality.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson's appearance at such a major venue epitomized the sudden,
unlikely rise of this committed surfer and seaside folkie, who in the
last year has found airplay and a broad audience for the hits "Flake"
and "Bubble Toes."</LD>
<TE>   The sound was seemingly casual, but distinctive and direct, riding
subtle waves of folk and reggae.</TE>
<TE>   He stood with his two-man band at the very front of the stage,
reaching for intimacy as surfing images were projected on a white
curtain behind them. Johnson sang not about the motion of the ocean,
but self-examination and quiet observation.</TE>
<TE>   A stirring new song, "Times Like These," turned topical as Johnson
sang, "those for peace, those for war, a God bless these ones, but
not those ones" -- this time as he stood alone, picking his acoustic
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   The night ended with the appearance of Harper, who reprised his
explosive slide guitar on "Flake," slapping his instrument for
emphasis. Johnson watched from across the stage, shaking his head
with a smile, joining the crowd for some final moments of hero
worship.</TE>

<HD>Are these videos rated C for clean or compromised?</HD>
<DH>Directors rail against firms such as CleanFlick that excise
offensive language and scenes with sex or violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Mesa, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Mesa, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Marva Sonntag drives to a modest strip mall to browse the local
CleanFlicks video store, a place where the clock has been turned
back; practically nobody swears in movies here.</LD>
<LD>   They don't swear because the 400-plus titles on the shelves have
been shipped back to CleanFlicks' corporate headquarters in Utah and
clipped of profanity, sexual scenes and some violent episodes. Much
of the time it's a matter of removing the "damns." Other times, the
surgery is extensive. In CleanFlicks' version of "Saving Private
Ryan," men still die and scream during the invasion of Normandy, but
most of the suffering and blood have been eliminated, changing
director Steven Spielberg's nightmarish frankness to mere
unpleasantness.</LD>
<TE>   Sonntag, a mother of four who believes "most crimes start with
pornography," loves CleanFlicks, which opened in her neighborhood
nine months ago. She's practically giddy as she talks about finally
getting to know Tom Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "I have loved him forever but I'd only seen one of his movies,"
she says, explaining that her family stopped going to R-rated films,
then PG-13s because "PG-13 was halfway to R and it was offensive. Now
I'm really enjoying it. I didn't realize how good his movies were."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, this anecdote is briefly relayed to director Michael
Apted ("Enigma," "The World Is Not Enough"), who is horrified. The
British-born Apted is a party in the Directors Guild of America's
month-old lawsuit against CleanFlicks and a dozen other video-rental
and software companies that sanitize hit films. But the description
of Sonntag's gratitude pushes him to a new level of outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrifying implication of what you're saying is that any
small interested parties are entitled to change anything to suit
their own particular will. Where does that leave you? That leaves you
in anarchy and chaos," he says. "It's fascism to me."</TE>
<TE>   This is an exchange of fire in America's latest culture war,
headed for a showdown in federal court because each side holds a
different definition of sacrilege: Directors like Apted are consumed
by the need to protect the sanctity of their films. CleanFlicks
customers like Sonntag are consumed by the need to protect the
sanctity of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Differences over commerce, art and morality have dug an
ideological chasm that dwarfs the 385 miles between Mesa, a
fast-growing city of 425,000 just outside Phoenix, and Bel-Air, where
Apted has gathered in a hotel suite with two other leading directors,
Michael Mann ("The Insider," "Ali") and Jon Turteltaub ("Phenomenon,"
"Disney's 'The Kid' ") to talk to a Times reporter about the threat
of unlicensed editing.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that somebody else ... can arbitrarily take our works
apart and destroy them in any manner they want and represent it as
still being that film ... is a breach," Mann says in a resentful
staccato. "There's no polite word for it -- it's stealing. It's
stealing from the consumers ... from the copyright holders [the
studios] and it's certainly stealing from us. That's not the film
that I made."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the tip of a very dangerous iceberg" of digitizing, adds
Apted. "This would appear to be a benign issue -- making a family
version -- which could easily go a thousand other ways: making
pornographic versions of films, political versions of films, any way
you wanted to."</TE>
<TE>   The directors' outrage is lost on Richard Ray, a chiropractor and
father of seven who, on the day a reporter visited the Mesa
CleanFlicks, was returning an edited copy of "We Were Soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   "They may talk about artistry and all that other stuff, but when
it comes down to it, they made the movie and then some editor came
and cut it, and the reason they cut it was to make it a marketable
movie," Ray says. "They cut out scenes they thought may have been
great. And then it goes to the airlines. They OK that. It goes to TV,
they edit that. And they're making money all along the way and nobody
hears anything about their artistry being cut down."</TE>
<TE>   The directors respond that such editing is permitted only because
it is licensed by the studios. But this is a technicality that does
not engage most Mesa CleanFlicks customers. One by one on this
afternoon, they tick off the movies that had made them uncomfortable
-- for themselves or their children -- and drove them inside this
store: the bedroom moments in "Bridget Jones's Diary," the sex scene
in "Dances With Wolves," the language in "My Cousin Vinny" and "Good
Will Hunting." The store's manager, Karen Huggans, a mother of six
children who invested in the business as a way to raise the family's
income, still remembers the cursing in "White Men Can't Jump," a
comedy she had looked forward to seeing. "The next day I was speaking
to a youth group of kids about doing good things and I could still
hear those words ringing in my head."</TE>
<TE>   To Hollywood's creative community, the movement is at once hugely
ominous and a minuscule blip. About 550 families have bought
memberships at Huggans' dealership. There are 75 other CleanFlicks
stores in 14 states, half in Utah (none yet in California or New
York). In addition, there are several other, smaller chains offering
edited videos. There are also software companies selling programs
that tell your computer or DVD to eliminate certain words or scenes
from hundreds of movies.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of these enterprises have sprung up in the past two
years, triggering legal threats from the Directors Guild. In August,
a CleanFlicks operator in Colorado preemptively sued the DGA and 16
high-profile members, asking for a court's endorsement of
CleanFlicks' practices. The DGA responded last month with a
countersuit against CleanFlicks' corporate office and 12 other
companies, asking the court to effectively shut them down. The DGA
contends the unlicensed video and software editing violates federal
copyright law. CleanFlicks contends that each store operates as a
co-op, meaning members "own" all the videos, which makes the editing
as legal as buying a book and tearing out a page at home.</TE>
<TE>   Experts sometimes offer conflicting impressions. Michael Marsden,
a professor at Eastern Kentucky University who edits a journal on
film and television, decries edited videos as "almost vigilantism."
Jeremy Hunsinger, who directs a center for "digital discourse" at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, describes it as merely the latest
example of the way digitizing dilutes reality -- an extension, for
example, of the way TV superimposes ads on stadium fences or the
yellow first-down line on football fields. Ernest Miller, a fellow of
the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, says directors
have overreached by trying to outlaw home software that masks content
of a DVD: "The issue is whether Hollywood can dictate how a viewer
experiences a movie in the privacy of his or her own home."</TE>
<TE>   You can hear a dialogue in the two sides' exhortations, but it
promises no compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Look, says director Turteltaub, you can't treat the work we spend
years on as though it were a cookie-cutter project. We put our
emotions and anxiety into our films. People like Marva Sonntag are
fooling themselves if they think they're watching a Tom Cruise movie.
They're simply watching clips from a Tom Cruise movie. Look, says
another CleanFlicks customer, Keena Baker, "there are some really
good stories out there that don't need the stuff they put in." You
rent the edited "Thomas Crown Affair" and you don't miss the sex
scene they clipped out.</TE>
<TE>   Look, says Apted, you do miss these things. Look at what happened
when they snipped the sex scene out of "Shakespeare in Love" -- they
obliterated the crucial link between art and life.</TE>
<TE>   Look, says another CleanFlicks customer, Lisa Lengstorf, "if
that's what it takes to make the story good, then whoever made the
movie didn't do a very good job of writing the story."</TE>
<TE>   Look, says Mann, you're crossing a line. "If we were manufacturing
a game we'd call it a game. But this isn't a game, it's a motion
picture, and it has a narrative." The parts of a film "bear complex
relationships that, in architecture, without that kind of
engineering, the building falls down.... The experience is degraded."</TE>
<TE>   Look, says another CleanFlicks customer, grandfather Lynn
Mullenaux, what's degrading is having to watch a film with even a
single lewd moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We can say, 'Oh, it was a great movie and there was only one
scene where we saw her naked from the top up, and I closed my eyes.
Or I put my hands over my kid's eyes. But aren't we living a double
standard when we do that? If I allow the violence and the filth and
the sex to enter into my home, what am I teaching my grandchildren?"</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the customers who come into the Mesa store, Mullenaux
is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which
plays a key role in this dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, the church, which has 5 million American members,
including 70% of Utah's population, has counseled Mormons to avoid
R-rated movies. CleanFlicks' creator, Ray Lines, a church member with
a video background, stumbled into the business when his friends began
asking him to edit a nude scene out of their copies of "Titanic." He
opened his first stores in 2000. CleanFlicks charges new dealers a
$5,000 fee plus $14,000 for an initial inventory of videos.</TE>
<TE>   Many CleanFlicks customers, and some conservative commentators,
characterize the chain as the first shot in a rebellion against
Hollywood's casual use of sex and profanity. The DGA dismisses
CleanFlicks and other companies as an extremist fringe movement
concerned more with profits than principles. Advocates of sanitized
videos say the marketplace supports them -- that while two-thirds of
U.S. films last year were rated R, all but two of the top 10 grossers
were PG-13 or milder. These supporters say they want nothing more
than to rent the same kind of edited movies that appear on TV
networks and airplanes. Their target in that demand is not the
directors but the studios, which -- aware that a strong stand either
way could offend potential consumers -- have yet to join the
litigation, leaving the directors to lead the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the two sides reach a settlement, the court will have to
decide whether the editing companies are illegally making
"derivative" works, or whether the changes are so minor that they
comply with a "fair use" exemption. Another key question is whether
software that allows a viewer to block content on an unedited DVD
violates a director's "artistic rights," as the DGA claims, or is as
harmless as hitting the fast-forward button on your remote.</TE>
<TE>   Directors say they realize their absolutism may be a hard sell in
a culture where, as Turteltaub says, "people have the right to have
things the way they want it.... I don't think it's surprising we
don't have a lot of money for art in our schools when we have a
society that feels when a piece of art is done, it's OK to cross
things out that you personally don't like or edit it yourself or
maybe put a black line through something that looks offensive to your
group."</TE>
<TE>   Hours before that reflection, 385 miles away from Bel-Air, a less
thoughtful but similarly minded person takes a lipstick tube and
writes a rhetorical question on the glass window of Karen Huggans'
store: "Would you defile Van Gogh?"</TE>

<CX>   Film director -- In some editions of Monday's Calendar, the
front-page photo accompanying a story about the editing of films
identified the subject as director Michael Apted. The photo was of
film director Michael Mann. The photo credit was also missing on that
picture and two others on E7 of Apted and director John Turtletaub;
all three were taken by Times photographer Lawrence K. Ho.</CX>

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y. / GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>Another reason not to get stuck on an elevator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is almost no sacred place left in the vertical city. The
elevator commute to the office used to offer precious seconds of
silence, a chance to reflect on your (black) shoes. Or flirt on the
fly.</LD>
<LD>   But not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the ride up is another chance to be chased by a news crawl, a
jumpy stock market, the weather and sports. Giving new meaning to
"captive audience," a Massachusetts company is determined to implant
tiny video screens in every upscale office building in Manhattan and
beyond and provide relentless headlines and ads for the Hummer or
Dunkin' Donuts. Mercifully, there is no sound. This "24-hour elevator
media network" is particularly suited to New York, where the elevator
has ruled since its invention here 150 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   In a city of cubes -- offices like veal pens, apartments where
space is rarely wasted on a curve -- the elevator was the one box
where media had no sway. And while not every New Yorker has a car,
everyone has an elevator. Just like the suburban car in the
horizontal world, vertical-ites take theirs to get milk, to go to
work, to get the kids to the park for soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Before they showed up at office towers with big saws and little
screens, the founders of the Captivate Network in Westford, Mass.,
studied workers in fancy skyscrapers and found that not only did they
have high incomes but they also spent six minutes a day alone in an
elevator. That's 30 minutes a week, 26 hours a year -- longer than
some New York romances. Nature abhors a vacuum and so do marketers.
So, they set out to capture people like Scott Strine, a project
manager for Pfizer, who on a sunny afternoon last week took 12
elevator rides in three hours shuttling between Pfizer offices in
midtown Manhattan. Strine is addicted to the little screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I need it," he admitted. "Instead of looking at the ceiling or
wondering if I'm annoying the guy next to me, I read the news." This
is not a young man who craves quiet time, judging from the
BlackBerry, cell phone, laptop and PalmPilot he carries on his
person. "When I'm sleeping," he said, "I'm quiet."</TE>
<TE>   The video screen is even eroding the act-as-if-you're-invisible
elevator culture. In an East 42nd Street elevator recently, a
headline flashed that the Mets had canned their controversial
manager, Bobby Valentine. Irene Garson, on her way for a smoke on the
sidewalk, screamed: "I can't believe it." Suddenly, everyone was
sharing emotions. It was like an "Oprah" show--in a closet. "He's a
no-good bum," a young guy in a Yankees hat offered up to Garson, 64,
who erupted in a smoky laugh.</TE>
<TE>   This is just the kind of blather that annoys Marc Schuman, 40, who
works in a Park Avenue skyscraper with a Captivate screen in every
elevator. It also annoys him that Americans get informed in
oversimplified bits. ("Iraqi radar missile sites hit" or "FBI issuing
'graphic aid.' ") And it annoys him, on the ride back from a midday
cup of coffee, to hit the up arrow and see the NASDAQ going down. "Do
I need to know right away when the Dow drops 150 points?" asked
Schuman, who works in financial services. "Maybe when I'm in the
bathroom I have the opportunity to think about something else?"</TE>
<TE>   Opportunity is the operative word here. Screens and advertising
flags blanket the city. Not just in elevators but on every imaginable
piece of real estate -- up and down the sides of buildings in Times
Square, on small screens atop taxis, in supermarkets, banks and, yes,
Mr. Schuman, in restaurant bathrooms. The old-fashioned lampposts
that were installed recently around Manhattan's ultimate sanctuary,
Central Park, have been sullied with banners that advertise airlines
and street fairs.</TE>
<TE>   But while the city is awash in news that fits into a sentence on
an elevator monitor, most surveys show that people remain uninformed,
particularly about world events. In a nation with attention deficit
disorder, this is a city where one crawl is never enough. So, how do
you captivate without alienating an already overstimulated
population?</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my editors, 'Give people the 'Oh, wow factor,' " said Mike
DiFranza, the president of Captivate. Which accounts for the "word of
the day" feature. Thursday it was "ineffable," defined as
"indescribable" and illustrated thus: "The chef adored the ineffable
aroma of the Italian truffle." DiFranza does not see this bite or his
"power poll" questions -- Would you be more productive with a midday
nap? -- as an intrusion into the john-sized space of an elevator.
(According to e-mailed responses to the nap question, 76% said yes
and 9% said they already nap at their desk.)</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental premise of our business is that elevator behavior
is fairly dysfunctional, and if you get four people in an elevator,
they'll try not to make eye contact," DiFranza said. (Only in the
21st century would an opportunity for a pensive moment be considered
dysfunctional.) Awhile back, elevator companies tried installing
highly polished doors to enable people to pass the time examining
themselves. But the mirror effect created even more anxiety when
people had to watch each other trying not to watch each other.</TE>
<TE>   DiFranza dreamed up putting flat screens in elevators after he was
stuck in one a minute too long for his type A personality. "I can't
stand waiting in a box so I can get to my next box and then my
meeting," he said. Now, Captivate, although not the only company in
the business, is bringing its service to 1,100 of the 1,700 best
office towers in North America, including the former Arco building in
downtown Los Angeles and the Sears Tower in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the decision not to have audio and not to have full-page
ads because we thought it would alienate viewers," added DiFranza.
"If people want to zone, meditate or talk to their other self, they
can still do that." Thanks, pal.</TE>
<TE>   Private time, going down.</TE>

<HD>What is art worth in an age of indifference?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An old, terminally sick man, lying in bed, rifles through a chaotic
accumulation of paper -- notes, clippings, books, surveys, deeds,
insurance, contracts -- in the hope of constructing a coherent case
for the value of art in a world that seems hostile or indifferent to
it. This is the premise of William Gaddis' last novel, "Agape Agape."</LD>
<LD>   The first "agape" (three syllables: a-gah-pay) alludes to the
Christian concept of immeasurable love, divine and human: the love of
creator and creation and, by extension, the gift of art. The second
"agape" (two syllables: a-gape) summons up a void: a gap, a gaping
hole, a vacancy or, as Gaddis' raving but never irrational
protagonist at one point describes it: "The ultimate collective, the
herd numbed and silenced agape at blood sex and guns blowing each
other to pieces only participation you get's maybe kids who see it
come to school next morning and mow down their classmates.... "</LD>
<TE>   Gaddis, who died in December 1998 at age 76, wrote four previous
novels over the course of a career that spanned five decades. His
first, "The Recognitions" (1955), was an intricate, allusive,
immensely ambitious work about a painter whose gift for re-creating
the styles of the great masters involves him in a world of forgery
and fraud. Too complex a work to win quick success, it slowly gained
a kind of cult status, though Gaddis had to turn his pen to corporate
and technical writing to make his living.</TE>
<TE>   Published 20 years later, his second novel, "JR" (which won the
National Book Award), brilliantly satirized the shortsighted,
profit-crazed world of big business via the character of an
11-year-old boy whose very lack of an "adult" sense of responsibility
enables him to build a financial empire. A decade later, in
"Carpenter's Gothic," Gaddis trained his satiric talents on the media
and religious fundamentalism. And with "A Frolic of His Own" (1994),
which won him his second National Book Award, Gaddis anatomized the
labyrinths of the culture of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Technology was another of Gaddis' recurrent concerns, and it was a
subject to which he had devoted a great deal of study and thought.
Although he was too sophisticated and realistic to take up the stance
of a latter-day Luddite wishing it all away, Gaddis was disturbed by
the ramifications of mechanization, standardization, cybernetics.
Like the critic Walter Benjamin, he saw technology as a force tending
to undermine the value of artistic endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   For Gaddis, the issue was crystallized in the history of the
player piano. It is the subject that consumes the Gaddis-like hero of
"Agape Agape." And Gaddis' own research notes and essays on the rise
and fall of this early form of automated music can be found--among
other essays, speeches and occasional writings--in "The Rush for
Second Place."</TE>
<TE>   This essay collection, as its editor, Joseph Tabbi, warns us, is
scrappy and uneven: Gaddis, perfectionist that he was, would probably
not have wished to publish some of the patchier pieces. But in two of
the essays, Gaddis sets out some of his key ideas on the relationship
of the state, religion and the artist: "We who struggle to create
fictions ... must regard the state with awe, for the state itself
must be the grandest fiction to be concocted by man, barring only
one." The fiction even grander than the state, in Gaddis' opinion, is
the "realm of ... divine revelations," religion.</TE>
<TE>   Both fiction and religion, he contends, depend upon a willing
suspension of disbelief: "In other words, we are all in the same line
of business: that of concocting, arranging, and peddling fictions to
get us safely through the night." While Gaddis the essayist tends to
take things in stride, coolly analyzing a situation, distancing
himself through irony, Gaddis' novelistic alter ego in "Agape Agape"
is much more agitated: " ... that's what my work is about, the
collapse of everything, of meaning, of language, of values, of art,
disorder and dislocation wherever you look, entropy drowning
everything in sight, entertainment and technology and every four year
old with a computer, everybody his own artist...."</TE>
<TE>   In an age of mass marketing, art degenerates into trivial
entertainment, and the public is more interested in the
artist-as-celebrity than in the art he or she creates. The speaker
detects a connection between the increasing complexity of machines
and the increasing inanity and coarseness of public taste. (His
outcry reminds one of Jeanette Winterson's lament: "We value
sensitive machines. We don't value sensitive human beings.")</TE>
<TE>   The themes that obsess the novel's hero go round and round his
head in a kind of discordant symphony: Plato's plan to banish poets
as "dangerous" to the state. Freud's elevation of the pleasure
principle. Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian insistence on viewing
pleasure as a question of quantity rather than quality. Flaubert's
contempt for the democratic "herd." Tolstoy's self-righteous,
self-punishing repudiation of art in the name of that same "herd."
The speaker's fugues of interconnected thought are constantly
interrupted as he struggles with the depredations of his ailing body
and the disorganized state of his papers.</TE>
<TE>   But although desperate, the dying man does not despair of the
power of art. Addressing Pozdnyshev, the antihero of Tolstoy's "The
Kreutzer Sonata" who kills his wife and is used by Tolstoy to make
the case against marriage and sexual love, Gaddis' hero has this to
say: " ... above all the catharsis of abandoned music and dance ...
should have looked into that yourself Pozdnyshev, should have tried
it. Should have learned the tango Pozdnyshev, the most elegant,
merciless, disciplined abandon never would have killed her, learned
the tango you never would have killed her and if I had I wouldn't be
here now...." Gaddis' final novel is perhaps his most poignant.</TE>

<LD>Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera were wildly indulgent bohemians. At the
center of the cultural scene in post-revolution Mexico, their soirees
were feasts of native food and drink.</LD>
<LD>   According to all accounts, Kahlo could put away the booze, as
depicted in the coming feature film "Frida."</LD>
<LD>   In once scene, Kahlo ends a macho drinking match between Rivera
and a rival by guzzling a nearly full bottle of tequila.</LD>
<TE>   Surely the reception following tonight's premiere of "Frida" at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art would be inspired by Frida and
Diego's appetites. Miramax, the studio behind the film, can throw a
fine fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   So an invitation arrives, revealing that the event's sponsors
include ... Coors Light! What, no Patron tequila? Not even, Bohemia
cerveza?</TE>
<TE>   Surely, Frida wouldn't approve of an American beer being served at
a party thrown in honor of her biopic. Consider it another adventure
in what she referred to as "Gringolandia."</TE>

<HD>SAG trying to restart talks with agents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newly elected board of the Screen Actors Guild, seeking to open
lines of communication after a three-year battle that ended in defeat
for the nation's talent agencies, on Sunday said it would try to
reopen its dialogue with agents over whether to ease restrictions
governing their business practices.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a catch. SAG, which represents 98,000 actors, will try
to jump-start the talks even though its membership already has said
no to the agent's make-or-break issue: giving agents more leeway to
receive investments from and invest in companies that also produce.</LD>
<LD>   That is not likely to sit well with the Assn. of Talent Agents or
its East Coast branch, the National Assn. of Talent Representatives,
which have tried and failed three times in the past three years to
come to a resolution. It is unclear whether they will even sit at the
table with the guild yet again.</LD>
<TE>   The Assn. of Talent Agents will meet to discuss SAG's offer on
Tuesday. "ATA is extremely disappointed," said Karen Stuart, the
group's executive director. "SAG has known now for years that this is
an element that needs to be bargained. I am concerned that there were
no discussions or meetings with the ATA prior to this board meeting.
Most disturbing is that they've argued that they need to fix their
own voting system, and yet now they draft a resolution based on a
vote that came through a process that they themselves are
questioning. What they've done is completely counterintuitive."</TE>
<TE>   Under the current system, SAG has no restrictions on who votes on
their referendums. Their voting membership includes working and
non-working actors, and SAG is considering a change in the voting
rules.</TE>
<TE>   SAG and the agents have been working without a franchise agreement
since April, when the guild's membership voted against a referendum
that would have, among other things, changed the financial rules
restricting agents. The defeat of the referendum marked the first
time since "Gone With the Wind" was in theaters that agents had not
worked under an agreement with SAG.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has split the union, with some high-profile members,
such as Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, supporting change, and
others, such as Jason Alexander and Rob Schneider, opposing it.
Proponents say agents need to be able to compete in a changing
economic environment; opponents argue that if their talent agencies
are linked financially with companies that also produce, the talent
representatives would effectively become employers.</TE>
<TE>   There was even a difference in opinion among SAG's former
presidents. Patty Duke and Richard Masur threw their support behind
the referendum, while Charlton Heston and William Daniels were
against it. The current president, Melissa Gilbert, supported the
change.</TE>
<TE>   However, in practice, talent agencies have been working for
corporate America for years, ever since former CAA power-broker
Michael Ovitz entered into a consultancy agreement with Coca-Cola Co.
in 1991. Today, many talent agencies represent actors and
corporations, including beverage companies, aerospace firms and
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, no agency has entered into any major financial
equity agreement with outside production entities, although many have
explored it.</TE>
<TE>   SAG acknowledged that "the prior referendum defeat reflects member
opposition to changes to financial interest rules" but said it is
setting up a national executive negotiating committee to try to
reopen talks.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution was unanimously passed Sunday by the board in a
meeting at the Universal Sheraton in Universal City. The board met
for three days. On Friday, SAG national executive director and CEO
Bob Pisano delivered a "state of the guild" speech.</TE>

<LD>Vladimir Jurowski, the 30-year-old music director of Glyndebourne
Opera, made an auspicious debut conducting the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in the first of the season's six Friday afternoon
concerts, in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Moscow, Jurowski conducted a Russian program with
great brilliance but a modest podium manner, right down to his
attire: no coat, just a black shirt and slacks for this debut.</LD>
<LD>   The climax of Jurowski's two-work program was a highly detailed,
intensely emotional revival of Tchaikovsky's "Manfred" Symphony, a
work that in some hands sprawls and loses focus. Not in Jurowski's.
His musical thinking, which he communicates effortlessly, embraces
the entire work -- its changing moods, its excesses and the depths of
the composer's, and the hero's, despair.</LD>
<TE>   The orchestra, which opened the 2002-2003 season Oct. 3,
demonstrated no second-week slump and played with a panache and a
vigor not always easy to achieve at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, this conductor's energy and musicality inspire his
colleagues. They also inspired the usually undemonstrative,
hard-to-impress Friday afternoon audience, which rose at the end. The
first half of the program also kept the listener wide awake and in a
mood to savor. Stravinsky's irresistible divertimento -- actually a
set of fragments -- from the ballet "The Fairy's Kiss" demands an
arsenal of instrumental colors, very often at the quiet end of the
dynamic spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   All the players responded to Jurowski's realization of the
composer's nuances as well as his high points. Contributing strongly
to the steady parade of charming solos were hornist William Lane, new
principal cellist Peter Stumpf and clarinetist Lorin Levee.</TE>

<HD>It is a laughing matter: Series picks funny people's brains</HD>
<DH>Bravo's new interview show explores the careers of those
connected with the Second City comedy laboratory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donald Liebenson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Bravo network's new series "Second City Presents ... With
Bill Zehme," comedy has its own "Inside the Actors Studio." The host,
a much taller, clean-shaven, more ebullient version of James Lipton,
devotes each one-hour episode to one comedian or comic actor.
Eschewing Lipton's signature blue note cards, Zehme consults his "Big
Book of Comedy" to chart that performer's career, which is
illuminated by conversation and illustrated with representative film
clips.</LD>
<LD>   First-guest honors on tonight's premiere episode go to Jim
Belushi, who followed his brother John to the Second City stage.
Future guests will include other Second City notables, Martin Short
and Joan Rivers, as well as performers with a Kevin Bacon-esque
degrees-of-separation relationship with the troupe. For example,
Tracey Ullman, the subject of the second episode, recruited Second
City veteran Dan Castellaneta for her sketch series.</LD>
<TE>   "Inside the Actors Studio" was the obvious template for this
series, according to producer John Davies, a native Chicagoan whose
credits include NBC's "The Rerun Show" as well as such network
specials as "A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman." Mounting a series of
interviews with comedians has long been a pet project. "I was
watching 'Actors Studio,' " he said in a phone interview, "and I
thought that Second City has had many more famous graduates who've
had just as big an impact on American pop culture."</TE>
<TE>   Time magazine hailed Second City as "a temple of satire."</TE>
<TE>   The company, as well as its predecessors--Playwrights Theatre
Club, which debuted in 1953, and the Compass Players--spawned a who's
who of comedy, among them: Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Shelley Berman,
John Candy, Chris Farley, Joe Flaherty, Barbara Harris, Bonnie Hunt,
Robert Klein, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Elaine May, Bill and Brian
Doyle Murray, Mike Myers, Mike Nichols, Catherine O'Hara, Gilda
Radner, Harold Ramis, Avery Schreiber and Fred Willard.</TE>
<TE>   The association with Second City (in conjunction with Brad Grey
Television) gives the series "immediate credibility," Davies said.
"Bravo got [the concept] instantly. They treat comedy and drama
equally seriously."</TE>
<TE>   "We're all about exploring the arts, and this series upholds that
tradition," said Bravo's Frances Berwick, senior vice president of
programming. "What we were looking for and what we absolutely found
is a lively interaction where you definitely get a lot about the
craft of comedy from the artist's perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Zehme sets the stage for each episode by relating what he "knows
to be true" about a particular artist. Here is what is known to be
true about Zehme. He is just shy of 6 1/2 feet tall. He towers as
well as a show business Boswell. For a recent Esquire piece marking
the 10th anniversary of Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" exit, Zehme
interviewed the reclusive Carson, the celebrity journalism "get" of
the new millennium.</TE>
<TE>   From Woody Allen and Albert Brooks to Jay Leno and David
Letterman, some of Zehme's most passionate writing has been about
comedians. "You want to crawl under the veneer and figure out why
they are funny," Zehme said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it comes from a small dark place, and often a gigantic
dark place. They give you a rich palette with which to work as a
writer."</TE>
<TE>   A collection of his magazine profiles, "Intimate Strangers: Comic
Profiles and Indiscretions of the Very Famous" (Delta), will be
published in December. He is the author of the bestseller "The Way
You Wear Your Hat: Frank Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin'," as well
as the Andy Kaufman bio "Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of
Andy Kaufman." He also collaborated on two Regis Philbin memoirs and
Jay Leno's "Leading With My Chin."</TE>
<TE>   Zehme is, for the most part, a television neophyte. He made the
talk show rounds as the go-to guy in the wake of Sinatra's death. He
filled in for Greg Kinnear for a couple of episodes of NBC's "Later."
He also suffered the indignities of being Charles Grodin's sidekick
for a night as research for an Esquire piece about second bananas.</TE>
<TE>   But that's less important, Davies maintains, than what Zehme
brings to the show as a lifelong student of comedy. "Bill and I have
an appreciation for how tough comedy is, how serious the work is, how
much effort [artists] put into it, and how much talent you've got to
have to be funny," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Second City Presents ... ," Zehme said, exists in part to further
challenge this ancient bias. "There is no greater act in
entertainment than the production of a laugh," he said. "To me, it's
noble."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Second City Presents" will be shown at 9 p.m. and midnight
Mondays, 6 p.m. Tuesdays, 4 a.m. and noon Saturdays on Bravo.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach delivers on promises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beginning his second season at the helm of the Long Beach Symphony,
music director Enrique Arturo Diemecke calls the season "Music With
Passion." On that promise, he and the orchestra delivered completely
at the opening event Saturday night in the Terrace Theater at the
Long Beach Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Rachmaninoff's rousing, exposing Second Symphony proved the
climax, in a brilliant but never overstated performance, elegantly
Romantic, effortlessly balanced.</LD>
<LD>   The string section has seldom sounded so full, lush and
controlled. Conductor Diemecke coaxed vibrant singing from these
sometimes restrained players; they played full-out and with a
resplendent legato. The winds crowned the performance with mellow but
glorious fortes and handsome solo contributions.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the program also met the orchestra's higher standard,
although the opening work, Walton's coronation march, "Crown
Imperial," emerged more unleashed than dignified. Diemecke's own
30-minute, Don Quixote-inspired tone poem "Camino y Vision" (The Way
and the Vision) -- a colorful reimagining of the Don Quixote legend,
with the hero coming to land in Diemecke's hometown, Guanajuato,
Mexico -- was the centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Being heard in its West Coast premiere, the eclectic, colorful
work quotes Quixote-inspired pieces by Telemann and Richard Strauss,
among others. And it adds at one place a rhythm band, here a
16-member group of youngsters called Recycled Rhythm, along with the
resourceful cello soloist, principal cello Cecilia Tsan.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a most entertaining and accessible piece that gave
great pleasure to the opening-night audience.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Symphony's opener gives quirky choices their due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The opening concert of a 75th anniversary season would seem to call
for a portentous blockbuster piece.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Pasadena Symphony kept the pomp mostly away Saturday
night, fittingly zeroing in on one of its strengths under maestro
Jorge Mester -- quirky, interesting programming of things that you
don't hear in live performance very often.</LD>
<LD>   For openers, there was Alfredo Casella's wonderful 1942
divertimento "Paganiniana," a vigorous virtuoso piece written during
a difficult time yet full of mischievous wit (which Mester brought
out in full), hints of Hindemith and Respighi, and bustling revelry
that was originally meant for the Vienna Philharmonic's centenary.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Sinfonia Concertante for Four Violins by
the 19th century German composer Louis Maurer came off as merely a
pleasantly innocuous piece, while providing many opportunities for
violinists Karen Gomyo, Ju-Young Baek, Sarah Kapustin and Steven
Moeckel to converse, pair up and gang up on one another in coy,
sometimes humorous fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Mester reminded us what a wickedly clever, dramatic tone poem
Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" really is, bringing out a lot of
glittering, hidden detail in a piece that has been, in effect, Mickey
Moused into concert hall oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Elgar's "Enigma" Variations was the closest thing to a live
repertoire staple on the bill. Yet for all of Mester's
rambunctiousness, the quietly intense opening to the "Nimrod"
passage, and superb solo work from the first desks, the variations
didn't fuse into a whole entity this time.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the pipe-organ-reinforced conclusion to "Enigma," the
sole display of anniversary pomp came when the Pasadena High School
Marching Band, in full regalia, played "Happy Birthday" from the
aisles of the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.</TE>

<HD>Juanes wins a show of hands</HD>
<DH>Fans were all over the Colombian, whose alt-Latin sound had
extra muscle in an Anaheim show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last few years, Los Angeles has witnessed a pop-culture
first -- the creation of a Latin-music superstar in its own backyard.
He goes only by Juanes, a childhood nickname that once seemed odd but
now symbolizes the long-awaited success of alt-Latino, the most
invigorating trend in Latin pop music today.</LD>
<LD>   He originally came here from his native Colombia as a skinny,
shaggy singer-songwriter and virtual unknown looking for his start.
He had a batch of brilliant songs in his head and nothing but dreams
in his pockets.</LD>
<LD>   Juanes returned in triumph Friday night with a rousing performance
before an adoring crowd at Anaheim's House of Blues, the artist so
beloved now for his soulful music that young women at the edge of the
stage reached to caress his calves as if he were some living god.</LD>
<TE>   Besides demonstrating his newfound popularity, Juanes proved
during the show that his music is even more powerful and stirring in
concert. The artist's Anaheim stop is part of his first U.S. tour as
headliner, which also includes a sold-out show Wednesday at the Mayan
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Juanes first became known outside his native country last year
when his debut album, the chilling and riveting "Fijate Bien,"
garnered seven Latin Grammy nominations and won three, including best
new artist.</TE>
<TE>   The awards significantly raised expectations for his fledgling
solo career, nurtured here by producer Gustavo Santaolalla.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics, including this one, felt let down by Juanes'
follow-up album, this year's far more tame and pop-oriented "Un Dia
Normal."</TE>
<TE>   But the public embraced it, especially the uplifting hit "A Dios
le Pido" (I Ask God), a prayer-like plea for family and homeland.</TE>
<TE>   The power of that song was vividly demonstrated at the close of
Friday's show. From its opening twangy guitar lines, the club burst
into joyful song and dance, the crowd throbbing with rhythms and
pulsing with the song's irresistible spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Juanes was backed by a tight, six-piece band, all fellow
Colombians. Only two, however, play on the new album, and only on
some tracks. Maybe that's what the work was missing, the passion of
compatriots playing together. On stage, they put blood and muscle
into tracks that sound anemic on record.</TE>
<TE>   Juanes wears his new stardom with grace. Better groomed and better
fed, he let himself be idolized, at one point reclining on stage so
the women could massage his hair and face. They almost didn't let him
get up. At another point, he was handed a cell phone and briefly
serenaded a lucky listener on the other end.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, he graciously accepted Colombian flags from fans. But
instead of unfurling them in a facile play to patriotism, he
respectfully set them aside, still folded. A classy move, befitting a
star of international stature. And unlike his crass and intrusive
promotional deal with Bud Light, on display throughout the club.
What's with these beer companies glomming onto Latino artists these
days?</TE>
<TE>   Superstardom has its material temptations, no doubt. The test for
Juanes will be to keep his music free from the excessive demands of
commercialism.</TE>
<TE>   So far, judging from his thrilling performance, he remains true to
his roots and his heart.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The musical relationship between Stan Kenton and Pete Rugolo
paralleled, to some extent, the linkage of Duke Ellington and Billy
Strayhorn. In both cases, an older, more established bandleader
found, and formed an important partnership with, a younger composer
who shared a similar musical view.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, the musical results of the Kenton-Rugolo connection
were considerably different from the music that flowed from
Ellington-Strayhorn. But the parallel remains -- two unique
relationships, each of which had a significant effect on the jazz
world.</LD>
<LD>   The depth of the Kenton-Rugolo rapport was on full display Friday
at the Crystal Ballroom of the Beverly Hills Hotel in "Rugolomania,"
a celebration of the 84-year-old composer-arranger's life and music.
The first of two evening concerts centered on Rugolo's music for his
own ensembles and recording sessions. The second focused on his work
for the Kenton aggregation.</LD>
<TE>   Most fascinating about the sequence of material -- written for
many different settings, and performed by an all-star ensemble
including several veterans of Rugolo's Kenton years -- was the
constancy of style. It was particularly interesting to note how that
connection was manifest in Rugolo's activities beyond the Kenton
orbit -- for films, television and his own bands.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening concert of material from that area, an
orchestration of the standard "Poinciana," for example, was assembled
in the style of "Bolero." Or, at least, as one imagines Kenton might
have done Ravel -- with swooping trombones and screaming brass and
percussion climaxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," arranged to feature the woodwinds, was
reminiscent of Kenton's saxophones-only work, "Opus in Pastels." And
a Rugolo rendering of "Nancy With the Laughing Face" similarly
embraced thick, harmonically dense combinations of saxophones and
trombones.</TE>
<TE>   When Rugolo, who conducted both concerts, got around to the works
written for the Kenton orchestra, the almost symbiotic musical
connection between the two -- as with Ellington-Strayhorn -- was
immediately apparent. Most showcased the brass-heavy, chromatically
shifting harmonies characteristic of the style Kenton referred to as
"progressive" jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Two vocal numbers, sung with appropriate similarities to the
best-known Kenton vocalist, June Christy, were offered by singer
Stephanie Nakasian.</TE>
<TE>   And many fine soloists -- especially trumpeters Steve Huffsteter
and Pete Candoli, trombonist Andy Martin and saxophonist Tom Peterson
-- were blended into the arrangements, adding the first-rate
improvisational coloration that also played an integral part of the
Kenton-Rugolo experience.</TE>

<LD>Television stereotypes everyone and everything. So why should it be
different for disabilities?</LD>
<LD>   Amputees have gotten a bad rap; for example, witness the notorious
one-armed slayer of Dr. Richard Kimble's wife on "The Fugitive." And
just as ultra-sensory perception or "smellavision" defined blind
characters, bitterness for years was the prevalent distortion
attached to those in wheelchairs.</LD>
<LD>   It went this way: You were injured, and miserable about it, until
jolted from your stupor by a wise (and, of course, able-bodied) rehab
mentor, who motivated you to get on with your life.</LD>
<TE>   TV is nothing if not cyclical, however, and may be in a
renaissance when it comes to portrayals of disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of progress in the mid-'80s, but then there was
some backsliding," says Tari Susan Hartman, an L.A. marketing and
media consultant who was founding executive director of the Media
Access Office, a casting clearinghouse for actors with disabilities.
"Now we're seeing a resurgence in grass-roots communities demanding
more authentic and savvy portrayals, and more performances by people
with disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   That includes increased visibility in commercials for kids with
Down syndrome -- a legacy of Chris Burke earlier gaining fame on
ABC's "Life Goes On" -- and prominence in series for others.</TE>
<TE>   Such as:</TE>
<TE>   Robert David Hall, who landed the role of "CSI" coroner Dr. David
Robbins on CBS, despite losing both legs and suffering severe burns
in a 1978 car accident.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl (Chill) Mitchell, now playing the bowling alley manager in
NBC's "Ed" a year after a motorcycle accident paralyzed him from the
mid-chest down.</TE>
<TE>   Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, as a pollster in NBC's "The West
Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Allison Cameron Gray, who has cerebral palsy, playing a character
like herself in an episode of "Family Law."</TE>
<TE>   Tony-winning deaf actress Phyllis Frelich appearing in a "Boston
Public" episode that Fox says will air Nov. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Earning especially high praise from activists, though, is "Anna's
Dream," a new movie about a teenager in a wheelchair that aired on
PAX-TV earlier in October, which is National Disabilities Employment
Awareness Month. And they also salute the new PAX weekly series, "Sue
Thomas: F.B.Eye," which is drawn from the life of a former bureau
worker whose lip-reading skill was utilized in surveillance. It began
its run Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye" is TV's first series based on the true story
of a deaf person, and Deanne Bray (who speaks very clearly, by the
way) is the first deaf actress in the title role of any series.</TE>
<TE>   In a refreshing departure, the mentor in "Anna's Dream" was a peer
counselor who was in a wheelchair himself. After her devastating
injury in a fall as a gymnast, Anna dreamed poignantly that she could
"fly like a bird, like Superman." After some setbacks and sadness,
the story showed her accepting her disability and even flying down
the road joyously in a hand-powered cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Much of "Anna's Dream" was turgid, unfortunately, and the zaftig
actress playing gifted gymnast Anna (Lindsay Felton) about the size
of two Mary Lou Rettons. Nor was "Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye" any more fluid
when opening stiffly with Thomas going to work for the FBI as a lip
reader deluxe. That, too, is a stereotype, going back at least as far
as George Arliss working uncanny magic with his eyes after going deaf
in the 1932 film "The Man Who Played God."</TE>
<TE>   But stereotype, shmereotype. More notable, say disability
activists, is how these productions address misconceptions, such as
"Anna's Dream" essentially rebutting the message of famously
wheelchaired Christopher Reeve.</TE>
<TE>   Reeve, the "Superman" actor made quadriplegic by an equestrian
fall in 1995, vexes many in the disability community by publicly
stressing walking again.</TE>
<TE>   They claim that by appearing uncomfortable in his own skin, Reeve
leaves the impression that people with paralysis dwell obsessively on
entering a phone booth and emerging free of disability. They believe
he nourishes a public view that useless legs make useless lives, even
though his own aggressive lobbying for the wheelchair crowd tells a
different story.</TE>
<TE>   What's the beef? After all, the guy just wants to walk.</TE>
<TE>   No one faults Reeve for that, said Marcie Roth, executive director
of the National Spinal Cord Injury Assn. "The concern is that he may
be giving false hope to people who are new to spinal cord injury"
while implying also that inability to walk "is a fate worse than
death."</TE>
<TE>   "Anna's Dream" preaches that one can lead a full life seated, "Sue
Thomas: F.B.Eye" that deafness is not crippling.</TE>
<TE>   Although both messages are sturdier than the drama underpinning
them, they need to be delivered again and again, for biases against
disabilities are deeply rooted. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
president from 1933 to 1945, for example, he so feared a public
backlash to the extent of his polio-caused paralysis that he did his
best (with help from a pliant press) to hide his wheelchair
dependence from America.</TE>
<TE>   Although played by able-bodied actors, meanwhile, recurring
characters with disabilities are also featured, however imperfectly,
in Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle," CBS' "Becker" and the WB's new
"Birds of Prey," whose former Batgirl still kicks butt after being
rendered paraplegic when gunned down by the Joker.</TE>
<TE>   There's also "Pelswick." That's Nickelodeon's appealingly bent
animated series from quadriplegic John Callahan, who uses comedy to
deflate stigmas attached to people in wheelchairs. As in Pelswick
calling himself "permanently seated."</TE>
<TE>   Like PAX's Anna, adolescent Pelswick wants only to be treated
normally. "People with disabilities focus on the same issue that
people without disabilities do -- being fulfilled as human beings,"
Hartman says. As for formulaic stories depicting those with
disabilities overcoming all barriers, she adds, "they don't really
triumph over adversity because it's not a triumph over society's
prejudices and lowered expectations. If anything, people with
disabilities are politically challenged."</TE>
<TE>   As some of television remains creatively challenged. However
flawed as entertainment, what PAX is doing is to be commended. Here's
hoping that one day execution matches good intentions, and that the
quality of these works soars as Anna did in her dreams.</TE>

<LD>Rikki Klieman beams at her husband, the next chief of the Los Angeles
Police Department. He is speaking to a group of Latino officers
picnicking at the Police Academy. She gives him the same adoring look
Nancy Reagan gave her Ronnie when he was in the White House, the same
sweet gaze Hillary Clinton leveled on post-Gennifer, pre-Monica Bill.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never, in my life, been in this role," Klieman says as she
watches Bill Bratton address the Latin American Law Enforcement
Assn., also known as La Ley. She works the tented area like a
candidate's wife, enthusiastically introducing herself to officers
and their families, including some who wanted one of their own,
Oxnard Police Chief and LAPD veteran Art Lopez, to move into Parker
Center. When the news cameras and reporters swarm the
chief-designate, she stands off to the side.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, she's Mrs. Bratton, making the public rounds with
her husband, house-hunting near the beach, in West L.A., the
Hollywood Hills and Los Feliz. In New York, she's Rikki Klieman, a
self-described "type A to the fourth power" and as accustomed to the
national spotlight as he is. A lawyer, she anchors the daily legal
affairs show "Both Sides" on Court TV, a job she's thrived in since
her on-air trial by fire, the O.J. Simpson case.</LD>
<TE>   And now she'll be a weekend wife. She'll stay in New York and in
front of the camera until her contract ends this time next year.
Until then, she'll rack up frequent flier miles on last-minute
nonstops and redeyes that land at dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "I really made a major shift when I fell in love with Bill," she
says. "For the first time in my life, I decided that he was my
priority, and not my work. Anybody who knew me would not believe that
kind of change is possible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Top Cop's' fourth wife</TE>
<TE>   So what's it like being the fourth wife of a man who calls himself
"America's Top Cop"?</TE>
<TE>   "For Bill, his job, his success, his career had always come first.
With us, there's an equality. I am every bit as important to Bill as
his job is," she says. "I don't think he's had that before."</TE>
<TE>   What do the lawyer and cop do together?</TE>
<TE>   "We are both joggers," she says. "We are very bad tennis players.
We love the movies. We're total movie buffs. We saw 'The Four
Feathers' because Bill needed a break from pacing while waiting for
Mayor Hahn to make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Who cooks?</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly, we eat out," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Does he blow a fuse?</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen him lose his temper. What you get is the look,
with a capital T and a capital L."</TE>
<TE>   Do you dance together?</TE>
<TE>   "I am transformed when I dance. Dance is my favorite thing....
Bill has really grown. When we were in Buenos Aires, we took tango
lessons, and I have the pictures."</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, they work.</TE>
<TE>   A pit-bull litigator in Boston before her television career,
Klieman first started making headlines as a prosecutor, then as a
criminal defense lawyer with the large silk-stocking law firm Choate,
Hall &amp; Stewart, and ultimately in her own firm, Klieman, Lyons,
Schindler &amp; Gross. No longer a partner, she remains "of counsel,"
practicing solely in an advisory capacity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Time magazine named her one of the nation's five best
women attorneys, all of them talented trial lawyers: "As a group,
they are less like the stereotype of their sex than the stereotype of
their job: they are fiercely intelligent, tough-minded, intensely
competitive, self-assured individualists who relish the fray."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, who began practicing law in
Boston a couple of years before Klieman, explains in a telephone
interview, "First, you have to recognize the profession was
overwhelmingly male. And however overwhelmingly male it was, criminal
law was even more overwhelmingly male."</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Silverglate, the dean of defense attorneys in Boston,
remembers Klieman's early days in court. "She's tough, very tough,"
he says by phone. "This is a very tough job. You've got a prosecutor
threatening you. You've got cops lying and other witnesses lying, and
you have to manage to tear them apart and convince the jury they are
lying. And, sometimes your clients are very tough."</TE>
<TE>   "She's a terrific actress," he adds. "I don't mean that in any
derogatory manner. She is able to communicate with jurors in a way
that makes them want to listen to her ....She's able to connect,
which is why she ended up in television."</TE>
<TE>   Warm, friendly, down-to-earth, Klieman nevertheless brings a
formidable intellect and terrific recall to her show, which dissects
both sides of big trials, the prosecution and the defense. She's also
ended up in film. "In my work at Court TV, my greatest fun, besides
what I do, has been acting," she says. "I played myself in 'Cable
Guy' with Jim Carrey. I played a reporter in 'A Civil Action' with
John Travolta. I most recently played a lawyer in '15 Minutes' with
Robert De Niro."</TE>
<TE>   Klieman dreamed early on of an acting career. Born in Chicago 17
years after her parents, a garment worker from the Ukraine and a
homemaker, were married, she started acting, dance and voice lessons
before she started school. She majored in theater at Northwestern
University, and then headed to New York. "I did a bus-and-truck of
'Stop the World, I Want to Get Off.' That was probably one of the
real learning experiences about the glamour of the theater," she
says. "Get on a bus. Go to some town. Get on another bus." After a
year, she gave up.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to figure out what to do next, she revisited a professor
who had taught a class on the 1st Amendment. "He said to me, 'Why
don't you think about going to law school?' I said, 'Well, girls
don't go to law school.' And he said, 'No, but women do.' It was a
pivotal moment in my life," she says, a moment that propelled her to
Boston University Law School and a career dominated by the law.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 25 years ago, Norfolk County, Mass. Dist. Atty. William
Delahunt--now a member of the U.S. House of Representatives--hired
Klieman, an "extraordinary lawyer." In a phone call from Capitol
Hill, he remembers one case in particular that she prosecuted. In
1980, at the height of the American hostage crisis in Iran, she won
the convictions of three teenagers who beat and fatally stabbed an
Iranian engineering student near Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   While a trial lawyer, she says, she worked "10 1/2 days out of
every week," at a high cost. "Many women in my generation, who were
in college during the '60s, of course, during the feminist
revolution, were driven to put success above our personal lives.
There are many women who have sacrificed solid, loving relationships,
marriages, children, and their physical and psychological health,"
Klieman says. "My life was geared as a successful lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Success required sacrifices: two failed marriages. No children.
Health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Petite, not quite 5 foot 3, Klieman weighs the same as she did in
high school--120 pounds, she says. Few women her age, at 54, can say
the same. For her, it's an accomplishment to weigh that much.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to say, 'Is this a five-pound trial or a 10-pound trial?'
It was pretty scary." In 1990 she lost 15 pounds while defending
David and Ginger Twitchel, a Christian Scientist couple convicted on
manslaughter charges for denying their dying son medical care because
of their religious beliefs. Her health took another hit during the
appeal, which she won. "I looked like a refugee," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She's now writing a cautionary autobiography, "The Price of the
Prize," with Peter Knobler, who also worked on Bratton's book
"Turnaround: "How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic."
It's due out in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Met Bratton 10 years ago</TE>
<TE>   The couple first met 10 years ago at a luncheon held by the
Anti-Defamation League of New England. A member of the league's civil
rights committee, Klieman sat next to Bratton, the guest speaker.
"The first time we met he doesn't remember," she says. "Where was my
feminine mystique?"</TE>
<TE>   They got to know each other professionally a year later, when she
negotiated the surrender of fugitive Katherine Ann Power, a
Vietnam-era radical who drove the getaway car after a 1970 bank
robbery that left a cop dead. A week after the officer's funeral,
Bratton joined the Boston Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   He became police commissioner while Klieman was arranging to bring
Power in, and joined the discussions along with state and federal
prosecutors. "We had no social interaction," she says. "This was
purely business." On a personal level, Klieman says, cops are her
weakness. Her second husband was a federal agent, and before that a
cop. Her first husband, a law school classmate, gave her away to
Bratton at their civil ceremony. (By coincidence, Bratton's third
wife was also a Boston lawyer who rode O.J. to a TV news career. He
has one child, a son by his first wife.)</TE>
<TE>   She got together with the current cop in her life four years ago.
Klieman, then on Court TV, and Bratton, then a security consultant,
were at the Regency Hotel in New York for a power breakfast, only not
with each other. She stopped by his table. "Remember me?" she asked.
He flirted back. They exchanged business cards. He called before she
got back to her office.</TE>
<TE>   On a chilly night in February 1999, he drove her down a dirt road
lightly dusted with snow. The former NYPD commissioner still had some
pretty important friends in the city. He asked them to open the
Central Park carousel.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew what horse would be my favorite, this big white horse. He
put me on it, and said, 'I want to go round and round in life with
you.' It was truly the most romantic moment of my life," says
Klieman, who collects carousel memorabilia, including miniature
carved horses in rainbow colors. Two months later, they married.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just on that carousel two weeks ago," Bratton says. "We
returned to the scene of the crime. We're never in the city on
weekends. We had a wedding to go to. We were walking and found
ourselves in Central Park."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, his 55th birthday, Bratton took his wife to the
Griffith Park merry-go-round. She immediately recognized an ornate
horse carved by the master Charles Looff, who, in 1876, installed the
first merry-go-round in New York's Coney Island. "She knows her
horses," the chief-designate said. He took the horse next to hers.
While the carousel twirled, they held hands, kissed and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an act, according to friends. Indeed, there is a palpable
heat between them.</TE>
<TE>   "She's like a teenager with Bratton. She just bubbles when she
talks about him," Dr. Bonnie Typlin says from Tucson. "I've known
Rikki forever. We went to grade school and high school together. We
were at Northwestern together." Still close, they talk often. "She
makes sacrifices for them," Typlin says. "They have a practice of
going up to their home in Quogue [in the Hamptons on Long Island] on
weekends, and they don't return phone calls. They spend quality time
together."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the move from New York, she says Klieman "cried for
three days, then she said OK, she has to do this. She's looking at
the broader picture. She wants her husband to be happy and
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's new job will force Klieman to give up her "perfect life"
in New York--a job she loves, dinner out at the restaurants of the
rich and famous (Elaine's, Nobu, Daniel, 11 Madison Park), and their
apartment in Murray Hill, a charming and historic area of Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   She'll miss most of all her "dream house," her favorite place in
the world, their Long Island sanctuary surrounded by woods, nestled
against a nature preserve, and five lovely minutes from the Atlantic
Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for sale," she says with a catch in her throat.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if Klieman is the kind of woman who would give up
everything for her man, Rep. Delahunt laughs. "We all mellow with
time," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As far as relocations go, she could have done worse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like she's moving to Ames, Iowa," says Silverglate, the
Boston attorney. "I wouldn't expect her to move if her husband became
police chief of Ames, Iowa. It's not like she's relegated to the
boondocks. People like Rikki make their own scene."</TE>
<TE>   Court TV doesn't broadcast out of L.A., so Klieman will be looking
for something to do. "There's my old world, the entertainment world,
and bet your bottom dollar I'll be looking there. There is my present
world, which is the TV world, which I would also look at, obviously.
There is my world, [in which] I teach. I'm still an adjunct professor
at Columbia Law School."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain, Klieman says. "You can rest assured, I'm not
going to be sitting home or doing yoga on the beach. It's not in my
character to simply be Mrs. Bratton."</TE>

<LD>Must a country music star trade her country soul to become a pop
diva?</LD>
<LD>   Find the answer in the latest singles from Shania Twain, Faith
Hill and LeAnn Rimes, each of whom parlayed country music fame into
across-the-board pop success. All three have just released the first
singles from new albums, but only one is a hit with country fans.</LD>
<LD>   Twain's "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" is getting country listeners
good, debuting this week at No. 21 on the Radio &amp; Records trade
publication's list of the most played records on country stations
across the nation. That's the highest debut on the country chart by a
female performer in R&amp;R's 30-year history, and second overall only to
Garth Brooks, says R&amp;R country music editor Lon Helton.</LD>
<TE>   Twain's single, setting up the Nov. 19 release of her new album,
"Up!," is further shaping up as "an out-of-the-park smash across all
formats," says Jeff Pollack, one of the nation's leading radio
consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's "Cry" single, however, has stalled on the country charts
and has yet to make significant inroads in pop -- it's holding at No.
33 on the Billboard Hot 100 after eight weeks -- while Rimes' "Life
Goes On" is getting moderate pop airplay but has been all but shunned
by country radio. Only six of the 150 country stations that report to
R&amp;R are playing Rimes' single; by comparison, 127 of those stations
added Twain's single as soon as it was released.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical lesson here," Pollack says, "is that if you want to
cross over, you can never ever abandon your core audience. If you do,
you can't get them back."</TE>
<TE>   Hill's "Cry" album "is completely devoid of any country music or
of any country songs," says R.J. Curtis, operations manager at L.A.
country station KZLA-FM (93.9).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm curious about how it's going to be accepted as a pop record,
but if she isn't careful, this could be her 'Chris Gaines' project,
without the weirdness" of Garth Brooks' alter-ego pop-crossover album
of 1999, Curtis says.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Rimes new "Twisted Angel" album is full of pop, R&amp;B and
hip-hop rhythms and production work, leaving country fans and radio
programmers feeling abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Twain, on the other hand, has released a song that Curtis feels
"is very consistent with what she's done on her last two albums and
in this single she's effectively put one foot in both pools."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Pollack: "Everybody wants to have a huge pop record because
pop [sales] numbers are so much bigger than country numbers. It's a
calculated risk.... Growing is great, but never abandon your base, or
you can end up with nothing."</TE>

<LD>When you're not Disney, marketing a family film can be tricky. Just
ask Tag Entertainment's Jonathan Bogner and Steve Austin, producers
of "Hansel &amp; Gretel," an independent, live-action movie opening
Friday in Los Angeles and five other U.S. cities.</LD>
<LD>   With a target audience of children 6 to 11, the filmmakers came up
with a novel promotion to reach kids in school.</LD>
<LD>   They struck a deal with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department
whereby deputies who regularly visit some 220 area schools to conduct
their STAR (Success Through Awareness Resistance) after-school
anti-drug classes, also hand out free "Hansel &amp; Gretel" pencils and
movie fliers. In return, the producers are donating a new Chrysler PT
Cruiser to the STAR program.</LD>
<TE>   Tag Entertainment is also offering to donate $1 to each local PTA
for every "Hansel &amp; Gretel" ticket stub that children and their
families return to their schools.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the company has forged promotional ties with
such retail outlets as Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Mrs. Fields Cookies
and Rite Aid stores. Bogner said Krispy Kreme, for example, will give
a free doughnut to any child who comes in with an A on his report
card.</TE>
<TE>   Bogner describes the film as a "fractured fairy tale" based on the
classic story by the Brothers Grimm but with contemporary dialogue.
"Everyone is familiar with the evil stepmother taking the kids to the
forest and abandoning them," Bogner said. "In our version, the
stepmother is captured by a troll and, as punishment, is forced to
watch reruns of 'Designing Women.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In her attempts at "defining dance" -- accompanied by requisite
boundary-pushing -- Arianne MacBean, producer of the third annual
Dance Moving Forward Festival, presented an evening of seven emerging
choreographers at Highways Performance Space on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   What resulted tended to tip the scales more toward self-indulgence
and pretentiousness than to a spate of awesome, breakthrough works.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, however, the revelations of Banafsheh Sayyad, in her solo
"Return," helped right things. Sayyad, a font of exquisite perpetual
motion, is a temple frieze come to life, a one-woman whirling
dervish, trance spinning to a glorious percussive track as she
beckons us into her exotic world.</LD>
<TE>   Also mystically bent: Hanh Nguyen's "Study the Flow of Chi," a
duet with the choreographer and Sarandon Cassidy set to a soundtrack
of rain. Serene and graceful, Nguyen offered lunges and tumbling
moves, as well as power in stillness. The piece would have fared
better as a solo, however, and without Cassidy's spoken words.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Favand's octet "Howl" bristled with primeval longings and
intoxicating leaps, with Arlys Alford adding live vocals to an
already breathy soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Eryn Schon's brave work "Moving On" featured a nearly immobile
Erica Rebollar and Evaldas Kvaracieyus facing front, spoon-like, in
Stanley and Blanche mode.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's misses: Carmela Hermann's "Turning My Head to the
Left," with vapid text and moves; Deborah Cohen's quasi-pantomimed
museum riff "Philosophical Toys: The Docent"; and Ilaan Egeland's
"What's in Between," a fluid quintet, lamentably saddled with
unnecessary speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Even envelope-pushing can benefit from smart editing.</TE>

<LD>"Red Dragon" and "Sweet Home Alabama" withstood an onslaught of new
films over the Columbus Day weekend, holding onto the No. 1 and 2
spots, respectively, while "Brown Sugar" emerged as the sweetest
performer among half a dozen moderately wide releases to debut in
third place, according to studio projections released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Madonna's latest, "Swept Away," was given the brushoff,
earning just $375,000 on 196 screens.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Hopkins, in his third outing as Hannibal the Cannibal,
sliced off an estimated $17.6 million, dropping a steep 52%, bringing
the Universal picture's 10-day total to $63.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   Disney's Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy remained strong in its
third weekend, declining only 34% to take in an estimated $14.1
million. Its 17-day total comes to about $85 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Famuyiwa's "Brown Sugar," a hip-hop romantic comedy starring
Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan, grossed an estimated $11.05 million,
with an impressive per-theater average of $8,054 in 1,372 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   But the holiday weekend's biggest winner was probably Paul Thomas
Anderson's foray into romantic comedy, "Punch Drunk Love," in which
the writer-director paired Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. It enjoyed
a muscular per-theater average of $76,000 in only five theaters in
L.A., New York and Toronto and $380,000 total. Sony boasted that it
is the highest per-theater average for a limited opening in more than
two theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Bowling for Columbine," Michael Moore's provocative documentary
about the U.S. gun culture, debuted with a solid per-theater average
of $25,750 in eight locations in Los Angeles and New York for a total
of $206,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among other new movies this holiday weekend, 20th Century Fox's
"The Transporter" landed in fourth place with an estimated $9.15
million in 2,572 theaters, averaging $3,558.</TE>
<TE>   Debuting in seventh place, "White Oleander" brought in an
estimated $5.655 million in 1,510 theaters, averaging $3,745 per
theater. With its power cast of Michelle Pfeiffer, Renee Zellweger,
Robin Wright Penn and newcomer Alison Lohman and positive reviews, it
should've fared better.</TE>
<TE>   Also based on a popular novel, Disney's family fantasy "Tuck
Everlasting" opened at No. 8 with an estimated $5.5 million on 1,185
screens, averaging $4,658 per theater. It was directed by Jay Russell
("My Dog Skip") and stars Alexis Bledel ("The Gilmore Girls") and
Jonathan Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth of the new movies opening in the top 10 was New Line's
long-delayed mob-themed comedy-drama "Knockaround Guys," which came
in ninth with an estimated $5.04 million on 1,806 screens, averaging
$2,791. Some of the credit for the little-heralded film's performance
is the popularity of Vin Diesel, who was cast in the film before
"XXX" and "The Fast and the Furious" made him famous.</TE>
<TE>   In fifth place, the incredibly durable "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"
declined only 4% with an estimated $7.8 million, for a total of about
$158.4 million. The Jackie Chan secret-agent action comedy "The
Tuxedo" slipped 30% from third to sixth place, with an estimated $7
million and a three-weekend total of $37million. "Barbershop" was
trimmed 40% from fifth to 10th, but it took in an estimated $4
million, for a five-weekend, robust total of $65.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   One last limited bow of note, the Jerry Seinfeld vehicle
"Comedian," opened in four theaters in Los Angeles and New York with
$61,000 or $15,250 per theater.</TE>

<HD>Clouds part for Thompson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until recently, British folk singer-songwriter Linda Thompson's
career seemed nearly as tragic as the dire songs from her heyday with
folk-rock giant Richard Thompson, her ex-husband and former musical
partner. Absent for 17 years due to an anxiety-based disorder that
prevented her from singing (or, for a time, even speaking), she
performed at the Troubadour on Saturday, her first local appearance
in 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   The first L.A. stop on her U.S. tour (she was also scheduled to
play McCabe's on Sunday) was a low-key affair. The 80-minute set
covered most of Thompson's critically acclaimed new collection, aptly
titled "Fashionably Late," which blended traditional British folk
styles with tasteful electric touches. The songs also fit her own
traditions, ranging from wry ("Weary Life") to doleful ("The Banks of
the Clyde") to yearning ("All I See").</LD>
<LD>   Relaxed and alert, Thompson showed no sign of the hysterical
dysphonia that began in the mid-'80s, although she often referred to
notes on her music stand. Flanked by two of her children, solo artist
Teddy Thompson and vocalist Kamila Thompson, she seemed buoyed by
their presence and their close harmonizing with her revered,
still-resonant mezzo-soprano. Yet she proved she needed no crutches
with a solo, a cappella rendition of a bleak number about an
alcoholic's battered-but-not-beaten-down wife.</LD>
<TE>   The quintet's spare instrumentation on accordion, organ,
tambourine and acoustic and electric guitars delicately colored
classic, vivid images of murder, sexual shame and undying devotion.
Thompson injected some variety with the jazz ballad "Paint &amp; Powder
Beauty," co-written with Rufus Wainwright. She treated the few older
works affectionately, even sounding a note of triumph in the
set-closing title tune from the Thompsons' 1974 album, "I Want to See
the Bright Lights Tonight."</TE>

<LD>The next time you're stuck in traffic, consider this: If Caltrans had
been paying any sort of attention to the work of recent Nobel Prize
winners Vernon L. Smith and Daniel Kahneman, you might be home by
now.</LD>
<LD>   While the Nobels awarded in other areas -- literature, medicine,
occasionally peace -- often resonate at some level with the average
person -- most of us can read, after all, and take medicine, and
peace, well, who doesn't want a little peace? -- the economics
category can leave one cold. So often the work done in that field
bears little resemblance to our challenges of maxed-out credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   But when reports of this year's winners stressed the
cross-pollination of economics and psychology, there seemed a chance
that this was something the layperson would be able to understand.
After all, the award -- shared by Smith, a professor of economics and
law at George Mason University in Virginia, and Kahneman, a professor
of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University --
highlights the emerging field of "behavioral economics," a term that
sounds more Dr. Phil than John Maynard Keynes.</LD>
<TE>   Smith and Kahneman were a bit too busy to bother with questions
that might be found in "The Idiot's Guide to Award-Winning Economic
Theory," but Ross M. Miller, author of "Paving Wall Street:
Experimental Economics &amp; the Quest for the Perfect Market," most
patiently obliged.</TE>
<TE>   And so he broke it down to freeways. According to Miller, the
formulas that California officials use when deciding when, where and
how to build a freeway are based on traditional cost-benefit models.
A major assumption of these models is that humans think, and act,
logically, like computers. "But the way people choose the path they
take to work is not rational," says Miller. "People get in habits;
they have misperceptions; they do not always choose the most
efficient route."</TE>
<TE>   This is one of the main findings of Kahneman's work -- that people
do not always act in the most logical or efficient manner. One of his
studies found that while folks will go out of their way to save five
bucks on a $15 calculator, they won't to save the same five-spot on a
$125 jacket. Perception -- the greater the percentage of saving, the
greater the actual savings -- blurs the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, on the other hand, has concentrated on how people behave in
groups, in the marketplace. Much of his work has concentrated on
re-creating and explaining bubbles and crashes. In a perfect market,
says Miller, who also runs a risk-management company in upstate New
York, "a depressed value should be bid up to appropriate value and
stop there. But it often doesn't stop there. Momentum itself
distracts people from the real value of what is being sold." And
prices, like those of California's housing market, skyrocket.</TE>
<TE>   "People get carried away," he says. "They forget that 'This isn't
worth this and, at that price, I don't need it anyway.' Conversely,
when a crash begins, it sometimes doesn't stop at a reasonable level
but goes on and on. It's almost magical, why and when it stops."</TE>
<TE>   Kind of like traffic on the 405.</TE>
<TE>   So, can our flawed freeways and ever-increasing commute times be
blamed on obsolete economic theory?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably," Miller says. "I have no doubt that if the ultimate
rulers of how freeways were built were run by Smith and Kahneman,
things would look a lot different. For one thing," he adds with a
laugh, "it is economically inefficient to have a 'free' freeway when
there is so much congestion. But then I live in the East now, the
land of the toll road and the EZ pass."</TE>
<TE>   Although he is happy to have explained economics in terms of
transportation, Miller refuses to take the analogy any further.
Because the work of the prizewinners is not really about freeways or
even consumerism. It's about markets, and talking about Smith and
Kahneman in terms of "how will it affect me?" is a little like asking
Bill Gates to come fix your hard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Kahneman has focused on what motivates an individual to buy or
sell at a certain price. For centuries, economists have assumed
people made economic decisions based on rational information -- was
the price good? was it worth the effort? Kahneman discovered that
this assumption is just wrong -- people's buying and selling behavior
may be predictable, but only if their odd habits, weird motivations
and misperceptions are taken into account.</TE>
<TE>   All this might seem like the first Nobel Prize in Traveling
Salesmanship. But to boil it down to that would be a mistake, says
Miller. This is less about the pricing of merchandise and more about
keeping the lights on and the water coming out of the taps.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Smith has constructed controlled experiments to
figure out why and when and for how much people and governments and
companies buy things -- pork bellies and electricity, houses and
gold. Smith believes the glitches that lead to bubbles and crashes in
the systems we all rely on can be explained, often foreseen and
possibly avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "Vern is very big-picture," says Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Economists should test new markets, or new rules and mechanisms,
Smith believes, before unleashing them on the public. Had California
properly tested its power market, says Miller, the blackouts might
have been prevented.</TE>
<TE>   And that is something almost anyone can understand.</TE>

<HD>Moving 'Passion' lovingly voiced</HD>
<DH>Cappella Romana's transporting delivery drew on the spare
Byzantine style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Purer, sweeter, more austere and impersonal than Baroque composer
Heinrich Schutz, who makes Bach sound like an overwrought Romantic,
is the music of the Byzantine liturgy. Ivan Moody drew on that
glorious tradition for his deeply moving "Passion and Resurrection,"
heard Friday at St. Paul Greek Orthodox Church in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Sung gorgeously by the Portland, Ore.-based Cappella Romana, led
by Moody, the performance set a high-water mark at the start of the
fourth Eclectic Orange Festival sponsored by the Philharmonic
Society. The concert was presented by the church.</LD>
<LD>   This is a vocal tradition uncommon in the Western concert hall and
takes some getting used to. A narrator chants the story of Christ's
Passion and resurrection, staying within a very narrow dynamic,
expressive and melodic range. The choir sings hymns and antiphons,
mostly a cappella, often in unison. When it breaks into harmony, the
effect is like jeweled light flooding the space.</LD>
<TE>   Moody added a small string ensemble to provide occasional,
discreet accompaniment. A string bass, however, sounded pedal notes
throughout the work, except at the moment of Christ's death. Its
absence then was shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Absence is the critical characteristic of this style: absence of
display, ego, of anything that draws attention from the involving
narrative. Following the practice of the Greek Orthodox Church,
however, the composer sets off sections of the work, which he calls
"Ikons," with chimed notes. That and the symbolic three-fold
repetitions of certain lines remind us that this is not meant as
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "Passion and Resurrection" is very close to being a church
service, and that may have accounted for the respectful rather than
overwhelming applause at the end. You don't applaud a Mass at which
you have been transported.</TE>
<TE>   The 16 singers were exemplary in breath and dynamic control,
creating timeless, endless melody by starting every new line at
exactly the same dynamic and color as the one they had just finished.
Tenor Leslie Green was the gentle, marathon Evangelist. Bass John
Vergin was the warm, authoritative Christ. LeaAnne DenBeste sang the
Mother of God with aching purity.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's a cappella "In You, All Creation Rejoices," also in
Byzantine style, was the encore.</TE>

<DH>Francine Prose, author of 'Lives of the Muses' has turned
some people off with her fierceness. But she says: 'I know at least
three people who think I'm a very nice person.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Woolf begat Susan Sontag, who begat Francine Prose. It's not
just about the writing; it's about the uncompromising ferocity.
Prose's books -- 11 works of fiction, three of nonfiction -- strike,
sometimes fatally, at the heart of modern life in a politically
charged way. "Blue Angel," her novel of two years ago, for example,
took on the issue of sex between professors and their students.</LD>
<LD>   Her new nonfiction work, "Lives of the Muses," looks at the lives
of nine women who are credited (not always by the artist himself)
with inspiring such luminaries as Edward Weston, Friedrich Nietzsche,
George Balanchine, John Lennon, Man Ray, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and
Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll). They are, with few
exceptions, extremely colorful, tragic lives -- musedom, it seems, is
fraught with soul-threatening dangers.</LD>
<LD>   Prose, 55, looks like a cross between Woolf and Frida Kahlo, which
perhaps adds to the impression of intellectual ferocity. She is tall
and very thin, with dark eyes and eyebrows and long fingers that run
nervously through her hair. She almost always wears black.</LD>
<TE>   But here's the conundrum: She is deferential, careful in her
manners. She is a considerate listener. She laughs easily and goes
out of her way to make her guest more comfortable. She is not mean
about other writers, with a few off-the-record exceptions. At a
recent literary event in New York, she joined two men deep in
conversation. The minute she joined, one walked away and wandered
over to a group that, unbeknownst to him, included Prose's husband.
"I just had to get away from that terrible woman," he said to Prose's
husband.</TE>
<TE>   "Withering," "scathing": These are words often used to describe
her. "I know at least three people who think I'm a very nice person,"
Prose says. "Women with strong opinions are extremely unpopular these
days, with other women as well as men. There's something threatening
about female intelligence, something dangerous and volatile. I don't
want to sound smarmy, but women are still expected to look good and
keep quiet."</TE>
<TE>   All of the women Prose wrote about were beautiful, from
10-year-old Alice Liddell, the inspiration for "Alice in Wonderland,"
to Hester Thrale, muse to Samuel Johnson in the 18th century, to
Charis Weston, much-abused muse to Edward Weston. Even Yoko Ono and
Lou Andreas-Salome, serial muse to Nietzsche, Rilke and Freud. They
were not traditional beauties but somehow seductive and compelling.
"Beauty seems to work," Prose says.</TE>
<TE>   In "Lives of the Muses," Prose warns about several of the mistakes
a muse can make, particularly the transformation into "art wife."
"Tenure is not an option in the lives of the muses," she writes. They
should not allow themselves to be domesticated and they should not
demand credit. So what did they get? "These women were able to make
exciting lives for themselves in times when women were hardly
influential."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the book is driven by images: Dodgson's photograph of a
young Alice Liddell as a beggar child, in which she looks seductively
at the camera with her dress falling from a cocked shoulder; Weston's
creepy 1943 photograph of wife Charis, in which she stands naked
outside his studio holding a sign that says "Edward Weston, Carmel,
Ca." These images speak volumes of the varying roles of the muse.
Young Alice is confident, looking for all the world like the
puppeteer who pulls the artist's strings, while Charis Weston is
fully humiliated.</TE>
<TE>   Prose is frequently criticized for her opinions. She raised some
hackles with her negative review of a book by Helen Bransford, Jay
McInerney's then-wife, about face lifts. For "Muses," she has been
criticized for her low opinion of Rossetti, which one reviewer
claimed was proof of her secret feminist leanings. "What really
bugged me about him," says Prose, "was that his paintings were not
that great and Lizzie Siddal, who ended up an opium addict while he
moved on to the next muse, was completely sacrificed to his mediocre
talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to be the famous artist," she says. "No one wants
to be the muse."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Prose does not believe that Charles Dodgson was
a pedophile, as so many feminists have alleged. " 'Alice in
Wonderland' is a stunningly sharp and beautiful book," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her rabble-rousing pieces for Harper's magazine, including a
recent piece questioning the importance of Maya Angelou's poetry,
have also earned her a bit of acrimony among the literati.</TE>
<TE>   They may be afraid of her, but she's not afraid of them. "Frankly,
who cares? What can they do to me? I have a great family life," she
says. Her two sons, 20 and 24, are successful and funny, she says.
Her husband is a painter, illustrator and, by her account, a fabulous
cook. She has also received a Guggenheim, a Fulbright and a
Director's Fellowship at New York Public Library's Center for
Scholars and Writers, which is how she wrote "Muses." She has written
for all the big rigs: the New Yorker, a column called Hers for the
New York Times, the Wall Street Journal. She is a contributing editor
for Harper's.</TE>
<TE>   As she greets a visitor in her hotel lobby, an insistent voice on
the loudspeaker commands everyone to leave the building because it is
on fire. Prose ignores the announcement and continues talking. Wow,
this woman is cool. Nothing breaks her concentration. Sitting on the
hotel patio, she is undisturbed by the wail of babies that fills the
air, emanating from the preschool next door.</TE>
<TE>   Prose is an old-fashioned intellectual, meaning she doesn't care
for the countryside; she drinks a lot of coffee and watches bad TV
for its camp value whenever she can. She claims not to be tightly
wound, just impatient, particularly in traffic. Malfunctioning
appliances can also drive her insane and are in danger of being
hurled against walls.</TE>
<TE>   And to see her get really riled up, just mention a certain
president and his potential war on Iraq. Clouds seem to gather around
her head. "It's the payoff for undereducating our children," she
says, her voice rising. "We've got a population that can't even
connect the dots between oil money and war anymore. It's gotten
worse, this exultation in the know-nothing American culture. Don't
get me wrong; I'm a patriot. I believe in the Bill of Rights and the
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   It takes only her computer screen, which has a Pavlovian effect on
her, to lift her spirits. Turn it on and she writes. "My parents got
a TV when I was just a baby, and I spent a lot of time in front of
it." She edits everything, even her own e-mails. She hates
self-indulgent writers. "I'm writing for people in dentists' offices,
people who are terrified on planes and want to be transported. I read
to be in someone else's life."</TE>
<TE>   "Muses" will be followed by a National Geographic book on Sicily
and a young adult novel called "After," about the gradual theft of
children's civil liberties. Since the shootings at Columbine High
School in Colorado, many schools check student backpacks and randomly
test for drugs. In the book, 14-year-old boys at a public school
begin to disappear. The administration says they are being sent to
drug rehab. But no.</TE>
<TE>   Prose is also working on a new novel, -- though she is reluctant
to discuss its plot--which means rewriting every chapter. "I never
know if it will work until the very last sentence."</TE>
<TE>   See? She's not so frightening.</TE>

<LD>Carlos Santana may have hit his career peak 30 years in with 1999's
"Supernatural," but deep down he'll always be a child of the '60s. He
said as much not long into a wildly celebratory performance Saturday
at the Hollywood Bowl, as he embarked on the follow to his last
album, which racked up nine Grammys and has sold more than 11 million
copies in the U.S. alone.</LD>
<LD>   "Even though it's 2002, we still have that vibration of the
1960s," he told the cross-generational, cross-cultural crowd that
packed the Bowl. A key part of that vibe, to which the 55-year-old
guitar hero still clings, is the deeply felt belief that peace on
Earth and the universal brotherhood of humanity might be realized in
our lifetimes.</LD>
<LD>   Other aspects of the '60s might be better off left there. Like
drum solos. Yet we got a 10-minute workout that was best viewed as an
extended chance to reflect on George Harrison's wise words, "All
things must pass." Percussion being integral to Santana's Latin-based
world music, the drum solo probably was inevitable. Fortunately, the
guitarist and his 11-member band offered plenty well worth cheering,
the vast majority of it from "Supernatural" and its follow-up,
"Shaman," which is being released Oct. 22.</LD>
<TE>   Santana opened the show with several songs from the new disc, only
one of which -- "The Game of Love" -- fans have had a chance to hear
yet. The early emphasis on new material would be a bolder move for
other rock and pop bands, but Santana's whole career has been built
on permutations of rock-infused Latin rhythms. So if the new songs
weren't specifically familiar, they melded seamlessly into the
group's repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, "Shaman" could have been called
"Superdupernatural," given the repeat of its predecessor's hit
formula: pairing the veteran guitarist and his bandmates with a
parade of pop, rock and hip-hop performers du jour.</TE>
<TE>   But the band itself is so accomplished and flexible that the
guests seem like a frill. Singers Tony Lindsay and Andy Vargas made
the absence of Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas a moot point when they
handled his vocal duties on "Smooth," given an extended treatment
that turned the Bowl into a surging dance party.</TE>
<TE>   The only outside help from "Shaman" on Saturday came from Michelle
Branch, the young rock singer-songwriter who performs "The Game of
Love," and opening act Ozomatli, which returned to the stage to chime
in with its parts from the album on "One of These Days."</TE>
<TE>   On record, "The Game of Love" is a confection -- the only
substance coming from Santana's guitar, his signature tone implying
spiritual purity at its core, with a thin skin of distortion
conveying the human side of things. Live, however, the band turned up
the heat so that "Game" gained a welcome forcefulness.</TE>
<TE>   In concert, the band almost completely skipped the hip-hop
elements that run through "Shaman" and "Supernatural," which tend to
feel forced. That left the wide variety of Afro-Cuban, Brazilian and
other Latin American flavors to carry the night, which the band did
easily, thanks also to the skilled work of key soloists Chester
Thompson (keyboards) and Bill Ortiz (trumpet).</TE>
<TE>   You'd barely have guessed Santana had a career before 1999 until
the very end of the show. That's when the band returned to the very
beginnings of its career for encore performances of "Black Magic
Woman" and Tito Puente's "Oye Como Va," both of which were sparked
with rhythmic twists that freshened these hyper-familiar numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The overall spirit of celebration extended to Ozomatli's set,
which hip-hopped through the band's rap y rock en espanol catalog.
The group trekked from its Latin-rooted rap- rock into back-to-back
songs that channeled Arabic modality and then klezmer music --
echoing the band's one-world political view -- before winding up with
roots-rock polka so vibrant it would have raised the roof, if the
Bowl had one.</TE>

<HD>Emotionally resonant work from Sean Curran</HD>
<DH>The choreographer- dancer expresses his sharply focused
technique in contemporary works reflecting tradition and nostalgia.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no fresher, more invigorating new American dance now than the
choreography of Sean Curran, an artist with a background in Irish
step dance, postmodern experiment and Broadway hoofing--but no clear
allegiance to anything but his restless imagination.</LD>
<LD>   Curran's nine-dancer company came to the Irvine Barclay Theatre on
Friday with three recent, plotless group works steeped in nostalgia.</LD>
<LD>   "From the Ether, With Instinct," for example, collected artifacts
of pop dance from the 1960s on up and reassembled them in witty
collages set to recordings by the Scottish band Young Marble Giants.</LD>
<TE>   Curran whomped an imaginary guitar and danced a robotic go-go
solo, while the rest of the company playfully wagged their heads,
shook that thing, walked like an Egyptian, twisted the night away and
paired off for swing dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Binding all these familiar moves: the dancers repeatedly pulling
out the sides of their loose, bright pants and smiling as if posing
for snapshots.</TE>
<TE>   But besides being an album of signature dance tropes through the
decades, "From the Ether" provided opportunities for sophisticated
choreographic expression--most notably, perhaps, in a fleet,
technically complex duet near the end for Amy Brous and Tony
Guglietti.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of breathless, emotionally responsive and sharply
focused dancing dominated the rest of the program and, right now, may
represent the essence of Curran's modern dance style.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sonata (We Are What We Were)," he used that style to create
another tribute to the past, but not a specific reflection of it. A
circle of tiny wooden chairs and circular folk-dance formations
evoked a sense of community rooted in tradition, but the dancing used
its folkloric skip steps and somber Janacek score with great freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Semaphoric windmill or propeller arms emerged as the key motif,
but like the other structural building blocks here, they seemed to
melt at the end, becoming an attempt to embrace or hold onto the air,
maybe even to stop time and make a moment of loving togetherness last
forever.</TE>
<TE>   In the unison passages that dominated the work, one dancer's
unexpected jump or a sudden lift would break the pattern, reminding
you of the individual personalities within the group--and sharpening
your perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing this individuality, Curran's "Six Laments" set weighty
solos and duets in front of three large portraits by Kieran McGonnell
on Venetian blinds, portraits that could vanish with the pull of a
cord.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by a mournful commissioned score by Seamus Egan, the
opening solo by Heather Waldon-Arnold defined the hopeless reaching
and sinking patterns that others would develop and embellish in their
segments.</TE>
<TE>   For all its sincere, shared sense of loss, the work had mysteries
galore: the identity of those people in the portraits, the presence
of a dancer (David Zurak) who never danced and, above all, the cause
or inspiration for this movement elegy. (No, it isn't a response to
Sept. 11; it dates from 1999.) Donna Scro Gentile was pregnant when
it was choreographed and on Friday depicted pregnancy in her solo,
suggesting that Curran intended to document something specific and
personal, rather than grief in the abstract.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the oddities in his own solo--searching for something,
trying to turn but always falling--played like living memories. But
of what? In some ways, "Six Laments" seemed the simplest piece on the
Curran program. However all those unanswered questions--the feeling
that this dance work had life or meaning beyond what we saw on the
stage--gave it a strange resonance.</TE>
<TE>   By keeping his secrets, Curran reinforced the sense of isolation
evident in the piece from the first tableau. Like Zurak, we could
only watch from a distance, not know what Curran knew, not feel what
he felt. Grief may be a universal emotion, but it strikes and shapes
each of us differently. Out of that difference, "Six Laments" made
rich, persuasive dance art.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the dancers mentioned, the company included Nora Brickman,
Peter Kalivas and Kevin Scarpin.</TE>

<LD>Tonight is a special night for me, but nobody in my family realizes
it. That's because it's homework time.</LD>
<LD>   Homework time at our house comes right after dinner every school
night. It means that until homework is finished, we kids aren't
allowed any television, telephone calls, computer games or talking
except to ask questions.</LD>
<LD>   My brother, Bailey, and my sister, Lizzy, are usually the only
ones doing homework. I'm Harley, and my job up to now on homework
night has been to stay quiet and not bug them while they're working.</LD>
<TE>   I mostly look through my picture books and try to figure out words
I don't already know. Sometimes I get out my jigsaw puzzle of the
United States. Mom lets me work on it because she considers it
educational.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Bailey is working on his multiplication tables. He's
making no noise, but his lips are saying, "Two times two is four, two
times three is six, two times four is...." He stops and scowls at me
when he notices I am watching.</TE>
<TE>   Lizzy is going over her spelling list, writing out the words over
and over. Her fingers are clamped around her pencil so tightly her
knuckles are white and she is chewing on her lower lip. She looks
really weird. Just for fun, I try to make my face look like hers.</TE>
<TE>   Lizzy immediately breaks the no talking rule. "Mom," she yells.
"Harley's bothering me!"</TE>
<TE>   "Am not!" I say when Mom appears. "I'm just getting ready to do my
homework!"</TE>
<TE>   "Why, Harley," Mom says. "You've never had to do homework before."</TE>
<TE>   "I know," I say proudly. "It's the first time!"</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is looking at me as I get out my construction paper and
box of crayons. I can tell they are impressed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: What is Harley's homework assignment?</TE>

<LD>To read the program essays by awestruck French writers, and to enter
a circus tent with darkened stage and air made thick with musky
incense, is to know that Theatre Zingaro has come to Costa Mesa
zealous in its desire to explore the mystical relationship between
man, beast and the divine spirit. But the Eclectic Orange Festival
hasn't spent its hard-raised millions of dollars to erect a tent and
create a gypsy village next to Segerstrom Hall, to lay tons of dirt,
to schlep livestock, dancers and equipment from France and India,
simply because audiences hanker for an equestrian interpretation of
Stravinsky's ballet "The Rite of Spring."</LD>
<LD>   Theatre Zingaro is a magnificent equestrian company. And
"Triptyk," which had its U.S. premiere Saturday night and which will
be presented throughout the month-long festival, is more than just a
magnificent equestrian show. But how much more is an area of some
confusion.</LD>
<LD>   The elements to "Triptyk" that are great, however, really are
great. The French company, led by a 44-year-old director,
choreographer and horseman who calls himself Bartabas, includes
several splendid horses and poetic riders to guide them (and be
guided by them). Extraordinary, as well, are the seven Dravidian
dancers from Kerala, in southwestern India, who spend years learning
to loosen joints to the point that legs accomplish gestures that only
arms normally can.</LD>
<TE>   Above all, Bartabas uses his phenomenal resources to create
cultishly spiritual spectacles that have become a favorite of the
international festival circuit. Twice, the Brooklyn Academy of Music
has installed the company in Battery Park in lower Manhattan, but
this is its first time on the West Coast and its only American
engagement this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Triptyk" is a kind of ballet with Stravinsky's "The Rite of
Spring" and "Symphony of Psalms" as its outer parts, and Pierre
Boulez's "Dialogue of the Double Shadow" in the center. The
Stravinsky pieces are performed to loudly amplified recordings of the
orchestral and choral pieces conducted by Boulez. Boulez's piece, for
a solo clarinet and tape, uses a live performer.</TE>
<TE>   Bartabas has great ambitions for these scores. The "Rite" is
transformed from the original sacrificial scenes of pagan Russia into
a full-fledged creation myth. Rising out of the darkness and dirt,
the kalaripayatt dancers, practicing traditional Indian martial-arts
movements, squirm on the ground, primitive life forms evolving out of
primeval ooze. The thudding string chords that augur spring are the
cue for seven riders to circle the ring and begin a tense interaction
between man (or whatever other animal shapes these dancers amazingly
twist themselves into) and noble horse.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy-handed though all this symbolism is, Bartabas is also an
entertainer. Dancers leap on the horses in breathtaking acrobatic
feats, seeming as much circus act as reverential theater. An
announcement in French and English, mostly unheard amid the din of
the crowd entering the tent, asked for no applause. But each amazing
show of horsemanship got just that from the half the spectators, and
angry shushing sounds from the other half. Twice, the applause (or
was it the shushing noise?) spooked horses and toppled delicately
balanced human pyramids standing upon them, the second time with an
angry gesture from a performer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was often a challenge to keep quiet. How not to coo over
the three frolicking white horses, adorably nuzzling each other as
they presumably represented the mystic circles of young girls in the
opening of the second half of the ballet? How to squelch that
appreciative oohing and awing of a parading black, white and brown
Spanish horse?</TE>
<TE>   Boulez's "Dialogue," a work for solo clarinet and pre-recorded
clarinet (the live player's shadow), is horseless but still
horse-haunted. Two traditional modern dancers, Anouck Tissot and
Bernard Gaddis, weave between illuminated Jean-Louis Sauvat white
sculptures of desiccated horse parts, with the clarinetist, Yoshinobu
Kamei, in the center.</TE>
<TE>   The dancers here are gloomily and conventionally expressive of
loss, as they weave about the sculptures. But Bartabas has other
inspirations. Pre-recorded clarinet parts circle the audience across
six loudspeakers in transitional sections between the fluttery live
music, with the sculptures illuminated in synchronization to the
moving sounds. Moreover, Kamei's trilling, leaping, flutter-tonguing
performance of this dazzling score proved a sensation in its own
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Symphony of Psalms" opens amid thick fog, six women in flowing
silk riding six exquisite white horses, a sacred Pre-Raphealite
vision. Musically, the "Rite's" chords are tamed in religious ritual.
Horses and riders make stately circles around the stage; at one
point, the horses paw their hoofs in counterpoint to a Stravinsky
fugue. Tissot twists and turns suspended high above the stage, a
trite symbol of rebirth, while the horses add an ineffable majesty to
the heavenly praise.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, how one responds to such a high degree of animal
training is a personal matter. I found the finale moving but slightly
nervous-making, wondering just how a horse feels about being guided
into such contrived movement. At the very end, Bartabas appears alone
on stage on top of his horse, which rhythmically beats out time to
the tolling of bells. It goes on for what seems like a long time. It
also appears profoundly egotistical and unnatural. I have no idea
what it is supposed to mean, but I wish it weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Triptyk" continues through Nov. 10, nightly except Mondays and
Thursdays, 8:30 p.m., $45-$75, at the corner of Town Center Drive and
Avenue of the Arts, Costa Mesa. (949) 553-2422.</TE>

<HD>'The Ship' shuffles the deck as it revisits Cook's voyage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capt. James Cook, who embarked on his historic Pacific voyage more
than 200 years ago, has never been forgotten, yet the British
explorer is undergoing something of a rediscovery.</LD>
<LD>   Two recent books retrace Cook's journey into uncharted waters and
reexamine his story. Now the History Channel chimes in with "The
Ship," a six-hour, three-part documentary airing tonight through
Wednesday at 9 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Forty men and women were picked to relive the 18th century odyssey
aboard a replica of Cook's ship, the Endeavor, in an adventure billed
as "experiential history" rather than reality TV. Over six weeks last
fall, the modern crew sailed from Australia to Indonesia, retracing
one of the roughest legs of Cook's 1768-71 voyage.</LD>
<TE>   This miniseries lacks the chilling suspense of last year's
documentary "The Endurance," which recounted Ernest Shackleton's
ill-fated expedition to Antarctica in 1914, but it stokes the
imagination. In its unusual way, it lives up to the network's slogan
"Where the Past Comes Alive."</TE>
<TE>   This trip is not quite the parallel test of courage filmmaker
Chris Terrill envisions -- the modern crew, for example, reenters the
Great Barrier Reef not through the dicey waters Cook dubbed
Providential Channel but through a wider route. Still, the contrasts
prompt us all the more to consider what the experience must have been
like, and to think about how much the world has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Cook was celebrated in his day for redrawing the world's map, but
the indigenous peoples affected by his "discoveries" see him
differently, and so do many historians. Indeed, Aborigines who
protest the new Endeavor's launch get a sympathetic hearing.</TE>
<TE>   As this film makes clear, Cook was a brilliant sailor who changed
the world--"for better or worse."</TE>

<HD>Impressive start for New West</HD>
<DH>Symphony begins its eighth season with pianist Christopher
O'Riley rising to the challenge of Ravel's concertos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To its credit, the still-young New West Symphony opened its eighth
season not with a traditional romantic bang, but with the soft,
insinuating sea foam of Debussy's "La Mer." Brasher sounds ended the
concert, with the slow-mo crescendo of "Bolero" framing a Ravel-heavy
French program heard Saturday at Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks
(the symphony also performed at the Oxnard Performing Arts Center on
Friday).</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly a contender on the West Coast symphony scene, this
impressive ensemble, led with lucid strength by Boris Brott, hasn't
always managed to steer clear of the standards. But here was a case
of a special-interest concert program that worked, built around the
rare treat of hearing Ravel's masterful piano concertos back to back,
and played by a musician clearly in his game.</LD>
<LD>   Pianist Christopher O'Riley has been in Ventura County before, in
the intimate dimensions of the Ventura Chamber Music Festival, but
his New West debut demonstrated sensitivity and flourish in an
orchestral setting.</LD>
<TE>   One challenge in the Concerto in D for left hand alone, the
emotionally darker of the two Ravel concertos, is giving due dramatic
heft, and sometimes technical overtime, to a hand normally relegated
to a supportive role. O'Riley rose to the task well, especially in
the final, sweeping cadenza.</TE>
<TE>   He also brought the right stuff to the breezier, jazzier Concerto
in G, while respecting the hushed lyricism of its bittersweet, lush
adagio movement.</TE>
<TE>   Saddled with kitsch potential, "Bolero" arrived with added
pressure to provide intelligent interpretation. Brott and company did
that, plotting an easy-does-it path until abandon at last reared her
clangorous head.</TE>

<HD>A different view of attention deficit</HD>
<DH>Researchers say the problem may be genetic and develop
prenatally. Brain scans of 152 children show anatomical variations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brains of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
are clearly different from those of normal children, a new
brain-imaging study has shown, providing further evidence that the
problem is biologically based.</LD>
<LD>   The study of 152 children casts doubt on lingering theories that
ADHD is caused by food allergies or isn't a real illness. Instead,
the research shows, children with the disorder have anatomical
differences in several parts of the brain, which probably accounts
for the symptoms of restlessness, poor concentration, distractibility
and talkativeness they typically experience.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like the whole brain is involved with ADHD, but some
parts are more affected than others," said Dr. Francisco X.
Castellanos, director of the Institute for Pediatric Neuroscience at
the New York University Child Study Center and lead investigator of
the study.</LD>
<TE>   Using brain scans taken over 10 years, the study compared the
children with ADHD with 139 normal children in the same age range.
Although Castellanos calls brain studies on ADHD "primitive," the
study produced several findings that should enhance the understanding
of a disorder that affects about 5% of children.</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies suggested that the front part of the brain is
altered in ADHD children, but this study showed differences in
several regions of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   The brains of ADHD children were 3% smaller in volume compared
with normal children.</TE>
<TE>   The brain differences remained the same through a child's
development, which suggests the differences are fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The brain differences among ADHD children who took medication,
such as Ritalin, and those who did not were similar. That suggests
that it's not the medication that causes brain differences, as some
researchers have suggested, Castellanos said.</TE>
<TE>   Although medication helps resolve the symptoms of ADHD in some
children, "medication didn't change the brain," Castellanos said.</TE>
<TE>   The study did show, however, that children with ADHD who took
medication were similar to normal kids in terms of the brain's white
matter, which contains nerve fibers. Although far from proven, that
could suggest that medication enhances the normal development of that
part of the brain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the brain differences remain largely unchanged
suggests that the cause of ADHD occurs prenatally -- it could be
genetic -- or early in life, giving researchers more avenues to
explore regarding the causes of ADHD and variations of the disorder,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The research also should reassure parents, teachers and children
with the disorder that no one is to blame for difficulties children
encounter.</TE>

<HD>An expert guide to exercises that heal</HD>
<DH>Fill these prescriptions at the gym, outdoors or anywhere
you can move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Krucoff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When most people think of medicine, they visualize a pill to be
popped, a liquid to be swallowed or an injection to be endured. But
in recent years, study after study has shown that one of the most
potent forms of "medicine" is movement.</LD>
<LD>   Health experts now prescribe exercise to help prevent and treat a
broad array of ailments, ranging from certain cancers to heart
disease, stroke and even sexual dysfunction. The basic recommendation
is to accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise, most days
of the week. But specific advice varies, depending on an individual's
fitness level and health goals.</LD>
<LD>   Based on research results and interviews with exercise scientists,
here are exercise guidelines for several disorders.</LD>
<TE>   Premenstrual syndrome</TE>
<TE>   Regular exercise can improve the flow of blood and fluids
throughout the body, which decreases fluid-related symptoms such as
abdominal bloating and constipation; increase the effectiveness of
insulin, which helps stabilize blood sugar levels and decreases food
cravings; and strengthen back and abdominal muscles, which reduces
back pain and cramping. It also can relieve anxiety and depression
and boost mood.</TE>
<TE>   Do some form of aerobic activity three to six days a week, at
about 55% to 90% of your maximum heart rate, for 20 to 60 minutes.
Pick an activity you enjoy and do it daily, or almost daily,
throughout your cycle -- not just on symptomatic days. Although
short, 10-minute bouts can boost cardiovascular fitness, activity
should last for at least 20 to 30 uninterrupted minutes to provide
maximum benefit to PMS sufferers. Consider exercising in fresh air
and sunlight when possible -- both can enhance mood. A regular
practice of mind-body exercise, such as tai chi or yoga, can be
helpful, as can specific yoga postures -- such as lying down
cobbler's pose -- to relieve some symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Asthma</TE>
<TE>   Regular physical activity can decrease the frequency and severity
of asthma attacks, reduce the need for medication, cut down on
absences from school and work, and improve quality of life. Of
course, discuss exercise plans with your health-care provider,
especially if activity tends to bring on symptoms; always use
prescribed medications, if necessary, before exercise; and warm up
for at least five minutes before exercise and cool down after
exercise to help prevent symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Pick a form of exercise that is less likely to induce symptoms,
such as swimming and aqua-aerobics, because water tends to moisten
inhaled air. Moderate-intensity activities and stop-and-go activities
(such as racquet sports or golf) also may be less likely to provoke
symptoms. Your goal is to do at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity
most days of the week. In addition, practice deep-breathing and
relaxation exercises for at least five minutes a day.</TE>
<TE>   High cholesterol</TE>
<TE>   Burn at least 1,000 calories per week -- the equivalent of walking
or running eight to 10 miles -- through some form of moderate to
vigorous aerobic activity. One of the easiest options is walking
three miles, three days a week or walking 30 minutes a day. You can
also break this up into two daily 15-minute walks. Although most
people don't need to consult a physician before doing moderate
activity, check with your doctor if you're planning to start a
program of vigorous exercise and you're a man over 40, a woman over
50, if you have risk factors for heart disease (such as cigarette
smoking, diabetes or obesity) or if you have a chronic disease.</TE>
<TE>   Depression, anxiety, stress</TE>
<TE>   Find an activity you enjoy and can commit to doing regularly.
Dancing, gardening, in-line skating, yoga -- virtually anything that
moves you is fine. Start slowly and progress gradually, working
toward the goal of being continuously active for at least 30 minutes
a day. Consider exercising outdoors when possible -- bright light is
known to improve mood. Don't worry about taking your pulse or burning
calories. And don't make the exercise so challenging that it
contributes to stress or feelings of inadequacy. Just enjoy the
sensations of moving your body.</TE>
<TE>   Osteoporosis</TE>
<TE>   Many of the exercises to prevent osteoporosis, such as those used
in resistance training, are well known -- but sometimes poorly
executed.</TE>
<TE>   To build strong bones, children and teens should get at least 30
to 60 minutes of physical activity daily. For optimum bone health,
choose sports that involve jumping and running such as basketball,
rope-skipping and soccer. To help maintain bone, adults should do at
least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise most days of the week
plus 30 minutes of resistance exercise two or three days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Weight-bearing exercises are those in which body weight is
supported by the legs and feet, such as walking, stair-climbing,
dancing and running. (Swimming and bicycling are non-weight-bearing
activities.) Upside-down weight-bearing activities -- such as
handstand and other inverted postures in yoga -- can strengthen bones
in the arms and upper body. The higher the impact of the activity,
the more it strengthens bones.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance exercises, such as working out with free weights or
weight machines, should include eight to 10 strengthening exercises
for all the major muscle groups. Use a heavy weight that you can lift
at least eight, but no more than about 12, times with good technique.
(Older and frailer people may find it more appropriate to choose a
lighter weight they can lift at least 10, but no more than 15,
times.)</TE>
<TE>   Doing lots of repetitions with a very light weight won't do much
for your bones; bones add density when greater demands are placed on
them.</TE>

<HD>Walk this way to pain relief</HD>
<DH>Experts from doctors to physical therapists are recognizing
that good posture and balance are essential to overall well-being.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone watching Mike Kaplan walk across a room could see something
was wrong. He strode stiffly, barely bending his knees, his shoulders
rounded, his head hanging forward. Back in high school, when he
played football, his knees had become so badly damaged that he
stopped bending them when he walked because it hurt too much.</LD>
<LD>   Now in his mid-50s, Kaplan, an educational company president, was
so busy powering through life he hadn't given much thought to
correcting his posture or gait. Then, last fall, the pain in his
chronically aching back became so severe that simple daily
activities, such as bending over the sink to shave, became difficult
to bear. So he decided to do something about it, going to
orthopedists and then other health professionals in search of help.</LD>
<LD>   While walking may seem as natural and effortless as breathing,
many people, like Kaplan, develop bad habits along the way. Perhaps
it's the wear and tear of life. Some experts believe that, as
children, we tend to mimic the posture of our parents. For others,
some kind of injury or medical condition may alter the way we sit,
stand and walk. It's a problem that's easy to ignore -- until we're
fed up with how we look or faced with debilitating pain. A growing
number of doctors, physical therapists and back specialists are
recognizing the importance of good posture and balance.</LD>
<TE>   Incorrect body alignment strains muscles and joints, damage that
is compounded with every step. Considering that we take thousands of
steps a day, even a minor posture error repeated countless times
eventually may lead to chronic pain in the back, neck, shoulders,
hips, knees and ankles.</TE>
<TE>   Like many pain sufferers, Kaplan shuttled among specialists until
an orthopedic surgeon referred him to Sherry Brourman, a West Los
Angeles physical therapist and yoga teacher who specializes in
patients with structural pain.</TE>
<TE>   Brourman, the author of "Walk Yourself Well" (Hyperion, 1998), has
devised a system of simple corrective walking techniques and
exercises that aims to restore balance and natural movement patterns,
allowing the body to heal.</TE>
<TE>   On Kaplan's first visit, Brourman asked him to walk back and forth
in her cozy living room, which doubles as her studio. She noticed
right away that he had several gait defects: His feet were turned out
too far, his knees and hips were locked, his arms were stiff, and his
upper back was rounded so that he leaned forward for balance.</TE>
<TE>   "His body was a string of compensation strategies," Brourman says.
"There is an arc to each step where you go up and back down for the
next step. With each step, you contract the muscles in the buttocks,
which are the motor that drives the walk. Mike wasn't engaging these
muscles at all."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan was dubious that something so basic as how he walked could
be causing such problems, but he was desperate. "It seemed very
foreign for someone to teach you how to walk."</TE>
<TE>   Brourman dismantled the elements of his gait and reassembled them,
starting with his feet. "I always liken the feet to two cars -- all
eight wheels should be getting an equal share of weight," she says.
"Mike was walking on his outside wheels."</TE>
<TE>   In weekly one-hour sessions over the next six months, she trained
him to pull out his heels, so that his feet were pointing outward at
about a 15-degree angle instead of 30 degrees, and to plant his feet
as wide apart as his hips, distributing his weight more evenly.
Kaplan tightened his ankles to keep them from turning inward. He
learned to bend his knees and to rotate his hips with each step,
shifting his weight from side to side. Finally, he worked on getting
a more natural motion in his arms, swinging them forward and back
instead of holding them stiffly at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Brourman also taught him yoga poses that reinforced each gait
correction. The exercises helped to stretch out muscles weakened by
years of inactivity.</TE>
<TE>   It felt unnatural at first because Kaplan was altering deeply
ingrained habits.  "Coming here felt like going to Hebrew school," he
recalls, "like learning this bizarre foreign language."</TE>
<TE>   And the retraining didn't end with his one-hour sessions. Brourman
gave homework: 20 minutes of practicing how to walk correctly and 45
minutes of yoga exercises each day. The time involved suggests that
people who practice Brourman's program have to be motivated enough to
stick with the routine to gain lasting relief.</TE>
<TE>   Although he's come a long way in six months, Kaplan has more work
to do. He hasn't yet integrated all the movements into a graceful
gait; his walk still tends to look exaggerated and self-conscious.
"People make fun of me," he says. "But I don't care. I'm not in pain
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other techniques</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Brourman's technique is one of several methods that can
ease chronic pain by changing the way sufferers move. Others include
yoga, the Alexander technique, which focuses on the relationship of
the head, neck and back and teaches people to incorporate improved
coordination into their daily activities, such as walking, bending,
sitting or talking; and the Feldenkrais method, in which intense body
massage is used in combination with movement exercises that help
people become more flexible and efficient.</TE>

<LD>Sherry Brourman's technique is one of several methods that can ease
chronic pain by changing the way sufferers move. Others include yoga,
the Alexander technique, which focuses on the relationship of the
head, neck and back and teaches people to incorporate improved
coordination into their daily activities, such as walking, bending,
sitting or talking; and the Feldenkrais method, in which intense body
massage is used in combination with movement exercises that help
people become more flexible and efficient.</LD>

<HD>When training gets too personal</HD>
<DH>One-on-one workouts can lead to romance, but that can put
trainer and client on the spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The client-trainer relationship is a unique one and should not be
entered into lightly. Client pays trainer to get him or her into
shape, but sessions are rarely perfunctory. To put it bluntly,
there's all that touching and sweating and grunting and scantily
cladness and rippling of muscles going on, not to mention the
chitchat between reps about everything from last night's football
game to sticky divorce proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Having a bad body image day? Trainers can make you feel like an
Olympic athlete. It's that closeness that often leads to friendships,
and friendships that sometimes progress to dating. And therein lies
the rub: How far should the client-trainer relationship go?</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of gray area," says Tom Heavy, national personal
training director for Crunch Fitness. "We can only control what
happens within the four walls of the club, and we tell our trainers
that they need to keep it on a professional level, don't let it
develop beyond that.... We can't tell a trainer you can't go out with
someone, but we highly recommend they don't."</LD>
<TE>   "There have been circumstances where I've been invited to parties
or wine tastings or family get-togethers," says Eric LeClair, a
trainer with Foothill Gym in Monrovia. "If it's an event with a lot
of people that's out in public, no problem."</TE>
<TE>   Some clients, though, make it clear they'd prefer a one-on-one
situation. "Usually people ask what my rates are," says LeClair,
"then ask if I'll come to the house, or they'll want to meet for
lunch. But in this industry image is almost everything and I don't
want to jeopardize my career."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has spent time in a gym knows there are those trainers
who seem to revel in a reputation that borders on skanky -- the ones
who touch clients that way and are all too happy to offer private
sessions. And when clients are the aggressors, trainers must fend off
advances without sparking animosity and retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Since trainers aren't licensed -- the way doctors, therapists and
lawyers are -- they're not legally bound to the same ethical
standards that prevent intimate contact and dating. Realizing that an
unsullied character is worth its weight in barbells, some personal
trainer certification programs, such as the American College of
Sports Medicine, have recently started discussing how to handle
client-trainer relationships. Gyms also are teaching their trainers
how to keep everything on the up and up.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespersons for a half-dozen gyms in the L.A. area were asked if
trainers have ever been fired or memberships revoked because of
inappropriate conduct; some reported no problems and others declined
to comment, citing privacy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Alyma Dorsey, manager of personal training at Crunch in Los
Angeles, sees the potential for problems with some trainers,
including one new woman who is "absolutely gorgeous." No client has
asked for a date yet, but "I see how they look at her and they're
going to want to train with her because of how she looks, not because
she's a good trainer. Her training is a little girly and not
aggressive, so I tell her how to walk through the gym with an air of
confidence, like she owns the gym, and that's going to make those
guys think twice about hitting on her."</TE>
<TE>   Not that all client-trainer relationships are bad news. For every
horror story or unhappy ending there's a good one, some resulting in
a walk down the aisle or a lasting friendship. "We had a good rapport
right away," says Sydney Gilner, a script supervisor from Highland
Park, of her former trainer. "He's such a nice man. And he looks
great, too, thin and muscular but not, like, scary. But he had a
girlfriend, and getting involved is bad karma. We were friends, and
we're still friends."</TE>
<TE>   "If you come in with the idea that this is going to be a strictly
professional relationship where you just talk about how many sets
you're doing, typically those are very short-lived," says Dino Nowak,
general manager of Equinox gym in Pasadena. "It's more rewarding if
you become friends. The ultimate goal of a trainer is to get results,
and a good relationship increases compliancy -- they're looking
forward to working out. It's not like going to the dentist. There is
a line you can cross, getting too personal too soon, but retention is
much higher when a trainer can be himself, be friendly, be someone
the client can trust."</TE>
<TE>   It ultimately comes down to individual comfort zones, whether
that's going to a movie or going further. Some who have crossed the
line say they learned a valuable lesson in the process.</TE>
<TE>   When Kevin Holden, director of print advertising for NBC in
Burbank, started dating his personal trainer, the two used to joke
about what would happen should they break up. When they eventually
did, Holden says, "I tried going back on my own, but it was too
awkward trying to find another time when he wasn't there. And then
I'd see him with another client and wonder if they were dating. So I
stepped away for a while. When I finally did get another trainer, I
told him that I had dated my last one and that I wanted to keep this
strictly professional. It was great. There were no distractions."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer and professional athlete Antony Galvan recalls the time
one former client who had recently had breast implants "took off her
top in the middle of doing sit-ups and said, 'Do these look right to
you?' I tried to keep a very professional face on. That was crazy."</TE>
<TE>   He admits they did go out, but it ended up being a big mistake:
"I've got some hot clients right now and it's not even remotely
erotic because you can't let it be. I don't even let myself go there.
I can see what the outcome would be. And then either I'd lose my $700
a month or I'd never be able to look at her again, and you know, it's
not worth it."</TE>

<HD>Underweight at birth, stressed out in middle age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low birth weight and poor growth in early childhood have long been
linked to poor psychological development, but now researchers have
found that the relationship persists into middle age. To a certain
degree, they say, lighter infants tend to be less able to handle
stress well as adults.</LD>
<LD>   In a study of nearly 10,000 babies born at or near full term in
Britain in the same week in 1958, those who weighed less than about
5.5 pounds at birth were more susceptible to stress at age 42.
Previous studies had shown this phenomenon persisted only up to age
26.</LD>
<LD>   But the researchers also found that small newborns can compensate
-- in terms of long-term mental health -- by achieving a normal
weight in early childhood.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a fantastic study. It's an incredible effort to follow
people for 42 years, but there are limitations," says Dr. Daniel
Batton, director of newborn medicine at William Beaumont Hospital in
Royal Oak, Mich. For instance, although the researchers attempted to
eliminate the effects of mothers' smoking during pregnancy on the
child's weight, there are many reasons a child would be underweight
that might affect his or her health -- physical and psychological --
later in life.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the study, the children were weighed at birth and again
at age 7. As adults, they took tests at age 23, 33 and/or 42 that
assessed certain psychological characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   The study's lead author, Yin Bun Cheung, a biostatician at the
National Cancer Centre in Singapore, says more research is needed to
learn if the babies' outlook could be improved by, say, helping them
gain weight.</TE>

<TE>   Antiviral drug may reduce spread of genital herpes</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, an antiviral medication has proved effective
in lowering the chances of transmission of genital herpes.</TE>
<TE>   In an eight-month study of more than 1,400 people with genital
herpes, valacylovir hydrochloride (Valtrex) reduced transmission to
partners by up to 77% in those who took the drug compared with those
who took a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   The study, funded by GlaxoSmithKline (the maker of Valtrex), was
presented Sept. 27 at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy in San Diego. The couples, all heterosexual
and monogamous, were also counseled to practice safe sex and use
condoms.</TE>
<TE>   The antiviral drug also reduced transmission by 50% in those whose
blood tested positive for the virus even if they didn't have
symptoms. It is possible for the virus to be transmitted without
causing symptoms, which is especially dangerous because the infected
person often doesn't know they have the virus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heart imaging encouraged for female patients</TE>
<TE>   Women have a long history of being under-diagnosed and
under-treated for heart disease -- about 38% die within one year
after hospitalization for a heart attack, compared with 25% of men.
Now, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology aims to change that
dire statistic.</TE>
<TE>   In a new consensus statement, the group recommends more frequent
use of a widely available imaging test called a gated myocardial
perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography -- or, much more
simply, a "gated SPECT." The test involves injection of a radioactive
material and a scan that creates images of heart muscle blood flow;
an electrocardiogram is done at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear cardiologists, who study noninvasive ways of assessing
blood flow to the heart, say that the imaging test is a more valuable
diagnostic tool than an exercise stress test for women who cannot do
a stress test, who have diabetes or who have an abnormal resting ECG.
The imaging test can be done at rest, after exercise or after a drug
is given to increase the heart rate.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every woman needs this test, but it is extremely useful in
patients with suspected heart disease," says Dr. Daniel Berman,
director of nuclear cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles and a contributing author of the consensus statement.</TE>

<LD>Seven thousand, four hundred and eighty-two. Seven thousand, four
hundred and .... One night, while walking my way to 10,000 steps,
which health experts now urge as a daily benchmark, I realized it's
harder to walk and count 10,000 steps than to let a pedometer do the
work. No wonder the age-old pedometer, a pager-sized device that
counts steps by electronically measuring knee-to-hip vibrations, is
suddenly hot.</LD>
<LD>   Here are the best of the new breed:</LD>
<LD>   You walk, it talks</LD>
<TE>   Sportline Talking Pedometer: Music! Talk! Blares six classical
pieces from tiny speaker and gabs at the press of a button (i.e.,
"You have walked 3,310 steps; the distance is 1.9 miles. It is 12:12
a.m."). Music tempo increases as you do.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Beautiful. Highly motivating. No eyestrain. Easy setup.
Works perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: No night light or volume control, so you wake the
neighborhood dogs. Forward-facing screen, so you have to hold it to
your face to read. Finally, classical's nice, but I like rap.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $29. (800) 338-6337.</TE>
<TE>   Tune in to tune out</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Scientific Pedometer with FM radio: Kidney-shaped,
flip-open ped/radio with auto scan, volume control and headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Clear, vivid sound. Readable display.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Headphone wire flops around. Irritating five-second
screech interrupts music when backlight button pushed. And how about
a more creative name -- like "Walk 'n' Roll"?</TE>
<TE>   Price: $29.95. (888) 274-7980.</TE>
<TE>   Don't miss a beat</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle Ergo-Touch Pulse: Large, loaded, seashell-shaped unit

to read. Too tall; sticks up into belly.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $40. (800) 949-1563. www.freestyleusa.com.</TE>
<TE>   Be alarmed, be very alarmed</TE>
<TE>   Brunton Digital Alarm Pedometer: Muggers beware. Includes built-in
120-decibel panic alarm with pull-cord activation.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Deafening, ear-splitting alarm lasts 15 minutes. Sleek
faux-aluminum design. Quality feel, function.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Though convenient -- readout of well-defined numerals
looks straight up -- there's eyestrain because of tiny numerals and
chance for shirt or belly to obscure view.</TE>

<HD>Marijuana study tries to bring facts to heated debate</HD>
<DH>A doctor takes a scientific look at the illegal drug's
effects on HIV patients with painful symptoms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In March, in a hospital room tucked in a quiet corner of San
Francisco General Hospital, a 39-year-old AIDS patient made history
of sorts when he lighted a marijuana cigarette -- legally. He is the
first of 16 volunteers participating in a study of whether the
illicit herb can relieve the pain in the hands and feet that afflicts
people with HIV.</LD>
<LD>   Although anecdotal stories abound about marijuana's therapeutic
powers, there is no data to support such claims. Dr. Donald I.
Abrams, who's heading the study at UC San Francisco, says his
research -- and similar studies that are getting underway -- are an
attempt "to inject some facts into this very emotionally charged
debate."</LD>
<LD>   Scientific interest in medicinal marijuana is blooming. It has
been kindled, in part, by the recent discovery of a molecular
signaling system in the brain and other parts of the body activated
by cannabinoids, naturally occurring compounds that are chemical
cousins to THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in
marijuana, according to Abrams. Research suggests this system affects
movement and emotional excitability, appetite and the growth of
cancerous tumors -- and may be as potent as morphine in reducing
pain. These findings may explain why smoking marijuana has a calming
effect, combats nausea or gives users the munchies.</LD>
<TE>   Smoking, of course, is a crude and hazardous way of delivering
THC, and scientists eventually hope to synthesize marijuana's
medicinal compounds into a pill. But right now, Abrams' main
objective is doing bulletproof science. Because of the tremendous
controversy, he says, "we have a burden to do this correctly."</TE>
<TE>   An AIDS doctor since the epidemic began, Abrams knew many of his
patients smoked pot to curb nausea and stimulate their appetites,
which is why he wanted to study its medicinal potential. In 1998,
after a lengthy battle to get funding from the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, Abrams conducted the first test of pot on people with
HIV. That study showed marijuana helped patients gain weight without
weakening their immune system.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, his current study will be broadened to involve
100 subjects, half of whom will receive a placebo or dummy cigarette.
Abrams is also in the initial phase of tests that use cannabis to
ease pain in patients with bone metastases from advanced breast and
prostate cancer. "We're looking to see if there is a beneficial
interaction between cannabis and morphine, and if pot can decrease
the side effects of these opiates," he says.</TE>
<TE>   A potential powerhouse</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco study is the first sponsored by the Center for
Medicinal Cannabis Research. Managed by the University of California,
the center is funded by a 1999 state law that provides $3 million
annually for three years to study marijuana's potential use.</TE>
<TE>   The active ingredient in marijuana appears to be the Swiss Army
knife of therapeutics: a powerful painkiller that also can combat
cancer, curb nausea, stimulate appetite, reduce anxiety, ease joint
stiffness and control muscle spasms.</TE>
<TE>   The center has so far given the go-ahead to 15 projects,
two-thirds of which have cleared many federal regulatory hurdles,
including scrutiny from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse and the Food and Drug Administration. Four
studies -- on AIDS patients, multiple sclerosis sufferers and people
with metastatic cancer -- are already underway, and several more are
gearing up, making this "the largest program ever done in the U.S. on
this topic," says Dr. Igor Grant, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego.</TE>

<HD>There could be something to prostate supplement</HD>

<LD>Herbs for prostate cancer? Doctors in this country have gone from
ridiculing to recommending to once again rejecting the idea, all in a
few years. But the debate over using natural therapy to treat this
difficult disease is not over.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, thousands of American men battling prostate
cancer were stunned when the dietary supplement PC Spes was taken off
the market. Studies have shown that the blend of eight herbs slows
tumor growth and prolongs life in men with advanced cancer who have
stopped responding to conventional therapies.</LD>
<LD>   In February, however, California health officials discovered that
batches of PC Spes were contaminated with warfarin, a blood thinner.
The news got worse. Subsequent lab testing of PC Spes turned up the
presence of DES, an estrogen-like drug formerly used to treat
prostate cancer. (DES can cause side effects such as blood clots and
breast enlargement, which is why it's rarely used today.) Officials
at BotanicLab, the Brea company that marketed PC Spes, have said they
aren't sure how the pills became tainted. Facing lawsuits and a
public relations fiasco, BotanicLab went out of business in June.
Just before the company shut down, a headline in the Wall Street
Journal proclaimed "Prostate-Cancer Herbs Gone for Good."</LD>
<TE>   Don't be so sure. Natural Approaches to Prostate Cancer, a
nonprofit group in Portland, Ore., hopes to introduce a supplement
containing the same combination of herbs in PC Spes by early next
year. Already, copycat supplements with sound-alike names and similar
ingredients are for sale on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   And scientists remain intrigued by PC Spes. Many men who used the
supplement, and some physicians who recommended it for patients for
whom standard treatments had failed, suspect that the herbal
preparation was merely a cheap drug -- DES -- mixed with herbs and
sold at a hefty price.</TE>
<TE>   As the controversy waned, new information emerged. For example,
researchers at UC San Francisco and Harvard University were
conducting a clinical trial comparing men with prostate cancer who
were taking PC Spes or DES. The researchers stopped the trial after
California officials discovered the tainted batches of PC Spes.
However, preliminary results from that study showed that men
receiving PC Spes were faring better than those taking DES. PSA
levels (a measure of prostate tumor growth) had dropped in 45% of the
men using herbs, contrasted with 21% of the DES men.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the men taking PC Spes had more than twice the
response suggests that the herbs may have cancer-fighting properties
independent of any possible benefits conferred by traces of DES, says
Dr. Jeffrey White, director of the office of cancer complementary and
alternative medicine at the National Cancer Institute. White says
it's too soon to assume that PC Spes was largely DES in disguise.</TE>
<TE>   Research led by Dr. Phillip Koeffler, chief of hematology and
oncology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and a
scientist at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center, has shown that components
found in a purified version of PC Spes not only disable hormones that
feed the growth of prostate cancer, but also cause cancer cells to
commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Koeffler theorized that if something in PC Spes combats prostate
cancer cells, then it was worth trying the herbs against other
cancers. Last month, his team published a paper in the journal Cancer
Research showing that a substance in PC Spes called baicalin may halt
colon cancer. Specially bred cancer-prone mice that were fed baicalin
developed half as many colon polyps (small formations in the
intestines that often develop into malignant tumors) as mice that
didn't eat baicalin. Koeffler's team also has shown in test tube
studies that PC Spes may fight lung cancer and leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   PC Spes probably wouldn't show such diverse cancer-fighting
potential if its only active ingredient was the estrogen-like DES,
says Koeffler. "I'm 99% sure that estrogen doesn't have any effect on
leukemia. I'm fairly sure it has no effect on lung cancer. And it
probably doesn't have any effect on colon cancer," he says. "I doubt
the anti-tumor effects we've noticed are due to that contaminant."</TE>
<TE>   Other observers are less convinced PC Spes has much effect on
cancer. "Baicalin works," says Dr. Robert Nagourney of Rational
Therapeutics in Long Beach. The question -- still unanswered -- is
whether PC Spes contains anywhere near the amount of baicalin needed
to produce a therapeutic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Nagourney coauthored a study that appeared in last month's Journal
of the National Cancer Institute in which he and colleagues analyzed
the content of several batches of PC Spes. They found that batches
laced with high amounts of DES were far more effective in killing
cancer cells than batches that had little or no DES. (The study also
turned up more traces of warfarin, as well as the anti-inflammatory
drug indomethacin.)</TE>
<TE>   In August, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine announced that three lab studies of PC Spes that it was
funding, but had suspended after the controversy, could resume.</TE>

<HD>The narcissist, unmasked</HD>
<DH>Behind the confident face is a self-loathing that
therapists are just learning to confront.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They've got the most fabulous personal trainer in town, the best
lawyer, the top BMW mechanic, and make sure the world knows it.</LD>
<LD>   They're charming enough to attract friends, associates and lovers
-- only to drop them as soon as better prospects show up. They need
the best table in the house, the lion's share of the conversation
and, above all, top billing, whether on the marquee or in the
mailroom.</LD>
<LD>   While familiar at almost any level of society, these peacocks find
Southern California an especially comfortable habitat. In the warm
bath of sunlight and celebrity, their behavior can be entertaining,
even encouraged, and it's usually relatively harmless.</LD>
<TE>   Yet some of these seemingly overconfident people are actually in
considerable psychological trouble, suffering what psychiatrists call
narcissistic personality disorder, one of the most self-destructive
and difficult-to-treat conditions in the lexicon of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   For contrary to Narcissus of Greek legend, who was enthralled by
his own reflection in a pool of water, researchers say that roughly 1
million Americans with this personality disorder act not from
self-love but from a kind of self-loathing, a dread of failure and an
inability to endure its emotional fallout -- shame. Millions more are
thought to suffer from narcissistic tendencies, due to similar but
less extreme fears. Recent research suggests that this anguish
develops in early childhood, and that therapists can help put it to
rest. New treatments combine advice on handling everyday situations
-- so-called cognitive therapy -- with emotional forays into the
unconscious more typical of psychoanalysis.</TE>
<TE>   This integration of biology and psychology amounts to a "paradigm
shift" in the way that therapists understand conditions such as
narcissism, said Allan Schore, a UCLA behavioral specialist and
expert on the origins of personality disorders. "The essential thing
seems to be that the patient not only see their narcissism, and talk
about it," he said, "but also that they have a physical experience of
the emotion that underlies it -- rage, shame, sadness, whatever it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Disorder's specific traits</TE>
<TE>   The word "narcissist" is so commonly thrown around that it's in
danger of becoming an all-purpose label for any difficult character,
in the same way that "chauvinist" or "fascist" was used a generation
ago. When psychiatrists diagnose the disorder, however, they do so on
the basis of several specific traits. These include a grandiose sense
of self-importance, in which talents and personal achievements are
vastly exaggerated; a desperate need for admiration; an almost
absolute blindness to the needs and feelings of others; and continual
fantasies of power, ideal love and success that far outstrip the
ordinariness of many narcissists' lives.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, when deployed in a business that feeds on
self-promotion and star power, such as entertainment or music, these
qualities often produce just that: a star, a sensation, the sort of
executive or performer who lands in a Brentwood estate with a chef
and a fleet of German sports cars. But add to this carefully
cantilevered life some imperfect elements -- a demanding spouse,
young kids, sluggish box office or sales -- and you can almost hear
the joists creaking. When deprived of across-the-board success in the
outside world, narcissists' need for attention may turn inward,
causing depression, mood swings, even exacerbating physical pain,
said Marc Schoen, a UCLA School of Medicine psychologist. "And of
course their pain is always much, much worse than anyone else's," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Marriages often wither under such selfish complaint. Alcohol and
drug problems are commonplace. Usually it's only a matter of time,
therapists say, before there's trouble in the arena that's often the
most gratifying, work. "That's when they come to see someone like
me," said Dr. Robert Neborsky, a San Diego therapist who specializes
in difficult-to-treat patients, some 40% of whom have narcissistic
tendencies, if not the whole package, he estimates. "At some point
they look around and realize that at home, and at work, everyone
hates them." The narcissistic longing for admiration has brought
loathing instead, and they don't know why.</TE>
<TE>   As patients, they're no treat, either. Pompous one moment and
solicitous the next, alternately contemptuous and then exuberantly
affectionate, narcissists qualify as among the worst therapy
candidates on Earth. They may know something is wrong but resist
treatment so vigorously because the nature of the disorder is based
on self-defense and deception of others -- even a therapist trying to
help. In his description of the condition in 1914, Sigmund Freud
declared them all but uncurable. At the first hint of disappointment
or challenge they might stalk out of the room. Neborsky has told
patients that unless they let down their guard and stop trying to
outwit him, there's nothing he can do for them.</TE>
<TE>   One such patient, a 36-year-old Los Angeles rock musician named
Jason, returned to Neborsky's office when he found he could no longer
bear his own company. Powerful narcissistic impulses had alienated
those around him, he said. He was suffering severe bouts of
depression. "I was the type of person who had to be the biggest rock
star within 100 miles, and every time I turned on the radio and heard
other bands it was just torture," he said. "Partly, it's the
business.... The definition of narcissist should say 'lead
guitarist.' "</TE>
<TE>   The mask of high self-approval must crack, under the strain of
some catastrophe at home or at work, before there's any plea for
help, therapists say. It is the new awareness among some therapists
that they must be patient and wait for pain to show itself that has
helped many of them achieve success. That reaction does not have to
spill out from a welter of childhood memories; it may be connected to
something that happened at work the previous week, or even in
therapy. "Often there's a break when the therapist goes on vacation,
and isn't around when the person is in need," said Dr. James
Grotstein, a psychoanalyst in Los Angeles. "The patient is just
outraged to learn that I'm not an extension of him, or her. That's
the beginning of an emotional connection."</TE>
<TE>   The hot flush of shame, or anger; the heavy ache of sadness, or
loss: These physical sensations themselves, expressed in the presence
of a capable therapist, appear to activate areas in the brain that
did not develop normally in narcissists' second year of life, said
Schore. Researchers do not know exactly why the development goes
awry. Some -- in a revival of what has become an out-of-fashion point
of view -- attribute the problem to parents who can't or don't
properly soothe their toddler's disappointments: teaching the child,
in effect, to avoid failure at all costs, rather than learning to
cope with it.</TE>
<TE>   Frozen in childhood?</TE>
<TE>   Other theorists are convinced that parents' indulgence of their
child's moods and demands freezes the boy or girl in a state of
childlike grandiosity. Either way, brain imaging studies suggest that
deficits in the emotional connection between small children and their
mother (or primary caregiver) appear to affect the development of
right-brain areas involved in empathy and compassion. Although
speculative, this notion is influential in the way some therapists
think about narcissism, and places the disorder in the context of
some cutting-edge research.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence that a therapist can directly affect these areas of
the brain in narcissists is based on studies of similarly difficult
conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one recent
experiment, for instance, researchers at UCLA did brain scans on
obsessive-compulsive patients. After 10 weeks of talk therapy, the
patients improved, and the scans showed significantly reduced
activity in a part of the right brain that has been linked to
compulsive behavior and personality disorders, including narcissism.
In another experiment, Swedish investigators reported in May that
therapists induced similar changes in patients with social phobia.
The very same principle is at work when narcissists are successfully
engaged, Schore argues.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly when an emotional connection is made, against all odds,
patients become more open to practical advice they can use to
regulate their behavior day to day, psychologists say. A patient
learns to spot the destructive pattern as it develops and to defuse
it. "You're talking about the kind of person who might be standing in
the checkout line, and suddenly have a flash of disrespect, a real
hurt, because he doesn't feel he's being waited on properly--and now
wants to punish someone for that," said Judith Beck, director of the
Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research in suburban
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   One of Beck's recent patients, a retired corporate executive, was
so accustomed to star treatment at work and at home that he became
furious whenever he was treated normally, whether at the dry cleaner
or library checkout counter. Before attending social events the man
would prepare himself to be preemptively nasty toward strangers he
assumed would not appreciate his specialness. Beck had him trade
those put-downs for questions: What kind of work do you do? How did
you get involved in that area? "He was flabbergasted at the
response," Beck said. "No one attacked him; people reacted very
positively. This went a long way in changing his idea that he had to
always be on guard."</TE>
<TE>   Techniques like this also can help narcissists avoid outbursts at
friends or family members, psychologists say. When it comes to
romantic relationships in particular, many patients consider their
spouse or partner as an extension of themselves, there to provide
admiration and support and nothing else, said Marion Solomon, a
Westwood therapist whose 1992 book "Narcissism and Intimacy"
discusses techniques for resolving narcissism in couples therapy.
"Sometimes all it takes is for the wife to be late to a dinner
party," she said, "and now he's yelling at her, 'How could you do
this to me?'</TE>
<TE>   "For the true narcissist there's no acknowledgment that this is a
separate person, with their own needs and thoughts and desires. Just
getting a patient to see that can make a difference in a
relationship."</TE>

<HD>The smallpox dilemma</HD>
<DH>If the vaccine becomes widely available, many families
would face a tough choice: the threat of bioterrorism or the health
risks of the shot itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty years have gone by since every child born in the United States
got a routine smallpox vaccination. We didn't think much about the
vaccine back then, and we haven't had to worry about it since.</LD>
<LD>   That could change. Officials at the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention announced earlier this month that they favor a
plan that would make the vaccine available to the general public. The
Bush administration has not made a decision about public access to
the vaccine; for now, officials are focused more on how to get it to
front-line emergency workers.</LD>
<LD>   But sooner or later each of us probably will have to weigh the
threat of a smallpox attack by terrorists against the threat posed by
the vaccine itself.</LD>
<TE>   It's going to be a tough call in many families. For as the threat
of terror has grown, so has the risk of side effects. In the years
since routine vaccination, we have not only developed new diseases,
such as AIDS, but new drugs, such as cancer-fighting agents, that
suppress the immune system and put millions more at risk of dangerous
vaccine side effects. The smallpox vaccine contains a live virus,
called vaccinia. This virus does not cause human smallpox. But during
the 1960s it spread out of control in about 900 of every 1 million
people, causing rashes, fever and body aches, researchers estimate.
About a dozen of these people developed encephalitis or other
potentially deadly afflictions, and one or two died.</TE>
<TE>   To some, the choice is obvious. "If some attack happened, you'd be
protected," said Fernando Derosa, 33, of Hayward, who volunteered to
receive the vaccine in a clinical trial at Kaiser Permanente in
Oakland. Derosa said the risks of vaccination pale beside the threat
of terror: Smallpox kills about one in three people it infects.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 100 million Americans who got the vaccine as
children also are far less likely to suffer side effects than those
who have not been inoculated, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   But the equation is more complex for millions of Americans with
weakened immune systems. These people may run more than 10 times the
one-in-150,000 odds for serious side effects calculated from the
1960s campaign. And they can catch the vaccinia virus merely by
coming into close contact with someone who has been recently
vaccinated. "This creates a household risk," said Dr. Joel Ward,
director of vaccine research at Harbor-UCLA Research ad Education
Institute in Torrance. "If you get immunized and are living with
someone on chemotherapy, for example, you could spread the virus to
that person." Family members who want the vaccination will have to
weigh the risk to their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   For such reasons, government officials have been very cautious
when advising the public about vaccination. "If there's no attack,
there's no reason to put yourself at risk of the complications of the
vaccine," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, "especially if you're someone
with a weakened immune system."</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for those suffering from eczema, the recurring
outbreaks of itchy, dry, inflamed skin that affect up to 10% to 20%
of people. For reasons no one understands, the prevalence of eczema
has doubled or tripled since the era of routine smallpox vaccination,
according to Dr. Donald Leung of the National Jewish Medical and
Research Center in Denver. When exposed to the vaccine, these men,
women and children are at increased risk of eczema vaccinatum, which
can cause fever, sores, deep scarring--and, in 1% to 6% of cases,
death.</TE>
<TE>   In the months ahead, we're likely to hear a lot about these
complications. The American public is far more wary of vaccines than
it was 30 years ago. The National Vaccine Information Center, an
advocacy group founded in 1982, is made up of many parents who
attribute their children's illnesses and mental disorders to
vaccinations. The group has come out strongly against releasing the
smallpox vaccine to the public. "I would advise parents to talk to
their doctor, get on the Internet and just learn as much as they can
about this before exposing their kids," said Barbara Loe Fisher, the
group's president and co-founder.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of an attack and possible exposure all of these
cautions go out the window, doctors said. "The risk of dying from
smallpox trumps any risk there might be from the vaccine, certainly
in healthy people but also in immuno-suppressed people," Fauci said.</TE>

<LD>This essential mineral is found in oysters, red meat, beans and many
other foods. It gained fame as a supplement in the 1990s for its
purported ability to shorten the duration of a cold.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Important to growth during pregnancy, childhood and
adolescence. Also supports the immune system, promotes wound healing
and helps maintain the sense of taste and smell. Zinc deficiencies
develop in some people, such as alcoholics. Vegetarians can also
become low in zinc.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Recommended dietary allowances -- including upper limits --
have been set for infants, children and adults. Supplement doses
typically range from 10 milligrams to 23 milligrams.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Zinc can be toxic in high amounts (150 milligrams or
more daily).</TE>

<HD>Often, the thyroid is the real culprit</HD>
<DH>Hypothyroidism, frequently undetected, can affect
everything from mood to weight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange and Richard Flaste</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is one of the stealthiest of human maladies: hypothyroidism.
Resulting from an underactive thyroid gland, it can produce
depression, weight gain, high cholesterol, fatigue and a wide range
of other symptoms, each of which may look like a disorder all by
itself. Even though it's the true culprit, the malfunctioning of the
thyroid may never be detected, while the symptoms are being
aggressively treated -- often ineffectively.</LD>
<LD>   But that may be changing. These days the thyroid, like a
schoolchild waving for attention, is finally getting a lot more
notice. Recent research suggests that as many as one in 10 Americans
may suffer from an underactive thyroid. That revelation has given
added credibility to those who argue that the gland should be tested
routinely, just as the heart is regularly examined.</LD>
<LD>   The thyroid sits in the front of the throat, like a bow tie below
the Adam's apple, quietly secreting hormones that circulate through
the bloodstream to every cell of the body. When the gland goes awry,
producing too little hormone (hypothyroidism) or too much hormone
(hyperthyroidism, a much less common condition), body and mind are
thrown out of sync. Too little of the thyroid hormone causes a
body-wide slowdown.</LD>
<TE>   Testing and treatment</TE>
<TE>   One current debate is whether people with slightly underactive
glands should be treated.</TE>
<TE>   The blood test for hypothyroidism is inexpensive and easy. So is
the treatment. A daily dose of thyroid hormones replaces what a
sluggish gland fails to make on its own.</TE>
<TE>   As for diagnosis, there are several indications of hypothyroidism.
One is an elevated level of a thyroid-stimulating hormone in the
blood. Usually called TSH, it is the chemical signal that the
pituitary gland sends to prompt the thyroid into action. Another test
is a direct measurement of the amount of thyroid hormone in the
blood.</TE>
<TE>   But the amount of that hormone may be normal because the
increasing amount of TSH is managing to keep the failing thyroid
pumping adequately. That's why an elevated level of the stimulating
hormone is so telling.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most obvious, but lesser, symptoms of hypothyroidism
are thinning hair, dry skin and puffy eyes. These also come with age,
of course, which is why they are deceptive symptoms. Other subtle
signs are memory lapses, feeling chilled and trouble losing weight.
Some of the indicators are so commonplace that one doctor, a hormone
specialist in fact, sheepishly admits that he missed for far too long
the signs that his own father, also a physician, was suffering from
hypothyroidism and not just the frailty of his years.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the major studies prompting the new vigilance was the
Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence Study, published two years ago.
More than 9% of the 25,000 Colorado residents tested had abnormally
high TSH levels.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a shocker," says Dr. Leonard Wartofsky, chairman of the
department of medicine at the Washington Hospital Center in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   That study was followed by a more diverse survey of 16,000
apparently healthy Americans published this year. It found that 4.6%
had hypothyroidism, even though they seemed symptom-free. The
abnormal test readings were most prevalent in women, the elderly,
whites and Mexican Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of this out there," says Wartofsky, "and studies
are showing that there's a benefit to finding it and treating it."</TE>
<TE>   There's no disagreement about treating anyone with clearly high
levels of the stimulating hormone whether or not the patient has
troubling symptoms. The most active controversy centers on people
whose thyroid is just slightly underactive, a condition that has been
called subclinical or mild hypothyroidism. In these people, there may
be some symptoms or none at all. Nearly half of those with mild
hypothyroidism, according to Wartofsky, will develop the full-blown
disease in five to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   On the testing issue, some kind of consensus among experts is
expected to emerge soon. But for the time being, medical
organizations have been offering a bewildering array of screening
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   One says that men and women over 35 years old should have a blood
test every five years. Another recommends annual screening for those
over 60, especially women. A third puts the spotlight on just about
anyone with a family history of thyroid problems.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the federal group responsible for guidelines, the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- looking at costs as well as
potential benefits -- is on the fence. It says, "There is
insufficient evidence for or against screening."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hot debate," says Inder Chopra, a UCLA endocrinologist and
member of a panel currently considering a recommendation for those
who qualify for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   "You would be doing so many tests," he says, and it "wouldn't
justify the expense."</TE>
<TE>   Disease linked to aging</TE>
<TE>   But E. Chester Ridgway, president elect of the Endocrine Society,
maintains that studies demonstrate that thyroid testing is more
cost-effective than measuring blood cholesterol and equally as
cost-effective as blood pressure or mammography.</TE>
<TE>   He's critical of the federal preventive task force for "really
burying its head in the sand on this one. The prevalence is going to
be much higher. Everybody's anticipating a huge shift to an older
population and more chronic diseases, thyroid being one of them."</TE>
<TE>   The thyroid fails to produce enough hormone for a number of
reasons. Drugs like lithium and interferon can interfere with thyroid
function. An infection or shift in hormones after pregnancy or during
menopause can cause a slowdown that may be temporary or permanent.
Some people are born with an underactive thyroid. But the most
frequent cause is an immune-system failure, often associated with
aging.</TE>
<TE>   One disorder frequently found in elderly women is called
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition in which the body
attacks its own thyroid cells.</TE>
<TE>   Ridgway says that while this disease becomes more prevalent with
age, it can occur in younger people and is "far and away the most
common cause of hypothyroidism in our country."</TE>
<TE>   Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which results in the death of thyroid
cells, was first described in Japan 90 years ago and has been
increasing in this country for about 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Thyroid Assn., the cause is probably a
combination of an inherited tendency and some trigger that has yet to
be identified. There is some speculation that stress may play a role.</TE>
<TE>   This thyroid disease has also been linked to a high intake of
iodine. So anyone with a high TSH reading may want to check for
hidden sources of iodine. Dr. John T. Dunn, a nationally recognized
authority on iodine at the University of Virginia Health Sciences
Center, says there is a lot of iodine in fast food, for instance.</TE>
<TE>He also points to some red food coloring, like the type that is used
to color pills. People who eat kelp should know that certain types
contain very high quantities. Some disinfectants, Dunn says, can be
sources because iodine can be absorbed through the skin. The iodine
in iodized table salt is a relatively minor concern, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox is that the thyroid needs some iodine to make thyroid
hormone, so too little iodine can also cause hypothyroidism.</TE>
<TE>   Thyroid specialists say that if you have any of the symptoms that
might point to hypothyroidism and they have just recently appeared,
let your physician know about it.</TE>
<TE>Your doctor may feel that a blood test is warranted. If the symptoms
have been around awhile, the specialists say, it's less likely that
the thyroid is the cause.</TE>

<CX>   Thyroid disease -- A graphic that accompanied a Health section story
on Oct. 14 gave some incorrect information. The graphic stated that
patients with hypothyroidism (underproduction of thyroid hormones in
the body) should avoid products containing ephedra and caf- feine.</CX>
<CX>      On the contrary, such advice is recommended for patients with
hyperthyroidism (overproduction of thyroid hormones.)</CX>
<CX>      Also, the graphic listed two "common treatments" for
hypothyroidism -- a lifelong regimen of prescription hormone therapy
and dietary changes. The graphic should have explained that hormone
therapy is the recommended conventional medical treatment, and that
health professionals recommend dietary changes as a supplemental
treatment.</CX>

<HD>Slew of Quarterly Earnings Reports on the Way</HD>
<DH>Tech firms Intel and AMD, automakers GM and Ford among
those scheduled to give results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week about 160 of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies are
scheduled to announce earnings, making it the first of the two
busiest weeks in the quarterly reporting season.</LD>
<LD>   Among eagerly anticipated results are those from the world's
largest chip maker, Intel Corp., and its main rival, Advanced Micro
Devices Inc.; No. 1 and No. 2 automakers General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.; and health-care products maker Johnson &amp; Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   With Intel and AMD, the focus will be on what they say about the
crucial last quarter of the year, usually the strongest for the
personal computer industry. Intel reports on Tuesday and AMD on
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "People are going to be looking heavily at the fourth quarter,"
said Dan Niles, an analyst at Lehman Bros., who expects Intel to
report net income of $825 million, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of
$6.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara-based Intel in early September published its
mid-quarter update, tightening its revenue range for the third
quarter to $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion from $6.3 billion to $6.9
billion, reassuring investors at the time that the troubled PC
industry was not getting far worse.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sunnyvale-based AMD stunned investors Oct. 2 with news
that its third-quarter revenue would be 18% below Wall Street
expectations, leading to a large operating loss.</TE>
<TE>   Other big tech names to report this week include IBM Corp. on
Wednesday and Microsoft Corp. on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The earnings statements from GM and Ford can be expected to show
how tough times are for the automakers.</TE>
<TE>   GM, which reports its third-quarter financial results on Tuesday,
and Ford, reporting a day later, are expected to show a profit before
one-time items and special charges. But the results will be razor
thin, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Steps on Gas to Clear Name</HD>
<DH>The Houston firm has mounted a PR campaign to answer
charges that it manipulated energy prices in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Houston's El Paso Corp. is seeking a Texas-style showdown before the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, hoping to overturn a ruling
that it illegally manipulated California's natural gas market.</LD>
<LD>   One analyst has dubbed it "high noon at the FERC building."</LD>
<LD>   El Paso's call for a six-hour hearing before the full commission
is part of a corporate lobbying and public relations blitz that also
includes full-page newspaper ads, regulatory filings and a
letter-writing campaign. The message: El Paso has been given a bum
rap.</LD>
<TE>   FERC's chief administrative law judge ruled Sept. 23 that El Paso
squeezed California's natural gas supplies by not running its
pipeline at full capacity in 2000 and 2001, causing prices of gas --
and the electricity generated from it -- to soar.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso lost more than $4 billion in market value immediately
after the decision by Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. And though the stock
has rebounded slightly, rising Friday nearly 18% to $6.34 on news of
a $165-million pipeline sale, it remains down nearly 46% on the New
York Stock Exchange since the judge's decision was released.</TE>
<TE>   After the ruling, Moody's Investors Service downgraded El Paso's
debt to its lowest investment-grade rating, other credit raters
threatened downgrades, and several stock market analysts lowered
their recommendations on the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   FERC can accept, reject or modify Wagner's ruling and order that
El Paso repay profit from the alleged manipulation. But the real
danger for El Paso lies in lawsuits by Californians who believe they
paid too much for natural gas during the state's energy crisis, legal
and market experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "El Paso certainly is in a tough situation," said Anatol Feygin,
who follows the company for J.P. Morgan Securities and gave the stock
a "neutral" recommendation, down from "buy," after the Wagner ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the tea leaves pointed to El Paso being largely unscathed
in this investigation, and when it turned out that they are not only
scathed but may be having the book thrown at them, it took the
company and the capital markets by surprise," Feygin said. "Now it's
a battle for their lives."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso is demanding a six-hour matchup against its accusers Nov.
22 in front of all four FERC commissioners. That's three hours for El
Paso and three hours for the other guys -- the California Public
Utilities Commission, FERC staff and other complainants -- to present
oral arguments on the issues.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso says the hearing is justified because Wagner's decision
has created intolerable uncertainty about the company's future.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company asked FERC, in an Oct. 4 filing, to
render judgment by the end of the year, because nothing less than the
financial stability of the energy industry and the "strength and
stability of the nation" are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the commission met as a group -- "en banc" in legal
terms -- to listen to oral arguments was in 1997, FERC spokesman
Kevin Cadden said.</TE>
<TE>   FERC has not responded to the request by El Paso. But the plan was
seconded by the California PUC in a filing with the commission
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very significant case," said Harvey Morris, the PUC
lawyer who filed the original April 2000 manipulation complaint
against El Paso and its subsidiaries that run the pipeline to
California and sell gas to customers.</TE>
<TE>   The face-off is just one of the avenues El Paso is pursuing to
restore its reputation.</TE>
<TE>   To explain its contention that Wagner's ruling is seriously
flawed, El Paso has taken out full-page ads in major newspapers as
well as in smaller publications in areas where the company operates,
including San Antonio and Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso also has written letters -- all made public through the
company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
corporate Web site -- to members of Congress and to editors of some
publications that ran articles or editorials the company didn't like.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, El Paso Chief Executive William A. Wise issued a
letter to employees, shareholders and "neighbors" to explain the
company's position.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to know, in no uncertain terms, EPNG did not withhold
capacity to California, and we did not take any action to manipulate
gas prices in the state," he wrote, referring to the company's El
Paso Natural Gas unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Requiring a pipeline to operate at or near its maximum allowable
operating pressure on a sustained basis without regard to safety or
operational considerations is akin to requiring all motorists to
drive at 65 miles an hour at all times, regardless of road and
weather conditions," Wise wrote.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso says that safety concerns after a fatal explosion in 2000
kept its pipeline to California from operating at full capacity and
that Wagner's ruling, if upheld, would interfere with the ability of
all natural gas pipelines to operate safely.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the safety issue was only El Paso's latest legal
maneuver, an argument it did not consider important enough to bring
up in the previous hearings or in FERC filings on the complaint.
Wagner's ruling said El Paso used several tactics to withhold gas,
including scheduling unnecessary maintenance and failing to use all
available routes within its pipeline network to California.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso spokesman Mel Scott declined to say how much the company
is spending to tell its side of the story but noted that the suddenly
greater scrutiny warrants an aggressive strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had an issue like this before," Scott said. "We've
never been through something like this before."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retail gasoline prices jumped about 2% during the last two weeks, the
first sizable spike in six months, an industry survey indicated.</LD>
<LD>   The average price nationwide, including all grades and taxes, was
about $1.486 a gallon, up 2.9 cents from the previous survey Sept.
27, according to the Lundberg Survey of 8,000 stations nationwide
released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Continued strong crude oil prices, plus higher demand at the pump,
contributed to the rise in prices, Camarillo-based analyst Trilby
Lundberg said.</LD>
<TE>   "Fears about the Middle East crisis have kept crude oil prices
high," she said, adding that travelers' continued reluctance to fly
also was a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Until the latest survey, the price of gasoline had remained steady
since April 5, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.45 a gallon for regular,
$1.55 for mid-grade and $1.64 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Global Probe Focusing on 2001 Practices</HD>
<DH>Accounting actions include changing the classification of a
lease, which boosted the firm's adjusted EBITDA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal investigators probing Global Crossing Ltd. for possible
wrongdoing are sharpening their focus on the first half of 2001 -- a
period when employees took questionable steps to fend off financial
collapse and top executives cashed out shares in a final binge.</LD>
<LD>   Internal documents and e-mails obtained by The Times show that by
May 2001, the telecommunications company was dangerously close to
violating a key bank requirement. Had such a violation occurred,
Global Crossing's banks could have demanded repayment of more than $2
billion in loans, triggering a default on $3.8 billion in notes.</LD>
<LD>   In turn, Global Crossing could have been forced into Bankruptcy
Court months before its Chapter 11 filing Jan. 28. At a minimum, the
default would have restricted or reduced Global Crossing's access to
credit and probably would have driven down its credit rating and
stock price.</LD>
<TE>   To avert the potential crisis, Global Crossing employees used
suspect accounting to boost the company's adjusted EBITDA, or
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, according to the e-mails and interviews with former
employees. Increasing that figure helped keep the firm in compliance
with a bank formula that measured the company's adjusted EBITDA
against its total debt.</TE>
<TE>   The practices call into question top executives' sales of more
than $147 million in Global Crossing stock in the first half of 2001,
before shares began a tumble from which they never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001 alone, when Global Crossing shares closed as high as
$15.80, five executives or directors cashed out 11.5 million shares.
Chairman Gary Winnick topped the list of sellers by cashing in more
than $124 million of stock. On Jan. 28, the day Global Crossing
sought bankruptcy protection, the company's stock closed at 13 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to question the numbers more than ever in those kinds
of circumstances," said Charles Mulford, an accounting professor at
Georgia Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just what the FBI, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Labor Department and a congressional committee are
doing. All are investigating Global Crossing, which took on more than
$10 billion in debt to build a worldwide network of fiber-optic
cables to carry data at the speed of light.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1997, Bermuda-based Global Crossing grew quickly
through acquisitions and made a name for itself with its posh Beverly
Hills offices and a share price that peaked above $61. But the
company endured a parade of five CEOs, spent lavishly and posted
cumulative net losses of more than $7 billion by the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Although much attention has been paid to the fiber-optic capacity
swaps Global Crossing made with other telecommunications operators,
other, smaller actions taken during the second quarter of 2001
illustrate how desperate the company was to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, internal accounting documents show Global Crossing
reclassified an 11-year rental agreement on the company's Madison,
N.J., office building from an operating lease to a capital lease.</TE>
<TE>   Most standard office leases don't meet the required accounting
criteria to be classified as anything but operating leases,
accounting experts said. In fact, companies typically try to avoid
capitalizing leases because doing so adds interest expense and
depreciation and shows up as a liability on the books.</TE>
<TE>   For Global Crossing, however, the switch did one critical thing:
It increased the company's EBITDA. That's because the lease change --
made retroactive to Jan. 1, 2001 -- converted six months of ordinary
rent expenses into interest and depreciation expenses that remain
outside the EBITDA calculation. The move effectively boosted what
Global Crossing called "recurring adjusted EBITDA" by $1.38 million,
plus an additional amount for six months' worth of depreciation, in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The move had a small effect on EBITDA -- less than 1% -- but tiny
amounts can make all the difference in bank covenants.</TE>
<TE>   "It immediately smacks of an attempted manipulation of the
financial results," said Carr Conway, a forensic accountant with
Denver-based Dickerson Financial Investigation Group Inc. "If you
enter into a lease transaction, you make the determination at the
inception of the lease. You don't change it mid-stream."</TE>
<TE>   Mulford, the accounting professor, called the lease change "a
dramatic and cavalier step."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing declined to answer questions about the Madison
lease or its classification and would not discuss what steps it took
to comply with its bank covenants for the quarters ended March 31 and
June 30, 2001. The company also declined to make available
individuals named in this story who still work for Global Crossing.
The others mentioned by name either declined to comment or could not
be reached last week.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the lead lender on
Global Crossing's bank debt, declined to discuss the covenants.</TE>
<TE>   It's not exactly clear what would have happened if Global Crossing
had busted the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA covenant. Once the banks were
notified, they could have given the company a waiver, tightened
financial requirements, added other conditions or collateral -- or
called the loans, forcing the company into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if the banks would in fact have waived the
covenant, and they might have, but it's their decision to make,"
Mulford said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Global Crossing's lenders did force the company into
bankruptcy, after granting a temporary waiver of the covenants in
late 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But a string of internal e-mails sent among finance executives and
others in mid-May 2001 reveal how anxious the company was to avoid
such a showdown with its lenders. In fact, the executives discussed
steps that might bring the company's books into compliance with
covenants before Global Crossing filed financial statements with the
banks.</TE>
<TE>   In a May 12, 2001, e-mail from Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs
titled "debt covenants and capacity sales," he wrote that current
projections for adjusted EBITDA indicate "that we will be tight on
our bank covenant as we go through this year." He added that the
first-quarter results "seriously changed the outlook" and stressed to
the recipients, "we need to make our numbers."</TE>
<TE>   That note was sent to then-President David Walsh and Tom Casey,
who was chief executive of Global Crossing at the time. Several
employees in the company's finance departments also received copies.
Four days later, Hank Millner, head of Global Crossing's structured
finance department, sent an e-mail to the top financial executives
and the general counsel warning of "the very serious impact" if
first-quarter numbers forced the company out of compliance with the
banks.</TE>
<TE>   Millner first urged certain divisions to forward to him updated
figures for capital lease obligations and inter-company loans.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just a few levers that we can pull to improve the ratio
of debt/EBITDA," he wrote. Among other things, Millner suggested
"where possible, classifying capital leases as operating leases."</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion from Millner showed the company's willingness to
reclassify existing leases to help out with the covenants, but it is
unclear why he was suggesting the reverse of what ultimately happened
with the Madison lease, which was changed from an operating lease to
a capital lease.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony this month before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's oversight and investigations panel, CFO Cohrs said
Millner's e-mail was based on "incorrect and imprecise and
preliminary estimates that, in fact, did not forecast a violation of
loan covenants." He added that Global Crossing certified that its
debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.54 at the end of the first
quarter of 2001, well below the maximum allowable ratio of 4.75.</TE>
<TE>   Still, by May 21, five days after Millner's missive about the
covenants, Global Crossing employees were trading e-mails discussing
how to convert the Madison operating lease into a capital lease.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Ripal Patel, a Global Crossing accounting manager,
asked another accounting manager, Bernard Calissendorff, to discuss
the accounting entries required to change the lease.</TE>
<TE>   In a reply dated May 22, Calissendorff wrote: "I ran the numbers
per the file you sent me. Hypothetically, it's simply an amortization
schedule. In effect what was previously recorded as rent expense is
now recorded as depreciation and interest expense."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added, "Do you know who made the decision to capitalize
this lease, it doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent string of e-mails show accounting employees trying to
adjust the value of the land and other numbers so the lease would
qualify to be capitalized.</TE>
<TE>   On June 1, Ken Dorward, senior manager for financial operations,
wrote to department colleagues Scott Sabbagh, Kirk Rossi and Patel:
"We are booking the balance sheet side of the Madison capital lease,
but there is one hitch. When we spoke about the land portion in
relation to the comps you came up with, we basically said land is a
small portion of the overall value when dealing with commercial
property. However, the tax bill valuation has the land split at 44%
of total."</TE>
<TE>   "I need some evidence that the land value is 25% or less of the
total fair value of the property to get the best accounting
treatment. Can we come up with something?"</TE>
<TE>   A June 11 printout from Global Crossing's computerized accounting
system, obtained by The Times, included the capitalized Madison
lease.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the company's general counsel a month later, Roy
Olofson, then a vice president of finance, suggested the company
investigate several accounting moves, including the "capitalization
of the operating lease for the Madison, New Jersey office complex in
May, 2001." Olofson, who later lost his job at the company, also
cited capacity swaps and other items.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails discussing the lease change indicate that the company
not only violated generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP,
"but they violated GAAP in three separate places for just one
transaction," maintained a former employee in Global Crossing's
finance department.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, that employee said, the company failed to comply
with GAAP in valuing the land as a percentage of the total property,
in valuing the overall property, and by understating the company's
incremental borrowing rate.</TE>
<TE>   Inflating EBITDA may have postponed the company's violation of the
debt covenant and bought it time for a possible turnaround. "But then
if you link it to the personal stock sales," Mulford said, "then the
whole thing starts to stink."</TE>

<HD>IBM Chip May Give Macs More Muscle</HD>
<DH>Apple Computer is expected to switch some products to the
new high-performance PowerPC 970.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. today is expected to announce a microchip for personal
computers that will crunch data in chunks twice as big as the current
standard and is expected by industry watchers to be used by Apple
Computer Inc.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Cupertino-based Apple was not available to
comment, and an IBM spokesman declined to comment on which PC makers
would use the chip. But the chip would mark a change for the
industry, which has emphasized the importance of the speed of a chip
rather than its ability to handle heavy workloads.</LD>
<LD>   Apple has used Motorola Inc.'s microprocessors in most of its
Macintosh computers since 1984.</LD>
<TE>   Apple, IBM and Motorola declined to comment on the switch, which
has been rumored as the processors in Macintosh computers have
trailed Windows-based counterparts in clock speed.</TE>
<TE>   In its marketing, Apple has stressed that megahertz and gigahertz
do not necessarily indicate a machine's performance. Still, the
fastest Motorola processor for the Mac, the G4, runs at 1.25
gigahertz; Intel Corp.'s fastest Pentium 4 chip runs at 2.8
gigahertz.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately known in which products Apple would use the
new IBM PowerPC 970 chip or whether they would become the foundation
of a new system. Besides its professional Macs, Apple sells
single-processor iMacs and xServe servers.</TE>
<TE>   The PowerPC 970 can run software optimized for both 32-bit and
64-bit environments without emulation. That's a similar strategy to
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s 64-bit processors for desktops and
servers to be released next year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics -- notably Intel -- argue that most desktop users have no
need for 64-bit processing. In fact, Microsoft Corp. has yet to
release a 64-bit version of Windows that will run on AMD's Hammer
chips.</TE>
<TE>   The new IBM chip is derived from the Power4 microprocessor that
powers the computer giant's high-end Regatta servers. When available
by the middle of next year, it will range in speeds from 1.6
gigahertz to 1.8 GHz.</TE>
<TE>   Chekib Akrout, vice president of microprocessor development at IBM
Microelectronics, said the PowerPC 970 would at first have plenty of
applications in low-end servers and uses in high-end desktops in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Apple, IBM and Motorola jointly developed early-generation PowerPC
chips under a 1991 agreement. That partnership dissolved in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But Motorola and IBM continued to develop the processor. All of
Apple's desktops are based on Motorola's 32-bit G4 PowerPC. Apple's
iBook laptops are built with IBM's G3 PowerPC processors.</TE>

<HD>Analysts' Tougher Ratings Take Toll on Wall Street</HD>
<DH>Regulatory pressure and reform are leading to more
downgrades when the market least welcomes them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Be careful what you wish for -- at least on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Stock analysts, under siege for their perceived lack of
forthrightness, now are downgrading shares and issuing outright
"sell" recommendations at a much higher clip.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, their growing cascade of negative opinions is arriving
when the stock market -- already trading near five-year lows -- least
needs to hear it.</LD>
<TE>   "It couldn't have come at a worse time," said Chuck Hill, research
director at Thomson First Call, a market data tracker in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks including General Electric Co., Electronic Data Systems
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been pummeled in recent weeks after
they were downgraded by brokerage analysts, weighing down the broader
market as well. Even a ratings cut from "buy" to "hold" can trigger
heavy selling, depending on who's talking and who's listening.</TE>
<TE>   More analysts also are advising investors to get out of some
stocks entirely. "Sell" ratings have hit such shares as United
Airlines parent UAL Corp., golf equipment maker Callaway Golf Co. and
power company Duke Energy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, "sell" ratings have jumped to more than 8% of the
approximately 24,000 total recommendations made by analysts, a
fourfold increase from earlier this year, Thomson First Call
estimates. The 8% figure includes such ratings as "under-perform" and
"underweight," which mean basically the same thing as "sell," Thomson
said.</TE>
<TE>   And more downgrades are coming, Hill predicted: "As time moves on,
we'll see a further shift upward" -- meaning more "sell" ratings --
"as more analysts say what they mean."</TE>
<TE>   True, analysts still are urging investors to buy or hold more than
90% of all stocks -- and their influence still cuts both ways.
Analyst upgrades or positive comments about IBM Corp., Oracle Corp.
and other tech stocks helped fuel the market's strong surge Friday,
lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 316.34 points to 7,850.29.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow and other major indexes rose last week after six straight
weeks of losses that had pushed prices to five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts' newfound imperative to get tough -- or at least look
tough -- could help assure that the 31-month-old bear market drags
on.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, investment ratings on fast-food purveyor Yum Brands
Inc., parent of Pizza Hut, KFC and Irvine-based Taco Bell, were cut
by some analysts Thursday amid fears that Yum's sales growth is
slowing. None of the analysts issued a "sell" or its equivalent, but
the stock plummeted 21% that day, and shares of rival restaurant
companies fell in tandem.</TE>
<TE>   The plunge in Yum shares shows that, even as many big investors
say they don't believe Wall Street, analysts' recommendations
continue to carry weight.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year it was rare for "sell" ratings to account for more
than 1% or 2% of all analyst ratings. That's what got analysts into
trouble: As the stock market's bull run neared its peak in early
2000, it wasn't easy to find a "sell" despite the adage to "buy low
and sell high," and even though some skeptics were warning that many
stocks had soared to absurdly high levels.</TE>
<TE>   Even as prices collapsed in 2000 and 2001, "sell" recommendations
were still hard to come by. That began to change only this year --
after many stocks already were down 50% or more from their peaks.</TE>
<TE>   In spring, regulators and lawmakers stepped up investigations of
whether analysts had been pressured into staying overly bullish about
companies for fear of losing the firms' lucrative investment banking
business.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street reforms stemming from those probes have included
simplified ratings at most brokerages, whereby analysts now are
largely using just three calls -- "buy," "hold" and "sell" -- rather
than the multitiered ratings structures that often left investors
confused about exactly what the analyst was recommending.</TE>
<TE>   With the simpler ratings structures, analysts increasingly are
downgrading stocks to "hold" or "sell." Morgan Stanley, one of the
first firms to reform its ratings, now has about 20% of its
recommendations in the "underweight" category, which for many
investors' purposes is the equivalent of "sell."</TE>
<TE>   But as downgrades increase, the shift has opened a debate over
whether analysts are giving a more honest view of what they expect to
happen to companies and stocks or whether they are merely piling on,
largely reflecting bad news that already is in the market.</TE>
<TE>   "People who put a 'sell' on a stock when it's down 50% are OK, but
you'd better be predicting something that's worse than what's already
happened," said Bob Smith, manager of the $3.3-billion T. Rowe Price
Growth Stock Fund in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The point is, he said, that ratings should indicate whether a
business is having short-term problems or is locked in a long-term
downward spiral.</TE>
<TE>   "In the same way that 'buys' in 1999 tended to be about one-third
really insightful, one-third [analysts'] riding momentum and
one-third nonsense, I think it's about the same on 'sells' " now,
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that in European markets, outright "sell" ratings by
analysts have long been more common, but their usefulness is
questionable.</TE>
<TE>   That's because "if the stock goes two points higher, they put out
a 'sell.' Then they do the reverse, and they whip the prices around,"
Smith said. "So if it's used poorly, it's of no value."</TE>

<HD>Banking On the Future</HD>
<DH>Ex-CEO of Vivendi Universal is reestablishing himself</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>His business strategy has been debunked and his love of the spotlight
lampooned. He has been ousted as head of the world's second-largest
media company. His former employer has vowed not to pay him a dime in
severance. And, to top it off, he and his family soon will have to
give up a $17-million penthouse on Park Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Most people would slink away in humiliation. Not Jean-Marie
Messier, the fallen media king turned New York exile. The former
chairman and chief executive of Vivendi Universal -- who once labeled
himself half-jokingly as "master of the world" -- is as self-assured
and defiant as ever.</LD>
<LD>   Messier sees himself largely as a victim of outside forces: market
rumors, nationalistic French politicians and a coterie of powerful
business leaders who turned on him.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't pay enough attention to them," Messier said in his first
in-depth interview since his downfall. "When I was in a weak position
they took advantage of me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Messier said he is not looking backward.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking to who betrayed me.... I'm looking forward. I
have a great future in the U.S. and Europe. I want to build a new
story."</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Messier these days is caught between two chapters
in his life. He has just completed a draft of a 300-page tell-all
book based on a journal he kept about his rise and fall at Vivendi
and his observations about the current media market. The book, he
said, was a form of therapy after the shock of losing his job. He
says he isn't sure when or whether he will publish it.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's turning his attention to a new, far more modest
enterprise than running a global media empire. Messier, a former
investment partner at French investment bank Lazard, returned to his
roots last week when he incorporated what he describes as a "boutique
investment bank" in Delaware. The firm, called Messier Partners, will
handle private equity investments in media and other sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone from 380,000 employees to just one. I know it will be a
challenge.... My only revenge is my future success," he said during
the two-hour interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel also is where Messier and his then-lieutenants
negotiated some of the major media deals that transformed Vivendi
from a staid 150-year-old water utility into a flashy global
entertainment player and owner of one of Hollywood's hottest studios.</TE>
<TE>   Success, however, eluded Messier during his two-year reign at
Vivendi, where he arranged a slew of acquisitions that puzzled
investors and racked up $19 billion in media-related debts. Concerns
about the company's high debt, strategy and complex balance sheet
spooked investors and analysts, causing a 70% fall in Vivendi's stock
price before Messier's ouster in July.</TE>
<TE>   Messier is mostly unapologetic about Vivendi's failures. Still
looking very much the part of a jet-setting media mogul, he wore a
charcoal-gray flannel suit with a mauve tie and was carrying his
ever-present cell phone and oversized leather-bound daily planner.</TE>
<TE>   "What's done is done," he said, appearing tanned and relaxed after
a three-month hiatus from the corporate world. "I have no regrets."</TE>
<TE>   He staunchly defended his business strategy for creating a global
entertainment giant that combined European wireless and cable
television with American movies such as the "Mummy" franchise and
musical acts, from Eminem to U2.</TE>
<TE>   "When I read that Vivendi has decided to continue on the track of
being a global media company, I was pleased," Messier said. "As many
people are saying, it's a Messier strategy without Messier."</TE>
<TE>   He admits only a few significant missteps as chief of Vivendi.
Among them: failure to convince French board members that they should
sell off the core utility business. He also acknowledges courting too
much publicity for himself by posing for magazines such as Paris
Match, where he was photographed skating in Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi attracted much more attention than it should have, in
part because I was overexposed to the media," he said. "That's one
thing I do regret because I know it hurt Vivendi Universal."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Messier's contention that the company is following his
strategy, that is not the perception inside Vivendi. His successor,
Jean-Rene Fourtou, declined to comment, but sources close to the CEO
said his decision to keep Vivendi in the entertainment business was
more a reflection of market realities than an affirmation of
Messier's goal of creating a rival to AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The sources note that Fourtou already has undone key parts of the
empire Messier put together -- for example, unloading the
money-losing Internet venture Vizzavi. The Internet portal was a
centerpiece of Messier's strategy for using mobile phones as
distribution pipelines for movies, music and games.</TE>
<TE>   Messier would not comment specifically on the financial crisis he
left behind, but he said the company was hurt most by unsubstantiated
market rumors.</TE>
<TE>   Others disagree. "They didn't have enough near-term funding to get
them through the second half of the year," said Michael Nathanson, a
media analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their criticism of him, Messier was restrained in his
comments about Fourtou and Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family led the
boardroom coup against Messier. Bronfman was acting only because his
family's fortune was plummeting along with Vivendi's stock, Messier
said, and added that Fourtou's recent criticism of his deal-making
and love of the limelight was necessary because Fourtou needs to
"differentiate himself from me."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Messier has little to gain from knocking current
management because he still is heavily invested in the company.</TE>
<TE>   He said he put about $20 million of his savings and borrowed $5
million more from the company to buy 500,000 shares in Vivendi before
the stock tanked.</TE>
<TE>   Messier denied speculation that he faces personal bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   After his ouster, he and his family retreated to a ranch in
Montana, where he went horseback riding and took up fly fishing for
trout, and later vacationed at a home outside Paris. The theater buff
also took in several Broadway shows, including the musical "Mamma
Mia," which he has seen three times.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the pending move from the Vivendi-owned penthouse, Messier
said his family will remain in New York, where four of his five
children attend school and he and his wife, Antoinette, are active in
organizations including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the
New York Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   The usually loquacious executive declined to identify his partners
or discuss details of his new venture, saying he wanted now to
operate "under the radar," in contrast to his previous flamboyant
style that irked his former colleagues and board members at Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he still clings to part of his past. He said he plans to give
up his seats on the boards of Vivendi's utility and telecom
subsidiaries, but he won't say when.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't comment on whether he was still trying to negotiate a
multimillion-dollar severance package, even though he criticized
others for seeking golden parachutes.</TE>
<TE>   He said he doesn't miss the perks of being a CEO and is prepared
to live a more modest life.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it really matter?" he said. "People forget that I grew up in
a middle-class family in Grenoble [in southeast France]. I wasn't
born into the life of a CEO."</TE>

<HD>Cargo at Ports Being Unloaded Without Incident</HD>
<DH>Equipment shortages and minor mix-ups cause some delays.
Contract talks could resume next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four days after the reopening of West Coast ports, cargo continued to
be unloaded without disruption Sunday, though hindered in part by
equipment shortages and minor terminal mix-ups.</LD>
<LD>   This week, federal mediator Peter Hurtgen will try to get contract
negotiations between dockworkers and their employers back on track,
and talks between the two parties could resume as early as next week,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping
lines, said Sunday that the unloading of ships was well behind
schedule and would take a month or two to complete, union officials
said containers were being unloaded as quickly as worker availability
allowed.</LD>
<TE>   The docks remained congested after the 10-day lockout, which ended
Wednesday night on orders from a federal judge acting on a request
from the Bush administration. The lockout went into effect after the
carriers accused dockworkers of a work slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The two parties had been negotiating a new contract for the 10,500
West Coast port workers since May.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 ships remain to be unloaded at the 29 ports along the
West Coast, and more are arriving each day. As of Saturday, 117
vessels were in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach waiting to be
unloaded, said Fausto Capobianco, a spokesman for the Marine
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The port is busy as usual, but we don't see as many trucks
running back and forth on the weekend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The flow of goods out of the ports has been slowed by shortages of
truck container trailers and rail cars to take containers away.</TE>
<TE>   "Union Pacific is only accepting 180 containers a day for the
whole port" of Oakland, said Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union. "A single ship has
hundreds of containers."</TE>
<TE>   Terminal operators have had difficulty coming up with enough
chassis for trucks to move containers out. Many chassis are still in
the possession of retailers that brought goods in.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, paperwork mix-ups by clerks have left some containers
misplaced, for a few hours or even a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said he also had heard of truckers being charged extra
storage fees for the time the containers they are picking up spent at
terminals during the lockout.</TE>
<TE>   A PMA spokesman, however, attributed many of the delays to union
workers' starting shifts late or not showing up for assignments, a
point Stallone could not dispute, he said, because he did not have
immediate access to dispatch information.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just not at a point of being able to resume normal
operations. We have unloaded 25% less than we expected to be unloaded
at this point," said Steve Sugerman, a PMA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials have asked Gov. Davis and the governors of Oregon
and Washington to dispatch state safety regulators to the docks to
verify that longshore workers are working safely, as they have said,
and not slowly.</TE>

<HD>UAL, Union to Start Talks on Concessions</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and the union representing its mechanics
and baggage handlers plan to start talks this week on worker
concessions as the carrier tries to avoid filing for bankruptcy
protection.</LD>
<LD>   The machinists union is Chicago-based United's largest labor
group, representing about 36,000 workers.</LD>
<LD>   United's five unions last month decided to jointly provide the
airline with $5 billion in concessions over five years to help reduce
costs and win a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee.</LD>
<TE>   UAL, the second-largest airline, has said it can't afford to repay
$875 million of debt due this quarter without the help and might have
to file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists union will keep working with the other unions on
the recovery effort while negotiating on its own on the amount of
concessions it will provide, said Scotty Ford, a district president
for the union.</TE>
<TE>   United and the unions always have expected that each union
eventually would have separate talks with the company on details of
new agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's, which lowered its corporate credit ratings for
UAL and United in August, said that the airline and parent company
remain on its CreditWatch list.</TE>
<TE>   UAL, which reports third-quarter earnings on Friday, has said it
may have to file for Bankruptcy Court protection if the company
cannot secure significant labor concessions.</TE>

<HD>Manufacturing, Other Economic Data Expected</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, investors face a slew of economic data that are likely to
show that U.S. manufacturing is limping along because consumers are
cautious about spending and that businesses are reluctant to buy
equipment or add much to inventories until the economy gathers steam.</LD>
<LD>   A report Thursday from the Federal Reserve is expected to show
that industrial production rose 0.1% in September after falling 0.3%
a month earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "There is little reason to expect an upturn in business conditions
until well into 2003," said Chris Rupkey, senior economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New York. "The economic picture will not
brighten until manufacturing gets back on firmer ground."</LD>
<TE>   Companies are reluctant to build inventories or order more from
manufacturers until the recovery picks up strength. The Commerce
Department is expected to report on Tuesday that business inventories
rose 0.2% during August, half of the July increase.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that the
consumer price index rose 0.2% in September compared with a 0.3% rise
a month earlier. Excluding the volatile components of food and
energy, the index probably increased 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the nation's home builders remained busy a month after

<HD>Widow Sues Distributor of Cheap Handgun</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The widow of a popular middle school teacher fatally shot by a
student is suing the gun distributor, alleging that the gun is
unreasonably dangerous and lacks safety devices that would prevent a
minor from using it.</LD>
<LD>   The design of the .25-caliber Raven handgun will go on trial this
week in West Palm Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The shooter, 16-year-old Nathaniel Brazill, will take a break from
his 28-year prison sentence to testify.</LD>
<TE>   Brazill was 13 when he killed teacher Barry Grunow in a school
hallway and was convicted last year of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The gun's distributor, Valor Corp., maintains that the gun did
what it was designed to do when it fired a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Grunow's attorney compared their case to the lawsuit against
large tobacco companies, where the public initially believed a
similar premise: People who bought cigarettes knew they were
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Grunow's attorneys are hoping for a verdict large enough to force
companies to stop selling the Raven handgun, known on the street as a
"junk" gun, or Saturday night special, because of its small size and
low cost. The Raven can be bought for as little as $75, less than
half the cost of similar firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The case has drawn national attention because it is the first to
address both the absence of a gun lock and the flaws associated with
a cheap, concealable weapon that looks like a toy.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. this holiday season will give away two games with
each Xbox video game console purchase in hopes of winning more
consumers in its race against Nintendo Co., maker of the rival
GameCube console.</LD>
<LD>   Companies rarely make money from selling consoles--indeed,
Microsoft is reportedly losing more than $100 for each console it
sells. But hardware companies make up for the losses by collecting
licensing fees for copies of games sold for their consoles.</LD>
<LD>   As of June 30, Microsoft and Nintendo were tied with 4 million
consoles shipped worldwide. Both trail far behind Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2, with 33 million units shipped worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   The Xbox bundle, which will start selling Tuesday for $199, will
come with "Jet Set Radio Future" and "Sega GT 2002," both developed
by Sega Corp. It also will include a smaller controller originally
made for the Japanese market.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission will meet an Oct. 28 deadline
to select members for a new board that will oversee accountants and
set accounting standards, SEC Chief of Staff Mark Radke said.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission is in the process of finalizing its selection,"
said Radke, addressing stock traders in Boca Raton, Fla., at the
annual meeting of the Security Traders Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Setbacks in naming an accounting board chairman are putting
pressure on SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, who has been accused of
bending to Republican and accounting industry requests that he choose
someone other than a former pension fund chief.</LD>
<TE>   The accounting board was created as part of the Sarbanes- Oxley
Act, enacted July 30 in response to accounting scandals that have hit
companies such as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The board's first task will be to register all accountants who
audit public companies, Radke said.</TE>
<TE>   The board also will set rules for quality control, ethics and the
independence of auditors. It will review audit firms regularly to
ensure they are following those standards.</TE>

<HD>Pro Forma Earnings Reports Get New Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Many companies say the numbers help to track performance,
but critics say the data can be used to downplay bad news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heard the one about the "pro forma" corporate golf game? You drop
your five worst holes, then total your score.</LD>
<LD>   As third-quarter earnings-reporting season dawns, Congress and
regulators have made it clear they want companies to stop "spinning"
their announcements to downplay potential bad news. And one of the
principal targets of the earnings-honesty campaign is the so-called
pro forma profit calculation.</LD>
<LD>   The Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform law that took effect in July
requires companies that report pro forma results -- profit excluding
certain charges -- to show how they compare with earnings that
strictly follow U.S. accounting rules. The act also forbids companies
from issuing news releases that omit "material" facts.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission expects to propose a rule
this month that spells out the requirements of the law.</TE>
<TE>   The National Investor Relations Institute, an association of
corporate investor relations officers, urged companies last week to
voluntarily comply with reporting guidelines that the group said can
"help restore investor trust and confidence" in the wake of the
deluge of accounting scandals this year.</TE>
<TE>   Among other steps, the investor relations institute said companies
should lead off their quarterly earnings news releases with net
income as measured by generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP, and report any pro forma results secondarily.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of earnings releases is all over the map," said Louis
Thompson, president of the institute.</TE>
<TE>   "You can certainly argue about the analytical merits of pro forma,
but there has been enough abuse that it's no longer an accounting
issue -- it's a corporate credibility issue," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings season starts in earnest this week with 160 of the
companies in the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index expected to
report.</TE>
<TE>   Pro forma results, which typically omit certain write-offs and
non-cash charges, often make companies appear more profitable than
earnings based on GAAP.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies say pro forma numbers often are the best way to
track how their basic businesses are performing, unaffected by
one-time gains or charges.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, too, say pro forma numbers can paint a truer picture of
a firm's operations. After mergers, for example, pro forma data help
investors make meaningful comparisons as if the companies had been
combined previously.</TE>
<TE>   But regulators and critics say many companies have gone too far,
abusing the lack of clear pro forma reporting guidelines to make
their numbers look good by excluding too many expenses. Cynics joke
about "recurring non-recurring charges," which show up seemingly
every quarter, and "EBBS: earnings before bad stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has been concerned about pro forma results since before
Sarbanes-Oxley: In December, the agency issued an alert warning
companies about misleading the public using non-GAAP numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Companies already may be shifting away from pro forma reporting,
at least gradually. At the end of 2001 about 48% of companies were
issuing pro forma results along with GAAP numbers, but in the second
quarter of this year that total fell to about 40%, according to the
investor relations institute's surveys.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 20% of companies list pro forma results first in their
news releases, Thompson said. Those companies in recent quarters have
included such firms as Irvine-based semiconductor maker Broadcom
Corp. and Cypress-based HMO PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always provided reconciliation with GAAP numbers, both
verbally and in charts, but it's important to show the results that
investors and analysts really care about, which in our case is pro
forma," said Suzanne Shirley, vice president of investor relations at
PacifiCare. "Analysts want an apples-to-apples look at the ongoing
operations."</TE>
<TE>   She said she would be willing to list GAAP numbers first, though
no decision has been made about the company's third-quarter release.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Other firms, including Walt Disney Co., have shifted within the
last year to reporting GAAP earnings first, listing pro forma results
later in their releases, even before the investor relations
institute's initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an evolution consistent with calls in the public arena to
display the information this way," Disney spokesman John Spelich
said.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hill, research director at Boston-based earnings tracker
Thomson First Call, said companies have gotten more forthright in
their quarterly earnings reports -- to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "That problem is improving but not as fast as it might. I would
think in this scandal-plagued environment that companies would be
bending over backward to help the investment community," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   He said stock analysts share the blame because many have been
shoddy "gatekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: In its quarterly report issued Oct. 4, Alcoa Inc.'s
write-off for shutting down a smelter should "at least have been
questioned by the analysts," Hill said. "Hey, guys, that's part of
doing business. Business may be slow right now because of the
economy, but you're still in the aluminum business."</TE>
<TE>   Alcoa led its earnings release with profit excluding the smelter
write-off, though the company immediately thereafter reported results
with the write-off included.</TE>
<TE>   Hill also said the investor relations institute guidelines could
go further, specifically urging companies to spell out "step by step"
any differences between pro forma and "as reported" earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with adjusting GAAP numbers. A lot of times
it's desirable," Hill said. "But when you leave the trail from GAAP
to pro forma, it's your obligation to show exactly how you got from
Point A to Point B."</TE>
<TE>   He said that currently, for example, a company might report 50
cents a share in net income for a quarter, but 60 cents in operating
profit, excluding a total of 10 cents a share from an asset sale, a
restructuring charge and an inventory write-down. But if the company
doesn't break out the three write-offs individually, analysts and
investors can't adjust the results as they see fit, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes the SEC addresses this loophole, which he said it left
open in its December alert.</TE>

<HD>Pilgrim's Pride Issues Record Recall of Poultry</HD>
<DH>The company says 27.4 million pounds of ready-to-eat
products could be contaminated with listeria bacteria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pilgrim's Pride Corp. is recalling 27.4 million pounds of
ready-to-eat chicken and turkey products in what U.S. officials
called the largest meat recall in the nation's history.</LD>
<LD>   Pilgrim's Pride, the second-largest U.S. poultry company behind
Tyson Foods Inc., suspended operations at its Wampler Foods Inc.
plant in Franconia, Pa., after testing found the presence of listeria
monocytogenes. The bacteria causes an estimated 2,500 cases of
flu-like illness and 500 deaths annually.</LD>
<LD>   "We found pretty extensive listeria throughout the facility," said
Steve Cohen, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the company nor the USDA would specify in which states or
to which stores or eating establishments the food was distributed,
other than to say that the Pilgrim's Pride cooked turkey and chicken
products produced from May 1 to Oct. 11 were distributed to grocery
stores, restaurants and food-service institutions throughout the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The deli products were sold to consumers under the Wampler Foods
brand and select private labels. The company said consumers who have
products made during the recall period should return the meats to
where they were purchased.</TE>
<TE>   The recalled products include roasted turkey breast, chicken
breast and cooked deli-style chicken. All products bear the
establishment code "P-1351" inside the USDA inspection seal.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three largest meat recalls in U.S. history have
occurred this year as the USDA is under pressure from Congress to
improve meat and poultry inspections. ConAgra Foods Inc. in July
recalled almost 19 million pounds of ground beef from a plant in
Greeley, Colo., some of which was contaminated with the E. coli
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   The previous largest meat recall was of 25 million pounds of
frozen hamburger patties in 1997 by Hudson Foods Inc., USDA records
show.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working diligently with the USDA and our customers to make
sure any product that has not yet been consumed is removed from the
marketplace and consumers' homes as quickly as possible," David Van
Hoose, chief executive of Pilgrim's Pride, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The recall announced Sunday is an expansion of the 295,000 pounds
of products recalled Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   All but the most recently produced 10 million pounds of meat being
recalled probably has already been consumed or discarded, said
Richard Cogdill, the company's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Listeria can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and
nausea, according to the USDA. It can be fatal in young children, the
elderly and people with weak immune systems and can cause
miscarriages and stillbirths.</TE>
<TE>   Listeria is killed when it is cooked, so the only chance for
contamination is when the product is wrapped, Van Hoose said. The
company will change its production methods to ensure that the
wrapping process doesn't contaminate the meat, Van Hoose said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Pittsburg, Texas-based Pilgrim's Pride gained 3 cents to
$7.01 in New York Stock Exchange trading Friday. The stock has fallen
more than 48% this year. Cogdill declined to estimate how much the
recall will cost the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a thorough and comprehensive insurance program that we
feel sure will cover the company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the recall is a record, the 27.4 million pounds is not a
significant portion of the U.S. production of turkey and chicken
products, which tops 30 billion pounds annually.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month
said turkey deli meat tainted with listeria monocytogenes may be the
source of more than 120 illnesses and 20 deaths from food poisoning
in the Northeast and Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state health officials have been investigating the
food-poisoning cases since last month, the USDA said. The outbreak
occurred in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA and the company said there was no known connection
between those cases and the poultry recalled by Pilgrim's Pride.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, Pilgrim's Pride said it lost 10 cents to 15 cents a
share in its fiscal fourth quarter because of low chicken prices and
higher feed costs. Pilgrim's Pride had net income of $12.9 million,
or 31 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA has about 7,600 inspectors in 6,500 meat and poultry
plants nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Contaminated foods cause an estimated 76 million illnesses and
5,000 deaths each year in the U.S., according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>

<HD>Recreational Vehicle Industry Is Humming Along Road to
Growth</HD>
<DH>Sales are up 17% from a year ago as more U.S. families
choose domestic leisure travel after Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Recchio was just completing the funding and incorporation of his
new recreational vehicle company last year when the terrorist attacks
hit New York and Washington, bringing car sales and leisure travel to
a screeching halt.</LD>
<LD>   Shaken personally by the tragedy, he also was alarmed that his
fledgling business would be stillborn, opening at a time when
Americans were shunning big-ticket purchases, such as motor homes and
trailers, and shying away from traveling for pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   Fleetwood Enterprises of Riverside, the country's largest RV
maker, shared that apprehension.</LD>
<TE>   "Initially, orders were severely depressed, and we were quite
concerned because we had seen some recovery after the big Nasdaq
decline of March 2000," said Fleetwood Treasurer Lyle Larkin.</TE>
<TE>   Claude Donati, vice president of sales and marketing for
Gulfstream Coach Inc., is more blunt about his distress.</TE>
<TE>   "We all thought the show was going down the toilet," he said,
referring to the RV market.</TE>
<TE>   They needn't have worried. The $9-billion RV industry, which runs
from $5,000 trailers to million-dollar-plus motor homes, is booming.
Sales are up 17% through August over the first eight months of last
year. Stock prices have shot up for RV makers, which are boosting
production. Margins are healthy.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not so much despite Sept. 11 but because of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It proves to us many times that the RV lifestyle is a passion and
a goal of many people," said Recchio, sitting in a comfy swivel chair
in the back of one of the 29-foot trailers made by his company,
Ameri-Camp of Syracuse, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a time when we can get away as a family and interact as a
family, expose the kids to other parts of the country," said Amy
Emett of Monrovia, who has been "RV'ing" ever since she got married
19 years ago and hopes to lease their house and retire with her
husband to their 38-foot motor home within 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Life at home is busy with both parents working and two teenage
girls busy with school, friends and sports. But the dozen or more
trips a year the the Emetts take in their Winnebago Adventurer give
them the chance to catch up with one another, as well as others who
share their RV ardor.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely love everyone we meet," said Emett, 40.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter Bethanie is just as fervent: "It's the best," the
15-year-old said, especially the family trips to Rancho Oso in the
Santa Barbara Mountains, where the family has made lifelong friends.</TE>
<TE>   These days her elder sister, Sherr, 18, is outgrowing the family
travel bug and stays inside the motor home more.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as she has a TV and a mirror, she's OK," Bethanie said.
"Me, I like traveling with the family." Games such as Pegs &amp; Jokers
and Rummy Cube are big hits in the Emett RV.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks came amid an onslaught of baby boomers
reaching or nearing retirement who want to do more things as a
family, a natural recipe for domestic sight-seeing sightseeing.</TE>
<TE>   "The RV industry was the unwitting beneficiary of the attitude of
seeing America one mile at a time instead of flying," said Dave
Altman, president of Altman's Winnebago dealership in Baldwin Park.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying, 'What if I lost someone in my own family?' "
Altman said at the annual RV dealers convention in Nashville
recently. "With everything happening in the stock market, terrorism,
the Middle East, people say, 'I'm tired of waiting,' and it's
accelerated people to our industry."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rising Popularity</TE>
<TE>   A recent study found that more people are getting into RVs earlier
in life. The average age of an RV buyer has come down from the low
60s to 49. The study by the University of Michigan for the RV
Industry Assn. found that nearly one of every 12 families that drive,
or 7 million households, have an RV of some kind.</TE>
<TE>   "RV sales are right ahead of a big demographic wave, and we've
just barely scratched that surface," said William Gibson, RV industry
analyst with Banc of America Securities.</TE>
<TE>   And much of the strength in the market has come in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to be almost as if Americans made the buying decision
turn in the industry's favor after 9/11," said John Diffendal, an
analyst who covers RVs and manufactured housing for the investment
bank BB&amp;T Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something to do with Americans staying domestic," Diffendal
said. "They saw their future as one where they might not be traveling
very much, and they wanted to see America."</TE>
<TE>   After being nervous about the RV industry after Sept. 11,
Gulfstream's Donati said, the resurgence now makes sense to him. The
stock market's turmoil has made baby boomers cash-rich and looking to
make that purchase they long have been eyeing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Plus, 10,000 people retire every day," Donati said. "If we get 1%
of them, the growth potential is enormous. And the growth is supposed
to continue for eight years."</TE>
<TE>   Historically low interest rates also fuel sales, which are up 31%
year to date for Gulfstream, an RV maker based in northern Indiana,
where much of the RV production in the U.S. is concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   Stock prices are soaring. Monaco Coach of Oregon is up about 44%.
Winnebago Industries of Iowa is up 48% since just before Sept. 11, ,
and Ohio-based Thor Industries is up 160% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood, which also is the country's largest maker of
manufactured housing, has sunk into red ink because of financing and
competition problems on the mobile home side of its business. But its
RV business is humming, and tuning up to face the swelling ranks of
retiring baby boomers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our higher-end products, especially [$150,000-plus] diesel, have
done very well," Fleetwood's Larkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Winnebago is on track to reach record sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as though we had to create a market -- we've been
selling at full margins" without the kind of incentives seen in the
passenger vehicle industry, said Winnebago Marketing Director Roger
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "But we've seen a tremendous upsurge in families traveling
together, and obviously RVs are a tremendous way to do just that," he
said. "9/11 woke people up to that more quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Growth is everywhere, led by Southern California, the country's
largest RV market, followed by Texas, Florida and New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Economic Barometer</TE>
<TE>   The RV industry had record sales of more than 321,000 in 1999,
with its second-best year in 2000 -- a year ahead of the auto
industry's best and second-best years.</TE>
<TE>   Economists are upbeat about the industry because what's good for
RVs seems to be good for America. Strong RV sales tend to foretell an
upturn in the economy, whereas a sales decline portends an overall
economic slump.</TE>
<TE>   "RV sales tend to respond earlier than other sales because they're
such a discretionary purchase and sensitive to income trends and
interest rates," said Richard Curtin, director of consumer surveys at
the University of Michigan, who conducted the RV study and views the
industry as a general economic barometer.</TE>
<TE>   The RV Industry Assn. has increased ad campaigns from 1999 to try
to attract younger buyers and has accelerated purchases among buyers
ages 35 to 55. The association's Web site, www.gorving.org, instructs
veterans and novices about RVs.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, the association starts a three-year, $55-million ad
campaign that will emphasize using an RV to pursue one's hobbies and
passions: NASCAR racing, bird-watching, snow and water skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Altman, the Baldwin Park dealer, found an RV the perfect place to
which to retreat during the long stretches between his children's
races at swim meets, which could last an entire day. .</TE>
<TE>   "It makes your hobby more fun," Altman said. "I photograph nature;
my son shows horses. It's perfect for that. Look at auto race fans:
They go for the whole weekend."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tax Advantages</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of an RV goes beyond freedom and flexibility. Any Class
A motor home -- in which the living and driving areas are enclosed
together on a special chassis -- can be treated like a second home
from a legal standpoint, with the tax advantages and long-term
financing that go along with it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, RVs are being made increasingly functional and
luxurious to attract more boomers and retirees.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the two easy chairs, Recchio's $27,000 trailer
model comes with ducted floor heat, a laundry chute, a spice rack and
a cedar-lined wardrobe. Options include a DVD/videocassette player, a
27-inch television and two-way radios.</TE>
<TE>   Monaco Coach's Beaver division builds the Monterey, a beefy bus up
to 40 feet long and that sells for up to $245,000. It features Corian
countertops and real porcelain sinks, two TV sets, ducted air
conditioning, cavernous "basement" storage accessed from outside the
bus, full hanging closets in the rear bedroom and a selection of
hardwoods for the abundant cabinets that line most available space.</TE>
<TE>   Most larger RVs have "slide-outs," a recent feature where portions
of the truck or trailer slide outward, greatly increasing interior
room.</TE>
<TE>   These days many RVs and campgrounds have cable TV and Internet
connectivity. Although inveterate campers might blanch at the thought
of going outdoors only to go online, RV Industry Assn. President
David Humphreys has an answer to that.</TE>
<TE>   "You find people come back to building memories; kids remember the
time spent together," he said. "Sure, it's great in a tent under the
stars, but you can be more comfortable if you can take a shower."</TE>
<TE>   Economic uncertainties, even looming war with Iraq, don't seem to
be threatening the RV growth trend.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that this is a discretionary purchase, if there's some
thought that [war] could lead to economic weakness, it could come
into play," analyst Diffendal said.</TE>
<TE>   "More realistically, it could come into play if we come into a
price increase for oil, and if we had an availability issue in terms
of gasoline or diesel fuel, but it's hard to come up with such a
scenario."</TE>

<HD>A Softer Approach in Wall St. Probes</HD>
<DH>Fines and reforms appear more likely than criminal
prosecution of analysts and others accused of wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In this season of white-collar scandal, the government has pursued
corporate rogues with an unalloyed zeal, subjecting alleged
wrongdoers to humiliating "perp walks" and rushing out criminal
charges that could put them in prison.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to the many revelations of disgraceful conduct
on Wall Street, prosecutors' approach this year has appeared
kid-gloved in comparison.</LD>
<LD>   Multiple state and federal probes of the practices of brokerage
stock analysts and investment bankers during the bull market have
shown "a clear commitment to deception on the part of a major portion
of the industry," said William Galvin, Massachusetts' secretary of
state.</LD>
<TE>   Yet no criminal charges have been filed against any brokerage or
individual analyst, and many legal experts doubt that prosecutors
will choose to bring such cases -- even though the scope of alleged
Wall Street fraud arguably goes far beyond the insider-trading
scandal of the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The government's investigation in the 1980s resulted in guilty
pleas and jail terms for an array of well-known financiers, traders
and brokerage executives, including investment banker Martin Siegel
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., takeover-stock trader Ivan Boesky and Boyd
Jefferies, founder of brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest name of all -- junk bond king Michael Milken -- also
pleaded guilty to securities law violations, and his firm, Drexel
Burnham Lambert, was slapped with a criminal indictment that
destroyed it.</TE>
<TE>   This time, major brokerages and regulators are engaged in talks to
reach a "global" civil settlement of the various state and federal
investigations. If a deal is struck, the probable outcome would be
large fines and promises to reform -- but no admissions of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that's the way it should be. Fining the industry
and forcing changes in the way brokerages do business could be more
effective than locking people up in an effort to make examples of
them, say some securities-law professors.</TE>
<TE>   "That would give us an appropriate closure," said Donald
Langevoort, a law professor at Georgetown University. "We don't need
jail time."</TE>
<TE>   The public, however, may well be mystified as to why the
revelations they've heard about brokerage practices in the late 1990s
don't rise up to criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   From the state and federal probes of stock analysts and investment
bankers, investors have learned that some analysts privately
disparaged stocks while advising the public to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts admitted to touting stocks simply to lure
investment banking business from the companies.</TE>
<TE>   A senior manager at one brokerage lamented that conflicts of
interest had rendered his firm's research "basically worthless."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, congressional investigations have shown that brokerages
routinely awarded shares in hot stock offerings to favored executives
of companies the brokerages were wooing for banking business.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deterrent Effect</TE>
<TE>   Michael Josephson, president of the Josephson Institute of Ethics
in Marina del Rey, believes criminal prosecutions could send a strong
deterrent message, if the government has sufficiently strong cases.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts "did real and meaningful harm and did it with what I
think is malicious intent," said Josephson, whose institute advises
corporations and other entities on matters of ethics and conduct. "If
we can prove that there was specific intent to defraud, then I think
there should be prosecutions" of analysts and their firms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government's willingness to bring criminal fraud cases against
executives at such failed firms as Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and
Adelphia Communications Corp. may be whetting the public's appetite
for charges against brokerages, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But a number of factors are working against a 1980s-style criminal
sweep of Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Some regulators fear that lengthy criminal prosecutions could
spook depressed financial markets and further sap investor trust. And
indicting any of the major brokerages at the heart of the government
probes -- such as Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney
-- could impair their ability to operate and potentially threaten
their existence.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment could force the Securities and Exchange Commission
or the New York Stock Exchange to immediately suspend a firm from
certain business activities.</TE>
<TE>   "It is highly unlikely that a firm would be prosecuted, regardless
of the evidence, for fear of Drexelizing the firm," said Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC attorney. "The indictment alone would be
fatal."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, regulators also don't want to exacerbate the brutal
Wall Street downturn that has spawned large-scale layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not act in a way that jeopardizes the stability of the
main investment houses that are the backbone of the city, state and
national economies," said New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who has
been at the forefront of the Wall Street probes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some regulators say criminal prosecutions, even of the biggest
brokerages, may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with civil sanctions alone, Massachusetts' Galvin
said, is that they have failed to prevent Wall Street from repeatedly
finding new ways to break laws.</TE>
<TE>   Galvin, whose office has been involved in a probe of Credit Suisse
First Boston, recommended to Spitzer last month that he file criminal
charges against the firm over alleged analyst conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a role for criminal prosecution," Galvin said. "Maybe a
company has to be put out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Galvin's office has helped stoke investor outrage through its
discovery of inflammatory e-mails written by CSFB analysts.</TE>
<TE>   In one e-mail, an analyst wrote that he maintained "buy" ratings
on certain stocks but privately confided different advice to favored
clients. He labeled the strategy the "Agilent Two-Step," a reference
to a company CSFB helped bring public in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst explained in the e-mail, "That's where in writing you
have a buy rating ... but verbally everyone knows your position."</TE>
<TE>   CSFB, which has denied wrongdoing, says it is cooperating "with
all government officials and regulatory authorities on these
matters."</TE>
<TE>   If Spitzer were to decide to pursue criminal cases against
individuals, he might have a better chance than federal authorities
at obtaining convictions, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   That's because New York's powerful securities law, known as the
Martin Act, gives Spitzer broad leeway to bring and to win cases,
said David Kaufmann, a former state prosecutor now with Kaufmann,
Finer, Yamin, Gildin &amp; Robbins.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, Spitzer would have to show only that an analyst
knew his exaggerated stock ratings would hurt investors, even if the
analyst didn't know he was violating the law, said Kaufmann, an
expert in the Martin Act.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that this attorney general under the Martin
Act possesses the power, if the allegations are true, to procure an
indictment against analysts or their superiors who knew about
[analyst hyping] and did nothing to stop it," Kaufmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Unless brokerages consent to significant reforms, Spitzer could
"send a warning shot over the bow" by going after individual
analysts, Kaufmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer continues to suggest that he is leaving his options open
with regard to individual brokerage employees.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be individuals who pay a very high price for
their conduct," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burden of Proof</TE>
<TE>   At the federal level, the Justice Department last year dropped a
criminal probe into CSFB's handling of new stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how strong the appetite for prosecution of
individual brokerage employees may be at the Justice Department,
which under former U.S. Attorney (and later New York Mayor) Rudolph
Giuliani led the 1980s probe against insider traders.</TE>
<TE>   The office of James Comey, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, has asked Massachusetts to share documents from
his CSFB investigation, sources said last week. And brokerage Morgan
Stanley revealed in July that it received "subpoenas and requests for
documents and information" from multiple regulators, including
Comey's office.</TE>
<TE>   But some legal experts continue to doubt that federal criminal
charges will be filed -- in part because cases against analysts could
be tough to win.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors would have to prove that analysts had criminal
intent, as opposed to simply spouting the bullishness that was
expected of them.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, it could be hard to counter analysts' likely defense
that they believed what they said. Despite their seemingly
incriminating tones, the e-mails regulators have revealed could prove
less damning as defense lawyers portrayed them as taken out of
context, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The late-1980s insider-trading charges were easier to prove, say
former prosecutors who worked on those cases. Trading stocks based on
privileged information was clearly a crime.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, writing bullish research reports -- even if done to
win financing business -- falls into a gray area of federal law, one
ex-prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Publishing an opinion which turns out is not your true opinion
... it's not quite as clear that's a criminal offense," the lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though he would favor criminal cases, Josephson, who is a former
criminal-law professor, acknowledges that the lack of a clear legal
violation could make it impossible to bring such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of losing, he said, may be holding prosecutors back. Losing a
high-profile case, he worries, could send a message that it is
possible to get away with wrongdoing on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say regulators are right to focus their energy on
compelling the brokerage industry to dramatically change the way it
does business, particularly in terms of insulating analysts from
investment-banking pressures.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a far more important fix than indicting, convicting and
burning at the stake an individual analyst," said Stephen Ryan, a
former prosecutor who now is a defense attorney in Washington.</TE>

<LD>It seems that almost every month there's a report of yet another
identity theft scam. The latest is particularly worrisome because it
plays off Internal Revenue Service forms, something the agency says
hasn't happened before.</LD>
<LD>   The California Society of Enrolled Agents, an association of tax
experts licensed by the Treasury, and other groups have been trying
to warn the public.</LD>
<LD>   "Criminals have become more brazen because they've learned that
they can profit from identity theft," said Bill Geideman, an enrolled
agent in Santa Ana. "And they're much harder to trace than thieves
who walk into a 7-Eleven with a handgun."</LD>
<TE>   The scam involves a cover letter from a "bank" and a doctored IRS
form.</TE>
<TE>   One of the phony forms is numbered W-9095 and titled "Application
Form for Certificate Status/Ownership for Withholding Tax." It mimics
the genuine IRS Form W-9, Re- quest for Taxpayer Identification
Number and Certification.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to seeking the consumer's name, address and Social
Security number, the sham form asks for detailed financial
information -- including bank account numbers, passwords and personal
identification numbers -- as well as personal details such as
mother's maiden name.</TE>
<TE>   The letter says the form must be faxed to a certain number within
seven days, or the "bank" will begin holding 31% of the account's
interest for taxes.</TE>
<TE>   A related scam that targets foreigners with accounts in the United
States features a doctored version of IRS Form W-8BEN, Certificate of
Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding.</TE>
<TE>   A totally fictitious IRS form, W-8888, also is in circulation, the
IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS says it has no figures on how many people have been caught
up in the latest scam, but the agency has received complaints from
around the country and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft is a growing problem in the United States, with
more than 700,000 people victimized each year, the government
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   With the right stolen information -- Social Security numbers, bank
account numbers and PINs -- the thieves can devastate victims
financially. They can empty savings accounts, open new credit card
accounts and run up massive bills, even buy houses and cars under
their assumed identities. Victims can spend years unraveling the mess
and correcting the damage to their credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said people should be wary of anyone
soliciting personal information.</TE>
<TE>   "The IRS would not normally send out these forms, and the IRS
would not ask for sensitive financial data," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that anyone receiving such solicitations should not
respond to them. Instead, she said, contact the IRS at (800)
829-1040.</TE>
<TE>   People who fear they may have been duped by such forms should
contact the agency, Riley said. In addition, because they are
potential identity theft targets, they could file a report with the
local police, contact their bank and notify the three major credit
bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.</TE>
<TE>   Other identity theft hotlines are run by the Social Security
Administration, (800) 269-0271, and the Federal Trade Commission,
(877) ID-THEFT.</TE>
<TE>   Geideman, the enrolled agent, said legitimate forms generally have
an IRS processing center address on them and the agency's phone
number.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that, the IRS would never ask you for things like your
bank passwords or insist that you fax things in," Geideman said. "If
someone sees that, it should be a red flag."</TE>

<HD>UC System Employees Call for Two-Day Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School is out for university teaching assistants, clerical workers
and lecturers who have called a two-day strike across the University
of California system beginning today.</LD>
<LD>   The strike centers on a labor dispute between the UC system and
two unions: the Coalition of University Employees, which represents
18,000 clerical workers, and the American Federation of Teachers,
which represents 4,000 lecturers hired to teach classes.</LD>
<LD>   Both groups are renegotiating expired employment contracts. They
have accused the university system of not bargaining in good faith
and not making certain financial and health benefits information
available to them in the process.</LD>
<TE>   A local of the United Auto Workers union, representing nearly
11,000 UC teaching assistants and tutors, said it would support the
employees' cause and refuse to cross picket lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We are withholding all of our labor for the two days of the
strike," said Zach Fish, a UC Riverside graduate student and
financial secretary of UAW Local 2865.</TE>
<TE>   That means no classes led by teaching assistants, no office hours
and no grading, Fish said.</TE>
<TE>   The UAW local claims its members perform more than 60% of the
face-to-face instruction at the UC system's eight campuses. It will
begin negotiating its next contract in April with the university
system.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown Sunday how many members of the university employees
union or the teachers union would participate in the walkout.</TE>
<TE>   But a strike could mean empty offices and closed departments for
two days while workers in payroll departments, financial aid offices,
registrar's offices, student health centers and campus libraries
hoist signs in picket lines, said Rita Skinner, an administrative
assistant at UC Riverside and member of the strike committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep the day-to-day business of the university running,"
Skinner said. "We are expecting a lot of disruption."</TE>
<TE>   UC officials were not immediately available for comment.</TE>

<HD>POW Atrocities: an Ugly Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Burkhalter</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the U.S. government lays the groundwork for war against Iraq, the
Bush administration must come to grips with the consequences of
alliances with local forces that show little respect for the laws of
armed conflict -- in particular, for the treatment of prisoners of
war. Failure to do so in Afghanistan resulted in the execution of
hundreds of captured combatants and the imprisonment of thousands of
others in life-threatening squalor.</LD>
<LD>   Situations like Afghanistan, in which the U.S. provides extensive
support and fights alongside local forces, require new doctrine,
training, planning and explicit rules of engagement that ensure
humane treatment of captured combatants and the safety of civilians.</LD>
<LD>   American military doctrine requires U.S. forces to comply with
principles and laws of war. But the Defense Department does not
oblige the U.S. military to take specific action to prevent abuses by
its partners, agents and allies in the field of combat. Its only
requirement is that U.S. soldiers report any violations.</LD>
<TE>   The consequences of the U.S. military's weak war crimes doctrine
were apparent in Afghanistan. U.S. Special Forces and CIA officers
were actively involved in the battle to wrest the city of Kunduz from
the Taliban, and they participated in the surrender negotiations.
U.S. military and intelligence personnel interviewed the captured
fighters at Sheberghan prison and other detention facilities,
selecting some for further investigation at a U.S. detention facility
at Guantanamo Bay. But they left virtually all other responsibility
for the Taliban POWs in the Northern Alliance's hands.</TE>
<TE>   The result was an atrocity. Northern Alliance commanders allied
with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum packed the surrendered Taliban members
into closed container trucks, where hundreds died of suffocation.
Thousands of surviving POWs were crammed into prison cells designed
to hold one-tenth the number. Water for 3,000 men came from a single
rusty spigot, sanitation was grossly inadequate and food and medical
care were minimal. Deaths from dysentery and exposure were common.</TE>
<TE>   In the Afghan theater, the Northern Alliance fighters were agents
of the United States. Until the Americans resurrected it, the
alliance was a spent force sequestered in less than 10% of Afghan
territory. But with American air power, financing, intelligence,
equipment, training and direction -- and U.S. Special Forces at its
side -- the Northern Alliance defeated the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. did not delegate to the Northern Alliance the task of
winning the war against the Taliban. It did, apparently, delegate
responsibility in one realm: complying with Geneva Convention
obligations to treat captured combatants humanely.</TE>
<TE>   If ever a fighting force was more unsuited to the task, it was the
Northern Alliance warriors, with their 20-year history of executing
surrendered or captured combatants, and torturing, raping and killing
noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Northern Alliance had suffered cruelly at the hands
of the Taliban, which had its own record of torture and killing.
Reprisals by the victorious Northern Alliance should have been
anticipated. When they occurred, the United States turned a blind
eye.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Kurdish and Shiite fighters who might be aligned with the
United States in an attack against Saddam Hussein have experienced
widespread abuses at the hands of Hussein's military, police and
intelligence officers. What can the United States do to prevent its
Iraqi partners from committing acts of revenge once the tables are
turned? The execution of captured combatants by coalition partners
would morally implicate the United States, erode international
support and bury possible intelligence useful to the investigation of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   One practical step would be to insist on oversight, by the
International Committee of the Red Cross, of the surrender, transfer
and confinement of enemy combatants. Another could be to dedicate a
military reserve unit to work with local coalition partners to carry
out a census of those captured and arrange decent detention
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   All U.S. military personnel could be required to protect the local
civilian population from abuses. And if atrocities are committed by
local partners, the U.S. military should secure all evidence, carry
out a full investigation and hold accountable those responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The mass murder of surrendered Taliban fighters was an ugly and
preventable crime. In the event of an attack on Iraq, the president
must order the military to anticipate and prevent similar crimes
there.</TE>

<HD>The Race for Governor</HD>
<DH>Gray Davis has signed bills to cut greenhouse gases, boost
stem cell research and aid college students</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attention, California voters: No matter what you read or hear in the
media, the governor's race is not a personality contest. That, of
course, is what most reporters are trying to make it. Nine out of 10
articles about this November's Gray Davis-Bill Simon matchup come to
the same conclusion: Nobody likes either one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, having been a friend of Davis' for more than 25 years -- ever
since we were pups, when we worked together for Gov. Jerry Brown -- I
will admit that Gray can be difficult. But he also can be fun to have
a margarita with, and he enjoys a good laugh and plays a mean game of
golf.</LD>
<LD>   So what if he's not liked? He's not running for Miss America. He's
running for reelection as governor. And the issue is not who's Mr.
Congeniality. The issue is who's better equipped, in resume and
record, to lead the largest state in the nation. On that score, there
is no contest. Davis, clearly, is. Simon, clearly, is not.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Simon, Davis didn't just fall off the turnip truck into
statewide politics. He learned the executive branch during six years
as Brown's chief of staff. He served four years in the state
Assembly. He mastered the budgetary process through eight years as
state controller, and he warmed up for governor by serving first as
lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody ever came to the California governor's office better
prepared or accomplished more in his first four years.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's unfair to compare Simon with Davis because, when it
comes to experience or record of accomplishment, Simon's not even in
the same league. His reckless accusation last week regarding a
campaign donation to Davis -- which quickly proved to be untrue --
proved that.</TE>
<TE>   A much more valid comparison is between what Davis has done and
what President Bush has not.</TE>
<TE>   As governor of the nation's most populous state, Davis actually
serves as the unofficial West Coast counterpoint to the president.</TE>
<TE>   On many issues, he has led where Bush stood still, proving once
again the adage: Where the United States is going, California is
already there.</TE>
<TE>   On higher education: Bush talks about "leaving no child behind"
yet has done nothing to make college education more accessible. Not
so Davis. One of his first achievements as governor was to sign into
law a $1.2- billion program guaranteeing financial aid for college to
any student who maintained a B average in high school. It's the
largest merit-based student-aid system in the country, now under
consideration by several other states. California leads the way.</TE>
<TE>   On health care: Davis signed legislation making California the
leading state for stem cell research, including human embryonic stem
cells. Research scientists say this could lead to the treatment or
cure of diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS (Lou Gehrig's
disease) and other debilitating diseases. Again, he went where Bush
feared to tread. Ignoring the advice of Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch,
Bill Frist and Arlen Specter, and the personal plea of former First
Lady Nancy Reagan, the president - shut down most scientific research
on stem cells. Again, California leads the way.</TE>
<TE>   On the environment: Even though global warming is the greatest
environmental danger facing the planet, Bush refuses to admit it even
exists, let alone take any action to remedy it. Davis stepped in,
making California the first and only state to require auto makers to
adopt special greenhouse gas standards for new cars, starting in
2009. Once again, California leads the way.</TE>
<TE>   On gun safety: In most of the country, what was once a hot issue
has almost disappeared from the radar screen. In fact, ever since
Bush moved into the White House, the National Rifle Assn. and gun
manufacturers have breathed easily. There have been no new attempts
at gun safety. Except in California, where Davis signed legislation
making gun manufacturers legitimate targets for product liability
lawsuits. California, the only state to do so, one more time leads
the way.</TE>
<TE>   So, the outcome of the governor's race in California is of
national, not just statewide, importance. And that may be the
strongest argument of all for giving Gray Davis four more years.</TE>

<HD>Dangerous Laxity on Medical Implant Safety</HD>
<DH>U.S. should mandate a free one-year checkup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diana Zuckerman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The news about the checkup on Vice President Dick Cheney's heart and
pacemaker came just as key congressional negotiators were meeting
behind closed doors to craft a law on all medical devices --
including Cheney's implant. It would be nice if a new law gave all
patients a free one-year checkup for their implants, like Cheney's.
Instead, the proposed law would make it easier for dangerous implants
to stay on the market.</LD>
<LD>   In the year of Enron and WorldCom, the Food and Drug
Administration is urging Congress to give a free pass to medical
device manufacturers that are too busy to conduct long-term safety
research on the implants they sell. Apparently, medical device
manufacturers are so honest that they don't need independent
oversight. Instead, the proposed law would speed up the approval of
implants and other lifesaving medical devices without any new
protections to make sure the heart valves and other implants were
safe for long-term use.</LD>
<LD>   Why worry? Although concerns about prescription drug prices, a
possible war with Iraq and other issues have dominated headlines, the
last few months have brought mind-boggling news stories questioning
the safety of implants and other medical devices.</LD>
<TE>   Here are a few examples:</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. News &amp; World Report published a story saying gastric lap
bands, bladder slings, jaw joints and other implants had caused
deaths and irrevocable damage to thousands, many of whom wanted to
lose weight or had relatively minor health problems before surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * In July, the FDA quietly held a meeting to discuss data
collected over five years on saline breast implants, which indicated
that, on average, patients suffered from several serious
complications and many required at least two additional surgeries
during the first five years.</TE>
<TE>   * In August, the Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger reported that device
manufacturers had covered up patient deaths and severe adverse
reactions instead of reporting them to the FDA as required by law.
And when companies finally reported them, the FDA did nothing to
penalize the companies for wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   With so much attention on the cost of prescription drugs, few
Americans have been concerned about medical implants. Meanwhile, we
are rapidly becoming a nation of people with implanted parts. Who
among us doesn't have a friend or relative with an implant of some
sort? My baby-boomer brother has a hip replacement, my mother-in-law
has new knees, a cousin's baby is relying on a shunt and several
friends have complications from the breast implants they chose after
mastectomies. I wonder how many of them have annual checkups for
their replacement parts the way our vice president does.</TE>
<TE>   Many implants have been on the market since before 1976, when the
FDA first was given authority to regulate medical devices. Although
they had been on the market for years, heart valves, shunts, breast
implants, jaw implants and many other devices were approved by the
FDA after only short-term studies following patients for, in some
cases, just a few weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   Even though patients will need these implants for the rest of
their lives, the FDA rarely requires studies to find out what happens
five or 10 or 20 years later. Even worse, newly designed implants are
sometimes approved based on scanty data if the company convinces the
FDA that the implants are "substantially equivalent" to other
previously approved implants.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too late for Congress to listen to its own rhetoric about
the need for independent oversight of the business world and apply it
to medical device companies. If that doesn't happen, then patients
and other buyers will just have to beware. Perhaps instead of
birthday and anniversary cards, we should start sending friends and
relatives annual reminders to get checkups on their implants. If
patients don't take matters into their own hands, we may never find
out whether these implants are safe until it is too late.</TE>

<HD>The Race for Governor</HD>
<DH>Bill Simon's policy agenda includes spending discipline,
tax cuts and regulatory restraint</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benjamin Zycher</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Many are the recent blessings enjoyed by Californians. A continuing
electricity crisis wholly avoidable but for Gov. Gray Davis'
negligence and obsession with his own political interests. A 40%
increase in electricity rates. An $8-billion state budget surplus
transformed into a $27-billion deficit, with future deficits looming
at about $15 billion annually. Public schools ranked at or near the
bottom among the states. Aging infrastructure with little coherent
planning for future population growth. An imminent water crisis, in
preparation for which the last four years have been squandered. A
climate of business taxes and regulations ranked worst in the nation
in a recent survey of entrepreneurs. About a million Californians
unemployed.</LD>
<LD>   Are we better off than we were four years ago? The question
answers itself.</LD>
<TE>   Precisely how is it that this state of affairs has come to pass?
After all, the approaches and decisions that would have mitigated
these problems were not difficult to perceive. Spending should not
have been allowed to increase 37% in two years, particularly on the
basis of volatile tax revenue from incomes and capital gains.
Electricity rates should have been increased more moderately and
sooner, and the utilities should have been allowed to sign long-term
contracts. The workers' compensation system should not have been
transformed into a bottomless pit for employers and workers while
remaining a honey pot for the attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we have descended into a chasm because we have a governor
who is cunning but not wise. Virtually every decision has been driven
by calculations of the narrow effects upon Davis' reelection
prospects and fund-raising, the larger public interest be damned.</TE>
<TE>   And so the inevitable resulting decline in the state's condition
has yielded for Davis real weakness in the polls, forcing him to
pander increasingly to the Democratic Party interest groups. That is
why, for example, he has signed a series of measures that bestow
benefits upon particular groups at the expense of the economy and
aggregate employment. A good example is the recent increase from one
year to two in the allowed time for filing many lawsuits, enriching
attorneys while increasing insurance and legal costs for everyone
else. On fund-raising, Davis has perfected a crass pay-to-play system
utterly shameless even by California standards. Davis claims,
naturally, that "policy decisions bear no relation to political
contributions." Really? Has he been able to raise $2 million per
month because of interest-group stupidity? Or because of his renowned
charm? No, it is quite clear that everyone understands that pay they
must, lest they get hammered by Davis in favor of those who pay more.
Can anyone tell what Davis stands for?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Californians have a real alternative in the form of
Bill Simon, an honorable and gracious man who has dedicated his life
and business success to charitable pursuits and improved government
policies. Simon has developed a detailed policy agenda driven by
ideas, the central theme of which is an intensive reorientation of
California state governance toward the long-term interests of the
citizens and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Spending discipline. Reduced taxation. Regulatory restraint.
Renewed investment in the infrastructure needed for future economic
growth. A de- bureaucratization of public education and restoration
of local control. A willingness to deal effectively with water
problems and other such serious conditions as they arise, rather than
after the next election, if ever. A broader focus on increasing
California's competitiveness in the national and international
economies.</TE>
<TE>   That Davis has been unable to criticize these themes is reflected
in the nature of his campaign, a series of grossly dishonest attacks
on Simon's business record. Nor has Davis, for obvious reasons, been
able to boast about his own record of politicized decisions,
shortsightedness and policy negligence, the result of which has been
a real decline in our economy and quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   Reelecting Davis would provide all public officials with the wrong
incentives: It would reward a failure to govern. Electing Simon would
begin a reform process based on policy seriousness and a long-term
perspective. Not since Ronald Reagan have California voters had this
kind of opportunity.</TE>

<HD>Clean Air Is the State's Right</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is staging an unprecedented and unwarranted
attack on California's right to regulate its own air quality. The
Justice Department, by joining a General Motors and DaimlerChrysler
lawsuit against the state's zero-emission vehicle requirement,
disregards California's explicit right to set air quality standards.
The federal government is entirely in the wrong and should withdraw
from the lawsuit immediately.</LD>
<LD>   When Congress passed the Clean Air Act more than 30 years ago, it
gave California the right to establish its own air pollution
standards, regardless of federal rules, because the state had a
unique and severe automobile-caused smog problem. California became
the nation's pioneer in demanding cleaner-burning cars; there was no
help from the automotive companies, which fought the effort and
dragged their heels all the way. The state is still in the forefront,
and the industry continues to balk.</LD>
<LD>   Early this year, auto makers sued to overturn a revised state rule
allowing hybrid autos that run alternately on gasoline-fueled engines
and batteries to count against the zero-emission requirement. The
rule was designed to help the auto industry, which is not prepared to
meet the state requirement that at least 10% of new cars sold
beginning in 2003 be zero-emission vehicles. Before the rule was
revised, that meant electric cars.</LD>
<TE>   The courts and the state Air Resources Board have, in any case,
delayed that requirement for two years to give manufacturers more
time to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrid cars such as those made by Honda and Toyota are on the
market and growing in popularity. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler
have announced plans to produce hybrids soon. True zero-emission fuel
cell vehicles will be produced by Honda and Toyota by the end of this
year but will be too expensively for wide distribution.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration claims that the state, by regulating
emissions, is trying to set a gasoline mileage standard, which only
the federal government can do. That's a sham argument.</TE>
<TE>   By the reasoning of the White House, the suit should have been
filed decades ago, when California began demanding cleaner cars. Not
that it wouldn't be a good thing for California to be able to set its
own fuel use standards, since Congress and President Bush refuse to
stiffen the current ones, adopted in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the less fuel burned, the less pollution escapes into
the air. But fuel savings are an incidental byproduct of California's
pollution controls. Without the California zero-emission mandate over
their heads, auto makers would not be where they are today with
hybrid and fuel-cell technology.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush White House, even as it has chipped away at federal clean
air and water regulations, professed to believe in states' rights.
With this lawsuit, it cynically cozies up to auto makers while
hobbling California's efforts to improve the air that its vulnerable
children breathe.</TE>

<LD>From patients with the wrong limb amputated to mothers stripped of
their childbearing ability because of a botch in the delivery room,
courts have delivered fair compensation to victims of bad medicine.
In recent years, however, soaring pain-and-suffering jury awards have
begun turning lawsuits into a lottery-style bonanza.</LD>
<LD>   Trial lawyers focus on claims with the highest reward potential, a
relative few, while ignoring other claims with merit, and they admit
they concentrate on states that have no caps on pain-and-suffering
damages. There is scant evidence that such lawsuits compel hospitals
and doctors to adopt better standards. Meanwhile, it can take years
to get a penny to any patient.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's medical malpractice system is "punitive, expensive
and inequitable for all, jeopardizing the availability of care," as
Dr. Lisa Hollier, president of the Texas Assn. of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, neatly framed the problem in recent testimony to
Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Hollier's testimony helped prompt the House last month to pass HR
4600, a bill capping pain-and-suffering damage awards for medical
negligence at $250,000, the same limit now imposed by California. The
legislation, by Rep. Jim Greenwood (R-Penn.), would help lower
doctors' medical malpractice premiums, which are soaring in states
without caps. The size of median jury awards for medical malpractice
has risen nationally -- from $474,536 in 1996 to $1 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers say the $250,000 cap, imposed in California in 1975
and never raised to account for inflation, provides far too little
compensation in 2002, however. They're right. It's also very hard to
find a lawyer to take a $250,000 case. To provide the same level of
compensation in today's dollars, the cap would have to be about
$800,000.</TE>
<TE>   But regardless of the figure that Congress finally sets, some cap
on these so-called punitive damages (compensation not for direct
economic loss but for impaired quality of life) makes sense. The
current lottery-style system hurts everyone, forcing physicians in
some states to close their practices. One measure of the chaos: In
California, insurance companies offer general surgeons malpractice
coverage for $21,000 to $43,000 a year, whereas in parts of Florida
annual premiums are as high as $159,000.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are slim that the Senate will agree to the medical
malpractice bill as it's now worded, for Democrats rightly argue that
if Congress is going to weaken patients' ability to penalize doctors
and health plans, then it must give them an alternate means of appeal
and improve detection of medical errors.</TE>
<TE>   Californians have enjoyed such recourse since 1999, with a law
guaranteeing patients the right to an independent medical review when
they believe they have been harmed by their health plan's treatment
-- or denial of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Federal legislators, rather than giving up on reform, should at
least begin drafting compromise legislation. Rather than focusing
narrowly on lowering the pain-and-suffering damages cap, Congress
should look at ways to seamlessly combine such caps with reviews of
treatment and care decisions by an independent board of medical
experts and better quality controls. The right policy would give
relief to patients as well as doctors.</TE>

<LD>Measure A, called the "earthquake and fire safety bond" on the Nov. 5
ballot, would authorize Los Angeles County to issue up to $250
million in general obligation bonds for eight cultural facilities
countywide. The measure has many strong points, the major one being a
requirement that the facilities match the bond funds with private
donations. On a ballot filled with pleas for money, it would place
the smallest burden on local taxpayers, costing the owner of a
$250,000 home about $6 the first year and declining over the bond's
30-year lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   This ballot measure would allot $98 million for the county Natural
History Museum, built in 1913 and clearly in need of safety
improvements. Safety, for museums and all other public buildings, is
a public responsibility. Deferred maintenance costs more in the long
run. An additional $98 million would go to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, which needs safety improvements, with or without the
planned make-over by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas.</LD>
<TE>   The money also would be used for new projects. The measure would
allocate $15 million each for a planned performing arts center at Cal
State Northridge and a planned cultural arts complex near El Pueblo
de Los Angeles historic district, and $8 million for a performing
arts center in the San Gabriel Valley. Yes, these projects involve
more than just making old buildings safer. A citizens oversight
committee would ensure that county money would be spent only on
earthquake and safety infrastructure, both in retrofitting old
buildings and constructing new ones. Private money would pay for
anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A is supported not only by leaders in the arts but by
earthquake and fire officials. Six bucks a year is a very small price
to pay to keep up Los Angeles County's museums and cultural centers.
Vote yes on Measure A.</TE>

<HD>More Evidence Needed to Map Portugal's Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your story "Portugal May Have Put America on the Map" (Oct. 6) not
only has Magellan as the first European to have officially sighted
the Pacific (it was Balboa) but also repeats an old idea as if it
were completely new: that an unknown Portuguese explorer ventured as
far north as present-day Acapulco up the west side of the Americas,
that this was kept "secret" for reasons of state by the Portuguese
but that somehow the German cartographer Martin Waldseemueller
incorporated this "discovery" into his world map of 1507. A book
published in 1921 raised the same claims (Edward L. Stevenson's
"Terrestrial and Celestial Globes," Volume I) but, alas, also
provided no evidence for them.</LD>
<LD>   I find more plausible the idea of Eviatar Zerubavel (in "Terra
Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America") that much of European
cartography of the "New World" in the 16th century was largely
speculative. Waldseemueller, for example, portrayed North America as
separate from Asia when this was not known for sure until
demonstrated by Captain Cook 271 years later.</LD>
<TE>   Why an armchair explorer like Waldseemueller, sitting in his study
in the small town of Saint-Die in the Vosges Mountains, would be
privy to the secrets of the king of Portugal needs some explanation.
A former CIA analyst like Peter Dickson, the author of the "new"
claims, should know how much modern intelligence is based on
guesswork rather than on firm evidence (witness disputes over
contemporary Iraq's weapons of mass destruction). The same went for
Renaissance-era cartography.</TE>

new trees and sidewalks near the new Disney Hall, and help may be on
the way for the health system.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it interesting that the supervisors can, with almost no
discussion, vote $12.5 million for trees and sidewalks ... and no one
says let's put $12.5 million into health care and help save
UCLA-Harbor hospital? Trees they spend money on; for people who need
health care they go to Washington. You figure it out!</LD>

<LD>Re "Right and Wrong Shouldn't Be Guesswork," Commentary, Oct. 9: John
Balzar is timely and on target in calling for a blue-ribbon
commission to reform and update our laws and regulations governing
basic honesty in business. I am referring here to laws that mandate
full disclosure, transparency, accountability and simple
truthfulness. Lying in business has become obsolete and can be safely
outlawed.</LD>
<LD>   Capitalism thrives on transparency and factual truth, which
underlie trust, which is the basis of trade. The ubiquity and speed
of information today make lying in business apparent,
counterproductive, dangerous and just plain foolish; it also makes
business disclosure and oversight practicable.</LD>
<LD>   As a society, we have made great progress toward achieving full
mass democracy, and, numerically, we are about halfway there to
achieving mass capitalism. We are ready now to mandate full
disclosure in our business activities. As investors in mass
capitalism, it is in our capitalistic self-interest to demand pure,
"fair" capitalism, which requires not simply the absence of lying but
also the presence of full disclosure, democratic participation,
effective oversight and swift and sure justice. It may take awhile to
bring just the right measure of these modern concepts to business,
but the blue-ribbon commission process that Balzar recommends is an
excellent place to begin.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balzar is absolutely right about making the language in laws more
straightforward. However, as long as lawyers make laws, there is
little chance of that happening. Lawyers draft vague and poorly
worded laws to keep their brethren employed suing and defending
citizens caught up in the legal ambiguities. It's legal job
insurance.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Warns Parents of Home-School Edict," Oct. 10: The
California Department of Education says parents without teachers'
credentials [or affiliation with a public school] who home-school
their children are doing so illegally. I am amazed at the hypocrisy
of the department, considering the fact that in California, 27% of
public secondary school classes are taught by teachers who lack a
college major or minor in the subject they are teaching. In other
words, art teachers in California public schools are trying to teach
history, math teachers are lecturing about biology, etc.</LD>
<LD>   Home-schoolers (who, by the way, have higher average test scores
than either public or private school students) are being attacked to
divert attention from the real problem: the abysmal track record of
public schools in our state. If the Department of Education were
really concerned about children's education (and not money) it would
spend more time figuring out how to credential public school teachers
and less time harassing home-schoolers, who are doing quite well
without the help of the public schools.</LD>

<LD>So, it has come to this: a choice for governor between the bumbling
nincompoop and the rapacious extortionist. I leave it to The Times'
readership to decide who fits those descriptions. I have decided to
return to my roots, and "waste my vote" on a minority party candidate
who cannot win. That puts my selected candidate in the same shoes as
the electorate in this race.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Simon Retreats on Allegations of Illegal Fund-Raising by
Davis," Oct. 9: Never, never in nearly 25 years have I witnessed such
a ridiculous, deplorable example of bad judgment as Bill Simon's
accusation that Gov. Gray Davis participated in illegal fund-raising.
Not only could he not back up his claim, Simon had the nerve to say
it's not his job to verify such an accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Simon, you are an embarrassment to the political process in
general and the Republican Party in particular. You should fire the
campaign aides who came up with the idea to publicly discredit Davis
and, while you are at it, fire yourself as well.</TE>
<TE>   With his challenger out of the race and without having to spend
millions on TV commercials, Davis should then pledge to return half
his campaign war chest to the state's general fund. He could donate
about $10 million to programs to feed needy children, help disabled
seniors or put more teacher aides in classrooms, for example.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to say anything to win elective office. It's
another thing altogether to be a leader. By his recent actions, Simon
has decided what means most to him.</TE>

<TE>   Why on Earth is Davis saying Simon should resign from the

candidate (especially Dick Riordan), Davis could well lose.</TE>
<TE>   Don Bender</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In recklessly accusing Davis of a crime, Simon has disqualified
himself from the office he seeks. For a former prosecutor to throw
around criminal accusations with no evidence whatsoever is
despicable. The people of California deserve much better. Simon
should remove himself from the race, and the Republican Party should
bring forward someone who will take integrity to Sacramento.</TE>

<TE>   I want to see Davis answer a few questions. Why are people in
California still losing jobs when other areas of the country are in
recovery? How did we go from a surplus to a multibillion-dollar
deficit? Why did Davis increase taxes? Why did my lights go out last
year? If he doesn't stand up in lights on statewide television and
answer those questions, it's lights out for Davis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Scouting a Main Street for a Valley City," Oct. 7: What use does
the Valley's vast low- income population have for cafes and
boutiques? For the concentration of working poor in the northeast
Valley, Ventura Boulevard might as well be downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, the solidly middle-class homeowners "north of Rinaldi"
might not match their upscale "south of the boulevard" contemporaries
in income, but I'm sure there are cafes and boutiques that don't
require them to face traffic on the 405. The lovely communities of
Chatsworth, West Hills and Tujunga probably don't consider Ventura
their lifeline either.</LD>
<LD>   While Van Nuys Boulevard at least cuts a swath through some of the
area's finest and coarsest neighborhoods, its discount department
stores and 24-hour notaries aren't exactly the hallmark of Valley
life either.</LD>
<TE>   Any realtor will tell you that Sepulveda Boulevard is the true
fulcrum of the Valley, the place where east meets west.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists of Tarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks and Studio City
might want to take a drive north on Sepulveda to decide whether the
densely packed apartments, used car lots, contractor supply centers
and motels advertising day rates are what they want to face in their
Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   Kezia Jauron</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   People who don't live in the San Fernando Valley should not get
any vote on whether the Valley secedes from Los Angeles. It should be
solely a decision for the folks in the Valley and nobody else's
business.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, if it's so much better to be part of Los Angeles,
then how come Burbank and Glendale and other independent cities
aren't rushing to become part of Los Angeles? That's because they
know they're better off not being part of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   It's crystal clear that Valley people would be far better off
being responsible only to themselves rather than staying subservient
any longer to a morbidly bloated L.A. city bureaucracy. L.A., please,
set us free! We want out! Sooner or later, it's going to happen. You
can bet your last political dollar on it.</TE>

<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>The Australian government Sunday launched a national security review
and pledged a measured but "powerful" response to a car bombing in
Bali, Indonesia, that killed more than 180 people, many of them
believed to be Australian tourists.</LD>
<LD>   The blast that ripped through two nightclubs in Kuta also
shattered the widely held view here that Australia's geographic
isolation protected it from terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "People should get out of their minds that it can't happen here.
It can, and it has happened to our own on our doorstep," Prime
Minister John Howard said. He met security advisors late Sunday and
called an emergency meeting of a key security committee for early
today.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a huge national tragedy for Australia and for
Australians," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister, a staunch supporter of the U.S.-led war on
terror, rejected any link between his strong backing of Washington
and the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   Howard said he wanted "a measured, sensible but powerful reaction"
to the bombing.</TE>

<HD>FBI Searches Debris in Bali</HD>
<DH>Death toll in terrorist bombing of nightclubs rises to 184,
including two Americans. Dozens are missing. Attackers remain
unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>KUTA, Indonesia--An FBI team sifted through the debris of Indonesia's
worst terrorist attack Sunday, searching for clues to the identity of
those who detonated a car bomb in a popular Bali nightclub district
crowded with foreign tourists.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the attack Saturday night killed at least 184
people and wounded 490. Dozens were still missing, and the death toll
was expected to rise. Police at the scene said bodies remained buried
in the rubble of the Sari Club, which was packed with foreigners when
the car bomb exploded nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Two Americans were confirmed dead and three others were among the
hundreds of people injured, a U.S. official said. At least one other
American, Steven Brooks Webster, 41, of Huntington Beach, remained
unaccounted for.</LD>
<TE>   The dead and wounded came from more than 25 nations and
represented six continents, although most of the victims were
Indonesian or Australian.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Australia said more than 200 Australians remained
unaccounted for. Prime Minister John Howard called the bombing a
national tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Grief-stricken survivors searched Bali's 13 hospitals for friends
and loved ones missing since the Saturday night blast.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian officials branded the bombing a terrorist attack, but
there was no indication whether it was connected to the Al Qaeda
terrorist network or other Islamic extremist groups that have been
operating in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent days, U.S. officials have been warning that Al Qaeda
could be preparing a new series of attacks, and some officials said
Sunday that the bombing could be part of that series.</TE>
<TE>   Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, predicted as much, saying more attacks could
occur "perhaps in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, the Indonesian police spokesman, said it
was "premature" to draw any conclusions about who was behind the
attack. The bomb was placed in a Toyota Kijang van and apparently
detonated by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush denounced the bombing as "a cowardly
act designed to create terror and chaos.... We must call this
despicable act by its rightful name, murder."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department ordered U.S. government personnel in
nonessential positions and embassy families out of Indonesia because
of the threat of more terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some extremist Muslim leaders asserted that the bombing was
carried out by the United States in a plot to embarrass Indonesia and
undermine the radical Islamic movement. As proof, they pointed to the
low number of American casualties.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials immediately denied the claim.</TE>
<TE>   "These statements are totally outrageous and completely false,"
said one American official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kuta district of Bali, witnesses and survivors Sunday
described a scene of horror from the night before, with severed heads
and limbs strewn around the streets in front of the Sari Club.</TE>
<TE>   One motorcyclist said the blast was so powerful that he saw a car
thrown through the air.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those injured suffered serious burns or lost arms or legs.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, many foreign visitors were in a state of shock and
bewilderment. Some marveled at their narrow escape. Others were
gripped by despair as they realized that missing friends probably
would not be found alive.</TE>
<TE>   John Woodley, a bandage over his left cheek and ear, returned to
the scene of the explosion Sunday afternoon to see the devastation he
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The Sari Club, where he had been drinking the night before, was
leveled, except for the twisted metal frame of its sign, which was
turned on end and pointing oddly toward the sky.</TE>
<TE>   All around were buildings gutted by fire, including a bank and
another bar that had been crowded that night, Paddy's Irish Club.
Glass and debris littered the nearby streets, and the smell of smoke
hung in the air. Dozens of police officers kept sightseers at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Woodley, a 28-year-old Londoner, said he was standing in the
center of the packed nightclub when the car bomb exploded, destroying
the building in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   The corrugated metal roof collapsed on the crowd, he said,
trapping scores of people.</TE>
<TE>   Woodley said he was knocked to the ground and lost his glasses and
sandals.</TE>
<TE>   But somehow, a small hole in the wreckage appeared above him and
he crawled through. He ran to safety as the building burst into
flames. He suffered only burns on his face and cuts on his leg.</TE>
<TE>   "I was incredibly lucky," he said. "There were 300 people in
there. I cannot imagine that many of them survived."</TE>
<TE>   At Sanga Hospital, hundreds of Indonesians and foreigners milled
around, hoping to find people they hadn't seen since the explosion. A
list of the missing was posted on a wall. A few were marked as found,
a few others as dead.</TE>
<TE>   A Swedish tourist, who gave his name only as Bjorn, said he was in
the bathroom at the back of the Sari Club when the blast hit.</TE>
<TE>   He hardly knows how he escaped but recalls coming to a high brick
wall, where he pushed others over to safety. He doesn't remember how
he got over the wall himself.</TE>
<TE>   The moment of the blast was the first time he had been apart from
his girlfriend the entire evening, he said Sunday. He had not seen
her since.</TE>
<TE>   After his escape, he helped load five bodies into a car and rode
with them to the hospital in the hope of finding her there.</TE>
<TE>   At first he thought the five were the only ones killed and was
optimistic he would soon find her. But as the dead bodies piled up,
his hopes dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   He searched for her among the dozens of charred, unidentified
bodies in the hospital morgue. But even there he didn't find her.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday evening, nearly 24 hours after the blast, he sat dejectedly
at the hospital, watching medics roll the wounded past on gurneys.</TE>
<TE>   "We were about to leave," he said, staring at the ground. "Another
five minutes and we would have been gone."</TE>
<TE>   One of Saturday's heroes was Made Swastika, 30, an Indonesian
management consultant who was walking near the Sari Club when the car
bomb exploded.</TE>
<TE>   In the chaos, he saw a young Swiss woman who had been blown out of
the nightclub by the blast and was severely burned.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw this girl badly injured, lying on the street, and nobody
helped her," he said. "She was dying."</TE>
<TE>   Swastika carried the woman to his motorcycle and drove her to the
hospital. Again there was no one to help her, so he got a pair of
scissors and cut the clothes off her burns.</TE>
<TE>   After going home briefly to change out of his bloody clothes, he
returned and stayed with her through the night and all day until she
was airlifted to Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "I took pity seeing those injured people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital's makeshift morgue, dozens of medical workers
began the laborious process of identifying bodies burned and maimed
beyond recognition.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 corpses were laid out on a covered walkway in the
tropical heat amid blocks of ice to keep them cool. Local residents
peered over a wall to watch the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, it was possible to take hair samples for DNA
analysis. In others, it was necessary to cut the body open and obtain
a tissue sample.</TE>
<TE>   Putra Swi Antara was one of a dozen Balinese medical students who
was helping out. But foremost in his mind was the effect the bombing
would have on Bali, a predominantly Hindu island that until Saturday
had been spared much of the turmoil affecting the rest of Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Bali, famous for its surfing beaches and terraced rice paddies,
depends heavily on tourism. Most Balinese have at least one relative
who works in the tourism industry.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some tourists are so frightened that they are leaving their
hotels and sleeping at the airport until they can get a flight home.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing residents are worried about is tourism," said
Antara, 20, as he watched his fellow students take samples from the
corpses. "Almost all of the tourists are checking out and departing."</TE>

take effect the day the feminist writer, who resides in Europe, is

confidence in President Daniel Arap Moi in a dispute over the ruling
party's nominee for presidential elections.</LD>
<LD>   The quintet objected to Moi's selection of Uhuru Kenyatta as the
presidential nominee of the Kenya African National Union party.
Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, was a
relative political unknown before Moi backed him. The ruling party is
expected to hold a twice-postponed nominating convention today.</LD>

<HD>Did the Butler Do It? Curious Britons Wait for Trial</HD>
<DH>Dirty linen may air in court as Diana's ex-servant fights
charges of stealing her property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In what threat- ens to turn into a sensational airing of British
royal intrigue, relatives of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, will
go to court today to try to recover possessions they claim were
stolen by a former butler after her death five years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Burrell, 44, is charged with stealing 342 personal items --
from Diana's Michael Jackson "Bad" CD to a closetful of designer
clothing to an authentic "Indiana Jones" bullwhip -- that her family
insists rightfully belong to either her estate, Prince Charles or her
elder son, Prince William.</LD>
<LD>   Burrell was a butler and friend to the princess through the
turbulent last 10 years of her life, a man she once famously referred
to as her "rock." As Diana's marriage to Charles imploded in a
venomous public display, Burrell remained her most trusted confidant,
relied upon for discretion, advice and, he now claims, the
safekeeping of many private letters, photographs and gifts.</LD>
<TE>   It is those items that have landed him in the dock at London's Old
Bailey. Officially, the prosecution is being brought by the crown --
in this case, Diana's former mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II. But
the queen vs. Paul Burrell is very much a Spencer family action, a
move led by Diana's relatives to recover what they see as theirs.
Both Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Diana's sister, and Frances Shand Kydd,
her mother, are expected to testify for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The family's implication is that Burrell took the items with the
intent of cashing in on the enduring worldwide fascination with
Diana. Estimates have put the value of the trove at epartment5 million, or
about $7.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Burrell, a married father of two who now runs a flower shop
near the Welsh border, claims he was only doing what a trusted
professional butler does: honoring the wishes of a client who wanted
the items kept away from grasping hands. Diana's possessions were not
on display in his house, his lawyer argued when Burrell was arraigned
more than a year ago. They were stored safely in boxes in his attic
-- just as Diana wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the fascination about the trial stems from the nature of
the catalog.</TE>
<TE>   It runs from crockery to crystal, from the sacred -- a letter to
Diana from Mother Teresa -- to the mundane, like the "Baywatch" card
autographed to William from star David Hasselhoff. There are hundreds
of photographs and negatives, from family holiday snaps to pictures
of early birthday parties for William and his brother, Harry.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of haute couture clothes and accessories are listed: from
Versace ball gowns to Prada purses.</TE>
<TE>   Charles also wants a white metal pepper grinder back. But by
challenging the ownership of these items, the prince and his former
in-laws have committed themselves to a potentially uncomfortable
5-week-long inquisition over their own conduct.</TE>
<TE>   The court is likely to hear testimony about the royal family's
behavior during the days after Diana's death in a Paris car accident,
when the House of Windsor and the Spencer family reportedly warred in
shabby ways. Burrell was present throughout those days and was so
close to the Spencers that he was asked to help dress the princess'
body for burial.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a gentleman, and I wish him well," says Philip Gosling, the
speakers' agent who has promoted Burrell as an authority on etiquette
and entertaining. "He has never tried to make money selling his
story, and he could have sold a book for whatever price, given who he
is."</TE>
<TE>   Just exactly what kind of man Burrell is remains a question. After
a long delay, the trial is expected to determine whether he
represents the epitome of the loyal butler or the opportunistic
thief.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A four-year drought in Afghanistan has wiped out more than 80% of the
cattle, sheep and goats in the north of the country, contributing
significantly to the impoverishment of rural populations there, the
United Nations said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   A survey of 884 villages conducted by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization in March and April found that the number of
cattle in the north had been reduced 84% from 1997-1998. Spokesman
Etienne Careme said the survey indicated that 80% of sheep and goats
had died in that period.</LD>
<LD>   FAO officials have warned that the drought poses a serious threat
to the country's meat supply. Merchants have been importing poultry,
sheep and cattle from Iran and Pakistan, but those animals are not
quarantined.</LD>

<HD>Koreans Not All for One</HD>
<DH>The South's younger generations are indifferent or even
hostile to the notion of reunification with the impoverished North.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- Kim In Woo, an aspiring architect with spiky hair and a
Levi's sweatshirt, has never met a North Korean and never hopes to
meet one. In fact, the 20-year-old South Korean student would be
perfectly happy to keep the North Koreans on their side of the DMZ
forever.</LD>
<LD>   Flipping distractedly through a Cosmopolitan magazine on a table
in an Internet cafe where he and a friend are waiting for a computer
to open up, Kim shrugs his shoulders at the idea of reuniting North
and South. "We are enjoying an affluent life right now," he says.
"Why bother?"</LD>
<LD>   Such talk would have been tantamount to heresy a few years ago.
Since the peninsula was divided after World War II and convulsed by
the Korean War, it has been conventional wisdom that Koreans are a
people yearning to be made whole again, a people who spend their
waking hours pining for their missing countrymen.</LD>
<TE>   "Unification is our desire. Even in our dreams, it is our desire,"
go the lyrics to a song that is as familiar to millions of South
Korean schoolchildren as the national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   But South Korea's younger generations are increasingly indifferent
or downright hostile to the idea of reunification. With no personal
experience of the 1950-53 Korean War and little, if any, contact with
North Koreans, many would just as soon ignore the very existence of
the impoverished communist nation hovering to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Recent events, such as the groundbreaking on a railroad connecting
the Koreas and a parade of North Korean delegations heading south for
officially sanctioned sporting and cultural exchanges, have been
greeted with emotions ranging from trepidation to apathy.</TE>
<TE>   When the North and South Korean national soccer teams faced off
last month in a friendly match at Seoul's World Cup stadium, tickets
went begging. The lack of interest led the city to scrap plans to
broadcast the game on outdoor screens, as it had when millions of
fans took to the streets three months earlier for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "People my age are not that interested in North Korea. Why create
problems for ourselves?" said Park Ji Sung, a 26-year-old
fashion-industry worker who was drinking a cup of Starbucks coffee
recently in a busy Seoul shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   When pollsters query South Koreans about reunification, a large
majority of respondents--about 70%--say they are in favor. For many
people, to answer otherwise would be akin to saying they are opposed
to peace or democracy. But when they are asked--as the newspaper
Joong Ang Ilbo did in a poll published last month--if they would be
willing to pay higher taxes for reunification, the number skids down
to 53%. And even most of those who favor reunification say it
shouldn't happen for another 20 years or so.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked by the rapidity with which we have abandoned
unification although we go on with the rhetoric. We've become a bunch
of hypocrites," said Kim Kyung Won, a former South Korean ambassador
to the U.S. and president of the Social Science Institute in Seoul.
"There is a lot of romantic nonsense about wanting unification, but
when you come right down to it, people don't want to pay the bills.
And if they want unification, they want it in the future--the more
distant, the better."</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts here trace the decline of reunification fervor
to the 1997 financial crisis that sent unemployment skyrocketing and
forced South Korea to seek a bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   South Koreans were also sobered by watching the costly German
reunification process. Until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989,
the very concept of a reunified Korea remained abstract. Afterward,
Koreans realized that it really could happen--but that it would not
be free.</TE>
<TE>   Jo Dong Ho, an economist who heads the North Korea section at the
Korea Development Institute, a government-funded think tank, said the
German experience prompted many economists, including at his own
institute, to churn out reports estimating the cost of reunifying the
Koreas.</TE>
<TE>   They ranged from $300 billion to $1.8 trillion, averaging around
$600 billion over a 10-year period, according to Jo.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a stupid exercise," Jo said. "They were only looking at
the costs, not taking into account the benefits tangible and
intangible. We will have a bigger market. We will have economies of
scale. We will have better access to Russia and to China."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the sticker shock, Jo said, South Korean television
aired a number of programs featuring East and West Germans
complaining about their resulting economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People got scared. They thought, 'Better to be in South Korea
with my own friends and leave the North Koreans up there with their
friends,' " Jo said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important person to be chastened by the German
experience was Kim Dae Jung, a dissident at the time of the Berlin
Wall's collapse and now South Korea's president. Widely regarded as
one of the most ardent advocates of reunification, Kim now says it
should not take place for several decades. In the interim, he says,
all efforts should be made to engage North Korea in dialogue and
improve its standard of living.</TE>
<TE>   Some political analysts believe that Kim's "sunshine policy"--for
which he won a Nobel Peace Prize--has subtly shifted in emphasis:
Instead of a steppingstone to reunification, they say, it has become
a way of propping up the North to prevent a Germany-like scenario in
which its communist system collapses and the country is incorporated
into the capitalist South.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government last year gave North Korea $70.5
million worth of aid, and private parties in South Korea donated $65
million, according to figures published by the South Korean
Unification Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "The government of South Korea seems to take it as a matter of
theology that North Korea should not collapse. One obvious reason is
the financial implications.... It would be much tidier if the North
would clean up its act before unification," said Nicholas Eberstadt,
a North Korea specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative Washington think tank. "That's why North Korea is being
kept alive today by ... the kindness of strangers. It has no visible
means of self-support."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking informally with foreign journalists at a recent lunch,
President Kim said his thoughts about reunification haven't changed.
But he said three trips to Germany in the mid-1990s confirmed his
belief that an incremental approach is best.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Berlin Wall fell, there remained a wall in the head. I
saw the huge differences that existed between east and west Germany
and the conflicts between the people," he said. "I became more
convinced that my gradual method of starting with exchanges and
cooperation was the right approach."</TE>
<TE>   When asked by one journalist if it was possible that North Korea
would collapse much like East Germany did, Kim's press secretary cut
off the president before he could answer, switching deftly to another
topic. Economic advisors in the South Korean government also refuse
to answer questions about the impact of North Korea failing, and say
it will never happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The South Koreans are not really afraid of the North Koreans
attacking. What they worry about is North Korea collapsing and [the
South] being saddled with all these refugees," said a Western
diplomat with long experience in South Korea. "It is understood that
the South Koreans don't need 23 million cold, hungry, angry North
Koreans dumped on their laps. They want to keep the economic miracle
rolling on."</TE>
<TE>   In North Korea, the official government line is that Koreans are
one people who should be reunified as soon as possible. North Koreans
who have defected to the South often remark how surprised they were
to learn that South Koreans are less keen on the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fiercely competitive society. People are too busy to
have time to think about North Korea," said Kim Eun Chul, 32, a
defector now working for an on-line shopping company in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past I vaguely thought we must unite, but now I think each
country should remain separate, just like now," said Jeon Hae Suk,
27, an office worker. "We were apart for so long that I think
problems would arise were we to mix."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many South Koreans continue to speak out passionately in
favor of reunification and attend rallies. Those most adamant are
often left-leaning North Korea sympathizers or, conversely, hard-line
conservatives who believe that the sooner North Korea collapses the
better. Mainstream opinion is generally supportive of Kim Dae Jung's
sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea. None of the three
major candidates vying to succeed Kim in the December election is
opposed to reunifying, but none is pushing to do it quickly.</TE>
<TE>   As in any society as politically polarized as South Korea,
generalizing is risky. But polls suggest that older people,
especially those with relatives in North Korea, are more strongly in
favor of reunification, while younger people have less interest in
it.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the Korea Education Development Institute in 2000
showed that 75% of middle and high school students opposed
reunification.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger people are, the more they are indifferent. To them,
the way Korea is divided now seems normal. It is all they know. They
don't have relatives they know in the North. They are living well and
they know North Koreans are very poor," said Paek Seung, 20, a
business student in Seoul who often finds herself alone among friends
in supporting reunification. "I hear this all the time. I feel
helpless to convince people otherwise."</TE>

<DL>BEIT JALA, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian militant whose clan has been targeted by Israeli
security forces was killed Sunday when a public telephone exploded in
his hand -- one of six Palestinians to die in a day of violence,
Palestinians said.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Shtewie Abayat was on the phone outside Beit Jala
Hospital near the West Bank city of Bethlehem when the apparatus blew
up, killing him, according to doctors. Relatives said he belonged to
a militia linked to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians blamed Israel, as they did when two other members of
the clan were killed over the last two years. The Israeli military
declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip on Sunday, Palestinians said a 4-year-old boy
was one of two Palestinians fatally shot during what the Israeli army
described as a firefight when troops entered the Rafah refugee camp
to search for smuggling tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   In other violence, Israeli soldiers killed two armed men who
crossed into southern Israel from Egypt, and a 56-year-old woman was
killed when soldiers opened fire on her vehicle, which was trying to
evade a roadblock near the West Bank city of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel C. Kurtzer sent a
strongly worded message to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office over
the weekend, saying Israel had not met promises to ease tough
restrictions imposed on the Palestinians.</TE>

<HD>Southland Surfers Caught in Blast</HD>
<DH>Orange County men were at Bali club when the bomb went off.

<LD>Just to be safe after last year's terrorist attacks in New York and
the Pentagon, Steven Brooks Webster and his friends canceled a
long-planned surfing trip to Fiji. This year, they decided to go for
it -- but picked the surf-rich Indonesian island of Bali.</LD>
<LD>   Webster and one of his friends were inside a Bali nightclub
Saturday night when a powerful car bomb exploded, a terrorist attack
that killed more than 180 people and injured hundreds.</LD>
<LD>   Webster is missing, and his friend is hospitalized with
third-degree burns.</LD>
<TE>   Webster's family received word of his disappearance from friends
who flew with him on what the 41-year-old said was going to be his
last surfing trip abroad. He was scheduled to return today.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope, somehow, he might have survived," said Stephen
Quartararo, Webster's business partner at the Newport Beach-based
engineering firm S&amp;S Commercial Environmental Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's longtime friend Nicholas Yuschenkoff of Laguna Niguel on
Sunday said he had spoken by telephone with the two friends traveling
with Webster. Webster was inside the Sari Club, a bar popular among
foreigners, just before the bomb blew, he was told.</TE>
<TE>   One friend, John Frederick Parodi Jr., 42, of Huntington Beach,
left the bar just before the bombing, according to Yuschenkoff and a
Webster family member. Another, William Steven Cabler, 42, of Newport
Beach, pulled himself out from the rubble to get medical attention,
Yuschenkoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends are e-mailing Webster's photo to authorities in
Bali and to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We want his picture out there so we can get his face and name in
the mind of people who may know where he is," said a family member
who did not want to be identified. "We're facing reality, though.
Hopefully, he is at one of the hospitals or in a private home."</TE>
<TE>   Webster's wife and her large extended family were too distraught
to speak Sunday afternoon. Family and friends gathered at the
couple's Huntington Beach home, not far from some of Webster's
favorite local surfing spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe there will be a happy outcome," a neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster works in Newport Beach and often goes surfing in the
middle of the day. Quartararo said Webster -- also an avid fisherman
and golfer -- realized he was getting older and might not have the
opportunity to make such a trip again.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, he took several surfing trips to Mexico and Fiji with
friends, but since getting married about five years ago, the trips
became less of a priority, Quartararo said.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew he was over 40 and getting older. He was a great athlete
but he was slowing down," Quartararo said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was dedicated to his wife, Mona; 5-year-old son, Dylan;
and teenage stepdaughter, Samantha, Quartararo said, but always
managed to find time to surf.</TE>
<TE>   Yuschenkoff, a 35-year-old commercial insurance salesman, was one
of three surfing buddies Webster had for more than a decade.
Yuschenkoff said he would have traveled with Webster and the other
two but was on his honeymoon in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   When Yuschenkoff returned and heard news reports about the bombing
on TV, "a hair stood up on the back of my neck," he said. "I had a
bad feeling. I have good intuition I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Bali "is the best place on the planet, or it was," Yuschenkoff
said. "Americans are [treated like] kings over there."</TE>
<TE>   The Sari Club was a place where locals were often turned away. On
a previous trip, Yuschenkoff said he was only able to get a Balinese
man into the Sari after bribing a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever did this knew they would be attacking foreigners," he
said. "If they were trying to send a message, they knew exactly what
they were doing."</TE>

<HD>Serbian Vote Invalidated by Low Turnout</HD>
<DH>The winner may be nationalist Seselj, who didn't make it
onto second-round ballot but may be included in the new election.</DH>

<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia--Apathy and fears of the Western-style reforms
promised by both candidates apparently succeeded in defeating the
electoral process in Serbia on Sunday, raising doubts about the
stability of Yugoslavia's political institutions.</LD>
<LD>   Too few voters went to the polls for the presidential election to
be valid under the law in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. The
statute requires that more than 50% of registered voters cast
ballots, but according to unofficial results from watchdog groups and
political parties, the turnout was only 45%.</LD>
<LD>   In many ways, the winner was a man whose name was not on the
ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Vojislav Seselj -- a crony of ousted Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and an extreme nationalist who came in third Sept. 29 in
the first round of the election -- had called on his supporters to
shun the polls in Sunday's runoff. It seems that enough of them
listened to invalidate the runoff's results, forcing a completely new
cycle of voting.</TE>
<TE>   Few people doubt that Seselj will compete in the next elections,
which Serbian officials said Sunday will be called for the end of
November. Most think he will do better than the first time, possibly
ending up in the next runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "What is obvious is that Serbia gave Seselj a chance to try
again," Mladjan Dinkic, the governor of the Serbian National Bank,
the equivalent of the United States' Federal Reserve, said as
Sunday's results came in.</TE>
<TE>   "The failure of the election will blow the wind in Seselj's back,"
said Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in Belgrade, capital of
both Serbia and what remains of the Yugoslav federation. "Now he may
become a serious player."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's election was a runoff between the two highest
vote-getters in the first round: Vojislav Kostunica, the current
Yugoslav president, who succeeded Milosevic, and Miroljub Labus, a
Communist-era economics professor who is now Yugoslavia's deputy
prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   For Yugoslav elected officials to have meaningful roles, they must
move into the Serbian government because the rump Yugoslav
federation, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, is on the verge of
becoming a far less powerful entity. An agreement slated to go into
effect in the next few months will loosen the ties between Serbia and
Montenegro, making the Yugoslav government largely ceremonial.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a new president and uncertainty about whether the next
round of elections will succeed will almost certainly slow down
economic reforms and, as a result, Western investment. Kostunica has
repeatedly said that failure to elect a president would inflict
"instability, tensions and chaos" on the republic and jeopardize
unfinished reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kostunica and Labus had promised to support reforms advocated
by the international community, including privatization of state-
owned companies, the phasing out of an array of state subsidies and
aligning the country closer with Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Labus is close to Serbia's reform-oriented prime minister, Zoran
Djindjic, and Kostunica, although inclined to take a slower approach,
also backs moving the country toward Europe. A constitutional lawyer
by training, he has been more focused on judicial reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Of the roughly 3 million votes cast Sunday, Kostunica won 66% and
Labus 31%.</TE>
<TE>   However, neither candidate's platform inspired many Serbs, who had
high hopes that the post-Milosevic era would bring changes that would
improve their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a number of people are suffering in the wake of economic
reforms that have left some without jobs and created pervasive
insecurity, since privatization means many more firms will have to
slash their payrolls. Unemployment already stands at 40%, the
government says.</TE>
<TE>   Although the salaries of those with jobs have increased, they have
not kept up with inflation in the prices for previously subsidized
goods, including sugar, bread and cooking oil. Heat is another
crucial item that is expected to increase in price by 50% in the
coming winter, according to a government announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people are very tired of politics," said Emina Cano
Tomic, 35, a mother of two and a Labus supporter. "Our expectations
were very big two years ago, and slowly, from month to month, we are
finding not many things improved. Some things are even worse, and it
makes people give up on politics."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Seselj ran primarily on an anti-reform ticket,
promising more security to people and pledging to eradicate
corruption--a dig at Djindjic and by extension Labus. Djindjic is
widely viewed in Serbia as having links to organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   The term of the current Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic,
expires in early January. Milutinovic, a former Milosevic ally, is
under indictment by the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, where Milosevic is on trial, but
there was a tacit agreement that he would not be extradited while he
was in office.</TE>

<HD>Iraq's Tribes May Provide a Secret Weapon for Hussein</HD>
<DH>One of the largest groups could serve as a militia,
complicating action by American forces. The regime has nurtured them
with aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AL RASHEED, Iraq</DL>
<LD>AL RASHEED, Iraq -- The Iraqi army, the Republican Guard and even his
Baath Party are among Saddam Hussein's main military forces. But one
of the Iraqi leader's secret weapons may well be a 72-year-old man
who wears flowing desert robes and lives with his family in this
village just south of Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   He is Khudeir Abbas Hamdan Shwerid, a mild-mannered grandfather
who, since age 15, has been the leader, or sheik, of one of Iraq's
largest tribes, the Abu Hamdan.</LD>
<LD>   The sheik says the tribe has hundreds of thousands of members
spread across Iraq -- people bound by birth to a group with roots
stretching to the Omayyad Empire in the 7th century. They are, at
least for now, loyal to Hussein and are prepared to serve as a
militia fighting foreign forces and as a national guard that could
quell internal conflicts.</LD>
<TE>   The Abu Hamdan are one small piece of a larger weapon. Hundreds of
tribes are scattered throughout this land. And whereas previous Iraqi
rulers have tried to crush the tribes for fear they would challenge
their authority, Hussein has nurtured them, winning their good favor
with money and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying the tribes could match the firepower of the U.S.
armed forces in the event of an invasion, but they promise to
complicate any military operation. Perhaps more consequential to U.S.
policymakers, the tribal system adds yet another balkanizing element
to a society already fractured along ethnic and religious lines.
Should the Hussein regime fall, a replacement government would have
to win the hearts of not only the Sunnis and Shiites, the Kurds and
Turkomans, but the hundreds of tribal leaders to whom they're also
loyal.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we will resist anyone who comes here, using our own
weapons," Shwerid said while seated inside a guest house he uses to
greet tribal members who travel from around the country seeking his
help and advice. "The tribe is fully cooperating with the
government."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, if a significant number of tribes abandoned their
fealty to the regime, a drive to topple Hussein might be
strengthened. But there is ample evidence that tribes could play a
crucial role in helping Hussein maintain his grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, after a U.S.-led coalition drove Iraqi forces from
Kuwait, an armed uprising erupted in the south. The Iraqis deny
internationally accepted accounts that the revolt was staged by
Shiite Muslims, who constitute a majority in this nation ruled by
Sunni Muslims. The official Iraqi version is that Iranians staged the
rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   But whoever was responsible, the government acknowledges that it
was the tribes, including the Abu Hamdan, that helped restore order
and, with the military, reaffirm Hussein's control over the country.</TE>
<TE>   The tribes proved themselves a valuable ally during the previous
decade as well, when they supplied tens of thousands of their members
to help fight Iran in a war that stretched on for eight years and
left hundreds of thousands dead on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "The tribes are very influential," said Saad Naji Jawad, a
political science professor at Baghdad University.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shwerid's tribe members are spread across the country, he
maintains loyalty through a system of family ties and honor that has
been handed down for generations -- and also, he says, with a good
deal of cash.</TE>
<TE>   These are hard times for Iraqis, and the government cannot provide
all the resources people need to survive. Each month, Shwerid says,
he gives an allowance to 1,000 needy members of his tribe. He says he
also routinely gives cash gifts to young men, so that they can get
what they need to marry.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Shwerid serves as a mediator in disputes, both civil
and criminal. Although he is careful not to place himself above
national law, his followers often turn to him, rather than the Iraqi
courts, to resolve disputes. For example, if one person kills another
on purpose, Shwerid will order the aggressor to pay the victim's
family $7,000 in blood money.</TE>
<TE>   So deep are the roots of tribal identity that they spread far
beyond the reaches of small, agricultural villages like this one and
into the heart of Baghdad, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "There is great respect for the tribes, even among those of us who
live in the city," said Eehab Rafe, 29, owner of an electronics shop
in Baghdad's most upscale neighborhood. He is a member of the Zobeida
tribe, which hails from the northern city of Mosul.</TE>
<TE>   Before Islam came to the Arabian Peninsula, about 1,400 years ago,
the main source of identity for many people was their tribe. Tribes
provided a sense of community and order in what could otherwise have
been a lawless existence. Tribal members lived by a code of conduct
centered on pride and honor.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Islam came to the Arab world, religion became
intertwined with the traditional way of life, particularly in
countries such as Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, where tribal
identities were strong and central governments generally weak.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, when the British-backed monarchy was overthrown, Iraq's
new rulers viewed the tribal system as backward and primitive. The
king had placed tribal leaders above the law, but the new government
did not.</TE>
<TE>   It was some time after the Baath Party took power in 1968 that the
government turned to the tribes as a means to help maintain internal
cohesion -- and power, observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's relationship with the tribes initially was cautious,
since he was always suspicious of any organization that might have
the ability to challenge his rule. Indeed, over the years, various
tribal factions moved against him. They got nowhere and were quickly
crushed.</TE>
<TE>   But after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when Hussein was struggling
to reassert his authority and hold his country together, he turned
ever more sharply toward the tribes.</TE>
<TE>   He offered them money, resources and an opportunity to exert
influence. One of the factors that helped him earn their loyalty was
the international trade sanctions placed on Iraq after the war.
Although the sanctions were intended as a short-term penalty to force
Baghdad to comply with U.N. resolutions, they have been in place for
12 years. As a result, tribes that once were largely independent have
had to turn to the government for help.</TE>
<TE>   Shwerid, for example, lives in an agricultural community with
400,000 residents. They grow dates and potatoes, wheat and barley,
tomatoes and cucumbers. But with sanctions in place, it is hard to
come by first-class seeds, or pesticides, or materials to build
greenhouses -- so the tribes turn to the president to get what they
need.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ties Attack to Terrorists, Warns of Further Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The deadly bombing of a nightclub district in Indonesia drew strong
condemnation from President Bush on Sunday as the State Department
warned that Americans should consider leaving the country because of
the threat of more terrorist violence.</LD>
<LD>   Bush sought to tie the bombing, which killed more than 180 people
at what was a popular tourist spot on the island of Bali, to
worldwide terrorism and called it "a cowardly act designed to create
terror and chaos."</LD>
<LD>   "The world must confront this global menace, terrorism," Bush said
in a statement. "We must together challenge and defeat the idea that
any wanton killing of civilians advances any cause or supports any
aspirations. And we must call this despicable act by its rightful
name, murder."</LD>
<TE>   Although no group has claimed responsibility, the bombing
apparently was the worst terrorist strike in the world since Sept.
11, 2001. It took place on the two-year anniversary of the bombing of
the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said the Bali attack "comes on the heels of
previous warnings of Americans at risk, and highlights the mounting
threat to Americans wherever they are in Indonesia." Americans should
"examine the necessity of continuing to remain," it said, and urged
them to keep a "low profile."</TE>
<TE>   The department said it was reevaluating its own presence in the
archipelago country, which is the world's most populous Islamic
nation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been warning in recent days that they feared
that a reconstituted Al Qaeda -- the worldwide terrorist network
believed responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks -- was mounting a new
round of terrorist action. On Sunday, officials said they believed
this bombing could be part of that new spasm.</TE>
<TE>   This wave of attacks might include last week's bombing of a French
supertanker off Yemen, which has been attributed to terrorists, and
an attack on U.S. Marines during a military exercise in Kuwait,
officials said. The attack in Kuwait killed one Marine and injured
another.</TE>
<TE>   Only days ago, an audiotape was circulated in which a senior Al
Qaeda official, Ayman Zawahiri, appeared to be trying to incite an
imminent wave of terrorist actions.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said evidence has been mounting that the Al Qaeda
network is present in Indonesia and has been reaching out to local
extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent weeks, we have been able to put an end to a year of
speculation as to whether Al Qaeda might be in Indonesia, or
relocating to Indonesia, or using Indonesia as a base of operations,
after the fall of Afghanistan," Ralph Boyce, the U.S. ambassador to
Indonesia, told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), ranking member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said on ABC-TV's "This Week" that "this is
the beginning of a lot more we're going to see, perhaps in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   One important question is how the attack will play into the debate
over whether the United States should invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The White House is likely to argue that the recent attacks prove
the U.S. should not wait to deal with the security threats it faces,
including Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But those who are skeptical about the campaign against Iraq could
point to the attack in Bali as proof that terrorism is the paramount
and yet-unfinished threat that the United States should tackle first.</TE>
<TE>   "This event can cut both ways," said Sheldon W. Simon, a
specialist in U.S.-Asia security issues at Arizona State University.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said the State Department's warning to Americans to consider
leaving Indonesia could displease the Indonesian government by
suggesting that the country is unsafe for foreigners. The suggestion
could hurt the foreign investment that Indonesia badly needs to
continue its economic recovery, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tourist industry is the third-largest source of foreign
currency for Indonesia, which is only beginning to emerge from an
economic crisis that began in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing also puts new pressure on a government that has been
in a predicament over how to handle militant domestic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and some countries neighboring Indonesia have prodded the
government there to take action against figures believed to be
connected to Al Qaeda and an associated group, Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is difficult for the weak government; many Indonesians
believe the U.S. has embarked on an anti-Islamic crusade.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced Al Qaeda is the prime mover in
Indonesia's terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, the U.S.-Asia security expert, said that despite the White
House's interest in tying the bombing to Al Qaeda, he does not
believe it has been clearly established that the international
terrorist network is a major player in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "From my research, I don't think the linkages are clear," he said.</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Six months after surviving a brief coup by rebel generals and
admirals, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday led a massive
rally and sternly warned his foes not to try another military putsch
against him.</LD>
<LD>   "If the coup plotters want to try another coup, then we're waiting
for them," the president told the cheering crowd.</LD>
<LD>   The rally was held to commemorate the day in April when Chavez was
restored to office by loyal troops and supporters after being deposed
for 48 hours by disgruntled officers.</LD>
<TE>   The rally was also a response to a large opposition march in
Caracas on Thursday. The mass turnouts in both events reflected the
intensity of the political conflict that is shaking one of the
world's largest oil exporters.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, an outspoken nationalist who was elected in 1998 six years
after staging a botched coup, scoffed at an opposition ultimatum to
call a national strike next Monday if he did not resign and call
early elections by this Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only got three days left! Gosh, I'm scared," he joked,
saying his hard-line foes, whom he condemned as "fascist,
coup-plotting elites," were "all bark and no bite."</TE>
<TE>   The president said more than 2 million people turned out for the
rally, but no independent estimates were available.</TE>

<HD>Growers Shed Organic Label, Keep Roots</HD>
<DH>New rules mean many small farmers will use other words to
describe their chemical-free ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARPINTERIA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Bill Coleman's arugula isn't pretty. It has holes in the center of
each leaf from the nibblings of flea beetles.</LD>
<LD>   And every now and then, a snail will inch down a slender green
stem among a bunch on sale in his stall at the local farmers markets.</LD>
<LD>   But, he said, that's usually not a turnoff for most of the
prestigious chefs and home cooks who buy from him.</LD>
<TE>   "That's how they know it's organic," and untouched by pesticides,
the white-haired 61-year-old farmer said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Oct. 21, though, he can't tell his customers that. After
four decades of farming organically, he is now strictly forbidden to
say the O-word.</TE>
<TE>   Just as organically produced food moves into the mainstream with
federal oversight and a USDA seal of approval, Coleman and many other
pioneers of the organic farming movement in California are dropping
out, unable or unwilling to fill out the paperwork and pay the
necessary fees to get certified as "organic" under new U.S.
Department of Agriculture rules that take effect next week.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,100 organic farmers in California, about 700 have yet to
receive their organic certification, said UC Davis cooperative
extension specialist Karen Klonsky. That's a prerequisite if farmers
want to use the word on signs or packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these growers still will farm organically, but they will
do it on their terms, using labels and signs that say "pesticide
free" or "chemical free."</TE>
<TE>   Executives insist there's no exodus from the $7.8-billion organic
food industry. This is just normal turnover on the farming side of
this niche industry, they say, and organic acreage is continuing to
grow.</TE>
<TE>   But some farm advisors and consultants say it's a sign that
remaining organic under the new bureaucracy has become difficult for
many small farmers, who lack manpower or capital to document their
practices and pay required assessments.</TE>
<TE>   It has become a big farmers' game. The top 2% of all California
organic growers account for half the industry's revenue and dominate
sales to supermarkets and natural food meccas such as Whole Foods
stores.</TE>
<TE>   It is these large organic farm operations that are benefiting as
organic frozen dinners, cookies and bagged salads become bigger
sellers at mainstream supermarkets, some of which are now stocking
their own private-label organic goods.</TE>
<TE>   All this is making smaller growers feel left out of the organic
food revolution that they helped ignite, relegated to selling their
products at farmers markets or to the small number of home-delivery
services.</TE>
<TE>   The word "organic" "sort of got co-opted," said Steve Sprinkel, a
farmer who runs an organic restaurant and store near Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement has been adopted by big-ticket commerce," he said.
"There's very little community to it. The people who started the
organic farming movement have been left out in the cold."</TE>
<TE>   Although many longtime organic farmers aren't raking in the tens
of millions their large competitors are, industry analysts say it's
still possible for smaller organic farmers to make a good living.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who hits seven Southern California farmers markets a
week, makes $100,000 to $150,000 a year, depending on weather and
pests.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the Carpinteria farmer has given up organic
certification is the paperwork he and his son Romeo, who helps him
run Coleman Family Farms, would have to fill out each week for each
of the 190 herbs, fruits, flowers and vegetables wedged onto his 15
acres of hillside, and the fees they would have to fork over to
government-accredited certifiers and the state.</TE>
<TE>   He says most of his customers consider him organic, even if the
federal government doesn't. And the signs hanging over his Oaxacan
legumes, Moroccan mint and Russian Red kale say his produce is
"chemical free."</TE>
<TE>   "About 15 times a week we'll get someone asking us if we're
certified," Coleman said. "Only a couple of times will they shrug and
walk away."</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkel says he has resorted to using the phrase "clean and
local" and no one seems to mind.</TE>
<TE>   However, others say they are afraid they will lose some of their
customer base as people look for certification to prove a farmer is
following organic practices, which forbid synthetic pesticides,
chemical fertilizers and sewage sludge, as well as genetically
modified seed.</TE>
<TE>   Maryann Carpenter, who grows heirloom tomatoes, squash and greens
in Santa Paula for three farmers markets, says she had intended to
drop the word "organic" because of the costs and paperwork associated
with certification.</TE>
<TE>   She already has changed the sign for her farmers market booth to
"Coastal" from "Coastal Organics" and made up signs saying "chemical
free" and everything else under the sun to describe her product.</TE>
<TE>   But when she found out that one of her main farmers markets, the
Saturday Santa Monica market on 2nd Street, was going to set up a
separate section for certified growers, she was spooked.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have signs saying you are now entering the
organic zone, you are now leaving the organic zone," Carpenter said.
"I'll be a block away from my original spot ... on the fringe," she
added. "I just don't know if [my business] can withstand that."</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal farm bill, small farmers will be eligible to
receive up to $500 to cover the cost of getting certified, and they
can get funds to help promote their organic produce overseas.</TE>
<TE>   But the government can't help Carpenter with her time. With just
her and her husband farming 12 acres, and her husband holding down
another full-time job, the paperwork would be difficult to handle
without hiring someone else. And what she earns from her produce, she
says, doesn't justify that.</TE>
<TE>   Organic farming, once seen as the salvation for the small farm,
has become increasingly difficult to manage and only marginally more
profitable, growers say, as large players with greater economies of
scale have muscled in and driven down prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much harder now to start an organic farm than it was in the
past," said R. Ford Denison, an agriculture professor and director of
organic farming research at UC Davis. And he said the increased
involvement of large farms is "probably having a more negative effect
on the profitability of small organic farms than increasing demand is
having a positive effect."</TE>
<TE>   A recent AC Nielsen study of 61,500 households suggests that the
market for organic goods might not be growing as fast as many people
would like. Only 15% of current organic buyers in the survey said
they would buy more organic foods in the next six months. And only 3%
of non-buyers said they would buy organics in the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the road to organic certification has been so
bewildering and burdensome that they have decided to abandon the
organic movement, or at least slap another name on it.</TE>
<TE>   Contra Costa County growers Rick and Kristie Knoll farm using
organic practices, but after dropping their organic certification,
they sell their fruits and vegetables under their own label, called
Tairwa -- a play on the French word terroir that refers to the
influence of a particular area's soil on a plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we just tell people that we are ecological and sustainable
and we promote the health of the soil," Kristie Knoll said. "We
wanted to [pay to] promote ourselves rather than the organic method."</TE>
<TE>   However, she acknowledged that the decision to drop out of organic
farming after more than two decades has been difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I had abandoned my child," Knoll said. "I was made to
feel like Judas."</TE>
<TE>   But, she added, "we don't want to fight anymore. We just want to
farm."</TE>
<TE>   California has 180,000 acres farmed organically, representing
about 14% of the 1.3 million acres grown organically across the
nation but producing two-thirds of the organic fruit and vegetables
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this acreage is held by large grower-shippers, and it is
these farms that dominate the flow of organic produce into
supermarkets -- the fastest growing and potentially most lucrative
market for organic food.</TE>
<TE>   Some started as small producers back before the organic movement
really began to pick up steam.</TE>
<TE>   Myra Goodman, for instance, one of the owners of San Juan
Bautista-based Earthbound Farm, which ships organic bagged salads and
vegetables, has seen sales go from thousands of dollars in the
mid-1980s to about $175 million last year. Her goods have found their
way into 67% of all supermarkets, as well as discounters such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The evolution of large grower-shippers such as Earthbound, and the
centralization of retail produce buying, has made it hard for smaller
organic growers to secure contracts with individual stores, industry
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   To compete in this economic landscape, farmers will have to think
more creatively about what they do, such as growing new produce
varieties and tapping ethnic markets, said Bob Scowcroft, executive
director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation in Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman said that although her company is larger than most other
organic growing operations, that doesn't mean she's tearing apart the
movement.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me, 'Don't you feel bad about putting small organic
farmers out of business?' I say, 'We're not competing with small
farmers, we're competing with conventional farmers,' " she said.
"We're putting 14,000 acres into organic farms that are not polluting
the earth, and farm workers are not being forced to handle those
chemicals."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Goodman added, small organic growers can provide
something major produce shippers supplying supermarket chains can't:
a level of freshness one can only get by picking something when it's
ready to eat and selling it within a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Coleman prefers farmers markets, where he can peddle
his holey greens and cut out the middleman.</TE>
<TE>   "I raise a good product," he said, "and people know it."</TE>

<HD>Stephen E. Ambrose, 66; Author's Work Brought WWII Vets
Back to Americans' Homes, Hearts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen E. Ambrose, the populist historian whose best-selling books
made hometown heroes anew of America's aging World War II veterans
and provided modern insight into such leaders as Dwight D. Eisenhower
and Lewis and Clark, died Sunday. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Ambrose, a longtime smoker, died of lung cancer in a Bay St.
Louis, Miss., hospital near New Orleans. His family was with him.</LD>
<LD>   "Steve ... didn't write for intellectuals, he wrote for everyday
people," said Douglas Brinkley, one of Ambrose's students who
collaborated on several of Ambrose's books and succeeded him as
director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans.</LD>
<TE>   A history teacher for much of his life, Ambrose became a
best-selling author with his 1994 book, "D-Day June 6, 1944: The
Climactic Battle of World War II."</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote "Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st
Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest," the basis of a
successful cable television series co-directed by Stephen Spielberg
and Tom Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose was advisor on Spielberg's blockbuster World War II film
"Saving Private Ryan" starring Hanks and his documentary "Price for
Peace." Neither Spielberg nor Hanks could be reached for comment
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A prolific writer who became a cottage industry planning historic
tours, creating museums and memorials, and giving lectures, Ambrose
only quickened his pace when he was diagnosed with advanced lung
cancer in April.</TE>
<TE>   "After I got through the shock, the outrage, the
how-can-this-be-happening, I got to thinking: Screw it," he told The
Times in May. "In the time I've got left I'm going to write my love
song."</TE>
<TE>   As he rose at 4 a.m. to rush to his word processor through the
summer, he planned to title the book "A Love Song to America."
Bristling at the suggestion it might be his memoir, he described it
as part interpretive history, part recollection and part
grandfatherly musing. The final product, "To America: Personal
Reflections of an Historian," is scheduled for release Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   That will be Ambrose's 36th book.</TE>
<TE>   When charges of plagiarism--specifically that he failed to use
quotation marks and misplaced footnotes on scattered passages in his
many books--arose last winter, the gravel-voiced, martini-swilling,
swashbuckling historian simply ignored the headlines. He went off to
the Philippines to research World War II battles for a book he
planned but did not live to write on the Pacific theater of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "The people decide," he told The Times in April when he visited
Washington, D.C., to lobby for funds for a Lewis and Clark
commemoration as the 200th anniversary of their expedition
approaches. "If they decide I'm a fraud, I'm a fraud. I don't know
that I'm all that good at academics. I'm a writer."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose discounted the criticism as jealousy from academic
colleagues, not only because of his fame and fortune from his books
but from his choice of historic research.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had a hard time because I did military history," he said
in April. "They want you to teach about gays and lesbians in the
Colonial period."</TE>
<TE>   There are ironies to how Ambrose, self-described storyteller, came
to be a scholar and admirer of the military. He considered himself a
new left instructor on America's wrongs, including its historic
treatment of Native Americans, neglect of the environment and
motivation for the Mexican-American War. A ponytail-wearing liberal,
he marched in protest of the Vietnam War. And he quit a teaching job
at Kansas State University to protest a campus visit from Richard
Nixon during the bombings of Laos and Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the doctor's son from Whitewater, Wis., was a hero-worshiper
of the returning World War II soldiers from the time he was 10,
watching them attend the local teachers' college on the GI Bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the returning veterans were giants who had saved the
world form barbarism," Ambrose said recently. "I still do."</TE>
<TE>   He played football at the University of Wisconsin and likened the
game to military strategy. Once equipped with his doctorate in
history, he began studying details of the U.S. Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   World War II became Ambrose's focus in 1963 when its
General-cum-President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked him to edit his
papers and write his biography. How had a 27-year-old obscure history
teacher at the University of New Orleans attracted Ike's attention?
Eisenhower was impressed with Ambrose's 1962 book--only his second
one published--on Henry Halleck, Abraham Lincoln's all-but-forgotten
chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewing the great general for hours on end and poring over
bundles of wartime correspondence riveted Ambrose to the war of his
boyhood. Ambrose not only helped produce "The Papers of Dwight David
Eisenhower, Vols. 1-5" in 1967, but also wrote eight more books about
the Abilene, Kan., boy who grew up to be general, allied supreme
commander and president.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the work with Ike, however, Ambrose focused not on the
military brass but on the "citizen soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose collected thousands of oral histories from the men who
fought the war, and famously never talked about it when they came
home to rebuild normal lives. Ambrose, who also tramped the European
battlefields and routes they described, deposited the precious
material in the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the New
Orleans university where he taught until 1995.</TE>
<TE>   He not only got the taciturn heroes to share memories they had
tried to bury forever, but he instilled such confidence in the men he
interviewed that they gave him artifacts they had saved from the
World War II battlefields. In 1999, he opened the D-Day Museum in New
Orleans' Warehouse District to display the collected trove.</TE>
<TE>   "More than anybody else in America," Gordon H. 'Nick' Mueller,
president of the museum, told The Times a few months ago, "he
[Ambrose] opened these guys up to talking about their experiences.
He's unlocked thousands of stories that would have been lost
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose occasionally diverted his attention to other phases of
history, writing "Crazy Horse and Custer," "Undaunted Courage:
Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson and the Owning of the American
West," "Lewis &amp; Clark: Voyage of Discovery" and "Nothing Like It in
the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad
1863-1869." Those books sprang from Ambrose's love of the West and
summer vacations spent with his family and students retracing the
Lewis and Clark Trail and other avenues of expansion history.</TE>
<TE>   He even resolved his feelings about Nixon enough to write three
books about the distinct phases of the ousted president's life:
"Nixon: The Education of a Politician, 1913-1962," "Nixon: The
Triumph of a Politician, 1962-1972," and "Nixon: Ruin and Recovery,
1973-1990."</TE>
<TE>   But Ambrose always returned to World War II. Among his books on
the era were "Citizen Soldiers: The U.S. Army from the Normandy
Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany, June 7, 1944-May 7,
1945," "The Victors: Eisenhower and His Boys, the Men of World War
II," "Comrades: Brothers, Fathers, Heroes, Sons, Pals," and "The Wild
Blue: The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s over Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose lent his name and his expertise to his son Andy's travel
company, Stephen Ambrose Historical Tours, which led excursions to
Civil War battlefields, Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, and along
the Missouri River.</TE>
<TE>   Recognized everywhere he went, Ambrose easily befriended war
veterans, readers, celebrities and politicians and presidents of both
parties. President Clinton gave him the National Humanities Medal in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in April whom he considered his peers, Ambrose replied
easily "Doris and David." He referred to Doris Kearns Goodwin,
another popular historian who was involved in a plagiarism
controversy, and David McCullough, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his
biography "John Adams."</TE>
<TE>   They share Ambrose's ability to make history not only readable but
entertaining and exciting.</TE>
<TE>   "His great gift," Brinkley said of Ambrose, "was that he refused
to allow people to think history was boring. He was always grabbing
people by their lapels and saying, 'Listen to this. Isn't this
fascinating?' "</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Schlesinger, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, agreed,
telling the Associated Press that Ambrose "combined high standards of
scholarship with the capacity to make history come alive for a lay
audience."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose is survived by his wife, Moira, and five children, Andy,
Barry, Hugh, Grace and Stephenie.</TE>

<HD>Colony Holds Its First Art Walk as a Member of Lincoln
Heights</HD>
<DH>A dispute over which Neighborhood Council should claim the
Brewery is typical of the growing pains the groups are experiencing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The large Los Angeles artists colony that lives and works in an old
brewery opened its studio doors over the weekend for its biannual Art
Walk as a certified member of the Lincoln Heights neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to include the complex of more than 1,200 artists,
designers and architects within the boundaries of a community council
that represents Lincoln Heights came after an acrimonious dispute
that is emblematic of the conflicts many such councils are facing as
they sputter into action under the revamped City Charter.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood councils were created to increase community say
in city matters such as budgeting and services.</LD>
<TE>   The Art Walk, where more than 160 artists displayed their work,
was the Brewery's first since a group of residents fought to ally
themselves with a downtown council rather than the one that
represents nearby Lincoln Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Now, nearly six months later, residents are debating the vexing
question of what defines community, or neighborhood, in a city that
is inherently fragmented.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood councils "were not about geography first and
foremost," said Don Levy, a Brewery resident who fought to be
included in the downtown council's boundaries and allied with other
artists who live and work there. "They were about communities of
interest."</TE>
<TE>   The 23-acre industrial Brewery complex, tucked between the Los
Angeles River and the Golden State Freeway, has little in common with
the mostly residential and Latino working-class Lincoln Heights,
founded in 1863 as the city's first suburb, Levy said. In contrast,
artists living in commercial and industrial space across a wide
swatch in and near downtown could have bonded together to push for
more artist-owned live-work buildings and secure public and corporate
art commissions, Levy and others said.</TE>
<TE>   Countered Russell Rock, an artist who along with his architect
partner runs Urban Rock Design out of the Brewery: "It seemed very
logical that this area would be part of the Lincoln Heights council.
We live here, we shop here, we pay our bills in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Rock is running for a seat on the council in elections next month,
and is one of the Brewery residents who have become involved in the
surrounding neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood councils must represent a minimum of 20,000
residents. As a result, councils that are now forming are laying
claim to key enclaves, and small neighborhoods are vying for
affiliations they believe will grant them the most power, said Greg
Nelson, general manager of the city's Department of Neighborhood
Empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the boundaries of 51 councils have been certified by the
city-appointed Board of Neighborhood Commissioners, and 12 councils
have held elections. Envisioned as the answer to greater community
participation and unity, Mayor James K. Hahn has touted the councils
as an antidote to secession. But some of the councils have become so
frustrated with their perceived lack of impact that in recent months
they have endorsed San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, many of the councils appear to be stymied by
secessionist tendencies. Already, Cypress Park and Mount Washington
have pushed unsuccessfully to separate themselves from the Arroyo
Seco Neighborhood Council, Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Other councils have been plagued by election disputes. At the root
of much discord is the belief, which Nelson says is mistaken, that
councils with key landmarks or properties have a greater chance of
being heard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a part of this system," Nelson said. "Everyone gets a
chance to be dysfunctional or irrelevant, and the strong will
survive."</TE>
<TE>   The rocky formation of the councils has also underscored deep
divisions in polyglot city pockets and differing notions of
neighborhood identity.</TE>
<TE>   "The really big question is, what makes a community?" said Jeanine
Centuori, Rock's partner. "As an architect, I believe that
neighborhoods are based on proximity. Your next-door neighbors are
the people you see every day, and that's Lincoln Heights."</TE>
<TE>   The Brewery, an industrial complex of 21 buildings, stopped
churning out Pabst beer in 1976. In 1981, a family purchased it,
converting it to artists' live-work space. It has been called the
world's largest such colony based on its acreage. The first Art Walk
was held in 1982 and has flourished. Weekend attendance was estimated
at more than 12,000, and the city's museums are now represented at
the event.</TE>
<TE>   When the neighborhood councils began to form, several Brewery
residents joined the downtown council's formation committee, lobbying
aggressively to affiliate with other artists from the so-called
Artists District near Traction Street to the Santa Fe Arts Colony
farther south.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new kind of community," said conceptual artist Eugenia
Butler, among those who led the push for a downtown affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council's leaders felt
strongly that the Brewery fell squarely within its borders: "We just
want to keep our neighborhood whole," said interim president Oscar
Garcia. "We don't want it sliced up. What it created was a division."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, at a heated April meeting of the Board of Neighborhood
Commissioners, the lines were drawn. Not only did the Brewery go to
Lincoln Heights, the downtown Artists District was granted to the
Historic Cultural Neighborhood Council, which includes Chinatown and
Little Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's group now says it hopes to work more closely with the
Brewery artists, who could help revitalize Lincoln Heights. "Because
we're going through elections, we're mending fences," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But others, like Butler, said the artists' interests will always
lean west, not east.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many Brewery residents are ambivalent about whether the
neighborhood councils even matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are like an island here," pop artist Andre Miripolsky said
Sunday of the complex, which boasts its own restaurant and bar along
with art directors, steel workers, designers and fine artists. "I
don't know that it should be affiliated with anyone. It's not clear
to me what anyone gets out of that."</TE>

<CX>   Artists colony -- An article in Monday's California section about the
Brewery artists colony near downtown Los Angeles stated that the
colony "has little in common with the mostly residential and Latino
working-class Lincoln Heights." That statement was attributed to
Brewery resident Don Levy. Levy's point was that the artists complex
has little in common with the mostly residential bedroom community of
Lincoln Heights. The observations about the ethnic and class makeup
of Lincoln Heights were made by The Times.</CX>

<HD>Grass-Roots Group Takes Fight to Cable</HD>
<DH>A campaign in Ventura to defeat Measure A, a growth
initiative, is using community television to get its message to
voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a tiny editing room at the Ventura headquarters of CAPS-TV Channel
6, Will Thompson wages his low-budget battle of the airwaves.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in front of a shiny iMac computer, the 67-year-old retired
airline pilot attempts to thread together the footage he has spent
the last few weeks gathering, everything from town hall meetings to
one-on-one front-porch interviews.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the camera work is shaky. The sound is less than perfect.
Transitions between clips are often abrupt.</LD>
<TE>   But Thompson isn't worried about that.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the amateur 30-minute political advertisement he is
producing, which premiered last week on Ventura's community-access
channel, is the essence of his grass-roots movement to defeat Measure
A, the November ballot initiative that proposes 1,390 homes in the
canyons and on the lower hillsides overlooking Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "My program's going to look kind of rough and clumsy, but we think
it might work toward our benefit, because [Measure A proponents] are
going to inundate us with very good quality stuff," said Thompson, a
member of Ventura Citizens for Hillside Preservation. "We're looking
for any way at all that we can reach the public."</TE>
<TE>   Community television access, which costs Ventura residents just
$25 a year for full use of top-notch equipment and unlimited air
time, provided an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 6 reaches 27,000 city households seven days a week, and
has tripled its hours of programming in the last few months, said Suz
Montgomery-Hart, executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Although the service has been available for three years, it is
just starting to catch on, she said.</TE>
<TE>   And Thompson's project appears to be the first time the channel is
being used as a venue for political ads.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great," said Montgomery-Hart, who declined to say
where she stands on Measure A. The channel does not censor content,
nor does it check for accuracy of information.</TE>
<TE>   "I love politics," she said, "and I like seeing this kind of free
expression."</TE>
<TE>   In battling the measure, the citizens' group is going up against a
landowner partnership, Lloyd Properties, which has hired two
marketing companies to produce slick mailers and professional
television ads promoting its project.</TE>
<TE>   The landowner wants to build six neighborhoods, two of which would
include small retail centers, in exchange for donating 3,050 acres of
hillside land as public open space.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also calls for 25 miles of new trails and a 32-acre city
park.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are worried about the proposed project's environmental
effects--primarily the extra traffic it would cause--but have fewer
resources to get out their message, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Financial statements filed last week show that Lloyd Properties
has outspent its opponents by more than 100 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's classic David versus Goliath," said Ventura County
Supervisor Steve Bennett. "All we have is people's passion."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Measure A, however, say the opposition is trying to
gain sympathy by pointing out disparities in campaign spending.</TE>
<TE>   A message based on fear -- not on actual fact -- is a less
expensive one to get out, said Jim Anderson, project manager.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A opponents also have an influential county supervisor on
their side, Anderson said, as well as the nonprofit arm of Save Open
Space and Agricultural Resources, which fights general growth issues
throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   That group, for example, paid for a San Francisco law firm that
helped SOAR in its attempt to prevent Measure A from appearing on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole 'woe is me' thing is bluster," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Thompson maintains that without the community-access option,
his group could never hope to rival the landowners' television air
time.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to create a series of 30-minute segments, each focusing
on a different aspect of the initiative, including traffic, schools
and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson will act as moderator, introducing the show and providing
periodic comments throughout.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year Ventura resident admits he is not technically
inclined. He has an old Macintosh computer and a VCR at home, and
that's about it. But with the help of mentors offered by the
community-access channel, Thompson is now a reasonably adept
cameraman, editor and producer.</TE>
<TE>   When the Measure A debate is over, Thompson said he may start a
talk show focusing on local politics modeled after "The Charlie Rose
Show" on PBS.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had told me a long time ago that I'd be doing this," he
said, "I would not have believed you."</TE>

<HD>Padilla Seeks Monument Status for Spillway</HD>
<DH>L.A. council is expected to consider designation for the
89-year-old 'Cascades' this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighty-nine years after a torrent of water first flowed into the
area, eventually enabling Los Angeles to become the nation's
second-largest city, Councilman Alex Padilla believes it's time to
pay homage to the 900-foot-long spillway that made it possible.</LD>
<LD>   Named the "Cascades" by L.A. water czar William Mulholland, the
concrete spillway in Sylmar is the terminus of the Los Angeles
Aqueduct, which brings water from the Owens Valley. The abundance of
water made it possible for the city to build housing, prompting a
population boom.</LD>
<LD>   "As an [MIT-trained] engineer, I've marveled at the engineering
accomplishment the Cascades represents," Padilla said. "L.A. wouldn't
be what it is and the Valley wouldn't be what it is without the
Cascades."</LD>
<TE>   He had long considered the idea to make it a monument but didn't
act until redistricting this summer put the Cascades in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's proposal to add the Cascades to the city's list of
historical and cultural monuments was approved this month by the
council's Arts, Health and Humanity Committee and is expected to be
considered by the City Council this week.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposal is approved, Padilla, who is also council
president, wants to plan a dedication Nov. 5, the date in 1913 when
Mulholland gave the signal to let the water flow.</TE>
<TE>   November 5 also is when city voters will decide whether to allow
the San Fernando Valley to secede from the rest of Los Angeles. While
the designation of the Cascades as a monument wasn't planned as an
anti-secession ploy, Padilla admitted he was pleased when he
recognized the connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a coincidence that brought a big smile to my face," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But before anything happens, it must be determined that the
designation would not interfere with the Department of Water and
Power's operation of the Cascades, which can be seen off the Golden
State Freeway. Padilla said a historical monument designation cannot
hamper either daily operations or any upgrading that might be
necessary in the future.</TE>
<TE>   DWP spokeswoman Carol Tucker said the department is discussing the
issue with Padilla's staff. "It's a very critical facility to our
operation," Tucker said. "We're working closely with the councilman's
office to come to a resolution."</TE>
<TE>   David Gershwin, a spokesman for Padilla, said he doesn't think
talks with the DWP will delay a council vote this week.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cascades is designated a monument, perhaps no one will be
prouder than Catherine Mulholland, whose book about her grandfather,
"William Mulholland and the Rise of Los Angeles," was published in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was on a quiz show, I would have figured it had already been
designated because it is so much a part of the city's evolution," she
said. "I think it's most appropriate."</TE>

<HD>Charter Schools Embracing Standards to Improve Image</HD>
<DH>Independent campuses will seek accreditation from a new
partnership between an advocacy group and a major regional agency.</DH>

<LD>California's charter schools will launch a new accreditation program
this week, one of the most ambitious efforts in the nation to give
the experimental public schools an independent seal of approval and
counter scandals that have hurt their image.</LD>
<LD>   The Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, the state's dominant
accreditation organization, will join the California Network of
Educational Charters, which represents about 70% of the state's 436
charter schools, to administer the program.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership brings together one of the six major regional
accreditation agencies in the U.S. and a networking and advocacy
group.</LD>
<TE>   Therein lies both its promise and its potential limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The program, its designers say, will meld the traditional work of
the association, an independent 40-year-old organization that checks
the educational standards of most major universities and high
schools, with a new set of financial and governance standards
tailored to charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   But by involving itself in accreditation, the charter network
could invite charges -- faced by self-regulating industries ranging
from chemical manufacturers to accounting firms -- that it is biased
in the charter industry's favor.</TE>
<TE>   Charter school operators say the association's role makes their
effort particularly credible. And some charter school founders say
the accreditation program could fill a void left by state education
officials who, by their own admission, have been reluctant to
investigate cheating charters.</TE>
<TE>   Charters are public schools that receive tax dollars but that, to
encourage innovation, have been held exempt from some regulations. In
California, they serve more than 166,000 students. In a few notable
cases, however, the school districts that establish and oversee
charters have looked the other way as charter operators abused that
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   An early Los Angeles Unified School District charter used taxpayer
dollars to buy its director a sports car and to lease apartments. One
San Bernardino County-based group used its charter to start a network
of campuses with names like "Victory Baptist Day" and "Barstow
Christian," illegally teaching religion and charging parents tuition,
even as it billed taxpayers for educating their youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Some charter schools have received state money for students who
didn't exist. Perhaps most notoriously, Gateway, a charter granted by
the Fresno Unified School District in 1999, set up unregulated
satellite sites, rolled up $1.3 million in debt, failed to do
criminal background checks on employees, violated fire safety codes,
exaggerated attendance numbers and taught Islam, the Fresno school
board found. Gateway was shut down in January.</TE>
<TE>   In response to reports of abuse, Gov. Gray Davis last month signed
a bill full of new charter regulations that many school operators
consider burdensome.</TE>
<TE>   The new accreditation program's designers hope it will help the
public distinguish good charters from bad and head off further
legislation in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we do something, we're going to get death by a thousand
cuts through regulation," said Ting L. Sun, co-founder of the Natomas
Charter School near Sacramento, one of the first 12 schools to have
signed up for a pilot version of the new accreditation program. "We
want to say to people that we're a good school, and we're willing to
open ourselves up to examination and accreditation to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   In general, accreditation is useful because it ensures that
credits are transferable between schools, allows high schools to
demonstrate to colleges that their graduates can handle college work
and serves as a prerequisite for many grants, both public and
private, that schools seek.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership between the accreditation organization and the
charter network is expected to be formally announced this week.</TE>
<TE>   Written plans provided to The Times show that state charter
schools will be eligible to apply for the accreditation beginning in
March. By 2004, the network will accept only members that agree to
apply for accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The charter accreditation program will be billed as the nation's
first membership-based system, but the idea of accrediting charters
is not wholly new. Private groups in Colorado and Arizona have
accountability regimens, but without the scope of the California
program. Last year the Washington-based American Academy for Liberal
Education, an accreditation group for colleges, started a nationwide
pilot program, but its capacity is limited.</TE>
<TE>   "Accreditation is a valuable tool that can bestow an element of
public trust and respect on charters," said Michael Kayes, director
of the Phoenix-based National Charter School Clearinghouse, which
compiles data for charters.Planning for the new accreditation program
began in early 2001. This year, the network hired David Jelinek, a
Cal State Sacramento education professor, to lead a team developing
accreditation standards.</TE>
<TE>   At first, California charter schools will have to demonstrate
financial and academic stability to be certified as candidates. Then,
a school must prepare an extensive study of its own programs. That
self-study will form the basis of a four-day visit and evaluation by
an accreditation team consisting of at least four administrators from
schools, probably two charter and two non-charter, across the state.
The team will decide whether a school merits accreditation. The
entire process will take about two years.</TE>
<TE>   Charter school operators say they have supported the effort
because the state government has refused their entreaties to do more
checking on problem schools.</TE>
<TE>   Three times in the last two years, after news reports of unlawful
activity in particular charters, network officials wrote the
California Department of Education to ask for an investigation and to
offer their expertise and assistance in any probe. Instead of
investigating, the state passed on information to school districts
that granted the charters. In two of the three cases, network board
members say, the charter school agency never even got the courtesy of
a reply.</TE>
<TE>   In response, state education officials say they have neither the
staff nor the clear legal authority to investigate charters. They
also point out that the network has fought their efforts to demand
more financial disclosure, citing high costs.</TE>
<TE>   Charter school operators concede that accreditation will hardly
stem all criticism. Many leading education reformers have soured on
accreditation, saying the process merely sanctions mediocrity. The
new program, like others, gives failing schools "remedial assistance"
and the chance to reapply.</TE>
<TE>   Some charter supporters fear that oversight by an establishment
group like the association could rob charters of their
distinctiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "For a large and diverse group of schools like charters, some kind
of specialty, niche evaluation would probably be much more
appropriate," said Michael Poliakoff, president of the National
Council for Teacher Quality, which supports charters.</TE>
<TE>   Some California charter schools, independent of the network, have
sought and received accreditation by the association. One, the Cato
School of Reason, gained accreditation for its educational programs
through the association, but it was later shut down anyway by its
chartering school district for financial and attendance
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   California Charter Academy, the state's largest charter network
and a target of criticism by legislators and other charters, is now
applying solely for the traditional association accreditation. Its
chief executive, Steven Cox, said he sees no need for the new program
and the involvement of the network.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it odd that a trade association that is supposed to
advocate for its members would think that it would also get to be the
judge of its members," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Designers of the accreditation program say its new fiscal checks
will augment the association's oversight and catch future Catos.
Among the requirements are annual independent audits and a cash
reserve representing 4% of a school's annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be the police," said Rick Piercy, the director of a
charter school in Apple Valley and one of the new program's
designers. "I see us as citizens' patrol. Accreditation can bring
some extra eyes and ears that would [prevent] the government from
chasing after shadows."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Trips Become Election Issue</HD>
<DH>Rival says congressman did more harm than good with his
early visits to the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Dana Rohrabacher made himself an expert on a faraway country
that, until last year, drew little notice from his Orange County
constituents.</LD>
<LD>   The Huntington Beach Republican toured the dusty mountain camps of
Afghanistan in 1988, befriending rebel leaders fighting the Soviet
invaders. Bearded and wearing some of the regional garb, Rohrabacher
once encountered supporters of Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The congressman's activities in the country intensified after the
Soviets pulled out. He spent years trying to negotiate a peace to
Afghanistan's civil war, touring the region several more times.</LD>
<TE>   After the 9/11 terrorist attacks last year, Rohrabacher, who had
been dismissed by many as a far-right ideologue, suddenly was sought
out by the media and the Bush administration for his insights into
the central Asian nation.</TE>
<TE>   But as Rohrabacher seeks reelection, Democratic challenger Gerrie
Schipske is trying to haunt him with that record, saying he's done
more harm than good in Afghanistan. She points to comments he made in
1996 praising Taliban fundamentalists as a force for stability. His
diplomatic efforts have hurt U.S. interests in the region, she said,
and have come at the expense of dealing with issues closer to home.
"Not one person I've talked to thinks [what he's done] is a
statesman's act," Schipske said.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher, 55, angrily dismisses the criticism as the desperate
acts of a challenger running in a solidly Republican district. "I
think my constituents are very happy that someone gets in the face of
gangsters and tyrants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher has won every election in his district since 1988, by
a wide margin. He has consistently dwarfed his challengers in
fund-raising. This year, his district has been expanded to include
Palos Verdes Peninsula and a portion of Long Beach, beefing up the
margin of Republican voters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rohrabacher's work in Afghanistan has emerged as the major
issue in what would otherwise be a low-key campaign.</TE>
<TE>   It was a hot topic at the first of the candidates' debates this
month, and Schipske attacks the congressman in campaign literature
that shows him squatting among Afghan fighters with a rifle balanced
on his lap.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy comes when Rohrabacher's public profile has never
been higher. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on the U.S., the
congressman has become a fixture on television news programs, and he
has met several times with White House officials to discuss
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher's history with Afghanistan dates to 1981. As a young
speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, he was outraged by the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and identified with the ragtag band of
rebels fighting the superpower.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher saw it as a clear-cut struggle of good versus evil,
which appealed to his vision of the United States as a defender of
democracy. His worldview was developed during years as a grass-roots
GOP activist in California and member of Young Americans for Freedom,
an activist group of young Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting the underdog's cause, he studied Afghanistan's history
and politics, becoming a specialist while writing speeches. In 1988,
voters in coastal Orange County elected Rohrabacher to the House of
Representatives, and he itched to visit the freedom fighters he'd
lionized on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Just months before he was sworn in, he traveled to Afghanistan and
spent a week with a moujahedeen infantry unit fighting the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get out there on the front lines with them so they
would know I had the courage not just to talk the talk but to walk
the walk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He came back to Washington even more resolved to be their
advocate.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet pullout in the early 1990s was a short-lived victory as
Afghanistan slipped into a bloody civil war. Rohrabacher pushed for a
peace agreement under which former king Zaher Shah would return,
ushering in what he hoped would be an era of democracy. He met in
Europe with warring factions, including some leaders who would later
form the Taliban, the religious extremist group that ultimately took
control of the country.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he was quoted in the foreign policy publication
Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs, characterizing the
Taliban takeover as a "positive development." He predicted that the
Taliban would bring "stability in an area where chaos was creating a
real threat to the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   He also told the journal that the Taliban were "devout
traditionalists, not terrorists [and] they did not seem intent on
exporting their beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   His Democratic opponent has now jumped on that interview as
evidence that Rohrabacher was misguided in his approach to a regime
that would become infamous for human rights violations and harboring
the terrorist network that attacked the United States last year.</TE>
<TE>   Schipske also faults Rohrabacher for meeting in Qatar with Taliban
Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakel in April 2001. She charges
that the meeting was illegal under the Logan Act, a 200-year-old law
that makes it a felony for a U.S. citizen to interfere in relations
between the United States and foreign governments.</TE>
<TE>   "It is simply outrageous that this rogue congressman engaged in
negotiations with the Taliban," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her campaign Web site details what she calls his foreign policy
missteps, as well as his frequent overseas trips, asking: "Dana, when
was the last time you visited an elementary school in Huntington
Beach or Costa Mesa?"</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher replied that he was in Qatar to attend a conference
and only by chance met the Taliban's foreign minister, who was
staying at the same hotel in the capital city of Doha. Rohrabacher
said he went to the foreign minister's room and "unloaded on" the
Taliban for half an hour about its human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   He said he recommended that the king come back as a candidate or
to oversee elections. Foreign press accounts described it as
Rohrabacher's "personal peace plan." As for his comments in 1996
about the Taliban, Rohrabacher said they were based on his hope that
the fundamentalists would bring stability to the region. His
interview was "laying down a marker" for Taliban leadership, he said.
"We were giving them the benefit of the doubt. That lasted about two
months."</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, as the Taliban's human rights abuses and attacks on
religious institutions became more widely known, Rohrabacher was
calling Taliban leaders tyrants on the House floor. He urged Congress
to condemn the practice of "gender apartheid" on Afghan women and
girls.</TE>
<TE>   He was joined by such unlikely allies as the Feminist Majority
Foundation and Mavis Leno, "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno's wife, who
publicized the regime's brutalities against females. Some of those
who worked with Rohrabacher on behalf of Afghan causes are rallying
to his defense against the campaign claims.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that someone who has fought against terrorism in the
U.S. Congress is now having his record being used in a devious way,"
said Afghan activist Hasan Nouri, an engineer from Laguna Hills who
met Rohrabacher while the latter worked at the White House. Nouri
enlisted Rohrabacher's help for International Orphan Care, a charity
Nouri established in Afghanistan in the early 1990s. Rohrabacher has
now won praise from some foreign policy experts for his focus on
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Dana has been consistently right about Afghanistan," said Peter
Tomsen, the former U.S. special envoy and ambassador to Afghanistan
from 1989 to 1992. The problem, he said, is that until 9/11, "no one
was listening."</TE>
<TE>   But the newfound respect accorded Rohrabacher inside the Beltway
doesn't necessarily extend to his district.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his coastal constituents, regardless of party, say he's
out of touch. They see him as an absentee congressman who doesn't
know his neighbors or their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's characteristic of his general arrogance," said Republican
Rayna Zeidenberg of Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat George Giacoppe, a Huntington Beach resident, said
Rohrabacher's foreign freelancing is disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "If Jesse Jackson does something like this, I can pass it off as a
play for headlines," he said. "When [Rohrabacher does] it, I look at
the separation of powers so essential to our republic and I cringe."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher, however, says his activism is serving his district in
the most fundamental way.</TE>
<TE>   "People can attack me, but it's not going to work. [National
security] is the biggest problem of my district or any other
district. If we're not safe, nothing else is important."</TE>

<LD>   The shooting came three days after two men were shot dead in

<TE>   "That's not being dismissed," Nishimoto said. "At this point,
there's no connection."</TE>
<TE>   What investigators did know Sunday was that two men wearing black
knit caps drove up to a house on the 1100 block of Helsam Avenue
about 5 a.m. They walked up the driveway and at least one of them
began shooting indiscriminately at people in the frontyard.</TE>
<TE>   Two 19-year-old males, one of whom lives in the house while the

wasn't known, were shot. The Oxnard man and the woman had attended a
party at the house Saturday night, Nishimoto said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials refused to identify the victims, citing the ongoing

<TE>   The El Rio man was in critical condition at St. John's Regional

<TE>   At least one handgun was used, and bullets struck the house and
parked cars, Nishimoto said. The assailants were last seen driving
north on George Street.</TE>
<TE>   The shootings Thursday in neighboring Oxnard occurred less than a
mile apart, claiming the lives of 23-year-old Juan Ramirez Jr. and
25-year-old Steven Anthony Lemos.</TE>
<TE>   Police were investigating the killings as possible gang attacks.
Although neither man was a gang member, Ramirez may have had gang
ties in his hometown of Bakersfield, and Lemos could have been
mistaken for a gang associate, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   While there was no evidence linking the two cases, authorities
were trying to determine whether the killings were related to the
city's recent spate of gang violence.</TE>

<HD>'Dallas' Actor Killed in Hollywood Hills Fire</HD>
<DH>Dennis Patrick, featured in dozens of TV shows, is found
dead after flames sweep through his home.</DH>

<LD>A veteran actor who guest-starred in scores of television shows
dating to the mid-1950s died Sunday in a blaze that destroyed his
Hollywood Hills home.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Patrick, 84, died next to his pet poodle, Josh, as flames
enveloped his four-story home overlooking the San Fernando Valley,
fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick, who lived in the home for more than 30 years, had been
suffering from a kidney-related illness and rarely left the house in
recent years, neighbors said.</LD>
<TE>   The actor was perhaps best known for his role in the prime-time
soap opera "Dallas," in which he played Vaughn Leland for five years.</TE>
<TE>   He also guest-starred in dozens of TV shows, including "All in the
Family," "The Bionic Woman," "Dark Shadows," "Eight Is Enough," "The
Streets of San Francisco" and "The Untouchables."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick also was featured in the 1970 film "Joe."</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was under investigation.</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Leaders Strive to Prevent Post-Trial Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trial of the two police officers accused in the Donovan Jackson
beating case won't start for weeks or even months. But in Inglewood,
civic leaders are feverishly organizing for the day a verdict is
reached.</LD>
<LD>   Worried that an unpopular outcome could prompt violence in a
mostly minority city that has begun to lift itself out of a
years-long economic slump, members of the Inglewood Peace &amp; Fairness
Coalition are enlisting everyone from clergy to gang members in their
efforts to see calm prevail.</LD>
<LD>   "We work with each other--that's the essence of Inglewood," Mayor
Roosevelt Dorn said recently of the efforts to build a peacekeeping
coalition representing business, elected officials, law enforcement,
youths, churches, synagogues, community organizations and
neighborhood block clubs.</LD>
<TE>   And, Dorn said, he wants trouble-minded "outsiders" to stay at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be able to take care of ourselves, but we are worried about
outsiders coming in and carrying on," Dorn said. He and others in the
peace-keeping campaign declined to mention any names.</TE>
<TE>   The days of looting and burning that rocked Los Angeles after the
1992 trial of four Los Angeles police officers involved in the
videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney G. King are never far
from Inglewood leaders' minds these days. And they are acutely aware
that the national spotlight is trained on their city of nearly
113,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an opportunity to be a role model for other communities
if we can take this tragedy and show how a city can come together and
make sure, no matter what the scenario is, that we can express
legitimate concerns without violence, without anybody losing a home
or a business or a life," said Khalid Shah, executive director of
Stop the Violence Increase the Peace Foundation, which works with
youths and the families of victims of violence. As a leader in the
city's peace coalition, Shah oversees its day-to-day organizing and
planning.</TE>
<TE>   The peace coalition was formed days after the July 6 police
altercation with the teenager and his father, whom sheriff's deputies
questioned at an Inglewood gas station about expired license tags.</TE>
<TE>   Two Inglewood police officers--Jeremy J. Morse and Bijan
Darvish--arrived to back up the deputies. Exactly what happened next
is in dispute but, by the time it was over, Morse had thrown the
handcuffed teenager onto the car and hit him.</TE>
<TE>   Morse is charged with assault under the color of authority, and
Darvish is charged with filing a false police report. Both are
scheduled to return to court Oct. 31 for pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   The widely broadcast videotape caused outrage reminiscent of that
after the King beating. Morse is white and 16-year-old Jackson is
African American. In the weeks that followed, nationally known
activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Dick Gregory, came to
Los Angeles and joined calls for Morse's firing and prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the gas station incident, protesters swarmed into
Inglewood City Hall and occupied the mayor's office until Dorn, an
African American and an articulate, politically savvy former judge,
agreed within a few minutes to meet with them.</TE>
<TE>   Local activist Najee Ali, who organized the demonstration,
credited Dorn with keeping the peace that day.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Dorn understood the pulse beat of the city, and he
prevented a possible riot that day by addressing our concerns. We had
a mayor who was taking the case seriously, [so] we settled down and
left City Hall in a calm manner," Ali said.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Ali has been joining protesters at each of the
officers' court appearances and leading prayer vigils Thursday
evenings in front of the police station. Participants include whites,
blacks and members of other minorities, and Christians, Muslims,
Buddhists and Jews, he said."This is not a black/white issue."</TE>
<TE>   Shah said the occupation of City Hall had galvanized Inglewood
leaders to form the coalition and to set a fast pace for its
organizing activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are on the right track with all this preparation,"
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who
attended the coalition's initial meeting and who has sent a
representative to each session since.</TE>
<TE>   "They are right to bring in not only the business and political
leaders and homeowners, but also others who are going to have a
response to what happens and who, while they don't want to see the
city destroyed, might get all riled up" without some advance
guidance, Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been block-club meetings with homeowners in the city's
many middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods and efforts to
reach less well-off tenants in apartment complexes. There have been
meetings with youths, some of them "gang-involved," and plans for
special programs in the city's high schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Inglewood," Robbie Y. Broom, a 32-year resident and
longtime schools volunteer, said one day as she caught the afternoon
breeze in her frontyard. "The city has come a long way, and it's
getting better all the time. Nobody wants to see it hurt for any
reason," Broom said in explaining why she is working with the
peacekeeping effort.</TE>
<TE>   Business representatives are seeking ways to offer jobs to young
people, and have pledged money to help spread the peace coalition's
message. The clergy group plans to open the city's many churches the
day of the verdict and urge residents to gather there to hear the
verdict and seek guidance if they don't like the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   At a citywide meeting in August, organizers asked residents to
fill out bright yellow volunteer sheets pledging to help with
peacekeeping efforts. Shah has collected nearly 1,500 so far.</TE>
<TE>   The peace coalition worked a booth at the city's recent arts
festival downtown, enlisting volunteers and spreading its plea for
calm.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition's leaders meet weekly with various segments of the
Inglewood community for brainstorming sessions and updates on
progress. At one session, someone floated the idea of having youths
meet with small groups of police officers to help improve
communication and understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Shah loved the idea. "To the extent that we may have a systemic
problem and not just a couple of rogue officers, this is the type of
thing that can address it. It's proactive, and that's key," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group also supports calls for a civilian police review board.</TE>
<TE>   To symbolize the city's efforts for unity and peace, the coalition
is planning "Hands Across Inglewood," an ambitious effort to enlist
thousands of people to ring the city Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they will wear ribbons or join hands; there are plans to
honor the victims of violence by having their families hold their
photos.</TE>
<TE>   The event will be as much a warning to outside troublemakers, Shah
said, as a symbol of city unity.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome anybody with a sincere attempt to help," Shah said,
"but we have a concern about anyone with a message that will divide
the city and lead others to take advantage of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Ali, who invited Sharpton and other national figures to weigh in
on the Inglewood incident, said he applauds the coalition's efforts,
especially those aimed at young people.</TE>
<TE>   "My big fear is that, if something does happen, it won't be only
Inglewood; it will be South-Central L.A. or Watts or any other
community that has these concerns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A cousin of Jackson said she supports peace efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Rioting doesn't solve anything; it's always the poorest
communities that get hurt," said teacher Talibah Shakir. "We do not
want the beating of Donovan to be an excuse to go out and burn or
help yourself to a free shopping spree, but we do want to see
justice, and we want to see our leaders working with us for equality
across the board."</TE>

<HD>Hundreds of Legal Claims Against Deputies Never Probed</HD>
<DH>Civilian watchdog says L.A. County missed chances to cut
liability, uncover wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department never investigated more
than 800 claims of wrongdoing by its deputies over the last decade,
losing chances to uncover misconduct and limit liability, according
to the agency's new civilian watchdog.</LD>
<LD>   The department only this year began requiring a review of all
legal claims filed against deputies at the urging of the Office of
Independent Review, an agency staffed by former prosecutors and civil
rights attorneys.For 10 years, the office found, the Sheriff's
Department often simply declined to review the performances of
deputies who, in legal claims against the county, had been alleged to
have violated department policies and the law.</LD>
<LD>   The office's first report, obtained by The Times and scheduled for
release this week, provides a benchmark for a nationally watched
experiment in civilian oversight of law enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca proposed the office at the height of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Rampart scandal. The team of six civil
rights attorneys has watched over the Sheriff's Department's shoulder
for the last year as it has policed itself.</TE>
<TE>   The most wide-ranging fault found by the Office of Independent
Review was in the way the Sheriff's Department addressed legal
claims, typically those filed with the county as precursors to
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The claims allege all levels of misconduct, from improperly served
search warrants and reckless driving to illegal shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The department routinely investigates complaints filed by the
public, and cases involving extreme use of force. But hundreds of
claims that did not fall into those categories were never
investigated internally.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was one lodged by Patricia Gutierrez.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Gutierrez was arrested by two deputies on suspicion of
having made terrorist threats and attacking a neighbor with whom she
had a long-running feud, according to county records. Charges were
later dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez then filed a claim against the department in 1995,
alleging that deputies had improperly entered her home, arrested her,
subjected her to illegal searches and fondled her in the East Los
Angeles sheriff's station.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez attributed the harassment to a complaint that she had
filed against Deputy Dan Bartlett, who she said had been angered when
she brought her boyfriend to a party that Bartlett had invited her to
years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The incident with the neighbors, Gutierrez argued, had been
investigated by other deputies earlier. The county rejected the
claim, leading Gutierrez to file a lawsuit. In court papers, county
attorneys argued that the Sheriff's Department had operated properly.</TE>
<TE>   But a Los Angeles jury sided with Gutierrez and awarded her $2
million. The county dropped its appeal, and agreed to pay Gutierrez a
$1.1-million settlement in April.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the settlement underway, the Sheriff's Department
still had not investigated the conduct of the deputies.</TE>
<TE>   "Their answer was, it was just a runaway judge, it was a runaway
jury," said Michael Gennaco, the former federal civil rights
prosecutor who now heads the Office of Independent Review.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of the office, an investigation is now underway.</TE>
<TE>   Automatic Reviews</TE>
<TE>   Some legal claims were investigated by unit commanders, but the
office found that those reviews were often substandard. Now all
claims are automatically reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all caught off guard, believing that everything was being
done properly, and it wasn't," Baca said of the lack of investigation
into legal claims.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we not had the OIR, we probably would still be bumbling, in
some respects, with the policies that are in place."</TE>
<TE>   The duties of the office's attorneys include responding to the
scenes of shootings involving officers and monitoring internal
administrative probes of deputies.</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the office, which was created by the county Board
of Supervisors, stated that it had encountered no resistance from the
Sheriff's Department and had unfettered access to records.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on in Los Angeles is different than just about
anywhere because they put a unit of civil rights attorneys right in
the department," said Sue Quinn, president of the National Assn. of
Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Gennaco, head of the Office of Independent Review, said the
creation of his agency showed a "cultural change" in the Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "At least up to now, the sheriff has allowed us to shine a
flashlight into any corner we want and see what we discover," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the Office of Independent Review praises the
quality of internal investigations, but also notes a number of cases
in which it says scrutiny has fallen short.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the most controversial case, the Sheriff's Department
never conducted an internal investigation of the much-publicized
death of a mentally ill inmate at Twin Towers jail who was
asphyxiated while being restrained by deputies, according to the
report.</TE>
<TE>   The county paid a $600,000 settlement to the family of Kevin
Evans, but, because there was no administrative investigation, no
deputy was ever disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Independent Review concluded that the deputies might
have violated department policies--a conclusion that Baca rejected.</TE>
<TE>   At the suggestion of the watchdog agency, the Sheriff's Department
is now routinely investigating all cases in which prisoners are
restrained by force.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators Prodded</TE>
<TE>   The report also lists several cases in which the Office of
Independent Review prodded internal investigators into being more
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   In another case--this one an incident in which deputies beat and
pepper-sprayed a man who they said was fleeing after swallowing rock
cocaine--the office found that the medical treatment the deputies
later requested for the man had not been consistent, prompting a
renewed internal investigation, which is still underway.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Independent Review's report found that the Sheriff's
Department had failed to provide complete disclosure in criminal
cases, a failing that had cost taxpayers $295,000.</TE>
<TE>   The issue surfaced in a case in which Calvin Newburn was charged
with drug dealing. He contended that he had been framed, and that
deputies had lied about witnessing the transactions during
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Newburn's attorney requested access to all messages that passed
between the patrol cars of deputies involved in the incident, but the
department did not turn over all of them. The department routinely
interpreted such requests narrowly and provided only a fraction of
the messages, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   Newburn was convicted and served 27 months in prison before an
appellate court ruled that the records withheld by the department
cast doubt on the deputies' testimony. Newburn received a $295,000
settlement from county supervisors, who asked Gennaco to look at the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "This criminal defendant deserved that information, and he didn't
get it and he didn't get it because his criminal attorney didn't know
the magic words to get that information," Gennaco said. "And that is
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   At the Office of Independent Review's urging, the Sheriff's
Department changed its policy. It now releases full radio
transmission records.</TE>
<TE>   County Counsel Chided</TE>
<TE>   While Baca was praised for his openness, the watchdog agency's
report criticized the county counsel's office, which represents the
Sheriff's Department and deputies accused of wrongdoing in lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel has refused to give the Office of Independent
Review case files from lawsuits, saying that doing so might violate
deputies' attorney-client privileges.</TE>
<TE>   It has asked a USC law professor for an opinion on whether it is
allowed to share information with the civilian overseers.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said that he was concerned about the situation, but that,
overall, the internal monitors have "exceeded my expectations" and
that the monitoring is improving the quality of the department's
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Baca added that he knew when he proposed the office that it would
uncover problems that could embarrass his department.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually opening up a door to criticism," said the sheriff,
who meets weekly with Gennaco. "But to me, the truth of what we are,
good or bad, is more important than hiding what could be bad."</TE>

<HD>Convention Bureau Draws Its Repeat Visitor: Trouble</HD>

<LD>Los Angeles politicians are back on the defensive, and taxpayers'
advocates are steamed again over spending by the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   This time it's over the agency using city funds to secure a luxury
box suite at Staples Center for this year's Grammy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The expenditure, disclosed last week in papers filed with the city
Ethics Commission, was defended by bureau officials and Councilwoman
Jan Perry, one of the VIPs who watched the show from the Staples
Center box.</LD>
<TE>   The defenders said it was part of an attempt to keep the Grammys
in Los Angeles and attract other events to the city convention
center.</TE>
<TE>   "It promotes business for the city," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., was
unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obscene they are spending tax dollars for that when the city
is continually complaining that it doesn't have enough money for
basic city services," Coupal said.</TE>
<TE>   Already facing a city audit for lavish travel and entertainment
expenses, bureau officials said they were approached by the Staples
Center owners about helping to keep the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles
in the face of a bid by New York City to lure away the big event.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau dipped into its city contract funds, money that comes
from the hotel bed tax, and gave $75,000 to the L.A. Grammy Host
Committee, according to bureau VP Michael Collins.</TE>
<TE>   It just happened that each sponsor was given access to a luxury
suite at the Staples Center for the awards show in February.</TE>
<TE>   Collins and Perry were joined in the box by bureau President
George Kirkland and Board Chairman Alan Rothenberg. Also present were
bureau salespeople and convention planners for Oracle Corp. and
Siggraph "to give them one more reason to love L.A.," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   "For what it's worth, the sponsorship was done because we were
asked by Staples to support the host committee's work to make the
case for a multiyear deal with the Grammys, not because we got
tickets to an iconic moment," Collins said. "We would, as a practical
matter, get access to this event anyway." Grammy Awards officials
later announced that next year's show will be held in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Perry Gets Stuck With Bill</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the Grammys stiff L.A., but Councilwoman Perry got
stuck with the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Elected officials cannot accept such gifts over $100, so Perry
reported last week that after receiving a Grammy ticket, valued at
$389, she subsequently paid back most of the cost to Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   After the state Fair Political Practices Commission originally
said Grammy tickets did not have a market value and so where not
gifts, Mayor James K. Hahn accepted three tickets, worth $350 each,
directly from the Grammy Awards, to sit in regular seats at the show.</TE>
<TE>   The commission later found that the market value of tickets could
be determined, so Hahn wrote a personal check to pay back $950 -- the
difference between the value of the tickets and the $100 gift
threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn skipped television's Emmy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium
last month after the Ethics Commission warned the tickets exceeded
gift limits.</TE>
<TE>   Event Was Attended by People and Reporters</TE>
<TE>   While last week's debate between gubernatorial contenders Gray
Davis and Bill Simon Jr. had its heated moments, not all of the name
calling and belittling occurred in front of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference after the debate at the Los Angeles Times, a
reporter asked Davis about his handling of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Responded the governor: "Listen, this is just a huge game of
gotcha. Not one question was asked of me or any other candidate
running for governor in 1998 about electricity. Not one. Not by a
human being, much less a reporter."</TE>
<TE>   The room, packed with reporters, erupted in groans and guffaws.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to be disparaging," Davis said, drawing another wave
of laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley Noticeable by His Absence</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Daily Journal released its annual list of the 100
most influential attorneys in California, and the tally caused a stir
in the Civic Center over who was left off.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the usual suspects from the private sector, those
making the list included City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown, Gov. Gray Davis, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
and Hahn consigliere William Wardlaw, who also held serious sway
during the administration of former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   But although Wardlaw made the list, Riordan did not. Neither did
criminal defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Still more amazing to some Civic Center notables was the absence
of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   You would figure if the L.A. city attorney made the list, the top
prosecutor in the largest county in the state would be there, too.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has been in the spotlight recently after his investigators
raided the offices of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. as
part of a probe into possible spending irregularities. He also has
launched corruption probes in smaller cities in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Daily Journal Editor Katrina Dewey said Cooley fell just short of
getting enough votes from peers in the legal community to make the
list.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them are still on the fence on whether he is going to do
anything on important issues in the county, such as the Catholic
Church and Belmont," Dewey said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, she added, appears to have suffered from "dashed
expectations" after failing to win the Republican primary this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley did not take the omission personally, according to Joe
Scott, his chief spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "He laughed about it," Scott said. "I don't think it [the list]
has any significance at all. I'm very suspicious of these
self-serving annual surveys."</TE>
<TE>   Good News for Asteroids Watchers</TE>
<TE>   Paging Bruce Willis. U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher decided to honor
the late astronaut Charles "Pete" Conrad by creating a national award
in his name for amateur astronomers who discover asteroids whizzing
perilously close to Earth, a la "Armageddon."</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone believe that such a scenario is just fanciful science
fiction, Rohrabacher said, "I've got bad news for them." An asteroid
the size of an 18-story building passed closer to the Earth than the
moon in March, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill creating the Charles Pete Conrad Astronomy Award passed
easily on the House floor. Conrad, who in 1969 became the third man
to set foot on the moon, died in a motorcycle accident in 1999 and is
buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Christopher Cox: Orange County congressman and Santa's Helper.
The Republican from Newport Beach recently discovered that while U.S.
Customs law imposes no import tax on toys, it levies an 8% import tax
on all telescopes -- even low-power devices that are used as toys. So
he drafted legislation to reclassify the low-power telescopes that
kids use as toys, so that they will be free from the special tax. "I
was shocked to find out that Uncle Sam -- who, like Santa, doesn't
tax toys -- was slapping customs duties on toy telescopes," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   * How realistic is the television drama "West Wing?" So realistic
that the National Education Assn. issued a statement after one recent
episode, saying: "We agree with President Bartlet that we must come
together as a country and 'do better' on behalf of America's children
and America's public schools. The president can be sure that the
members of the NEA will do our share to make public schools great for
every child." Bartlet is played by actor Martin Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   * W.C. Fields joked about the joys of acting with kids and
animals, but Irvine City Council candidate Chuck DeVore decided to
make the best of it after repeated flubs while filming a 30-second
cable TV commercial with his wife, Diane; daughters Jennie, 11, and
Amy, 6; and their Belgian Malinois, Moxie. His "Outtakes" began
running last week showing Moxie repeatedly howling -- and not --
completely off cue. "I figured I'd show my funny side," DeVore said.</TE>
<TE>   * He may not be running for governor -- this year -- but actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger is busy enough on the political circuit. He is
all over television touting Proposition 49, his measure to promote
after-school programs. Last week, he was the guest of honor at a
Bruce McPherson for lieutenant governor fund-raiser in Santa Ana.
That same day he appeared at a pro-Proposition 49 rally at Staples
Center. And on Tuesday, he'll headline the fifth annual dinner for
the Los Angeles County Lincoln Clubs.</TE>
<TE>   * Was Hillary Clinton right after all? A familiar-sounding group
recently sent out fliers to get protesters to attend a Los Angeles
event featuring Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. The
group sending out the invitations, according to the flier: "The Vast
Right Wing Conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Telling people that politicians raise money is like telling
people that dogs drink out of toilet bowls. I'm sure they're shocked,
shocked."</TE>
<TE>   --Garry South, Gov. Gray Davis' chief campaign strategist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION: San Fernando Valley mayoral candidate
Bruce Boyer says he has gotten a lot of compliments from motorists
for his sign at one Valley intersection that protests the city's use
of automatic cameras, such as the one to the right of the sign, to
catch red-light runners.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Tar L.A.'s Efforts to Fill Up Potholes</HD>
<DH>They see road ruts as a symbol of neglect, while city
points to a rapid fix record.</DH>
<SE>Second in a series of stories analyzing Los Angeles city
services.</SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Tong was stunned the other morning when he walked out of his
North Hollywood house and found two city workers in yellow hard hats
neatly setting up orange cones around the little pothole that had
been bugging him for months.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh my God, is this even possible?" he said as he stood in his
frontyard.</LD>
<LD>   Tong hadn't called the city to complain, he said, but each time it
rained the dirt-bottomed depression filled up with mud, and every day
when his tires dipped into it, his car made an unhappy ca-thunk
ca-thunk sound.</LD>
<TE>   Now here was a crew, complete with a truck filled with hot
asphalt. The workers jackhammered the old pavement, swept a coating
of adhesive around the inside of the hole, filled it with steaming
asphalt, then raked it and flattened it with a little yellow machine
resembling a lawnmower. About 40 minutes later, they were stacking up
the cones, sweeping up the debris and climbing back into the truck to
head for the next hole.</TE>
<TE>   Potholes are a constant in the lives of many Los Angeles
residents, and a constant theme in the secession campaign. For
secessionists, potholes have become both an issue in themselves and a
metaphor for City Hall neglect--each unfixed pothole seen as evidence
of a city too big to care about little things, to focus on the real
troubles of neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The road crews are working harder than ever now, and with better
funding, according to Los Angeles officials. But their efforts only
seem to annoy secessionists more. Secessionists attribute any new
maintenance zeal to politically motivated City Hall officials
determined to make pre-election improvements in neighborhoods that
have long been ignored. And they say no amount of window-dressing can
change the fact that the city is too big to function efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   "Potholes are a symbol of the poor delivery of so many city
services," said Keith Richman, a Republican assemblyman from
Northridge who is running for Valley mayor. "A pothole is not only a
visual reminder, but a palpable reminder of the lack of city
services. Every time you run over a pothole, it jars you and reminds
you of that lack of city services."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they are tackling the pothole problem. If a
citizen calls in a pothole complaint, the city aims to get a crew out
to fix it by the next business day. The only exceptions occur if what
looks like a pothole turns out to be a different problem, such as a
hole left by a utility crew (which is responsible for fixing it), or
if the city is in the middle of a severe rainstorm and has a huge
spike in calls.</TE>
<TE>   A recent test, a call about a series of potholes on a Chatsworth
street, showed that the system works: The large holes, which
stretched over several blocks, had been filled in by the next
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Such service doesn't soothe secessionists, who say they began
noticing the city's street-repairing zeal only after secession
measures in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood seemed destined to
make the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Pothole Plot</TE>
<TE>   To those long frustrated by Los Angeles city services, every
patched pothole or repaved bit of city roadway is evidence of a city
plot to seduce voters away from the secession measure with a short
spurt of calculated service improvements. Many secessionists are
convinced that such activity will come to a shrieking halt Nov. 6 if
secession loses at the polls, and that the would-be independent areas
will suffer worse than ever from neglect after that.</TE>
<TE>   The city fills more than 200,000 potholes a year, said Bill
Robertson, interim director of the city's Bureau of Street Services.
But the place is too big for officials to know the location of each
hole. A lot of the chronic complainers don't actually call the city
with their complaints, while those who do get prompt service, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson argues that while potholes may rankle residents, Los
Angeles' record at fixing them actually compares favorably to that of
other big cities.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the stated goal is to respond to 65% of all pothole
complaints within 30 days. Right now, New York has only about 1,000
pothole complaints outstanding, according to the city's Department of
Transportation spokesman Keith Kalb, who added proudly, "We're doing
really good." Los Angeles has no such backlog, fixing more than 99%
of all potholes within a day after they're called in.</TE>
<TE>   But even Robertson admits that filling potholes is sometimes like
bailing out a sinking boat with a teaspoon. The city's streets are
old and tired, and there is never enough money to repair enough of
them to put the system in overall good condition.</TE>
<TE>   "We all realize that there's not enough money out there to fix the
need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After an audit last fall, City Controller Laura Chick said the
street bureau had "no long-term plan for how to fix the city's
streets." She also said that, contrary to the beliefs of
secessionists, the city had no systematic pattern of favoring some
areas of the city over others when it came to repaving. In fact, she
said, the bureau split the money for repaving among the 15 City
Council districts rather than focusing on the most dire needs
citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has the largest municipal street system in the
country. Just before World War II, the city had 2,500 road miles.
Then came the boom, when the city grew exponentially, especially with
the construction of subdivisions in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For years before this growth, and for years after it, Robertson
said, the city resurfaced only about 50 miles a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We got behind the eight ball," said Robertson, adding that the
number of miles resurfaced annually didn't hit 100 until the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the city plans to resurface 260 miles, but Los Angeles
has 6,500 miles of roads. It has a $63-million budget for
resurfacing, its highest ever, Robertson said. But that's not because
of the looming threat of secession, he said. In fact, the budget has
been increasing gradually since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Robertson is the first to admit that it would take well
over twice the annual budget--about $150 million--and the repaving of
350 miles each year for a decade to get Los Angeles roads up to
speed. And he admits, too, that such a large budget--over such a
sustained period--is highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "Streets aren't sexy. They aren't like beautiful bridges. But
they're essential. And people need to let it be known that they want
fixing them to be a priority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller Is Better</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say Angelenos do complain about the streets, all the
time. But in a city so big, they say, it's hard to be heard, even on
a problem as simple as potholes. Getting things fixed is far more
difficult than it should be, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nowhere to hide when you have a small city," said Gene La
Pietra, who wants to be mayor of a proposed city of Hollywood, which
would stretch over 15 square miles instead of Los Angeles' more than
460 square miles. "We'd have a small city council. We'd have city
council meetings at night. And if you complained about a pothole and
it wasn't filled, you'd be complaining to a council member who lived
right in your neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, the Valley mayoral candidate, said an independent Valley
city would provide better service than Los Angeles because it would
get rid of "a big city's bloated bureaucracy."</TE>
<TE>   "None of this is rocket science. I'm confident that we're going to
be able to run a more efficient city. Whether it's picking up
discarded couches or filling potholes, it's putting in place systems
that respond to the needs of the people," he said. "Currently, Los
Angeles does not do that."</TE>
<TE>   Confronted with such claims, Robertson has statistics to show just
how responsive the city is. In September, he said, the city received
636 pothole complaints. Some of those were not in fact potholes, he
said. But of the 447 legitimate complaints, 442 were repaired within
a day.</TE>
<TE>   "That's 99.2%. Normally, we're about 100%, except when someone
parks a car over one of the holes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether separate Valley or Hollywood cities would be able to
do a better job of fixing potholes, let alone tackle the more serious
ills of the aging street systems they would inherit, Robertson
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   He said the city has a big staff, and sends at least one pothole
truck out daily to each of 24 maintenance districts. In addition, Los
Angeles has a fancy "pothole killer" truck, which lets the driver
repair a hole without ever leaving the truck, and is about to rent
three more under a pilot program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just my viewpoint," he said of potential independent
cities, "but I think they would find all of this very, very, very
difficult."</TE>

<HD>Far Ahead, Republican Isn't Letting Up</HD>
<DH>GOP incumbent Tony Strickland outpaces Bruce Thomas, but
Democrats might pump in funds to get critical Assembly seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Strickland's Assembly seat is safer than ever for a Republican
because of redistricting.</LD>
<LD>   His campaign treasury so dwarfs that of his Democratic opponent,
Moorpark financial advisor Bruce Thomas, that Strickland has given
thousands of dollars to friends in tougher battles.</LD>
<LD>   But Strickland, the Assembly's second-ranking Republican, said he
is still running hard for a third and final term in the Legislature's
lower house.</LD>
<TE>   After two close races against Somis teacher Roz McGrath,
Strickland said he's not leaving anything to chance as he faces
Thomas, a little-known Democrat, in the competition for the 37th
District seat. The district includes much of Ventura County as well
as Chatsworth and northwest Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "I always campaign hard," said Strickland, a Moorpark resident,
who at 32 is the youngest member of the Assembly. "No one said I had
a chance to win the first race because I was too young. But I proved
them wrong. And I'm going to win this one, too."</TE>
<TE>   First he must get by Thomas, 54, a plain-spoken former Marine
Corps officer.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas thinks Strickland is vulnerable because many voters view
him as too conservative. Thomas says Strickland is so busy climbing
the ladder in Republican Party politics that he pays little attention
to issues in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Personal history also distinguishes them, the Democrat said.
Strickland has never held a job outside of public service, joining
the staff of a Republican legislator right out of college, Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Thomas served in the military, started two companies
and raised a family before running for office, he said. He's hoping
that voters will like his broad experience, giving him an edge
despite a Republican 11-point advantage in voter registration.</TE>
<TE>   But a GOP strategist disagreed, saying Thomas' best chance of
beating the incumbent is if Democrats pump big money into his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   So far, that has not happened, said Allan Hoffenblum, editor and
publisher of "California Target Book," which tracks finances and
handicaps election races.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats are hoping to gain a veto-proof majority in the
Assembly and will have to knock off at least one incumbent to achieve
that, Hoffenblum said. They may turn to Thomas because Gov. Gray
Davis polled better four years ago in the district's new boundaries
than his opponent, Republican Dan Lundgren, Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has a strong Republican bias but it doesn't vote
overwhelmingly Republican," the analyst said. "It could be on their
short list of possibilities [of] where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Strickland first ran for office when he was 27. With his party out
of power, he has had few legislative victories during his two terms.
He names a bill that created a special license plate to honor former
President Reagan as one high point.</TE>
<TE>   He's made his greatest mark, Strickland said, by consistently
pushing the Democrat-controlled Legislature to rein in spending and
cut taxes.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is not afraid of a fight. He sued for, and eventually
won, the release of government energy contracts last year after Davis
refused to make them public.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed Davis was locked into higher prices than what was
available on the spot market. Now he is renegotiating those
contracts. I'm proud of that," Strickland said. "A lot of my
colleagues wouldn't have been willing to do that. But I thought it
was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Strickland was viewed as a rising star in line for
the job of the Assembly's minority party leader. He was passed over,
but now holds the No. 2 position of Republican Caucus chair.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's Hoffenblum said Sacramento views Strickland as
ambitious, a politician who will continue to rise if he can find
another elective office. Even if he wins in November, term limits
will oust Strickland from the Assembly in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Although Strickland opposes abortion in most cases and has voted
against gun control laws, he tends to focus most on economic issues,
Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   In his off hours, he's served as an unofficial advisor to
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon, campaign staff say.
Strickland said he freely offers strategy -- and contributions -- to
like-minded Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed Thomas' contention that such work distracts from
attention to issues important to his constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud of my political involvement. We should not shy away
from helping people of quality get elected to public service,"
Strickland said.</TE>
<TE>   During his two decades in the Marines, Thomas oversaw the creation
of a software system that controls planes and weapons. He retired as
a major in 1992 and helped found CRI, a defense communications
company in Van Nuys. After a few years, he became a retirement
advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Running for political office has been difficult for Thomas,
because he is basically a shy guy used to organizing things from the
sidelines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He decided to run because "this is a critical time for
California," he said. He describes himself as a social moderate,
favoring abortion rights and gun control legislation. Education and
health care are other priorities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among his proposals are a call for a six-month moratorium on
legislation next year so lawmakers can buckle down and solve the
state's budget crunch.</TE>
<TE>   His shoestring campaign is being run out of the Westlake office
where he is still working full time. He fits in precinct walks and
campaign appearances after hours.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Democratic Party has not promised any money, leaders
have told him dollars could flow in the final weeks if he manages to
bring his poll numbers to within striking range of Strickland, Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   So far he's raised $17,000, two-thirds of it a loan from himself.
That compares with $277,000 that flowed into Strickland's treasury
from a broad range of individuals, corporations and real estate
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said he's not intimidated by the lopsided numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to prove you don't need a million dollars to run a
campaign," he said.</TE>

<HD>Far Ahead in Race, Republican Isn't Letting Up</HD>
<DH>Strickland continues tough fight, though Thomas lags in
polls and fund-raising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Strickland's Assembly seat is safer than ever for a Republican
because of redistricting.</LD>
<LD>   His campaign treasury so dwarfs that of his Democratic opponent,
Moorpark financial advisor Bruce Thomas, that Strickland has given
thousands of dollars to friends in tougher battles.</LD>
<LD>   But Strickland, the Assembly's second-ranking Republican, said he
is still running hard for a third and final term in the Legislature's
lower house.</LD>
<TE>   After two close races against Somis teacher Roz McGrath,
Strickland said he's not leaving anything to chance as he faces
Thomas, a little-known Democrat, in the competition for the 37th
District seat.</TE>
<TE>   The district includes much of Ventura County as well as Chatsworth
and northwest Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "I always campaign hard," said Strickland, a Moorpark resident,
who at 32 is the youngest member of the Assembly. "No one said I had
a chance to win the first race because I was too young. But I proved
them wrong. And I'm going to win this one, too."</TE>
<TE>   First he must get by Thomas, 54, a plain-spoken former Marine
Corps officer.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas thinks Strickland is vulnerable because many voters view
him as too conservative. Thomas says Strickland is so busy climbing
the ladder in Republican Party politics that he pays little attention
to issues in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Personal history also distinguishes them, the Democrat said.
Strickland has never held a job outside of public service, joining
the staff of a Republican legislator right out of college, Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Thomas served in the military, started two companies
and raised a family before running for office, he said. He's hoping
that voters will like his broad experience, giving him an edge
despite a Republican 11-point advantage in voter registration.</TE>
<TE>   But a GOP strategist disagreed, saying Thomas' best chance of
beating the incumbent is if Democrats pump big money into his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   So far, that has not happened, said Allan Hoffenblum, editor and
publisher of "California Target Book," which tracks finances and
handicaps election races.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats are hoping to gain a veto-proof majority in the
Assembly and will have to knock off at least one incumbent to achieve
that, Hoffenblum said. They may turn to Thomas because Gov. Gray
Davis polled better four years ago in the district's new boundaries
than his opponent, Republican Dan Lundgren, Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has a strong Republican bias but it doesn't vote
overwhelmingly Republican," the analyst said. "It could be on their
short list of possibilities [of] where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Strickland first ran for office when he was 27. With his party out
of power, he has had few legislative victories during his two terms.
He names a bill that created a special license plate to honor former
President Reagan as one high point.</TE>
<TE>   He's made his greatest mark, Strickland said, by consistently
pushing the Democrat-controlled Legislature to rein in spending and
cut taxes.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is not afraid of a fight. He sued for, and eventually
won, the release of government energy contracts last year after Davis
refused to make them public.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed Davis was locked into higher prices than what was
available on the spot market. Now he is renegotiating those
contracts. I'm proud of that," Strickland said. "A lot of my
colleagues wouldn't have been willing to do that. But I thought it
was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Strickland was viewed as a rising star in line for
the job of the Assembly's minority party leader. He was passed over,
but now holds the No. 2 position of Republican Caucus chair.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's Hoffenblum said Sacramento views Strickland as
ambitious, a politician who will continue to rise if he can find
another elective office. Even if he wins in November, term limits
will oust Strickland from the Assembly in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Although Strickland opposes abortion in most cases and has voted
against gun control laws, he tends to focus most on economic issues,
Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a likable guy. He's active and works with people. And he's
forged good relationships," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his off hours, he's served as an unofficial advisor to
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon, campaign staff say.
Strickland said he freely offers strategy -- and contributions -- to
like-minded Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed Thomas' contention that such work distracts from
attention to issues important to his constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud of my political involvement. We should not shy away
from helping people of quality get elected to public service,"

of a software system that controls planes and weapons. He retired as
a major in 1992 and helped found CRI, a defense communications
company in Van Nuys. After a few years, he became a retirement
advisor.</TE>

health care are other priorities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among his proposals are a call for a six-month moratorium on
legislation next year so lawmakers can buckle down and solve the
state's budget crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas also said he would call on legislators to immediately cut
their salary and benefits by 10%, starting with himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how you can ask Californians to sacrifice if the
elected leaders aren't doing it too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His shoestring campaign is being run out of the Westlake office
where he is still working full time. He fits in precinct walks and
campaign appearances after hours.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Democratic Party has not promised any money, leaders

<HD>Empty Feeling Is Going, Going Gone</HD>
<DH>Longtime Angels fan felt a twinge of old fears during a
Twins rally, but then his team slugged its way to the pennant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Owens knows that empty feeling all too well. That feeling in the
pit of his stomach that comes when hope is waning, when something
really bad is about to happen.</LD>
<LD>   Owens, a 57-year-old Lake Forest resident, has been a
season-ticket holder for 26 years with the Anaheim Angels, a team
renowned for fading when it really matters.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday afternoon, there was a moment -- early in the seventh
inning, to be precise -- when that feeling returned. The Minnesota
Twins scored three runs and took a 5-3 lead.</LD>
<TE>   Then the Angels' Adam Kennedy hit his third home run of the night,
sparking a 10-run inning that cemented the Angels' first trip to the
World Series in the team's 42-year history. Instead of fading as in
playoffs past, the team rallied. It was an apt end to a game that has
taught longtime Angels fans to see their team in a new light.</TE>
<TE>   "That empty feeling? It's gone," Owens said, gloating in the
stands as the team celebrated with spewing champagne. "The ghosts are
gone. Everything about this day, this series, this season, has been
great."</TE>
<TE>   Owens stood next to his son at Edison International Field, after
the game was long over and the crowd had begun to dissipate. They
both wore giddy grins. They refused to budge.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, a computer consultant for Unisys, grew up a Philadelphia
Phillies fan. When he moved to California in 1971, he couldn't bring
himself to switch his allegiance to the Dodgers -- which, like the
Phillies, are a National League team.</TE>
<TE>   Among other reasons, he chose the Angels because of a personal
connection: He had once played in the same men's basketball team as
former Angels pitcher Dave LaRoche. "He was a ringer," Owens said.
"He was good. The rest of us were average."</TE>
<TE>   And there was an early excitement about the team and its famous
owner. "It was perfect. We loved Gene Autry. The players at the time
were exciting."</TE>
<TE>   But for 26 years the team tested his resolve. Strikes made him
rethink whether he should renew his season tickets. Losing teams made
him wonder why he was at the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his only worry is figuring out who gets to go with him to the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   At least one seat is earmarked for his 30-year-old son David, an
Air Force pilot who now lives in South Carolina. In March, when he
had to put in for leave, he asked for the first two weeks in October,
thinking that maybe, just maybe, this would be the Angels' year.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, I always hope," David Owens said. "This year, it was
too good to be true. I would have kicked myself watching it on
television if I didn't work my way out here somehow."</TE>
<TE>   They scoff, a tiny bit, at the idea that this is a Cinderella
story. This team, they said, is just good. Plain and simple.</TE>
<TE>   But then there was Kennedy and his three home runs. There was that
crazy 10-run seventh inning. There's the sea of red. The sky still
hazy from fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   And then, it's hard not to believe in magic. Dave Owens conceded:
"It's almost like this year it was meant to be."</TE>

<HD>Garfield Todd, 93; Missionary Became Top Rhodesian Official</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>Sir Garfield Todd, a former prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, as
Zimbabwe was once known, died Sunday after a stroke. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Todd died in a hospital in the western city of Bulawayo, said his
daughter Judith, a leading Zimbabwean human rights activist.</LD>
<LD>   Prime minister from 1953 to 1958, Todd backed his country's
independence from Britain for two decades before it was finally
granted in 1980. He later became a bitter critic of President Robert
Mugabe, and earlier this year was stripped of his passport and vote
under draconian new citizenship laws.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Invercargill, New Zealand, Todd went to Southern Rhodesia
in 1934 as a missionary for the Church of Christ and helped run a
school about 250 miles southwest of the capital Harare.</TE>
<TE>   The school produced many of the country's black political leaders,
who studied and later taught there.</TE>
<TE>   Todd entered parliament for the governing white supremacist United
Party in 1946. His rugged good looks, fluent oratory and lucid memory
smoothed his path to the premiership in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   In power, Todd deployed white troops to crush striking black
mineworkers and faced mounting unrest over unpopular land reforms.</TE>
<TE>   But he also felt that at least some blacks deserved the right to
vote and enter politics and believed that compromise would secure the
whites' future.</TE>
<TE>   "These were reasonable things, but the whites only saw it as
losing their privilege, and they were right. But it was an artificial
privilege," Todd told Associated Press in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Todd claimed that he was ousted by white reactionaries bent on
blocking black advancement, but colleagues said that his autocratic
unpredictability triggered his replacement by Edgar Whitehead.</TE>
<TE>   Out of office, Todd joined African nationalist leaders in 1960 in
a call for British troops to remove Whitehead by force.</TE>
<TE>   His critics accused him of doing little to advance democracy while
in power and of trying to reinvent himself as a liberal and build a
black constituency to restore his waning political influence.</TE>
<TE>   When Whitehead was replaced by Ian Smith, who declared unilateral
independence from Britain in 1965, Todd was restricted to his ranch.</TE>
<TE>   He was twice detained during the 1972-80 independence war.</TE>
<TE>   Nominated a senator after Zimbabwe's 1980 independence, Todd at
first strongly supported Mugabe's policies, but later accused him of
allowing rampant corruption to destroy the hopes of a rising black
generation.</TE>
<TE>   Todd was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1989, with
Mugabe's approval, at the behest of the New Zealand government.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, Zimbabwean officials denied Todd a vote in
presidential elections because he had been born in New Zealand,
claiming he had forfeited his Zimbabwean citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Todd's wife, Grace, died last year. In addition to his daughter
Judith, he is survived by two other daughters and two grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Home In on Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey L. Rabin and Sue Fox</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flush with cash and confidence, anti-secession forces led by Mayor
James K. Hahn are targeting San Fernando Valley voters in an all-out
campaign to crush the secession movement on its home turf.</LD>
<LD>   With three weeks remaining until the Nov. 5 election, Hahn's L.A.
United campaign and a host of other groups are rolling out messages
aimed at distinct groups of voters. The messages vary, but their
purpose is the same: to convince voters that secession is too risky,
especially in the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to defeat it in the Valley," said Larry Levine, leader
of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles. "If it wins in the
Valley, then I think we'll see it coming back again and again and
again.... For the health of the city, we need to end this with an
exclamation point and not a question mark."</LD>
<TE>   The anti-secessionists are pressing their case through television
and radio ads, in the mail and on the phone, at shopping centers and
community forums.</TE>
<TE>   Their commercials, mailers and fliers are being tailored to
resonate with homeowners and renters, senior citizens and union
members, Latinos, and gay and lesbian voters. In the view of
secession opponents, each of those groups has reason to be wary of
breaking up the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strategic; it may be even surgical," said Los Angeles City
Council President Alex Padilla, who is leading a bilingual effort to
persuade the Valley's Latino residents to reject secession.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents are even more confident of defeating the
Hollywood cityhood measure, also on the Nov. 5 ballot. From the
start, public polls as well as some private surveys have shown the
Hollywood proposal losing badly -- both within Hollywood and in the
city overall. Polls also have generally pointed to citywide
opposition to the Valley breaking away. But in those same surveys,
secession has fared better among Valley voters.</TE>
<TE>   For each secession measure to pass, it must attract a majority of
votes in the breakaway region and in Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Key Battleground</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders, such as former Assemblyman Richard Katz,
acknowledge that the Valley has become the battleground in the
campaign's final weeks and say that Hahn and special interests at
City Hall are trying to break the back of the cityhood movement. But
Katz said it won't work.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Valley is going to be fooled. What the downtown
power brokers don't understand is that the Valley is used to getting
beaten on by City Hall," Katz said. "What you're seeing today is that
the Valley is not going to take it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, however, have reason to hope that the notion
might be defeated, even in what was once thought to be its
stronghold. In recent months, a back-room effort to negotiate a deal
to replace the Valley cityhood measure with a borough plan backfired.
A high-powered field of candidates for mayor and city council seats
never developed. Campaign consultants quit last month for lack of
payment. And secession supporters failed to raise the millions of
dollars needed to wage a campaign on the airwaves, leaving
anti-secession TV ads unchallenged, except by pro-cityhood spots on
local cable stations.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been laughable three months ago to think Jimmy Hahn
could defeat secession in the Valley," said Bruce Cain, director of
the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. "It's not
laughable now."</TE>
<TE>   UC San Diego political scientist Steven P. Erie agreed. "The stars
are not aligned for secession," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both professors say voter turnout will be key to the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of who gets more demoralized as this election
season goes on," Cain said. "Right now, I'm betting it's the
Republicans, because [GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill] Simon has
just sort of immolated himself. That could dampen Republican turnout,
which would help Jimmy Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   Turnout traditionally is stronger in the Valley than in the rest
of the city. In last year's mayoral election, Valley residents, who
account for 38.5% of the city's 1.46 million registered voters, cast
42% of the ballots.</TE>
<TE>   If cityhood passes in the Valley but fails citywide, some
observers predict that secessionists will try to change the state law
requiring a citywide vote. Valley secession leader Richard Close has
threatened to file a lawsuit over such an outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The election also includes races for offices that would exist only
if cityhood passes. If it fails, that will leave 14 would-be city
council members and a mayor who were elected to serve in a stillborn
city -- a turn of events that secession opponents worry would form a
sort of Valley shadow government that could bedevil City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's campaign has raised nearly $5 million to fight secession.
After being elected with the support of Valley voters, Hahn is
determined not to preside over the dismemberment of the city -- and
is hoping to avoid a split decision.</TE>
<TE>   His L.A. United advertising plays on fears about public safety,
raising doubts about whether a new city could provide adequate police
and fire protection, paramedic services and emergency response to
disasters. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents
LAPD officers, is already airing radio ads saying that public safety
could be jeopardized in a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Safety Coalition, an alliance of four City Council
members and lobbyists and special interests who court them, plans to
deliver the same message to Valley voters through the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents are hoping the message of uncertainty will
alarm people in particularly fragile circumstances--such as renters
and senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We are literally going to go after everybody, but we are going
after certain people in a much more targeted way," said Hahn campaign
strategist Kam Kuwata. "The majority of voters in the Valley don't
know that their taxes could go up, that their water bill could go up,
that their senior center could be eliminated, that their after-school
program could be cut."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the anti-secession mail and phone calls will be directed
at Valley voters. Renters will be warned there is no guarantee that a
new Valley city would keep rent control in place. Senior citizens
will be told that meal programs and senior centers could be cut back.</TE>
<TE>   Gay and lesbian voters will be reminded that domestic partnership
benefits for city employees could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   City employee unions, worried about their jobs and benefits, have
launched a massive outreach campaign to persuade union households
that secession is not in their best interests.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists counter that the mayor's campaign distorts the
ground rules under which a Valley city would operate. "There's no
factual basis to the fears that they're raising," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, a new city would retain rent control and all other
Los Angeles ordinances for 120 days. After that, the Valley
government would decide which laws to keep. A new city must also
honor union contracts, although it can negotiate new agreements as
contracts expire.</TE>
<TE>   As for senior centers and other programs, Valley leaders would set
service levels. A projected Valley surplus would mean better services
across the board, secessionists say.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's campaign has been aided by the money and muscle of the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. On Saturday, about 100
electricians, bus drivers, firefighters and other union workers hit
the Valley streets to ring doorbells at union households.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of firefighters based in the harbor area headed straight to
the heart of secession country: the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As they trooped from one Reseda tract house to the next, they
handed out colorful fliers detailing their union's opposition to
secession. "We trust our firefighters with our lives -- shouldn't we
trust them about secession?" the flier read.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Capt. Brian Hishinuma of San Pedro was even more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "You got kids?" he asked one man who answered the doorbell. "Well,
the closest pediatric center to you is in Childrens Hospital. If you
were to secede, you'll have only one [Fire Department] helicopter
here in the Valley. That means if there's a brush fire here, and one
of your kids needs an air ambulance, there's no way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," replied Andre Consalvi, a 26-year-old loan officer. "You
got our vote then."</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the labor
federation, said the 104,000 union members in the Valley can expect
seven pieces of mail, as well as phone calls, urging them to vote
against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras is one of those determined to beat secession once and
for all. "If it passes in the Valley, it will give the same
proponents of secession another soapbox," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With one-tenth of the money raised by their opponents, Valley
cityhood advocates cannot compete with the barrage of messages
against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a mighty ground campaign have diminished, with only a
few hundred volunteers ready to walk precincts rather than the 3,000
secessionists predicted. Instead, cityhood backers are putting their
faith in the voters to resist the onslaught of anti-secession
appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "With a huge war chest that the special interests have given the
mayor, they're going to try very hard to step on the Valley," Katz
said. "We will try to show that disinformation for what it is. People
react negatively to the fear-mongering."</TE>

<HD>Around Beltway, Jittery Residents Try to Go About Their
Lives</HD>
<DH>Although the sniper picks victims at random, he prefers
unobscured targets. 'This man has me very scared,' one woman,
standing alone outdoors, says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md</DL>
<LD>ROCKVILLE, Md. -- In a morning's fading minutes of darkness, fear's
measure is taken in a head's swivel, a sudden glance, an awkward
crouch, the staccato of advancing footsteps. For suburban
Washington's earliest risers, the first wave of commuters heading out
alone, these are the dangerous hours.</LD>
<LD>   They are human marks, and they know it. The unseen killer who has
confounded police for 11 days by selecting his prey at random is
given to one telling characteristic: He aims at unobscured targets.
Like deer idle in a clearing, 10 victims stood alone and stationary
the moment before they fell.</LD>
<LD>   As dim horizon diffuses over the suburbs, the solitary emerge in
the gathering pale sunlight. They sit at bus benches and huddle at
curbsides. They skitter toward convenience stores and fidget in gas
station pump bays. Some try to stay in motion. But soon enough,
entropy takes hold. They stand. They wait.</LD>
<TE>   At 6 a.m., Chris Swepson, 39, is pumping gas at an Exxon station
in Bethesda, Md., south of the circular freeway that winds around the
nation's capital. He is alone at the pump, exposed under a glaring
fluorescent panel.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the killer's human prey have died standing between their
cars and an open pump. Swepson did not want to stop. But his
Chevrolet Cavalier does not travel on prudence. He sets the pump
handle on automatic, allowing the gas to course freely into the fuel
tank. The slow click of the pump nags at him until he grabs the
handle and clamps it down as tight as it can go.</TE>
<TE>   "I was down to a quarter-tank," he says, staring at the advancing
numbers on the pump gauge. They seem endless. "Come on, come on."</TE>
<TE>   He is a carpenter; a big man with a forked beard. A cigarette
smolders in one hand; he ignores a warning about smoking posted near
the gasoline pumps. It is the other peril that worries him.</TE>
<TE>   Driving out from his home in Riverdale, Md., he wondered whether
he was being watched from the highway's edge. Traffic was thin on the
Beltway, but as he drove, Swepson found himself gazing toward the dim
tree line at the roadside. He tried to imagine what a high-powered
rifle barrel looked like in the darkness, wondered whether it might
glint in the passing headlights.</TE>
<TE>   "He could be out there in the bushes and I wouldn't know it until
it's too late," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Swepson has been working on the upper floors of a
14-story office building under construction in the center of
Bethesda, a thriving commercial center on the Metro subway line. When
the killing started, Swepson felt secure at work. But as the tension
rose, he found himself brooding, even up on the 14th floor while he
and a crew of carpenters installed rows of wooden columns.</TE>
<TE>   "See, we work right on the edge," Swepson said. "First, you say,
'No way he's going to find me up there.' But this guy's a marksman.
You figure if I can see the whole city ... then someone down there
can see me too."</TE>
<TE>   When the pump finishes, Swepson racks up the handle and walks
briskly to the cashier's glass-enclosed station. Only a single
lightbulb glows faintly at the back of the store. The cashier works
in near darkness.</TE>
<TE>   "Business is bad," he says with a shrug. "If it's not so bright in
here, maybe people won't be so scared to come in."</TE>
<TE>   Several blocks away, the day's first subway commuters are bustling
toward the long escalators that carry them down to the Metro. Some
scurry. It is too early for them to be late. It is the fear. They
will be safe down in the tunnels. But when they emerge on the other
end, the fear builds again. At Friendship Heights, a subway stop
within the Washington city limits, commuters leaving the station have
been seen ducking down and dashing away in a crouched position, as if
in an imaginary line of fire.</TE>
<TE>   Rain pelts down as the sun rises, maintaining the morning's gloom.
In Rockville, to the north, Yvonne Ibon waits under a strip mall
awning, holding a mangled umbrella. A cafeteria worker, she is
waiting for her regular ride from a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe away from the road, don't you think?" Ibon asks. "This
man has me very scared."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she is a perfect silhouette, highlighted as she stands in
front of a garish red neon sign: "WHILE-U-WAIT EYEGLASS REPAIR."
Traffic flashes along Rockville Pike, a highway ribbon of shopping
malls and industrial parks; one of the first victims died while
mowing grass near this road. White vans and white trucks, the
killer's reported vehicles of choice, pass by, too numerous to count.</TE>
<TE>   "My goodness," she says, noticing the neon. Ibon sidles away just
as her friend's car glides into view in the parking lot. "I think
maybe she picks me up at home tomorrow," Ibon says. There is no trace
of humor in her nervous laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Several blocks away, Margaret Gelin, 70, is pecking at the buttons
of an automated teller. Shrouded from the rain in a bright yellow
rain slicker, she works at the machine, facing away from the traffic
until she can fish out her cash.</TE>
<TE>   "At my age you get fatalistic," she says. "I worry more about my
grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   But she too travels with a submerged pang of fear. Gelin does much
of her shopping in the morning, the sniper's favorite stalking
period. Six of the killer's 10 victims have been gunned down between
dawn and 10 a.m. Three of them were fatally wounded in the sniper's
first brazen rampage 11 days ago along Connecticut Avenue, a parallel
artery less than five miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to be too exposed," Gelin says, "I try to be where
there are other people nearby. He hasn't shot into a crowd yet. Has
he?"</TE>
<TE>   Swamy Shiva is nearly as exposed as Gelin, sitting perfectly still
inside a glass bus shelter on Rockville Pike. At least he is a dry
target. Though not bulletproof, the glass shields him from the rear
and sides as he waits for the No. 46 bus to take him to the National
Institutes of Health, where he works as a molecular biologist.</TE>
<TE>   Behind him is a lush field bordered by a wall of pines and maples,
a perfect place to lurk. But with the glass at his back, Shiva only
scans the road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to admit, every time I see a white truck or a white van, I
watch it until it's past me," he says. "It's not even something you
think about until they're past you. But in those seconds, your mind
is racing. Is the window down? Is there a gun inside? It's a habit
with me already. With all of us, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Shiva, 35, clings to his routine, promptly reaching the bus stop
by 8:30 a.m. every day. "The best way to proceed," he assures
himself. "I have a lot of faith." Still, he can detect the anxiety in
his wife's wide eyes as he gathers up his book bag and heads for the
door.</TE>
<TE>   "She tells me I should keep looking around, watch out for this
guy," Shiva says. "But you can't spend your entire life outside
waiting for the bullet to come." A green bus approaches, an
impressionist blur in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, I think I see it," Shiva says. He surrenders a tiny sigh, his
only genuflection to the fear. Then he dashes out into the rain and
to safety.</TE>

<LD>Ira Einhorn's lawyer says it's up to the former hippie guru to
convince a Philadelphia jury that he should go free instead of to
jail for the 1977 slaying of his girlfriend. "The circumstantial
evidence in this case is extremely damaging," attorney William Cannon
said.</LD>
<LD>   Einhorn, 62, intends to take the stand today and testify that the
CIA killed his girlfriend, Helen "Holly" Maddux, and framed him
because of his research into "psychic warfare."</LD>

<HD>Gore Raises Money for Maryland Candidate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHEVY CHASE, Md.</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore began a five-state campaign swing
Sunday, raising $100,000 for Maryland congressional candidate
Christopher Van Hollen Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Van Hollen is trying to unseat Republican Rep. Constance A.
Morella in one of the nation's most-watched races as Democrats try to
seize control of the House.</LD>
<LD>   "When you are in a struggle this close, it really matters who is
speaker of the House, who organizes the committees, whether or not
Tom DeLay is setting the agenda of the Congress," Gore said,
referring to the House majority whip from Texas, a Republican.</LD>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Gore, who was the Democrats' nominee for
president in 2000, has criticized President Bush's policies on Iraq,
the economy and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said Sunday he would not have voted for the resolution
Congress approved last week authorizing Bush to use force in Iraq,
but added that he respects Congress' decision.</TE>
<TE>   Gore spent most of September on the road campaigning for
Democrats. He also raises money for them through his political action
committee, Leadership '02.</TE>
<TE>   He planned to take part in rallies and fund-raisers in Iowa today
and Tuesday, making stops in Dubuque, Mount Vernon, Iowa City, Des
Moines, Ames and Mason City for candidates in four of the state's
five House races.</TE>
<TE>   He then heads to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Gore is expected to announce after next month's elections whether
he will seek the presidency in 2004. He is among several White House
hopefuls who have campaigned for Democrats in Iowa this year.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 people attended Sunday's fund-raiser at a private
residence in Chevy Chase, contributing at least $1,000 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Morella, who has represented the largely Democratic suburban
Washington district since 1987, has said this year's redrawing of
district boundaries to include more traditionally Democratic voters
makes her one of the most vulnerable incumbents. Bush raised $500,000
for Morella's campaign in June.</TE>
<TE>   A survey released this month by the Sun newspaper in Baltimore and
the Gazette in suburban Washington found Van Hollen leading Morella
43% to 40%, with 17% of voters undecided. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Shootings Put New Emphasis on Bullet IDs</HD>
<DH>Sniper attacks renew call for a database that would track
unique fingerprint from weapons. Gun makers and NRA have blocked such
plans, backers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The sparse evidence available to investigators in the Washington-area
sniper shootings has thrown new attention on proposals to create a
national system for linking bullets recovered at crime scenes to
specific firearms.</LD>
<LD>   Technology to create such a system is in limited use. Several
lawmakers have argued that the system should be expanded so that
every weapon -- before it leaves the manufacturer -- is tested for
the unique fingerprint it leaves on bullets and casings.</LD>
<LD>   Bullets and casings found at crime scenes could then be linked to
the gun that fired them, advocates say, and then possibly to an
owner. But gun makers and the National Rifle Assn. have blocked the
plan, they say.</LD>
<TE>   "The gun lobby has made it clear to the majority in the House that
there will be no new federal gun laws," said Rep. Robert E. Andrews
(D-N.J.), the sponsor of one proposal to create a national ballistic
fingerprinting system.</TE>
<TE>   Another hurdle, he said, is that his measure can best advance if
attached to a larger crime bill, "and there's been no such bill
moving in the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any question that this is technically
feasible," said Dennis Henigan, legal director of the Brady Center to
Prevent Gun Violence.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, investigators used similar technology to compare
bullets recovered in the Washington-area shootings, and to conclude
that they came from the same gun.</TE>
<TE>   When a gun is fired, it transfers microscopic dents and scratches
to the bullet and casing. Those markings are as unique to the firearm
as fingerprints are to people, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms says.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, comparing these markings was time-consuming and hard
on the eyes. Now, images of bullets and casings can be digitized,
placed in a database and automatically compared with images of other
ballistic evidence.</TE>
<TE>   This allows investigators to determine whether bullets found at
different crime scenes came from the same weapon. Investigators can
also fire a test shot from a weapon found at a crime scene and
compare the bullet to those in the database.</TE>
<TE>   Tests Showed Promise</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the FBI and ATF joined forces to create a system for
recording ballistic evidence found at crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "We piloted the technology when I was at ATF, and the testing
showed that this equipment had a high degree of success," said Joe
Vince, a former chief of the firearm agency's crime guns analysis
branch.</TE>
<TE>   He said the system, called the National Integrated Ballistic
Information Network, could make 8,200 comparisons between bullets in
less than two seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Vince, Andrews and others are calling for a more comprehensive
system that would include information from every gun before it
reaches consumers. Maryland and New York recently started such a
system for all new handguns, Vince said.</TE>
<TE>   In a national system, each weapon's serial number would be paired
with a digital form of its unique bullet and casing marks.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said that if such a system had been in place for several
years, there is a chance it would contain data for the gun used in
the Washington-area sniper assaults. Police could match the
.223-caliber bullets they have recovered to the sniper's gun, he
said, and could then try to track the chain of ownership of that
rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is that when the police apprehend this shooter or
shooters, their best clue will have come from the vehicle they used,
but not the gun," Andrews said. "Think about that: What a relatively
ineffective way to investigate this crime."</TE>
<TE>   He said a ballistic database "would convert the investigation from
finding a needle in a haystack into a very focused event."</TE>
<TE>   A call to the NRA requesting comment was not returned. The group
traditionally opposes any measure it considers a move toward creating
a registry of gun owners.</TE>
<TE>   William A. Tobin, a former FBI metallurgist, said a system to
track every new firearm would be unworkably complex.</TE>
<TE>   One hurdle, he said, is that gun barrels and mechanisms change
over time, which in turn changes the marks on bullets and casings.</TE>
<TE>   "I am truly skeptical that in our lifetime there could be a
database that would uniquely fingerprint each weapon," he said. A
more feasible system, he suggested, would include markings
intentionally introduced in the manufacturing process.</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center,
a Washington group working to reduce gun violence, said a national
database would have other shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   The system would not include any of the tens of millions of guns
already on the streets, she said. And because a gun is typically used
in crime only three years after manufacture, the system would not
show results for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, she said, the proposal has never gained traction in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a useful thing, but it has to be kept in
perspective," Rand said. "It would be a time-intensive, expensive
proposition. It would be a very good investigative tool. But by
definition it's not preventive. You're tracking the bullet after
someone's already been killed."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews acknowledged that gun fingerprints may change over time,
and that the system would not include firearms already in
circulation. "I'm not assuring anyone that this is a perfect method,"
he said. But he added that, with the sniper shootings, "sadly, we are
seeing an example of why it is needed."</TE>
<TE>   Gun control advocates said two proposals similar to Andrews' plan
had been introduced in Congress in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews imagined a system where gun makers recorded the
fingerprint for each gun and passed on the cost to buyers.</TE>
<TE>   But Vince said gun makers could merely test-fire the weapon, as
many do already, and include the fired round in the packaging for the
weapon. When a dealer later sold the gun, he said, the bullet could
then be sent to police for inclusion in the database.</TE>

<HD>Mobster's 5 Condos in Boston on the Block</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The government held open houses Sunday at five properties confiscated
from a convicted mobster that are going on the auction block.</LD>
<LD>   The condominiums were seized last year after Stephen "The
Rifleman" Flemmi began serving a 10-year sentence for extortion and
money laundering. He still faces charges for his alleged role in 12
killings.</LD>
<LD>   The government's auction is scheduled for Friday. Properties
seized from Flemmi, which he rented out but did not inhabit, are
worth about $2 million, according to the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<TE>   Real estate agent Kevin Breland toured an apartment in Boston's
posh Back Bay neighborhood, eyeing the walls and ceiling, gauging
what he might tear down if he snaps up the prime real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But his renovations, he said, would have an unusual purpose -- to
convince himself there aren't any hidden bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "The day he walks out of jail, I am out of here. I'll sell it,"
Breland said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to wake up one day with a horse's head in my bed,"
he added, referring to a famous scene in "The Godfather."</TE>
<TE>   Flemmi, the notorious henchman of fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger,
has pleaded not guilty to charges of involvement in 10 murders in
Massachusetts. He also faces capital murder charges in Florida and
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Flemmi and Bulger were FBI informants who helped run South
Boston's Winter Hill gang from the 1970s through the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Their FBI handlers were accused of looking the other way while the
two had free rein over Boston's crime underworld. A former FBI agent
was sentenced last month to more than 10 years in prison for
protecting Bulger and Flemmi.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the visitors at Sunday's open houses, however, were just
looking for a good deal, not knowing or giving much thought to the
properties' history.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't freak me out," said Nicole Procida, a lawyer. "Just as
long as no one was murdered here, I'm fine."</TE>

<HD>Sniper Probe Spotlights Chief's Style</HD>
<DH>As the face of authority in a national drama, Charles A.
Moose of Montgomery County, Md., has shown a range of emotions in his
dealings with the media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>He has become a household name, a daily presence on national
television, the earnest, sometimes testy voice of the hunt for a
killer.</LD>
<LD>   In the effort to solve the sniper slayings that have sent waves of
fear around the nation's capital, Charles A. Moose is the top cop --
chief of police in Montgomery County, Md., the quintessential
suburban area where peace was shattered almost two weeks ago with a
spree of five lethal shootings in less than 16 hours.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of pressure on him," said Montgomery County
Executive Douglas M. Duncan. "There's a lot of people pulling on
him.... He is showing emotion when the situation requires it. He is
showing reassurance when the situation requires it. I'm proud of what
he's doing."</LD>
<TE>   In his polite, nonmacho style, the 49-year-old Moose is the voice
of law enforcement in an unfolding national drama. Day after day, he
faces the cameras, almost mechanically avoiding questions about the
course of the investigation for fear that such details might help the
killer. Over and over, he asks the public to call in tips on hotlines
that already have generated thousands of calls.</TE>
<TE>   And he urges the media to show restraint in their reporting of a
chilling crime story that now overshadows most other domestic news:
"I know that is very tough for everyone," Moose told reporters who
flocked to police headquarters Sunday morning for a briefing. "But
that is our request."</TE>
<TE>   Moose, who dresses in a tidy police uniform rather than the suit
and tie favored by some chiefs, is not anybody's stereotype.</TE>
<TE>   He holds a doctorate in urban studies and, while serving in the
police department, taught college courses in Portland, Ore. -- the
city where he began his law enforcement career, rising to become
chief before being hired by Montgomery County in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, when the sniper shot a 13-year-old boy who was walking
into a middle school, Moose could not hide his emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "Shooting a kid -- it's getting really, really personal now," the
chief said, a tear streaming down his cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, his wife, Sandy, told the Raleigh, N.C., News &amp;
Observer that the moment had revealed her husband's more private,
sensitive side, not often seen in public: "That's the real Charles.
That's the guy behind all the toughness."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the week, when word leaked to local media that the sniper
had left a Tarot card and a taunting note near the school, the
tougher side of the chief -- who has acknowledged some problems with
his temper in the past -- exploded into public view. "I have not
received any message that the citizens of Montgomery County want
Channel 9 or the Washington Post or any other media outlet to solve
this case," he said, livid. "If they do, then let me know.... To
date, the people in my community have asked the police department to
work the case. So I beg of the media: Let us do our job."</TE>
<TE>   While he was at it, Moose tossed some barbs at former law
enforcement officers and others outside of Washington who were going
on television with various theories about the sniper investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got retired police chiefs out there looking for other jobs,
taking advantage of this situation to get their face on television,"
he complained. "How sad. How insulting."</TE>
<TE>   Moose is just one official in a growing web of local and federal
law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, including the
FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Secret Service
and police from the District of Columbia and the neighboring counties
in Maryland and Virginia where the sniper also has struck. But in a
sense, Montgomery County remains ground zero, the scene of five
killings on the evening of Oct. 2 and morning of Oct. 3 that
introduced a frightening new killer to the world -- one who shot 10
people in 10 days, leaving eight dead and two wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Often, such huge police mobilizations with multiple agencies are
marred by tensions and rivalries. But publicly at least, officials
award Moose high grades for handling the organizational headaches
that go with the current dragnet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to speak with one voice," said Gary M. Bald,
special agent in charge of the FBI regional office in Baltimore. "He
speaks for us."</TE>
<TE>   Moose, who grew up in the small town of Lexington, N.C., went
straight from the University of North Carolina -- where he graduated
with a history degree -- to the police department in Portland, where
he spent 24 years. Even as he earned a master's in public
administration and a doctorate in urban studies from Portland State
University, he climbed the Portland Police Bureau's ranks to become
the city's first African American chief. His six years in charge
there were occasionally stormy -- but they also were a time of
accomplishment, when the crime rate fell, community policing efforts
improved, personnel standards rose and technologies were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Moose expressed public resentment after an
incident in which Portland residents, angry over a park closing,
targeted his home for a protest. During that 1998 demonstration,
police fired nonlethal beanbags into the crowd, sparking outrage. On
another occasion, Moose reprimanded a police officer who was reading
a newspaper while the chief was giving a speech.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the occasional flaps, Moose received accolades from local
officials when he announced his decision to take the Montgomery
County job three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He leaves the bureau in the best shape, at least in my memory,"
Portland Mayor Vera Katz said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Even as chief, Moose taught college courses, including one with
his wife on "gender conflict resolution." On the job, he espoused a
broad view of public safety, often considering the roots of crime
problems -- such as when he said, during a visit by President
Clinton: "Public safety is more than law enforcement. Public safety
is education. Public safety is jobs. Public safety is people caring
about other people."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Montgomery County officials recruited Moose to run the
police department that protects about 890,000 residents over 497
square miles that sprawl through wealthy suburbs, working-class

<TE>   His mandate was to help ease racial tensions following two
shootings of unarmed blacks and complaints that cops in the
predominantly white county were using racial profiling techniques
against African Americans. So far, he has received generally
favorable reviews for his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But now it seems his tenure -- and perhaps his future -- will be
judged on the investigation for an elusive sniper who continues to
terrorize residents throughout the region. It is a challenge to which
he brings a personal style that is volatile and humble.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>With apologies to Richard Lewis, Election 2002 is becoming the
Campaign From Hell.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of the HBO sitcom "Curb Your Enthusiasm" will recall that
Lewis, the comedian buddy of star Larry David, recently tried to
claim authorship, in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations no less, of the
phrase "The -- From Hell." Much merriment ensued.</LD>
<LD>   It's been a little less jolly on the campaign trail. Most
campaigns this year seem to be operating at two speeds: vicious and
vacuous. Here in Texas, Republican Gov. Rick Perry and his Democratic
challenger, banker Tony Sanchez, have been very specific in their
personal allegations about each other -- and equally vague in their
policy prescriptions for many of the state's problems. It's a formula
evident in races everywhere.</LD>
<TE>   What voters aren't seeing are candidates, at least not in the
flesh. Campaigns appear to be evolving beyond much actual
campaigning. Exceptions endure, of course, but the typical candidate
today does far fewer public events -- speeches at Rotary Clubs,
visits to senior centers, sit-downs at schools -- than their
counterparts a decade or two ago.</TE>
<TE>   It's good news for managing editors watching the campaign travel
budgets of newspaper reporters, but not so terrific for everybody
else. The chance for real voters -- or even for reporters, as their
surrogates -- to push and prod and take the measure of office-seekers
is eroding as candidates expose themselves to fewer uncontrolled
situations.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the politicians? Usually on the phone, raising money to
buy television ads. In Iowa, Democrat Ann Hutchinson, who's
challenging Republican Rep. Jim Nussle in a House race, admits she
spends more of her time raising money than on anything else.</TE>
<TE>   As Hutchinson describes it, fund-raising is essentially her
full-time job as a candidate; she squeezes in campaign appearances
whenever there is a lull. Meanwhile, if you called Nussle's office
for his public schedule earlier this month, they might have directed
you to an appearance two weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   This pattern, visible in race after race, is the fulfillment of a
dark prophecy that first surfaced in California. Back in the 1980s,
Democratic media consultant Bob Shrum famously observed that "a
campaign rally in California is three people around a television
set."</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, like so many others, California has now conquered
America. In too many races, television advertising isn't just the
centerpiece of the campaign; it is, for all intents and purposes, the
entirety of the campaign. Fearful of stumbling "off message,"
candidates let their TV ads do ever more of their talking, often in
incendiary language that shades the truth. At this rate, it may not
be long before somebody nominates a computer simulation for office.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it has been that edifying when candidates step out from
behind the TV screen. If there's one common theme in state and
federal races this year, it's avoidance of confronting tough problems
-- especially the budget squeeze facing governments at all levels.</TE>
<TE>   At least 45 states are facing budget deficits. But the biggest
deficit in state campaigns this year is in specifics from
gubernatorial candidates about how they would close those shortfalls
-- much less simultaneously fund the improvements in education and
health care many are promising.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone in California knows how Gov. Gray Davis or Republican
Bill Simon Jr. would deal with the state's looming budget deficit,
they are telepathic. It's no better in Texas. The latest estimates
are that the state faces a budget shortfall next year of at least $5
billion, and possibly twice that.</TE>
<TE>   But when asked at their debate last week in Houston how they would
solve the problem, Sanchez volunteered only that he would scrub the
budget for "waste and inefficiency," while Perry insisted he has the
experience to find a solution. The reporters questioning the two men
probably had a better chance of convincing them to blurt out the PINs
for their ATM cards than disclosing what they think it may take to
balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this reticence isn't hard to see. Governors from
Michigan to Maryland next year are looking at painful budget cuts, or
tax increases, or both.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, if you are looking at a $5-billion deficit, you are
going to have to come up with some revenue measures or the cuts are
going to be very draconian," says retiring Democratic state Rep. Paul
Sadler, the Texas Legislature's leading expert on school finance. Few
candidates have the nerve to tell voters that.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for the U.S. House and Senate have been just as evasive
concerning the central domestic issue they're debating this year:
Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dow nose-diving, Republicans have spent the fall in a
semantic snit, insisting that their plans for restructuring Social
Security should not be called privatization.</TE>
<TE>   Far fewer have made it clear to voters that, under whatever name,
they still want to expose Social Security to the risks and rewards of
the markets by allowing workers to invest part of their payroll taxes
in stocks and bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Even fewer Republicans have acknowledged that the means President
Bush once identified to fund those investments -- the surplus
accumulating in the Social Security account before the baby boom
generation retires -- is already being diverted to cover the massive
federal budget deficits now projected during the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats promise to save those surpluses for Social Security. But
they have given no hint of how they might balance the budget -- much
less fund exorbitant new promises such as a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare -- without tapping Social Security money.</TE>
<TE>   The only way that math can add up is to roll back Bush's tax cut.
But just the tiniest handful of Democrats want to say that. So the
party is reduced to hoping that voters can't count.</TE>
<TE>   Here and there candidates are presenting voters with real choices.
(Perry and Sanchez, for instance, have some good ideas on education.)
But mostly, this year's campaign is making it tougher for the
eventual winners to solve the problems awaiting them.</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to curb your enthusiasm about that.</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg Marches in Bronx Parade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg marched with local officials Sunday in the
Bronx, a day before the city's main Columbus Day parade, which he
planned to sit out because organizers would not allow him to walk
with two cast members from "The Sopranos."</LD>
<LD>   "It's great to be in the Bronx and it's great to be at a parade
where you can march with all your friends," Bloomberg said.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of today's parade in Manhattan say the hit HBO show
about a crime family perpetuates negative stereotypes of Italian
Americans.</LD>
<TE>   The Columbus Citizens Foundation had sought a federal court order
banning Bloomberg from bringing Dominic Chianese and Lorraine Bracco
to the annual celebration. Chianese plays a New Jersey mob boss;
Bracco plays a psychiatrist treating a mobster.</TE>
<TE>   After both sides agreed that organizers had the right to invite or
not invite anyone to their parade, the judge said he had nothing to
rule on.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation Vice President Frank Fusaro said the group still wants
Bloomberg to march -- by himself. But the mayor said he instead would
have lunch with the actors today.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody should lighten up a little," Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Inzano of the Bronx agreed: "It's a TV series. They're not
really in the mob. They're only actors."</TE>

<HD>Amid Surge in Popularity, Lie Is Put to the Polygraph</HD>
<DH>Study by science society calls systems so flawed as to be
'danger to national security.' The machines have shown a sometimes
astonishing tendency to red-flag the innocent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Piller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The demand to cast an ever-wider net of security across the country
has created a rush to embrace technologies that have demonstrated a
sometimes staggering propensity for snaring the innocent.</LD>
<LD>   Since last year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, hijackers, spies and snipers are seen as blending
invisibly into airports, public buildings and city streets -- even
infiltrating the very agencies that guard against attacks. With
almost no one above suspicion, security agencies increasingly are
looking for screening technologies that can peer into the thoughts of
thousands or even millions of people.</LD>
<LD>   Artificial-intelligence software that plucks terrorist needles
from haystacks of unrelated data, facial recognition stations that
see hijackers behind newly grown beards at airport checkpoints, and
electronic identification systems for travelers are being implemented
despite clear signs that the error-prone systems may do more harm
than good, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   The latest example in this trend is the 100-year-old polygraph. In
a scathing report this month, the nation's most respected scientific
society, the National Academy of Sciences, debunked the use of
polygraphs to catch spies and screen employees. The study called
polygraph tests so flawed as to be "a danger to national security."</TE>
<TE>   But even before reviewing the rigorous assessment, a wide range of
police and federal security agencies now say they have no plans to
abandon the device. And unlike experimental, high-tech security tools
that are not yet widely deployed, the "lie detector" is used daily by
thousands of police departments and federal security agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Security officials cite a lack of alternative technologies and,
despite the report's findings, an abiding faith that it is better to
suspect many in order to detect one or two terrorists or criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Always an Error Margin</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a margin of error," said Wayne Jones, a recruiter
for the San Jose Police Department. "But is it a good indicator? Yes.
It's not a fishing expedition."</TE>
<TE>   Experts view such widespread support for a discredited technology
as a distressing sign of lowered standards of protection as the
nation races to catch not only spies and terrorists, but those who
might merely be contemplating a criminal act. It signals, they say, a
growing disconnect between scientific certainty and security
imperatives in the post-9/11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "A key problem is the illusion of control. A lot of technology is
marketed to make people think they know more than they do, and can do
more than they can," said Edward Tenner, author of "Why Things Bite
Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only will these technologies be a distraction, but there is
an even greater danger -- that terrorists may be able to work around
them."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence and military agencies use the polygraph extensively.
In a growing trend, more than 62% of large police departments test
job applicants and many test criminal suspects. It's an effort borne
of frustration. Security professionals are trying to satisfy public
pressure to preempt acts of terrorism and other crimes. No technology
can read minds.</TE>
<TE>   But there is the polygraph.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, of the San Jose police, credits polygraph testing of job
applicants with saving his city from a Rampart-like scandal, in which
crooked Los Angeles cops terrorized lawbreakers and innocents alike
during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   A Ringing Endorsement</TE>
<TE>   "I put a lot of stock into it -- and I've been in the business for
25 years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' remarks were echoed by police examiners from Los Angeles,
Dallas, Chicago and San Diego, as well as some with the CIA, Customs
Service and Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the National Academy report could hardly have been more
dismissive of the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Overconfidence in the polygraph actually reduces security because
many loyal employees are judged deceptive while most spies escape
notice, the report noted.</TE>
<TE>   "National security is too important to be left to such a blunt
instrument," said Stephen E. Fienberg, a computer scientist at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and chairman of the academy
panel.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that polygraph testing designed to catch eight of
10 spies among 10,000 employees would also implicate an estimated
1,600 innocents--an error rate that renders the exercise meaningless.
When a higher threshold is set to reduce false positives, eight of
the 10 spies would go free, the panel found.</TE>
<TE>   For 10,000 criminal suspects -- half who were presumed guilty --
the panel found that to detect deception in 80% of the criminals,
examiners would also implicate 800 innocent suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many people on the front lines of crime and fighting terrorism
are willing to tolerate high error rates to exploit an available tool
to penetrate criminal intent -- and to reassure the public that what
can be done is being done.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD, which faces a chronic shortage of officers, began
polygraph screening for applicants in February 2001. This year, of
7,200 recruits, about 2,000 passed a written test, a preliminary
interview and background check. Among that group -- the cream of the
applicant pool -- barely more than half passed the polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   One-third were judged deceptive about drug use, thefts from
employers and other matters of personal integrity. An additional 4%
used techniques designed to defeat the device, according to city
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Among law enforcement circles it was kind of a joke that you
could come to the LAPD and lie, and not get caught," said Phyllis
Lynes, a city personnel executive, citing one justification for the
polygraph program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a perfect science, we know that," she added. "People who
have concerns that they had a false positive can bring it to our
attention and we are very liberal about reviewing that."</TE>
<TE>   Police departments also argue that polygraph tests are augmented
with traditional gumshoe detective work.</TE>
<TE>   "We do the legwork -- people's employment history, their financial
history and background. We will talk to people who know them --
family members, friends and associates from years and years ago,"
said Lt. Horace Frank, an LAPD spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Increased reliance on the polygraph also stems from a changed
perception of safety in an America where seemingly innocuous young
men fly jetliners into buildings. As the number of suspects viewed as
capable of terrible crimes has swelled exponentially, security
authorities understandably are scrambling ways to filter that vast
pool.</TE>
<TE>   They are loath to discard the one tool that has a long track
record for the job, despite glaring flaws, in part because of the
placebo effect: Some subjects of polygraph testing spontaneously
confess or avoid committing crimes for fear of being detected.</TE>
<TE>   "The polygraph is a wonderful prop for interrogation" of naive
suspects, said David L. Faigman, a professor at the UC San Francisco
Hastings College of Law and a member of the polygraph panel.</TE>
<TE>   But he and other experts caution that the actual polygraph data is
unreliable. U.S. security agencies have repeatedly experienced the
disastrous effects of faith in the polygraph.</TE>
<TE>   Study Born of Scandal</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy study was prompted by the scandal surrounding
Wen Ho Lee, who was a scientist at the Los Alamos nuclear lab in New
Mexico. The Department of Energy weapons scientist was accused of
spying for China, based largely on polygraph tests in 1998 and 1999
that were interpreted differently by DOE and FBI analysts. In a major
embarrassment to both agencies, Lee pleaded guilty to a felony charge
but was exonerated of spying.</TE>
<TE>   Polygraph exams have proved equally bad at detecting some of the
most damaging spies in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Aldrich Ames, a Soviet mole, became a top CIA official despite
passing polygraph tests repeatedly. And Ana B. Montes, who this year
pleaded guilty to spying for Cuba for 16 years, passed polygraph
exams en route to becoming the Pentagon's senior Cuba analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Similar doubts about efficacy have been directed at FBI moves to
mine public records in efforts to preempt acts of terrorism, and
experiments by airports with facial ID systems -- which together have
already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the effort to thwart terrorists is pushing such technologies
ahead with little regard to their prospects for success. Some
scientists compare the trend to historical blunders made in forensic
techniques developed for criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Many forensic methods, from carpet-fiber and handwriting analysis
to polygraph testing -- emerged from police investigative efforts
with little or no controlled research to eliminate examiner bias and
other factors that taint reliability.</TE>
<TE>   "For centuries, clinical anecdotes and experiences suggested that
bloodletting was an effective therapy" until controlled studies
showed it to be useless or harmful, said Faigman, the UC professor.
"Human experience is fallible. That's why we have the scientific
method."</TE>
<TE>   The seemingly anti-scientific approach of police and security
agencies is what most troubles critics.</TE>
<TE>   They warn that the justified sense of urgency that followed last
year's terrorist attacks may have dampened healthy skepticism about
the potential of quick-fix technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "The police like to show that they are effective, and there are a
lot of dumb crooks," author Tenner said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the smart ones do much greater damage and they evaluate the
technology you are using in order to subvert it."</TE>

<DH>A 13-5 trouncing of the Twins puts Anaheim in Fall Classic,
ending four decades of heartbreak.</DH>

<LD>There was something dreamlike about the fireworks booming through the
afternoon sky, the crowd roaring. Adam Kennedy looked dazed as he
made his way off Edison Field in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "This is surreal," the second baseman said.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels had finally made it to the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   After decades of agonizing defeats. After a season in which no one
expected much of them.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise team of the playoffs earned a trip to baseball's
annual spectacle with a suitably astonishing 13-5 victory over the
Minnesota Twins on Sunday in Game 5 of the American League
championship series. They did it with Kennedy, by no means a slugger,
hitting three home runs. They did it with a record-tying explosion of
10 runs in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day their late owner Gene Autry, the singing cowboy, had
dreamed of. Autry's widow, Jackie, the honorary president of the
American League, presented the league championship trophy to team
officials Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that he's not here personally," she said. "But I know
he's watching from somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   The World Series begins Saturday at Edison Field. The Angels will
play the winner of the National League championship series between
the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' clinching victory came in a back-and-forth game before
a crowd of 44,835. The Twins appeared to be in command after going
ahead, 5-3, in the seventh inning, but the Angels, as they have done
all season, found a way to come back.</TE>
<TE>   First came a couple of base hits, then Kennedy, who had seven
homers in the regular season, hit his third of the game for a 6-5
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a couple of pitches to hit," he said. "I had my swing
working today and I didn't miss those pitches."</TE>
<TE>   With each successive run, the roar inside the stadium grew louder,
the fans banging their red, plastic "Thunder Sticks." Before the
inning was over, the Angels sent 15 batters to the plate and tied a
playoff run-scoring record set held by two teams.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept swinging and, goodness gracious, I don't know I've ever
seen an inning like that," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That's
a great baseball team."</TE>
<TE>   A team that most had written off before the season began.</TE>
<TE>   This is no collection of superstars or pricey free agents,
boasting no big names such as Rod Carew or Nolan Ryan, who played for
earlier incarnations of the team. This is a roster of working-class
players and emerging stars assembled by General Manager Bill
Stoneman, who remained patient after the club finished 41 games out
of first place in 2001 and started sluggishly this season.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co., which bought out Jackie Autry three
years ago, was looking to sell.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday afternoon, after the pennant-clinching victory over
Minnesota, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner preferred to talk about the
"magical moment" and fans stubbornly refused to leave the stadium,
staying in their seats to cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "This more than makes up for all the heartbreaks over all the
decades," said Ralf Woebken, 44, who held a sign reading: "World
Series starts here on Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   At the Knothole Club, an upscale cafe in the stadium, Gary
Overman, 44, of Yorba Linda, said: "I have goose bumps. I have tears.
And I have a memory that will last forever."</TE>
<TE>   The players seemed to sense the moment, eschewing the clubhouse to
stream back onto the field, waving and holding their trophy aloft.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrations were not confined to Edison Field. At the Huntington
Beach pier, the game was blaring from a boombox in front of Zack's
Pier Plaza, where fans have been putting Angel flags on bikes they
rent there.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has the Lakers, but we've had nothing like that in
Orange County to help out the local economy," said Mike Ali, 58, the
shop's owner. Ali envisions more business drummed up by the World
Series. "We're ready for them. Bring 'em on."</TE>
<TE>   From his home in Balboa Island, Russ Shimer watched on television
with his family. Shimer, who grew up in Minnesota rooting for the
Twins, said he switched allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to like this team," he said. "You don't have the
household names. You don't have the typical over-the-hill superstars
the Angels usually bring in. Not everybody has to be a hero, because
everybody is a hero."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the World Series came to the Los Angeles area was
1988, when the Dodgers defeated the Oakland Athletics four games to
one behind Kirk Gibson's ninth-inning home run in Game 1 and the
pitching of Orel Hershiser, the series' most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   In the seasons since, the Dodgers have been the team that spent
tens of millions to improve their lineup. The Dodgers were the team
that seemed most likely to bring the series back to the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be the Angels -- led by Manager Mike Scioscia and
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, stars of that 1988 Dodger team -- who
are in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been pinching myself all week," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said.
"I don't think it will fully sink in until I watch the highlights on
TV and read the sports section tomorrow. This is like the best dream
ever.... It's like a children's storybook."</TE>
<TE>   Even the players seemed amazed.</TE>
<TE>   While Kennedy accepted his award as the playoff series' most
valuable player, relief pitcher Francisco Rodriguez seemed equally
dazed.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-year-old rookie spent most of this season in the minor
leagues before being called up last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked," he said. "You know, the World Series, I can't
believe it. It's something you dream about."</TE>

<HD>Battling the Air Banner Ban</HD>
<DH>On free speech grounds, an anti-abortion group is suing
Huntington Beach because it will bar towed aerial signs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach will soon become the first city in California to
prohibit banner-towing planes after residents complained about the
noise. But the rules are now at the center of a free-speech battle
that pits the city against an anti-abortion group.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance takes effect Wednesday at a time when other coastal
communities are considering similar bans on the planes, which pull
ads for a variety of products, including soft drinks and dot-com
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which paid for towed banners
with graphic pictures of 10-week-old aborted fetuses over beaches
last summer, alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court that the
ordinance is unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   "The moment this ordinance goes into effect, my client's rights
are being violated," said Robert Muise, an attorney with the Thomas
More Law Center, a public interest law firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The group is seeking a temporary restraining order that would halt
the ban until a court decides whether the law violates 1st Amendment
protections of free speech.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the group's banners are a form of political
speech that deserve special protection.</TE>
<TE>   City officials insist their rule is legal because it doesn't
target certain banners, but bans them all. They also point out that
the ordinance was meant to reduce noise, not muffle the voice of
advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what's on the banner, it's the noise," said Councilwoman
Connie Boardman.</TE>
<TE>   The city expected companies that tow the banners to challenge the
ordinance, and the anti-abortion group's lawsuit came as something of
a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is known for its high-profile tactics. In
addition to banners, it has sent caravans of trucks with the same
images along busy freeways in major metropolitan areas and around
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the group will have an uphill battle because it
must show there are not sufficient alternative ways to express its
views.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Supreme] Court says as long as the restriction is
content-neutral, the government may control the time, place and
manner of speech," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Cunningham, executive director of the Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform, insists the banners represent one of the few ways the
organization has to express its views, noting that newspapers and
television stations have refused its ads because of their graphic
content.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have alternative ways of getting our message out that
are remotely as effective as this," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   He also challenged the assertion that the ban is content-neutral.
He cited comments by one council member, Pam Julien Houchen, who
cited the abortion banners as one reason she supported the ban.</TE>
<TE>   "The ordinance is not content-neutral if the people enacting it
explicitly state that their purpose is to get our aborted-baby
pictures out of the skies," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, beach communities have been stymied in their efforts to
curb the noise because airspace is controlled by the Federal Aviation
Administration, which has steadfastly supported the right of banner
planes to operate.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent federal appeals court ruling upheld the right of
Honolulu to ban aerial advertising, prompting Huntington Beach to
enact its ban. Several other beach cities, including Laguna Beach and
Hermosa Beach, are studying the issue.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev.</DL>
<LD>The number of bears killed in the Lake Tahoe area is on the rise,
wildlife advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   Eight bears have been killed by vehicles on Tahoe's Nevada side
this season, and four more had to be shot because they were breaking
into homes to get food, said Carl Lackey, a biologist for the Nevada
Division of Wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   He blamed a combination of a drought that has left scant food for
bears in the Sierra Nevada and a lack of bear-proof garbage
containers.</LD>
<TE>   Ann Bryant, president of the Bear Preservation League, said 13
bears have been killed on the California side.</TE>

<KH>CAPITOL JOURNAL</KH>
<HD>Reader Offers a Sound Idea for Governor's Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Sacramento-- In this nutty election season, a Times reader offers a
sane suggestion: Stop the gubernatorial race.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a race anyway. It's a one-sided mud-wrestle. Close it
down.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Bill Simon Jr. should crawl out of the muck, grab a
white towel and wave it. Concede three weeks early.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis then should cancel his multimillion-dollar buy of
mud-slinging attack ads and donate the money to the state's strapped
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   But, here, read the e-mail for yourself from the reader, Denny
Freidenrich of Laguna Beach:</TE>
<TE>   "[Simon's] an embarrassment to the political process in general
and the Republican Party in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only should he fire the aide [who plotted Simon's false
fund-raising charge against Davis], he should fire himself. He should
immediately drop out of the race ....</TE>
<TE>   "Without needing to spend millions on TV commercials, Davis should
pledge to [give] half his campaign war chest to the state's general
fund. This translates into about $10 million for food for needy kids,
help for disabled seniors, more teacher aides in classrooms, etc."</TE>
<TE>   It's the most interesting, unrealistic idea of the campaign. So I
called the e-mailer.</TE>
<TE>   Freidenrich, 54, turns out to be a lifelong Democrat who plans to
vote for Davis. "But would I put up a 'Davis for Governor' sign in my
frontyard? Probably not." He has voted Republican before and praises
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   He owns a consulting firm, First Strategies, that does PR,
marketing and fund-raising for private and public agencies.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon capitulated, Freidenrich notes, Davis could "do something
noble .... Give [money] back to the folks of California. Feed hungry
children ....</TE>
<TE>   "That would really be a photo op. What a photo op!"</TE>
<TE>   This is legally possible, even if politically improbable --
especially for a money hoarder like Davis. It's legal to use
political funds for a "governmental purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Here are other options for spending Davis' surplus:</TE>
<TE>   * Donate it to charity.</TE>
<TE>   * Give it to the Democratic Party. (Help shore up his wobbly
base.)</TE>
<TE>   * Return it to donors.</TE>
<TE>   * Bankroll a nonprofit group that would build a much-needed
governor's residence near the Capitol. (Leave a legacy to be exalted
on every visitor's tour.)</TE>
<TE>   One problem with Freidenrich's visionary suggestion, of course, is
that Simon shows no inclination to quit.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a strong chance of winning," he still insisted Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody else I've talked to -- in or out of his campaign -- feels
that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Any Republican with any brains can see if they don't do
something, they're headed for a complete disaster in which all
Republicans lose [on the statewide ticket]," says political analyst
Tony Quinn, a onetime GOP staffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take something like a Riordan write-in to put
enthusiasm back into this election."</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Richard Riordan, beaten badly in the GOP primary, is
hinting at a write-in candidacy. A Field poll six weeks ago showed
Riordan trouncing Davis by 15 points in a hypothetical matchup.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House and Riordan's allies are urging him not to
jump in unless Simon withdraws. The deadline for becoming a write-in
is Oct. 22.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ghoulish, but Simon's motto for the rest of the campaign
should be, 'Death with dignity,' " says Jack Pitney, a political
science professor at Claremont-McKenna College and former national
GOP official.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. If he stays in, Simon at least should run a positive
campaign, talking solely about issues critical to California. But
that's not the plan. He has begun airing a new TV ad again attacking
Davis' ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much easier to make someone dislike somebody than make them
like somebody," says veteran Simon strategist Ed Rollins. "This is
why a lot of negative campaigning has been effective over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Sure. But every voter must already know that Davis holds the
all-time gubernatorial record for hitting up special</TE>
<TE>   interests. Anyway, Simon's credentials as the messenger of that
non-news just fell into the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, most people already realize that Simon is in way over
his head. Davis has spent many millions trashing him on TV. The
anti-Simon message, I suspect, really is boring viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Call me naive, but positive ads by Davis and Simon might be
uplifting and increase voter turnout. And the smiley spots could
spiff up both their muddied images.</TE>
<TE>   However, if Simon adopted Freidenrich's plan, he also could help
himself financially. He could take back some of the $4 million he
recently loaned his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And Davis could get the most for his money politically by giving
it to disabled folks or school kids. Yep, what a photo op.</TE>
<TE>   But that would be too sane for politics.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Gardena city councilman is facing possible assault charges for
allegedly hitting a Hawthorne police officer with his car at the
scene of a traffic accident in a busy South Bay intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Gardena City Councilman Steven C. Bradford was released Saturday
after posting $50,000 bail for his arrest that morning.</LD>
<LD>   Bradford had no comment when reached by phone Sunday. But his
attorney, Winston K. McKesson, said the councilman was only trying to
help out at the crash scene and blamed officers for any
miscommunication.</LD>
<TE>   According to police, the councilman disobeyed traffic officers'
orders to stop as he drove away from a gas station near the scene of
a two-car collision at El Segundo and Crenshaw boulevards, an
intersection that divides Hawthorne and Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   When Bradford's car inched forward in a stop-and-go movement,
Officer Vince Arias signaled for him to stop, police said. Instead,
Bradford yelled through his closed windows as he moved forward,
eventually hitting Arias in his left leg and knocking him down,
Hawthorne police Lt. John Beerling said.</TE>
<TE>   Beerling said Bradford then "got out of the car and became
verbally uncooperative and semi-combative."</TE>
<TE>   Arias tried to place Bradford in handcuffs, but he resisted,
police said. When another officer approached Bradford and threatened
to use pepper spray on him, he complied, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Arias did not require medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford was taken to the Hawthorne police station, where he was
booked on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon on an
officer and resisting arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "All he was trying to do was tender service," McKesson said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident involved a car that had rear-ended another, sparking
a fire on one of the vehicles. Police said no serious injuries were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, has served
on the Gardena City Council for five years. He was first elected to
the council in 1997, making him the city's first black elected
council member.</TE>

<HD>Would You Like Some Fries With That Homework?</HD>
<DH>Administrators and teachers go behind McDonald's counters
to raise funds for schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an elementary school principal, Rena Thompson is used to fielding
complaints about test scores or inadequate supplies. Once a year,
though, she hears protests of a different sort: oversalted fries,
undercooked potatoes, sluggish service.</LD>
<LD>   Her school, Evans Elementary in Garden Grove, is one of about 30
in Orange County where the teachers and administrators this week will
double as McDonald's employees to raise money for their schools.</LD>
<LD>   Evans is participating for the third consecutive year in
McTeacher's Night--on Tuesday for two schools and on Thursday for
most others. The outlets turn over 20% of the night's take to the
schools.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, participating campuses each netted about $600, with the
money going toward supplies in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   Although her school's proceeds have bought some much-needed books,
Thompson said that is less important than the chance to strengthen
the school's presence.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's about the money," said Thompson, who has worn
her husband's old uniform shirt and nametag from when he worked at
the restaurant chain as a teen. "It's a community-building thing.
Kids and parents have the chance to see us in a different light."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said she doesn't see the program as a McDonald's
publicity gimmick or a marketing tool. This and other
corporate-sponsored fund-raisers, such as those offered by pizza
parlors or skating rinks are "just some other different avenue for us
to have fun outside school," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Individual McDonald's operators work with schools to pick who
participates in the event, which is expected this year to include
more than 1,000 campuses in 16 states. An administrator and 10 to 15
teachers are each assigned to an employee as they flip burgers, work
the drive-through window or avoid burns from French fry grease vats.</TE>
<TE>   For Debbie Crussell, assistant principal at Sycamore Elementary in
Orange, the event is an opportunity for team-building among the
teachers. But they also leave each year with a greater appreciation
for fast-food workers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Assembling the burgers and the sandwiches -- I had no idea it was
so hard," said Crussell, whose school is participating for the third
year. "The Quarter Pounder is easy, but those other sandwiches....
Those different-sized patties are very complicated and frustrating."</TE>

<LD>A man died in Fullerton late Saturday night after the car he was
riding in collided with a truck at Brookhurst Road and Valencia
Avenue, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County coroner's office had not identified him Sunday
but believes he was about 30 years old.</LD>
<LD>   The man killed was a passenger; the driver was injured and cannot

<HD>Laguna Niguel's 'Moon-Fest' Has Become City's Cheeky
Tradition</HD>
<DH>Mooning Amtrak trains on a day in July started on a dare
nearly 25 years ago, or so the story goes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who says staid, conservative, let's-please-follow-the-rules Orange
County doesn't have a sense of humor?</LD>
<LD>   It seems almost surreal, but there's a spot in South County where
you can live on a $5-million equestrian estate, buy a new
Mercedes-Benz and drop your drawers in front of a passing Amtrak
without the slightest bit of condemnation from your friends or the
authorities. Fact. Welcome to the neighborhood, pal.</LD>
<LD>   On the second Saturday in July, Laguna Niguel becomes a place
where buttoned-down becomes bottoms up. Near the spot where two-lane
Camino Capistrano Road comes to a dead end, several thousand folks
show up outside a roadside saloon to, well, moon the passing Amtrak
trains.</LD>
<TE>   Legend has it that this bizarre and bawdy ritual began as a dare
by Mugs Away tavern regular K.T. Smith some 24 years ago. While
celebrating his 30th birthday at his favorite watering hole, a
somewhat-worse-for-wear Smith offered to buy beers all day long for
anyone who would show his or her backside to a passing Amtrak. Smith
had five takers. The next year, 50 regulars celebrated Smith's
birthday, displaying their cabooses to the passing trains.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the R-rated event attracted more than 3,000 people to
this colorful dive that sits only 40 yards from the railroad tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Smith, whose saloon name is "Cowboy Paul," has been attending
and occasionally participating in the "Mooning of the Amtrak" for six
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a great time the first year I did it," said
Smith, 46. "It reminded me of college."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Peterson, a former bar owner in New Orleans who goes by "Big
Jim," said the annual block party is an "incredible idea."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I'd have thought of it when I had my bar," said Peterson
as he sipped a cocktail at the end of the wooden bar. "It's a great
marketing ploy."</TE>
<TE>   But it's one that saloon owner John Kunik jokingly tries to
distance himself from.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't promote, condone or endorse what goes on," said Kunik, a
former telephone company executive who purchased the watering hole
seven years ago. "However, I am open that day."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Kunik doesn't mind that the annual drawer-drop has
appeared on local and national television, including CNN and the
Travel Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "San Juan Capistrano is known for the return of the swallows," he
said. "Laguna Niguel is famous for the return of the mooners."</TE>
<TE>   As the event has grown up and become more publicized, it has
evolved into something of a "Moon-Fest." The mooners fall somewhere
between Deadheads, Parrotheads and football tailgaters. They begin
arriving at sunrise in their RVs, motorcycles and pickups. Some
regulars have even begun outfitting the back of their pickups with
hot tubs.</TE>
<TE>   A giant train schedule is posted outside the bar for those wishing
to stumble across the street and position themselves against a
chain-link fence for the next passing train. The lineup of bare bums,
Kunik says, can vary in age from 1 month to 80 years.</TE>
<TE>   The passenger trains run all day from north and south, about twice
an hour beginning at 7:30 a.m. and ending at 11:40 p.m. A Web site
(www.moonamtrak.org) offers mooners directions, a list of do's and
don'ts, pictures from previous years and train schedules for those
who want to view the "moon show" from a train window.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the bar, vendors sell event T-shirts and a painter marks
the behind of those mooners who want Amtrak passengers to have
something to remember them by. Live bands play inside the tavern,
which is your typical dive. Peanut shells litter the dusty wood
floors. Old license plates, beer posters and faded pictures of Mugs
Away legends clutter the walls. Motorcycles and surfboards hang from
the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers, bikers, painters, schoolteachers, doctors
and lawyers gather after work to discuss the hot topics of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a quiet men's club in here," said Smith, who had 15
Mugs' locals visit him in the hospital after a major surgery. "People
get a lot of good advice here."</TE>
<TE>   They also know how to have a good time. Golf outings, fishing
trips and charity events bring this collection of barflies together.
But what sets them apart is the annual moon festival.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the regulars take part or even attend the spectacle, but
most accept its premise.</TE>
<TE>   What does Amtrak think of all this openness?</TE>
<TE>   "It has absolutely nothing to do with us," Amtrak spokeswoman
Sarah Swain said. "It's a tradition, but it's not one of our
traditions."</TE>
<TE>   And City Hall?</TE>
<TE>   "From our perspective," Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey said,
"we prefer to turn the other cheek."</TE>
<TE>   Casey has never attended the festivities, though Kunik said many
other politicians do. But even before Casey arrived in town from
Redondo Beach, he learned of the event's importance.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got the job, I received a congratulations card from city
staff and the council members," he said. "Instead of signing it,
someone had drawn bottoms in different shapes and sizes with first
names of council and staff. Once I understood the significance of the
card, I realized I was joining a City Council and a city staff with a
great sense of humor. And that was important."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Casey said the city receives a nasty e-mail or phone
call from someone wishing that the Orange County's Sheriff's
Department would crack down on the mooners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, generally, the Sheriff's Department views this as a
harmless tradition," Casey said. "I'm sure they have more important
things to tend to."</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy Paul said that the Sheriff's Department decided four years
ago that it was going to get tough on the mooners.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed up with video cameras and they were going to get
people for indecent exposure," he said. "But that was the year a
bunch of porters from the train began mooning back at us. I think the
cops just said, 'If they don't care, we don't either.' "</TE>

<HD>Senate Seat Is a Must-Win for Both Parties</HD>

<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>MODESTO -- Even in what is shaping up as the only heavily contested
race for a state Senate seat this year, the arrival of Clint Eastwood
in a presidential-like convoy of shiny black SUVs was unexpected here
-- maybe doubly so.</LD>
<LD>   It's not every day that a Hollywood icon steps out of a
mini-motorcade and into the local movie house for a screening of his
latest film, "Bloodwork." What's more, on this recent Sunday evening,
Republican Eastwood was in town to raise money and campaign for Rusty
Areias, the Democratic nominee in the 12th District Senate race.</LD>
<LD>   Areias, 52, who is opposed by Republican businessman Jeff Denham,
35, was pumped at harnessing the star power and fund-raising draw of
Eastwood, a longtime friend, to the California 99 community whose
votes are crucial to the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<TE>   He suggested that Eastwood's role in Modesto dramatized the
importance Democrats put on winning the vacant seat formerly occupied
by termed-out Republican Dick Monteith.</TE>
<TE>   For Democrats, a win in this nominally Democratic but
philosophically conservative region once represented by Rep. Gary
Condit (D-Ceres) is a must to keep their lopsided 26-14 Senate
majority. Democrats are one short of a two-thirds super-majority
required to enact the state budget or raise taxes without a GOP vote.</TE>
<TE>   Retaining the seat in the GOP lineup is also crucial to the
Republicans, whose numbers in the Senate have shrunk to so few in the
last decade that they exercise little power. Loss of the seat would
push them further to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of redistricting maps drawn by the Legislature last
year, the 12th District is the only Senate seat that is competitive.
In a deal agreed to by majority Democrats and minority Republicans, a
status quo redistricting plan was adopted that is intended to freeze
the current alignment for the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Originally drawn as a Democratic-tilting district, the 12th now
has Democrats outnumbering Republicans 48% to 38%, while voters of no
party total 9%. The district includes all of Merced County, much of
Stanislaus County and a piece of Madera County. It also stretches
west over the coastal mountains to include all of San Benito County
and part of Monterey County.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties are pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the
campaign and expect to spend millions before election day -- more
than a combined $6 million for a seat that pays $99,000 a year plus a
tax-free $120 daily living allowance when the Legislature is in
session.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we are the underdog. The Democrats have much more money,
and they are going to outspend Jeff significantly," said Senate
Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Difference in Financing</TE>
<TE>   Brulte noted that under the Proposition 34 campaign finance reform
initiative, Denham had agreed to voluntarily limit his spending but
Areias had not. Denham will be listed in official voter materials as
having restricted his expenditures, an action that presumably would
appeal to voters.</TE>
<TE>   The telegenic Denham, a married father of two young children who
failed in a race for the Assembly two years ago, owns a factory in
Salinas that produces plastic containers for agriculture. He also
operates a plastics recycling business. He is a graduate of Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   Areias served in the Assembly for nine years starting in 1983. He
was defeated for state controller in 1994 and lost his first race for
the Senate in 1996. Gov. Gray Davis appointed him chairman of the
Coastal Commission and later made him the director of the Department
of Parks and Recreation, a post he resigned from in June.</TE>
<TE>   As an assemblyman from a rural district where gun control was
unpopular, Areias cast the decisive vote in 1989 to pass the
country's first assault gun control law. He also unsuccessfully
challenged the leadership of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a fellow
Democrat, as a member of the maverick "Gang of Five."</TE>
<TE>   On issues, Denham said he opposes a recently signed bill that will
authorize the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board to impose a
mediated settlement when negotiations fail between growers and
unionized farm workers. "It sets precedents that we don't require of
any other industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Denham also said he does not favor a new law that will allow
workers to take paid leave to attend to family matters. He said some
provisions were so vague that they invited costly legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Areias, whose family operated a dairy for 85 years until it went
bankrupt several years ago, sidestepped a direct answer on whether he
favors the Democratic-backed mediated settlement law, saying, "We are
going to have to live with it." He added, however, that "from a
policy standpoint, I think it is reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   As election day draws closer, the candidates' differences have
turned nasty.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a long list of liens filed against Areias by local, state
and federal officials for nonpayment of taxes, Denham charged that
Areias is unfit for the Senate. Denham disclosed, and Areias
confirmed, that the state in 2001 garnished part of his salary as
state director of parks in order to satisfy a $144,476 lien for back
income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to Pay Taxes</TE>
<TE>   Areias has conceded he failed to pay taxes several times in recent
years because they had "fallen between the cracks" or he mistakenly
believed that someone else had made the payments.</TE>
<TE>   He said these occurred during the tough times when the family
dairy business, of which he was a partner, went bankrupt and was
auctioned off in 1998. He said that cash was very tight and that he
delayed some tax payments so he could make electricity bill payments
for his elderly father.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody [creditors] has been paid back 100% or soon will be,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Areias recently launched a counteroffensive against Denham,
demanding that Denham produce police records of at least two
incidents in which he was taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Paule, Denham's campaign manager, did not make the documents
public but said Denham was never charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 case, Denham, a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, was
included in the mass arrest of about 150 rioting college-age people
during a drunken homecoming celebration, Paule said. He was detained
overnight and released the next day without being charged, Paule
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 incident, some friends of Denham got into a fight at a
Salinas bar and he tried to break it up, Paule said. "The cops came
and hauled everyone away until they sorted it out. No charges were
filed" against Denham, Paule said.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani Talks Up a Sagging Simon</HD>
<DH>Former New York mayor appears at campaign rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried Sunday to help
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. recover from
falsely accusing Gov. Gray Davis last week of illegal fund-raising.</LD>
<LD>   "Bill understood this was a mistake, and he acknowledged it,"
Giuliani told reporters after a Simon campaign rally in Burbank. "And
now you've got to move on."</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani, the star attraction at Simon fund-raisers Saturday in
San Jose and Sunday in San Diego and Fresno, recalled that he made
"lots of mistakes" in his mayoral campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   "It didn't have any impact on how I governed, or what I was able
to do as the mayor," Giuliani said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged last week that he made a mistake by saying a
photograph was proof that Davis had illegally accepted campaign money
in the state Capitol; it turned out the photo was shot at a private
home. On Sunday, Simon said it was "time to move on" to other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's visit to California was not just to stump for Simon. He
is also promoting his new book, "Leadership," with signings Sunday in
Pasadena and today in San Francisco, where he has scheduled another
stop with Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is one of several dozen Republicans around the country for
whom Giuliani has campaigned in recent months. Among them are Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush and North Carolina Senate candidate Elizabeth Hanford
Dole.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to helping fellow Republicans, Giuliani is also
accumulating political goodwill among donors and party leaders who
could assist him if he runs for public office again. Giuliani, 58,
says he "would most likely return to public service," according to
Matt Mahoney, deputy director of the Friends of Giuliani political
action committee.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign, used
the former mayor's visit to question Simon's record as a prosecutor
who worked for Giuliani in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that Mr. Simon didn't learn his lesson when he
was working with Mr. Giuliani," he said. "Otherwise, he probably
wouldn't have gone through this entire episode last week of accusing
the governor of a crime without checking his facts. I doubt Mr.
Giuliani is proud of his protege in that effort."</TE>
<TE>   But Giuliani vouched for Simon's character at the Burbank hotel
rally.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're looking for someone of impeccable integrity,
directness, honesty, you couldn't have a better person than Bill
Simon," Giuliani said.</TE>

<HD>An Irreverent Look at Law and Politics</HD>
<DH>The man whose lawsuit struck 'under God' from the Pledge of
Allegiance gives his musical take on the Constitution and personal
pronouns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any thoughts that the guy whose lawsuit struck "under God" from the
Pledge of Allegiance would take himself too seriously Sunday ended
the moment he strapped on his guitar, hooked up his harmonica and
sang his own blues composition to a surprised audience.</LD>
<LD>   "It's freedom of religion, as long as it's God you choose,</LD>
<LD>   "They had those Pledge-of-Allegiance-needs-some-old-time-religion
blues."</LD>
<TE>   It was the first of five original songs Michael Newdow sang to 120
people gathered at the Center for Inquiry-West Los Angeles, whose
members generally espouse atheism and do not believe in the
supernatural.</TE>
<TE>   His appearance was part history lesson and part constitutional law
lecture, with a hootenanny and a sing-along thrown in -- the world
according to Newdow.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the Sacramento emergency-room doctor became one of the
most pilloried people in America after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed with him that the phrase "under God" violated the
constitutional separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-nine U.S. senators stood on the Capitol steps to denounce
the decision. Children by the thousands defied the ruling and pledged
allegiance under God.</TE>
<TE>   And the ruling was fodder for weeks on the talk-show circuit, all
of which led Newdow to another song in which he pretends he's a
cynical politician wrapping himself in religion.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter as long as I end it with 'God bless,' " Newdow
sang.</TE>
<TE>   The case that brought him infamy has been appealed. The Justice
Department is arguing as part of its brief that Newdow did not have
the standing to bring the case on behalf of his 8-year-old daughter
because he does not have custody of her.</TE>
<TE>   But the audience Sunday was full of supporters who greeted Newdow
with a standing ovation. One member gave him a T-shirt with the U.S.
flag and "Atheists Love America, Too," printed on it.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Tabash, a lawyer who is the center's chairman, introduced
Newdow as "perhaps the most important atheist in the world today."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow, 49, is also a lawyer who was raised Jewish. He is of
medium height, balding, and his brown hair is fading to gray. He
dressed casually, in faded blue jeans and a heavy green shirt.</TE>
<TE>   His lawsuit days are far from over, he told the group.</TE>
<TE>   He has filed one suit to ban chaplains at presidential
inaugurations and another saying it is unconstitutional for chaplains
to lead the prayers of state legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   He is also on a quest to introduce gender-neutral pronouns into
the language, when appropriate. Instead of he or she, he has invented
the word "ree," and instead of him or her, he offers "hurm."</TE>
<TE>   So perhaps it was appropriate that among those attending Newdow's
speech was comic Julia Sweeney, best known for her "Saturday Night
Live" character of unknown gender, Pat.</TE>
<TE>   She bought his two CDs -- one of children's songs and the other
similar to those he sang Sunday -- and asked Newdow to autograph
them.</TE>
<TE>   She's now a fan, someone she can relate to especially as she
fine-tunes her latest monologue, which she may call "My Beautiful
Loss of Faith Story."</TE>

<HD>Promising Lawyer Now a Defendant</HD>
<DH>Accused of embezzling from an estate, Angela Wallace also
is a suspect in two slayings. Her family insists she will be cleared
when the truth comes out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset and Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angela Wallace started humbly enough, the daughter of a postal
worker. She applied herself in school, and achieved.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace worked her way through law school and then paid her dues
as a struggling young attorney in solo practice, taking her share of
routine work, from drug cases to personal injury.</LD>
<LD>   She was bright, hard-working and personable. Those qualities
helped Wallace drive hard and rise high, counting among her friends
and clients such celebrities as basketball legend Earvin "Magic"
Johnson, rap star Andre "Dr. Dre" Young, entertainment executives and
judges.</LD>
<TE>   But after years in the circles of some of the city's premier
athletes, entertainers and politicians, Wallace, 41, finds herself
down again, stripped of her law license, facing a possible eight
years in prison if convicted of embezzlement, and a suspect in a
double homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's short but promising legal career is now seen as a
cautionary tale on the perils of ambition, Hollywood celebrity and
greed.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the stuff that movies are made of," said former state bar
examiner Teresa M. Garcia, who successfully prosecuted Wallace for
professional misconduct in 1998. "Her appearance was totally
deceiving. She looks so prim and proper."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace grew up as the middle child of seven in a tight-knit
family, according to an older sister, Leah Wallace. She was an honor
student who served as ninth-grade class president and drill team
captain at Palisades High School. A high school teacher inspired her
to become a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace graduated from USC Law School in 1985 and passed the bar
exam three years later, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Angie liked the American dream [but] she's not corporate
America," said Deputy Alternate Public Defender Michael-Loren Miller,
who has known Wallace since they were high school students. "We both
kind of dance to our own tune. We both wanted to be rich.... She was
going to make her mark."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace moved easily in the worlds of pop music and sports,
attracting celebrity cases and clients.</TE>
<TE>   She defended Aaron Hall, a singer with the platinum-selling R&amp;B
group Guy, in 1996; represented the family of Kevin Williams, a
former professional football player killed in a 1996 train
derailment; and won a confidential settlement for a pregnant former
girlfriend of New York Knicks forward Larry Johnson in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   While hosting events for the Black Women Lawyers Assn. of Los
Angeles and the John M. Langston Bar Assn., Wallace entertained state
Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown at her Hancock Park home.</TE>
<TE>   As is true for most lawyers in private practice, there were
disputes with clients, and some setbacks. Several clients complained
to the State Bar of California, the agency that regulates and
licenses lawyers, that Wallace failed to return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Another contended that he lost $124,000 when Wallace failed to
show up for a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But Wallace's real problems began when she took the job of
representing the estate of a Santa Monica retiree, Max Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Days after Wolf died, Wallace moved $206,000 of his money into a
trust account that she controlled, using checks with forged
signatures, according to state bar records and a civil lawsuit. She
then wrote 16 checks on the account, most of them payable to cash,
those records show. At her disciplinary hearing, Wallace said she had
not known Wolf was dead when she was duped into authorizing the
payments by someone who impersonated him.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace pleaded no contest in State Bar Court in 1998 to seven
counts of professional misconduct, including mishandling the money.
She was suspended from the bar for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Her troubles mounted that year. Wallace was ordered to spend five
days in jail and was fined $1,000 for perpetual tardiness in court.
And an adversary alleged in court documents that a Wallace associate
threatened to kill him if he didn't end a protracted dispute with her
over referral fees.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Wallace met Howard Byrdsong at his mother's funeral
and offered to help him settle her estate, according to court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Byrdsong's mother, Shiree Arrant, was a Los Angeles police officer
who died of a brain tumor. A single parent, she left her estate to
Howard Byrdsong, her oldest son; it included a $380,000 life
insurance policy and her house.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, Wallace received the insurance check and opened an
account in Byrdsong's name using a forged power of attorney,
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald E. Goudy of the office's
organized crime division.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Wallace then wrote a number of
unauthorized checks on the account, making them out to herself, cash,
her law firm and others, including New York attorneys Edward Panzer
and Bruce Cutler.</TE>
<TE>   Cutler, who gained fame representing New York Mafia boss John
Gotti, said Wallace's $40,000 check helped pay for the defense of
Wallace's friend, Darron Bennett, a Los Angeles-area resident who was
acquitted on cocaine charges in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that by February 2001, Wallace--who had filed for
bankruptcy in 1998 and would do so again later that year--had already
spent most of Howard Byrdsong's insurance money.</TE>
<TE>   Byrdsong complained to prosecutors, who opened an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Wallace tried to strike a deal with Byrdsong, 20, and
his younger brother, Jontrae, 18, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   An emissary allegedly sent by Wallace met with them first. He
offered to pay the Byrdsongs $125,000, plus $143,000 if Howard
Byrdsong withdrew his allegations, according to the criminal
complaint. About a week later, Wallace herself urged them to take the
deal, prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   On May 7, Marina del Rey resident Timothy Mack, allegedly posing
as a bank representative, urged Howard Byrdsong to sign a $125,000
settlement that would release Wallace from all liability, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Byrdsong rejected the offer. A month later, on June 6, 2001, the
Byrdsong brothers were fatally shot in a home in Inglewood by a man
dressed as a postal worker.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace has been free on $150,000 bond since her arrest in
February on charges of forgery, perjury and embezzlement from the
Byrdsong estate. She pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace has denied any financial wrongdoing or any role in the
slayings, although Inglewood police say she remains a suspect in the
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the boys," she said outside a Los Angeles courtroom
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Milton Grimes, said his client is innocent of all
charges. He said the Byrdsongs owed Wallace $111,000 for money the
family borrowed. Wallace, he said, was willing to pay them the
difference of about $268,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who has pleaded not guilty to grand theft and perjury in the
case, denied in a jailhouse interview that he told the Byrdsongs he
worked for a bank. He said he merely dropped off documents at
Wallace's request, and that he received no money from the Byrdsong
trust account.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why they arrested me," said Mack, 46. "They
have nothing on me."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who has been held in the Men's Central Jail since his Feb. 5
arrest, faces up to six years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Leah Wallace said her family stands by her younger sister. She
said she believes Angela Wallace will be exonerated and referred
questions about the criminal case to Grimes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a woman with an awesome heart, and she is very, very
kind," Leah Wallace said. "Her whole life as an attorney has been
helping people to the detriment of herself."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace surrendered her license to practice law in May 2001, amid
more allegations of misconduct, including misappropriation of client
funds and failure to notify clients of her suspension. Some $28,000
in restitution was paid to eight of her victims last year through the
state bar's client security fund.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who faces trial later this year, still has some prominent
supporters. One is L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden, who has known
Wallace since she was an undergraduate at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "She's super smart, super hard-working. She could run for
president," Holden said. "It would be a damn shame for her to come
this far and stumble and fall."</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   The Angels trailed, 5-3, in the seventh, and a Game 6 appeared
likely. Adam Kennedy came to the plate with runners on first and
second, failed to bunt them over, then hit a three-run homer to
right. The Angels scored seven more times. If Kennedy had bunted
successfully, who knows what might have happened?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to really put the hammer to the Twins and put the
game out of reach, Alex Ochoa struck out looking on a 2-and-2 pitch
with two on and two out in the seventh inning, leaving the Angels
clinging to a 13-5 lead over the Twins. Just kidding, Alex. It's
tough to find a big letdown in a game like this.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN THE BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy became the fifth player to hit three home runs in a
postseason game, joining an illustrious group. The others: Babe Ruth
(1926 and 1928 World Series), Reggie Jackson (1977 World Series),
George Brett (1978 ALCS) and Bob Robertson (1971 NLCS).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   Gene Autry died in 1998, and had not had much to do with the
day-to-day activities of the Angels since selling part of the club to
Disney in 1996. But several signs in the stands Sunday paid tribute
to Autry. It was always his dream to see his team in the World
Series. It was nice of the fans to remember him.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Is Paying Off Regardless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds is unavoidable, and yet he's meaningless. He's the focal
point of the opposition, the fans and the media, but sometimes he's
nothing more than a chess piece getting moved around the board.</LD>
<LD>   The deeper the San Francisco Giants move into the postseason, the
less their fate rests in Bonds' hands. His reputation and potential
have more to do with the Giants moving to within one victory of the
World Series than his statistics.</LD>
<LD>   How unimportant are his numbers to the Giants? After the fifth and
sixth hitters, Benito Santiago and J.T. Snow drove in all the runs in
the Giants' 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday night,
San Francisco is 5-0 in the postseason games in which Bonds did not
hit a home run, 1-3 when he did homer.</LD>
<TE>   It takes the batters ahead of him reaching base for him to get a
chance to do damage, and it's up to the guys behind him to come
through after the many times when Bonds isn't allowed to swing the
bat. Otherwise, all he can do is trot down to first base and stand
there.</TE>
<TE>   If Bonds continues to hit the ball well it will only better his
postseason stats, caulking the cracks in an otherwise outstanding
career.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he isn't content to rest on his records and acclaim as the
game's greatest hitter. But they've already served their purpose.
They dictate how the Cardinals will play him. For two consecutive
games, St. Louis Manager Tony LaRussa has demonstrated that he's
willing to break from conventional wisdom and intentionally walk
Bonds even when he represents the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   Great as Bonds might be, he can't score from first base without
help.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Snow and Santiago came in. Snow hit a long drive that
bounced off a the wall in left center for a double that drove in two
and tied the score, 2-2, in the bottom of the sixth inning. Bonds,
standing on first after a walk, provided the rare sight of a
baserunner breaking into a home run trot before he saw where Snow's
ball landed and revved up the motor to score.</TE>
<TE>   After Bonds was intentionally walked with two out and nobody on in
the eighth, Santiago launched a ball high into the night that landed
in the left-field seats for the go-ahead home run. They held up to
give the Giants a 3-1 lead in the National League championship
series, even though closer Robb Nen gave up a run in a shaky ninth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   When Bonds hit a game-tying, three-run homer into San Francisco
Bay in Game 3 on Saturday, it turned out to be nothing more than a
soggy souvenir after the Cardinals' Eli Marrero came back with a solo
home run to give St. Louis a 5-4 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds had only one harmless single in four trips to the plate
Sunday, but he scored two runs thanks to Snow and Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, they spend a lot of their attention and
time on Barry and what to do with him," Snow said. "You put him on
first base, we like it. We like hitting with a guy on base. We like
getting the pitcher in the stretch. Barry can steal a base, he can
score on a ball in the gap. So there's a lot of positives that can
happen with pitching around him."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago has even come to find the positive in what could be
considered a slap in the face: intentionally walking Bonds to get to
him over and over again. He said he takes solace in Manager Dusty
Baker's advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been loosening me up out there and told me not to try to do
too much," Santiago said.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Bonds was intentionally walked only once Sunday. But
you might as well have called Bonds' sixth-inning walk intentional as
well because Bonds saw four consecutive balls, none coming close to
the plate</TE>
<TE>   It worked temporarily, because Santiago struck out in the sixth.
But then Snow doubled. And when Santiago got another chance two
innings later, he came through.</TE>
<TE>   He looked for the same pitch -- an inside fastball -- St. Louis
reliever Rick White used to strike him out in the sixth and drove it
into the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Baker doesn't expect the opposition -- be it LaRussa or
potentially his old buddy Mike Scioscia of the Angels -- to change
their approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they will still put him on," Baker said. "He's hit 600
and whatever home runs."</TE>
<TE>   He turned to Santiago on the news conference dais.</TE>
<TE>   "How many home runs you got, Benny?"</TE>
<TE>   "I got 201," Santiago said, which is true only if you count Sunday
night's.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Baker said. "You guys do the math."</TE>
<TE>   You could add in Snow's 159 career homers and it still wouldn't
come close to Bonds' 613.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's why Bonds handicaps his batting practice home run
competition and takes on Santiago and Snow. Santiago said they win
sometimes, but they were overmatched Sunday. Bonds hit blasts all
over Pacific Bell Park. He hit one to center that hit the top of a
shed and bounced off a wall that's nearly 490 feet from home plate.
He hit another one that dinged a flag pole high above the 421 mark in
right center. He hit a few that splashed into McCovey Cove beyond
right field.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds won, 9-8. Then he savored the spoils of victory and
commanded the losers to gather all the stray balls around the cage.</TE>
<TE>   "Pick it up!" Bonds said. "Pick that ... up! Pick it up!"</TE>
<TE>   Snow and Santiago did as they were told ... then went right on
picking up for Bonds and the Giants through the rest of the night.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES</KH>
<HD>The Molinas Are Brothers in Arms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Mike DiGiovanna and Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the postgame celebration in front of the Angel dugout Sunday
afternoon, the catching Molina brothers, Bengie and Jose, locked arms
and somehow found time and space to pose for a picture.</LD>
<LD>   That shot will have to be worth a thousand words, because the
Molinas couldn't come up with enough of their own to describe the
feeling surrounding the Kodak moment.</LD>
<LD>   "There's not enough words to explain it," said Bengie Molina, who
had a single during the Angels' 10-run seventh inning. "We go way
back as kids in Puerto Rico, dreaming about going to the World
Series. This is awesome. I'm so glad he's here with me. We always
wanted to be part of a championship."</LD>
<TE>   Not only was Jose, the Angels' backup catcher, part of the
championship, he got to catch the final two innings Sunday, leaping
three or four times in the air before Tom Prince's game-ending pop-up
landed in shortstop David Eckstein's glove.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago I was without a job, and the Angels gave me a
chance," Jose said. "Look at where I am now, going to the World
Series. That's amazing. And going there with my brother makes it that
much better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel ace Jarrod Washburn will start the first game of the World
Series, Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be the biggest game of my life," said Washburn, who
pitched seven strong innings Friday in the Angels' 2-1 Game 3 victory
over the Twins. "Two days ago, that was the biggest game of my life.
Now there's a bigger one."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to use Washburn, Ramon Ortiz, Kevin Appier and
John Lackey as their starters in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like many in the Angel clubhouse Sunday, Scott Spiezio, who tied a
postseason record with two hits in the seventh inning, was armed with
a bottle of champagne, but he wasn't looking for a teammate to douse.</TE>
<TE>   He was looking for his father, Ed, a utility player for the St.
Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox from 1964-72
and winner of World Series championships with St. Louis in 1964 and
'67.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not satisfied with getting to the World Series--we want to
win it," Spiezio said. "My dad has two World Series rings, and I want
one badly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Francisco Rodriguez, the 20-year-old wunderkind who
had struck out 15 batters in 9 1/3 previous playoff innings, showed
he was human Sunday. Replacing Brendan Donnelly with the bases loaded
and one out in the seventh inning, the flame-throwing right-hander
couldn't hold a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to throw his nasty slider for strikes, Rodriguez walked
pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty to force in the tying run, threw a wild
pitch that enabled the Twins to score the go-ahead run and
surrendered a sacrifice fly to Jacque Jones that gave Minnesota a
temporary 5-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, however, was credited with the victory after the Angels
rallied in the bottom of the seventh, improving his playoff record to
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to be too perfect and bounced a couple balls in the
dirt," Rodriguez said. "You never expect to win a game when you come
out of the bullpen. I guess I've been in the right place at the right
time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder and No. 3 batter Tim Salmon had been hitless in 10
championship series at-bats before singling three times Sunday. "I
thought for us to win I'd have to be a big part of it offensively,"
Salmon said. "But I did nothing this whole series, and here I am
celebrating. That says a lot about this team. We all pick each other
up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The happiest fan at Edison Field Sunday might have been Anaheim
Mayor Tom Daly. It doesn't do much for a city's sports reputation
when the Rams leave town, the Mighty Ducks have the worst attendance
in the NHL and the Angels plod along through the decades without
winning.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels celebrated their World Series berth, Daly pointed
out that Los Angeles Mayor Jim Hahn had attended Saturday's game--and
worn an Angel cap for part of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "This is big for Anaheim. And the Dodgers have been struggling, so
it's extra special for us," Daly said. "Maybe for the first time in
Angel history, we've got Southern California bragging rights."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy's 13 total bases Sunday were an ALCS record,
surpassing the previous high of 12 set by Kansas City's George Brett
in Game 3 of the 1978 ALCS against New York.... The Angels have hit
17 home runs this postseason, including a playoff-record 14 solo
homers.... The Angels scored 20 of their 28 runs in the ALCS in the
sixth inning or later. In the final three games, 18 of the Angels' 22
runs came in the seventh inning or later....   Cleveland General
Manager Mark Shapiro might ask for permission to interview Angel
pitching coach Bud Black this week for the Indians' managerial
vacancy. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Shapiro has
narrowed his choices to Black, minor league manager Eric Wedge and
Joel Skinner, the Indians' interim manager.</TE>

<HD>When the Hits Just Kept Coming</HD>
<DH>Maddon's "our guys absolutely feed off each other" belief
perhaps best describes record-setting seventh inning featuring 10
runs and 10 hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only way bench coach Joe Maddon can explain the Angels' 10-run,
10-hit, 15-batter, 15-minute, 917-high-five,
scream-until-your-voice-is-hoarse, record-setting seventh inning
Sunday is that "our guys absolutely feed off each other."</LD>
<LD>   If that's the case, it's a wonder there was anything left of the
Angels but flesh and bones after their piranha-like frenzy in the
seventh, when they obliterated a two-run deficit with a league
championship series-record 10-spot en route to an American League
pennant-clinching 13-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got to see their faces, the looks in their eyes," Maddon
said of the relentless Angels, who tied a postseason record for runs
in an inning, set by the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics and the 1968
Detroit Tigers.</LD>
<TE>   "You see a determination. It's, 'I can do this, I believe, yes we
can,' all those things. There's no 'I' in this club. I know that's a
cliche, but it's true. It's what every coach wants to get from a
group. It's an absolute blast."</TE>
<TE>   It was a blast from the not-too-distant past. Only eight days
before Sunday, in Game 4 of the division series against New York, the
Angels stunned the Yankees with an eight-run, 10-hit fifth inning, in
which they sent 13 batters to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels took it to another level Sunday, ascending to
seventh heaven, with Adam Kennedy's dramatic three-run home run
highlighting an explosive inning that vaulted them to their first
World Series berth in the 42-year star-crossed history of the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our guys wanted the inning to be over," said Angel
batting instructor Mickey Hatcher, whose rally cap went haywire in
the seventh. "We just kept hitting and hitting ... even our clubhouse
guys wanted to go up there and hit."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins had scored three runs in the top of the seventh,
knocking the bullet-proof vest off Angel phenom Francisco Rodriguez,
who walked in the tying run, allowed the go-ahead run to score on a
wild pitch and another to score on a sacrifice fly, as Minnesota took
a 5-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott Spiezio led off the bottom of the seventh with a single
to right-center off left-handed reliever Johan Santana, and Bengie
Molina slapped a full-count pitch to left for a single.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Kennedy, who had homered in the third and fifth innings
but bunted the first pitch foul against Santana. Manager Mike
Scioscia took off the bunt and Kennedy fouled off two more pitches
before hammering an 0-and-2 pitch over the wall in right-center for
his third home run and a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, it turned out, were just getting warmed up.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein greeted reliever LaTroy Hawkins with an infield
single, Darin Erstad singled to left-center, and Tim Salmon singled
to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire summoned left-hander J.C. Romero to
face the left-handed-hitting Garret Anderson, who drew a walk to
force in a run for a 7-5 lead. Troy Glaus struck out, but Shawn
Wooten lined an RBI single to right for an 8-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ochoa, who replaced Salmon as a pinch-runner, scored on
Romero's wild pitch for a 9-5 lead, and Spiezio, who has a
team-leading 11 RBIs in the postseason, lined a two-run single to
left-center to make it 11-5.</TE>
<TE>   Romero was pulled for Bob Wells, and Chone Figgins, who had run
for Molina earlier in the inning, singled to left. Kennedy singled to
left to load the bases, Eckstein was hit by a pitch to force in a
run, and Erstad's RBI groundout made it 13-5.</TE>
<TE>   The mercy rule was not in effect, but the inning finally ended
with Ochoa's strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to keep pushing runs across because you can never get
enough," Salmon said. "A.K. came up with the big hit to put us up,
but we wanted to keep adding nails to the coffin. It was awesome
watching all those runs cross the plate, because we could really
relax and start thinking about clinching this thing at home."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hit .290 with runners in scoring position during the
season, so it wasn't shocking that they had five hits with runners in
scoring position in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't always expect that to happen," Scioscia said of the
barrage. "But I wouldn't put anything past this group."</TE>
<TE>   Neither could the Twin pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's a battler on this team, no one's a quitter," Molina
said. "No one wants to make the last out."</TE>

<HD>Mare's Kick Gives Dolphins Slim Victory</HD>
<DH>His 53-yard field goal with six seconds remaining gives
Miami a 24-22 win over Denver and a two-game lead in the AFC East.
Fielder is injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DENVER -- Miami's Olindo Mare met with Denver's Jason Elam at
midfield before Sunday's AFC showdown, and the two kickers held a
can-you-top-this contest. First, they boomed field goals from 60
yards, then 63, then 65. What looked to be an absurd exercise in
bravado turned out to be a worthwhile experiment.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the wildest finishes of the NFL season, Elam kicked a
go-ahead 55-yard field goal with 45 seconds remaining, setting the
stage for a game-winning 53-yarder by Mare with six seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-22 victory gave the 5-1 Dolphins a two-game lead in the AFC
East, but the team also suffered a significant loss: quarterback Jay
Fiedler sustained a broken right thumb on the second-to-last series
and will be out indefinitely. Ray Lucas will replace him.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the injury, Fiedler moved the Dolphins 39 yards in five
plays -- using only 39 seconds -- to set up the winning field goal.
He connected with tight end Randy McMichael for a 17-yard gain on
third and 10, then threaded a 22-yard pass to Dedric Ward to silence
the packed house at Invesco Field.</TE>
<TE>   The next play was sweet redemption for Mare, who had missed four
field-goal attempts in five games, including a 48-yarder Sunday. So
confident was Mare that his winning kick was true, he turned, raised
his arms and sprinted the other way as it sailed through the
uprights. "I don't even know if I saw it go through," he said. "I was
kind of excited."</TE>
<TE>   That goes double for his teammates, considering the Dolphins
matched Oakland for the league's best record. The Broncos (4-2)
dropped their sixth consecutive regular-season game to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of opportunities in that game and we gave them
away," Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan said. "Early in the game, we didn't
take advantage of those opportunities, and it came back to haunt us."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos had a 12-7 lead after three quarters, but were unable
to hang on after two Brian Griese passes were intercepted in the
fourth. Both of those miscues led to touchdowns -- one directly, when
Patrick Surtain picked off a pass and weaved his way 40 yards into
the end zone to give the Dolphins a 21-12 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the quarter, Miami's Sam Madison intercepted a pass and
tore off a 15-yard return. That drive ended with a two-yard touchdown
by Ricky Williams, his second of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 21-12, the Broncos responded with an 11-play, 80-yard
drive that Griese culminated with a one-yard touchdown pass to Mike
Anderson. That put them within a field goal of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Denver's No. 2-ranked rushing defense, which has allowed only
Baltimore's Jermaine Lewis to run for more than 50 yards this season,
limited Williams to a season-low 49 yards in 20 carries. But Williams
did his damage, scoring touchdowns of 10 and two yards.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we didn't get frustrated and we just kept after it,
things just started to open up for us in the fourth quarter," said
Williams, who has rushed for more 100 yards four times this season.</TE>
<TE>   Williams acknowledged the mood changed among the Miami players in
the second quarter, when Denver safety Kenoy Kennedy knocked receiver
Chris Chambers cold with a helmet-to-helmet hit. It was the third
time this season Kennedy has landed an illegal blow -- the first two
coming against Isaac Bruce of St. Louis and Fred McCrary of San Diego
-- and there is a good possibility the league will suspend him for at
least a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It got our guys fired up," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like when guys do our players like that."</TE>
<TE>   Dolphin guard Jamie Nails was more forceful in his condemnation,
not only of Kennedy's hit but of linebacker Al Wilson's tendency to
take a roundhouse swing at Williams from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   "They were doing some cheap things," Nails said. "The
helmet-to-helmet thing was cheap; I was pretty hot about that. But
the entire game we didn't stoop to that. They were doing a lot of
stuff out there that is not football."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the Dolphins won an important game before a national
TV audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big to come on the road and play like we did today, beat a
good team in a tough place to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That says a lot for our character. Everyone knows how well we
play at home. But I think it's great to come on the road and get a
win like this."</TE>

<KH>TAMPA BAY 17, CLEVELAND 3</KH>
<HD>Alstott, Buccaneers Too Hot to Handle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were up 10 points on a hot, muggy afternoon,
making Sunday the ideal time to unleash Mike Alstott on a tiring
Cleveland defense.</LD>
<LD>   The five-time Pro Bowl fullback, frustrated by a diminished role
in Coach Jon Gruden's offense, broke tackle after tackle in running
for all but five of his 126 yards in the final 17 minutes of a 17-3
victory over the Browns.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a good, hot day. They had been wearing down all day
long," Buccaneer defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. "Turn the 'Train'
loose on them. Mike loves that type of environment because there
ain't a lot of tackling going on. He can just bounce around, like a
bowling ball."</LD>
<TE>   The Buccaneers' defense extended its streak of consecutive games
without allowing a touchdown to three. Sapp led the way, sacking Tim
Couch twice and forcing the Cleveland quarterback to hurry numerous
throws.</TE>
<TE>   But as well as the defense played, the emergence of Alstott was
just as important.</TE>
<TE>   Alstott made the most of his opportunities after Gruden sensed the
Browns were wearing down in the 85-degree heat. Alstott gained 83 of
his yards in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was getting frustrating, I'm not going to lie. You just want
to be a part of it," said Alstott, who ran a season-high 17 times.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (5-1) won its fifth consecutive game to match the team's
best start after six games. The Buccaneers also began 5-1 in 1979 and
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns (2-4) avoided a shutout with Phil Dawson's 50-yard
field goal with 11:45 left.</TE>
<TE>   Alstott, the first Tampa Bay runner to rush for 100 yards this
season, accounted for all the yardage on a five-play, 55-yard drive,
which he finished with a 17-yard touchdown run on the first play of
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been their M.O.," Brown Coach Butch Davis said. "They get
a lead and they just grind you and pound you."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers' defense hasn't given up a touchdown since the
fourth quarter of a 26-14 victory over St. Louis on Sept. 23. The
unit failed to score on its own for the first time in five games, but
the offense didn't need the help, thanks to Alstott running at will
in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Couch was 20 for 40 for 151 yards. He was sacked twice and
intercepted once.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Johnson was 15 for 32 for 194 yards and no interceptions for
Tampa Bay.</TE>

<KH>SAN DIEGO 35, KANSAS CITY 34</KH>
<HD>Chargers Finally Get a Grip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Drew Brees had absolutely no doubt the San Diego Chargers were going
to beat the Kansas City Chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   "Seriously," Brees said with a laugh after the Chargers' 35-34
victory Sunday, when they committed five turnovers and had a punt
blocked, yet came back to win when Brees threw a two-yard touchdown
pass to rookie Reche Caldwell with 14 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   "I think as many times as we shot ourselves in the foot, to have a
chance at the end to win the game, you've got to think there's some
kind of destiny involved, some kind of fate," said Brees, who had two
passes intercepted, then threw two touchdown passes in the final
8:06.</LD>
<TE>   The victory wasn't secured until Charger linebacker Donnie Edwards
-- cut by the Chiefs in March in a salary-cap move -- intercepted
Trent Green's desperation pass at the San Diego two-yard line as time
expired.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (5-1) trailed, 24-14, entering the fourth quarter,
before scoring three touchdowns to beat the Chiefs (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   Out of timeouts with 2:24 to play, Brees led the Chargers 71
yards, completing six of seven passes. Caldwell caught the go-ahead
touchdown pass by beating cornerback Eric Warfield, who earlier had
an interception and recovered a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   While receiver Curtis Conway drew double coverage, Caldwell drew
man-to-man coverage. He acted as if he was running a fade route, then
stopped, with Warfield running past him. Brees threw a perfect pass,
and after making the catch, Caldwell pumped his fist in celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't drop it. He hit me right in the chest," said Caldwell,
a third-round pick out of Florida whose touchdown was his first in
the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs inadvertently helped the Chargers when they called a
timeout with 19 seconds left and the Chargers facing third and one at
the two. The Chiefs saw 12 players in the Charger huddle, which the
referees didn't see.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what defense to call, so we were forced to call
time out," Chief Coach Dick Vermeil said.</TE>
<TE>   Brees was 28 for 41 for 319 yards with two touchdowns. Conway, who
had two fumbles, had eight catches for 129 yards. LaDainian Tomlinson
ran 20 times for 78 yards and caught nine passes for 78 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Green was 17 of 29 for 236 yards with three touchdowns and two
interceptions. Priest Holmes was limited to 63 yards rushing in 23
carries, but had seven catches for 96 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Charger Pro Bowl linebacker Junior Seau started after sitting out
last week's loss at Denver because of a sprained ankle, but left
early in the third quarter because of a foot injury.</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi's Knee Needs More Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Olowokandi has been told to take at least two more weeks off
before testing his sore left knee, which could jeopardize his
availability for the start of the season Oct. 30 against the
Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very hopeful I'll be there for the first game," he said
before the Clippers' beat the Memphis Grizzlies, 106-96, in an
exhibition at Staples Center on Sunday night. "I've lost a half an
inch of muscle [in his leg].... I'm confident it's something I can
work with.... It's better to treat it before the season starts rather
than during the 82-game schedule."</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi said he injured his knee while working out during the
off-season.</LD>
<TE>   "That's all I did," he said. "I prepared for this season. I hardly
took any time off.... I felt a little discomfort. Once training camp
started, I thought I could fight it off."</TE>
<TE>   The pain became too much to ignore, however.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam indicated Olowokandi was suffering from bruised
cartilage. He has been resting the knee and taking anti-inflammatory
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi, power forward Elton Brand, top reserve Quentin
Richardson, backup point guard Keyon Dooling, small forward Lamar
Odom and first-round draft picks Melvin Ely and Chris Wilcox could
not play against the Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Brand's status for the opener is uncertain after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26, although he shot
baskets for the second consecutive day.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson has a sprained right knee, Dooling and Odom sprained
ankles. Ely has tendinitis in his left big toe and Wilcox a strained
right quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play healthy guys," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We're not
going to have anyone out there who's going to injure themselves
[further]. We've got eight months of basketball, if we're lucky,
ahead of us. Our whole thing is to get them healthy to the point
where they can go out and play at a high level."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry started guards Andre Miller and Eric Piatkowski,  center
Sean Rooks and forwards Corey Maggette and Cherokee Parks against the
Grizzlies. It was the same lineup Gentry used in Friday's
double-overtime win over the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers waived free agents Jason Crowe and James Head and
signed Larry Reid, Bennett Davison and Eric Chenowith, bringing the
training camp roster to 20 players. The SuperSonics on Wednesday
waived Chenowith, a 7-foot-1 center from Villa Park High and
Kansas.... The Clippers decided against returning to the College of
the Desert during the week between their final exhibition game and
the season opener. They will hold a mini-camp Oct. 24-29 at their
practice facility at L.A. Southwest College.</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 22, BALTIMORE 20</KH>
<HD>Vanderjagt Gets Kicks In for Colts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Mike Vanderjagt didn't think he had been kicking properly all season.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, he got it right. Five times.</LD>
<LD>   Vanderjagt's career high was capped by a 38-yard game-winner that
completed Indianapolis' last-minute rally for a 22-20 victory over
Baltimore.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't been real confident all year, but on Wednesday, I
kicked some field goals and kind of realized what I was doing wrong,"
Vanderjagt said. "To learn on Wednesday is a good time, because today
I had a lot more confidence."</TE>
<TE>   There were no signs of Vanderjagt's concern before Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He was still the league's most accurate kicker despite going five
for seven in the Colts' first four games.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Ravens (2-3) forced him to nearly match that total in
four quarters, the Colts (4-1) never doubted Vanderjagt would come
through.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells me all the time that he's the most accurate kicker in
the history of the league, so just get him close and he'll put it
through," Coach Tony Dungy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts relied on Vanderjagt, and he produced with field goals
of 39, 50, 43 and 25 yards before making the game-winner, and on a
defense that proved nearly as formidable as Baltimore's. Indianapolis
forced seven fumbles, recovering two.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore, playing without All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis for the
first time in 64 regular-season games, held Edgerrin James to a
career-low 43 yards in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a defensive mistake that gave quarterback Peyton
Manning a chance to complete the comeback.</TE>
<TE>   With a little more than a minute left and Indianapolis facing
fourth and 10, Baltimore chased Manning from the pocket. He lobbed an
errant pass for Qadry Ismail. When Ismail jumped for the ball,
cornerback Gary Baxter plowed into him, drawing a 22-yard pass
interference that put Indianapolis at the Baltimore 42.</TE>
<TE>   It took Manning five more plays to put Vanderjagt in position for
the winning kick, giving the Colts their third victory in a row.</TE>

<KH>DALLAS 14, CAROLINA 13</KH>
<HD>Carter Knows Rallies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>If Quincy Carter could play the first 55 minutes the way he plays the
last five, the Dallas Cowboys might be better than .500.</LD>
<LD>   But their games wouldn't be as interesting.</LD>
<LD>   Carter led Dallas to a dramatic win for the second time in three
weeks, turning a 13-0 deficit to the Carolina Panthers into a 14-13
victory by throwing an 80-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway with
3:55 left, then a 24-yarder to Antonio Bryant with 56 seconds to go.</LD>
<TE>   "This is one of the craziest wins I've ever been involved in,"
Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina not only lost but also had to play the second half
without quarterback Rodney Peete, who suffered a concussion after
being hit while completing a pass on the final play of the first
half. Coach John Fox said Peete would have an MRI exam today. Chris
Weinke took over and completed seven of 12 passes for 114 yards.
Peete was nine for 15 for 84 yards.</TE>
<TE>   For Dallas, Carter started showing his comeback skills two games
ago, when he directed a last-minute drive that led to the
game-winning field goal against St. Louis. He almost did it again
last week against the New York Giants, but he overthrew Bryant on a
deep ball.</TE>
<TE>   This time, on his 25th birthday, Carter got the Cowboys (3-3) in a
hole by committing two turnovers and making few good throws. Fans
booed and nearly half of Texas Stadium emptied as Dallas appeared
headed to their first home shutout in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Then Carter started clicking. After completing nine of 22 passes
for 77 yards over the first 55 minutes, he was six of 10 for 148
yards on the final two drives. The Galloway touchdown was the longest
pass of Carter's career, and it stretched his streak of consecutive
200-yard passing games to five.</TE>
<TE>   To pull it out, he had to be as lucky as he was good. On
Galloway's touchdown, Carter scrambled out of a sack and steadied
himself with his free hand. The pass was nearly intercepted by Deon
Grant, but instead he deflected it -- right to Galloway.</TE>
<TE>   On the game-winning drive, Carolina (3-3) thought it had recovered
a Carter fumble, but replay officials called it an incompletion,
citing the same "tuck rule" that saved the New England Patriots in
last season's playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Give the Gift of Goal</HD>
<DH>As if the Red Wings needed any help, Oates shoots puck into
his own net and Anaheim loses home opener, 4-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was more of a red-faced than red-letter day on the east side of
the 57 Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's professional sports teams certainly had their ups and
downs Sunday. Across the way, the Angels were celebrating their first
World Series appearance. At the Arrowhead Pond, the Mighty Ducks were
having a performance that left them with a shade of crimson, after
handing out goals like they were promotional giveaways in a 4-2 loss
to the Detroit Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   The loss snapped the Ducks' five-game unbeaten streak in home
openers (4-0-1). And this, technically, qualified as home game, even
with the legions of Red Wing fans in attendance. No matter who the
17,174 at the Pond were rooting for, they got an eyeful when Adam
Oates sent a 194-foot shot up the ice and into his team's empty net
to give the Red Wings a 3-0 lead.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, that was merely the grand prize in a game where the Ducks
couldn't hand the puck over fast enough in key situations.</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much hit it dead center," Oates said. "I've never done
that one before."</TE>
<TE>   After 17 seasons in the NHL, Oates has very few "firsts" left in
his career. This one he could have lived without.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings were leading, 2-0, and the team's were skating
four-on-four. Brendan Shanahan was about to be called for a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere headed for the bench to get a
man advantage. The puck deflected off Shanahan's skate into the
corner. Oates sent a pass to defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski at the blue
line.Only Vishnevski was heading to the Duck bench to get another
offensive-skilled player on the ice. The only thing that was going to
stop the puck was an act of God.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched it go the whole way," Oates said.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, it was a power play, as the Red Wings' Mathieu
Dandenault had just stepped back onto the ice, which just added to
the unusual moment.</TE>
<TE>   "No. No. A pretty standard [goal]," Shanahan said, then paused for
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you call it a goal that I scored? I'd call it a goal I got
credit for. I'm not going to refer to that one as one I scored. That
is going to make up for some night I hit the post."</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave the Red Wings their 3-0 lead at 19 minutes 30
seconds of the third period. That became more crucial when Paul
Kariya scored 24 seconds later and Ruslan Salei blasted in a
one-timer from the blue line five minutes into the third period to
make it 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad break against you, that's part of the game and you can
live with that," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said. "The others you can't.
You can't give a good team goals."</TE>
<TE>   The champagne was still flowing at Edison Field when the Ducks
turned the puck over at center ice, which led to Shanahan's first
goal, 43 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had the silver platter out again with the score 3-2.
Another turnover ended in disaster when Henrik Zetterberg chipped in
a rebound on a power play, giving the Red Wings a 4-2 lead 13:42 into
the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had their turns with the puck, including eight power
plays. They converted on only one. "On the power play, there are
times we are looking to pass the puck instead looking to shoot the
puck," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Ducks, there was one time Oates shot the
puck when he was actually passing it.</TE>

<LD>The Ducks juggled their lineup slightly, benching forward Dan Bylsma
in favor of Patrick Kjellberg.</LD>
<LD>   Kjellberg played 65 games for the Ducks last season, but was a
healthy scratch the first two games. Bylsma is one of the team's top
penalty killers.</LD>
<LD>   "The other night in Dallas, I thought we didn't have enough
forwards going," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I couldn't make the
changes I wanted to during the game. Patrick had a good camp and is
going to get an opportunity. If you're out [of the lineup], you
better be working hard every single day to get in. Once you're in, I
wouldn't be giving your job away."</LD>

<TE>   Michael Eisner has found his way into the professional sports wing
of the Disney empire, but has saved public comments only for the
World Series-bound Angels. Eisner has refused interview requests for
more than a year to talk about the Ducks' drop off, in play and
profit, in recent seasons. Repeated calls to Disney offices were not
returned this week.</TE>

<HD>Duck 'Joke' Since Becomes a Fond Memory for Hebert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time Guy Hebert heard Disney had named its new hockey team
the Mighty Ducks, after one of its movies, he laughed. "I thought it
was a joke," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Little did he know the team would become a box office and
commercial success -- and a huge part of his life.</LD>
<LD>   Hebert, a backup goaltender with the St. Louis Blues, was the
first player chosen by the Ducks in the 1993 NHL expansion draft and
played for them until he was claimed on waivers by the New York
Rangers in March 2001. He joined several teammates from the Ducks'
inaugural season for a reunion Sunday at the Pond, swapping stories
and chuckles before the Ducks played the first home game of their
10th season.</LD>
<TE>   "Ten years of my life have just flown by," said Hebert, who was
born in upstate New York and lives with his family in Newport Beach.
"I'm glad to say I was part of the team for eight of those years.
It's my 10th year of being out here, being a California guy.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of ups and downs for the team and the
organization, but 10 years for a franchise in any sport, you're still
really in the fledgling stage. They've taken some steps backward a
few years ago, but hopefully they're making up for it. I've stopped
by the rink a few times and the atmosphere is good."</TE>
<TE>   No one knew what to expect at first, least of all the players.
Hockey traditionalists warned that Disney would throw money at free
agents and buy the Stanley Cup, and pressure the NHL to adopt the
shootout proposal advocated by Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner.
Not so. Fiscally, Disney was -- and is -- conservative, and Eisner
did little beyond lead cheers and slap backs the first few seasons.</TE>
<TE>   And while purists mocked the team's name and marketing strategies,
Duck merchandise was the top seller in professional sports for
several years and the team filled at least 98.8% of its seats its
first five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The tone was set the first season. Devoid of scoring talent, the
Ducks were scrappy. Todd Ewen -- who had a team-high 272 penalty
minutes but illustrated children's books in his spare time -- and
strongman Stu "the Grim Reaper" Grimson (199 penalty minutes) were
cult heroes. Terry Yake, a small center taken from Hartford in the
expansion draft, led the team with 21 goals and 52 points. They made
opponents work for every inch of ice, which the fans loved.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my fondest memories was our very first game against
Detroit," Hebert said. "They were still putting things together and
there was no player parking and the guy at the arena was trying to
charge me $8 to park. I showed him my player pass but he didn't know
what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled in at 5 for a 7:30 game, and it was like a football
game. There were cookouts and people were drinking beer in the
parking lots. I was thinking, 'Oh my God, where am I?' It wasn't like
that in St. Louis."</TE>
<TE>   Captained by Troy Loney and led by the goaltending tandem of
Hebert and Ron Tugnutt, the Ducks earned a share of the record for
most victories by a first-year team (33) and set a record for a
first-year team with 19 road victories. Coach Ron Wilson refused to
use the term expansion team because he didn't want players to use the
team's newness as an excuse to lose. The psychology worked, leading
players to raise their standards.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a ton of fan support, and that certainly helped a young
team. It was exciting and Ron did a great job," said Hebert, who
earned the team's first shutout, a 1-0 victory at Toronto on Dec. 15,
1993. "We might not have had the best team, but he kept guys
motivated and made it fun. I don't care what kind of job you're in,
you have to have fun, and that was sorely missing around this team
the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks peaked in 1996-97, when they defeated Phoenix in their
first playoff series and took the Detroit Red Wings to overtime three
times before being swept in the second round. They made the playoffs
in 1998-99 but were swept by Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   By then, however, they were no longer a novelty. Their
competitive, hard-working character had been lost, and management
alienated fans by raising ticket prices every year. An ego battle
between Wilson and then-team president Tony Tavares led to Wilson's
firing after the 1996-97 season and set off a revolving door of
coaches and front-office executives. Attendance dwindled and the team
foundered.</TE>
<TE>   "The stumbling block came in the year Ron wasn't retained and they
got rid of five or six veteran players," Hebert said. "They took a
couple of steps back as a franchise and have really never recovered."</TE>
<TE>   Hebert said he deliberately stayed away while Pierre Gauthier was
the Ducks' general manager but has felt welcome since Gauthier was
fired and Bryan Murray took over. Hebert offered to help the Ducks
with community and promotional work and agreed to head the team's new
alumni association.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense I feel I didn't complete because I didn't accomplish
what I set out to do -- to win the Cup," Hebert said. "I've talked to
Paul [Kariya] and [Steve Rucchin] and they want to get this thing.
And if they do, I'll be on there, on the bandwagon, in the locker
room. Hopefully people will look at the team and see the positive
things that have gone on. They just need a shot of confidence."</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 17, NEW YORK GIANTS 10</KH>
<HD>No Vick Becomes No Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Doug Johnson made the Atlanta Falcons forget the absence of Michael
Vick in a game the New York Giants would simply like to forget.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in place of an injured Vick, Johnson ran for a touchdown
and threw a game-deciding 14-yard pass to Brian Finneran with 8:06
left in leading the Falcons to a 17-10 victory over the Giants on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He played great," Finneran said of Johnson, the third-year
quarterback out of Florida making only his third career start for the
Falcons (2-3). "He knew it was his team this week and he ran it."</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't great for the Giants (3-3). They gave away yet another
game with three major fourth-quarter mistakes. They lost veteran
defensive tackle Keith Hamilton for the season because of an
Achilles' injury. Defensive end Michael Strahan also played sparingly
after developing back spasms in the first quarter. The Giants' other
defensive end, Kenny Holmes, didn't play because of elbow injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We blew coverages. We let guys get open and we didn't cover
well," Giant Coach Jim Fassel said after watching Johnson complete 19
of 25 passes for 257 yards. "Their quarterback played a heck of a
game, but we made him look like he was ready for the Hall of Fame."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I had confidence before this game. What I got from
this game was experience. It was a huge."</TE>
<TE>   Falcon cornerback Juran Bolden prevented New York from taking the
lead early in the fourth quarter with an interception at the Falcon
six. Henry Jones forced a fumble that Kevin Mathis recovered at the
Atlanta 15 with 3:22 left with New York threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays after Bolden intercepted Kerry Collins, Johnson
connected with Shawn Jefferson on a 63-yard pass play that set up the
go-ahead touchdown. Giant cornerback Will Allen went for an
interception and missed.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, 20 for 31 for 207 yards, including an 18-yard
third-quarter touchdown pass to Ike Hilliard, moved the Giants into
position to tie the game in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth and three, Collins connected with Ron Dixon over the
middle despite having the ball snapped on the wrong count. Dixon
carried the ball to the Atlanta 17, but fumbled and Mathis recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like this was a game that we would win unless we shot
ourselves in the foot, and we obviously did that," Giant guard Dusty
Zeigler said.</TE>

<HD>A Special Win for Tataurangi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Tataurangi didn't know he was leading as he played the back nine
Sunday at the TPC at Summerlin in Las Vegas. He wasn't certain how
much money he made after winning for the first time on the PGA Tour.</LD>
<LD>   About the only thing Tataurangi was sure of was he was very happy
indeed.</LD>
<LD>   "It's out of my wildest dreams to have won," Tataurangi said after
shooting a 10-under-par 62 to win the Invensys Classic with a 90-hole
score of 330. "No way did I start out the day thinking I had a chance
to win."</LD>
<TE>   In a year of unlikely first-time winners, Tataurangi became the
latest, coming from five shots off the pace in a tournament that was
destined to be decided by a lot of birdies.</TE>
<TE>   Tataurangi made 10 of them in 18 holes, good enough to move past
David Duval, three-time Las Vegas winner Jim Furyk and others to win
his first tournament by a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty bizarre, isn't it?" Tataurangi said. "To beat the
players who were in the field this week is very special to me."</TE>
<TE>   The New Zealander posted his score of 29 under, then went out to
the driving range to wait nervously as Furyk, Stuart Appleby and Jeff
Sluman all missed birdie tries on the 18th hole that would have
forced a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Tataurangi played his entire round without looking at a
leaderboard, sticking to a game plan to try to shoot a 62. After he
did, he wasn't about to watch as his trio of pursuers had their
chances on the final hole.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he was presented the winner's check, he wasn't sure
just how big the payday was.</TE>
<TE>   "How much did I make?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, it was $900,000, more than he had won in his
entire career before this year. He's the 15th first-time winner this
year, breaking the record set in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The win not only secures his tour card for two years, but will
likely put him into next year's Masters after he moved to 33rd on the
money list.</TE>
<TE>   Appleby, who shot a 66, had the best chance to tie after nearly
making a hole-in-one on the 17th hole. But he missed a 10-footer for
birdie on the last hole that would have gotten him to 29 under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak birdied four of the last five holes to overtake Carin
Koch and defend her title in the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions
at Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Pak closed with a six-under 66, eagling the par-five fourth hole
and taking control with consecutive birdies on Nos. 14-17. She
finished with a four-stroke margin over Koch and Catriona Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   Pak, 25, finished with a tournament-record 20-under 268. She
earned $122,000 for her fourth victory of the year and 17th in five
full seasons on the LPGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam fell short in a bid for her 10th tour victory of
the year, three-putting for bogey on the 18th hole for a 70 to tie
for fourth--five strokes behind Pak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kite won his third title of the year on the Senior PGA Tour,
shooting an even-par 72 for a one-stroke victory in the Napa Valley
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Kite had a 12-under 204 total on the Silverado Resort's South
Course in Napa. He earned $195,000 to jump from sixth to fourth on
the money list with $1,570,147.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gibson (66) and Bruce Fleisher (67) tied for second. Jim
Thorpe shot a 69 to finish at 10 under.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Johar Is Second to None</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Richard Mandella's Sunday punch is getting to be a haymaker
at Santa Anita. A week ago Sunday, Mandella saddled two stakes
winners -- Pleasantly Perfect and The Tin Man -- and returned seven
days later to win the $150,000 Oak Tree Derby with Johar, a colt best
known for his runner-up finishes.</LD>
<LD>   Johar, ridden by Alex Solis for the Thoroughbred Corp., ended a
five-race losing streak in which he was second three times. Johar
beat Rock Opera by a nose as he ran 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:46,
breaking the 1:46 2/5 record set by No Slip last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I was worried, because the seconds were starting to pile up for
him," Solis said. "The longer distance is what he needed."</LD>
<TE>   Inesperado, who had been undefeated in three U.S. starts, joined a
long list of favorites--25 in the last 26 years--that have been
beaten in this stake. Ridden by substitute jockey Kent Desormeaux,
Inesperado was squeezed at the start when Sunkosi, the outside horse
in an eight-horse field, broke inward at the start.</TE>
<TE>   Inesperado gained position after that, but wound up fourth, behind
Mananan McLir, who was beaten by almost three lengths.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first stakes win for Johar, who had won a pair of
races -- against maidens and in allowance company -- at Santa Anita
last winter. Johar paid $7.80 as the third choice.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good horse," Mandella said, "and I think he'll really
prosper when they go a mile and a quarter. He should also be a good
older horse, because he's been very sound."</TE>
<TE>   With Rock Opera, Laffit Pincay just missed winning the stake for
the fifth time and in a fourth different decade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux rode Inesperado after Corey Nakatani suffered a
contusion to his back in a two-horse spill in the fifth race.</TE>
<TE>   Hero's Welcome, ridden by Garrett Gomez, broke down nearing the
far turn and Nakatani's trailing mount, Sing Because, stumbled.
Hero's Welcome was euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez took off the rest of the card.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Mel Stute is leaning toward running Buffythecenterfold in
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Arlington Park on Oct. 26.
Stute's filly ran second to Composure in the Oak Leaf at Santa
Anita.... Trainer Mike Smith, handling Humorous Lady for the first
time, shipped the filly to Belmont Park from Santa Anita and won the
$150,000 Astarita Stakes by a nose over Fast Cookie, with favored
Chimichurri third.</TE>

<HD>De La Salle Is Even Surprised by Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several weeks ago, Concord De La Salle High coaches and players
thought they had little chance to defeat Long Beach Poly, their new
rival from Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The Spartans were undefeated but had sputtered through a couple of
victories, including a 14-0 defeat of Mountain View St. Francis that
marked the fewest points De La Salle had scored during its
national-record winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   "The kids knew we weren't good enough after three weeks [of the
season]," Coach Bob Ladouceur said. "Nobody thought we could beat
these guys."</LD>
<TE>   Ladouceur's fears were quickly put to rest Saturday, when De La
Salle drove 72 yards on its opening series for a touchdown and a lead
it would never relinquish during a 28-7 victory over Poly at
California's Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Maurice Drew had a big game, as expected, finishing
with 161 yards in 19 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Equally impressive were quarterback Britt Cecil, who threw for his
first three touchdown passes of the season, and a defense that
limited Poly to a single touchdown, coming with three minutes left in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We set a goal of [holding Poly to] 14 points," defensive
coordinator Terry Eidson said. "We said, '14, we'll win the game.' "</TE>
<TE>   The effort, which extended De La Salle's winning streak to 130
games, prompted Ladouceur to call it the "greatest victory" in the
school's storied 23-year history.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids played well beyond expectations," he said. "Everything
good that happened, they worked for." For his part, Poly Coach Raul
Lara isn't overly concerned about a letdown when his Jackrabbits
(4-1) return to Moore League play this weekend. In fact, he said,
watching De La Salle run roughshod over his team may have its
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It inspires me to get to that level," Lara said. "Maybe one day."</TE>
<TE>   Lara said he is making sure his players keep the defeat in
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not lose or win a ring, we do not lose or win a
championship, and we need to understand that," he said. "I tell the
kids, 'Even if we won it, it still wouldn't mean anything if we
didn't win the rest of our games and the [Southern Section]
championship.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo extended the Southern Section's current longest
winning streak to 19 games with its 17-0 victory over Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The Diablos only need to win every regular season and playoff game
for the next seven years, then advance to the championship game of
the 2010 season to match De La Salle's current streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Few teams have had a more successful platoon system than Los
Alamitos, which rotated quarterbacks Justin Elway and Jeff Kline. But
Elway suffered a slight shoulder separation in the fourth quarter of
the 34-26 victory over Carson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so bad right now," said Coach John Barnes. "Hopefully,
he'll miss two weeks, max."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Covina Charter Oak, a Division VI team, has played three games
this season against Division II Sierra League teams, and the Chargers
have won them all.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Perri completed 16 of 19 passes for 189 yards and one
touchdown as Charter Oak beat Diamond Bar, 21-10, on Friday to hand
the Brahmas their first loss of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (4-1) put it away when Ricky Isidro returned an
interception 55 yards for the game's final score.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak also defeated La Verne Damien, 19-14, for the
Spartans' only loss of the season, and Glendora, 29-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park scored 55 points ... and lost.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Royal overcame a 23-point deficit in the second half
for a 58-55 Marmonte League victory on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very good offense and a very bad defense," Newbury Park
Coach George Hurley said. "We only have 25 players, so a lot of
things we do offensively are finesse things -- throw ball, score lot
of touchdowns -- but we don't play defense very well.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say our defense is offensive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the losing effort, Newbury Park quarterback Rudy Carpenter
completed 31 of 61 passes for 507 yards and six touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The 61 attempts is a Southern Section record, his 31 completions
is tied for eighth-best all-time (the record is 36) and his 507 yards
is the fifth-highest total in section history.</TE>
<TE>   Royal's Kyle Uebelhardt was no slouch himself, completing 22 of 51
passes for 456 yards and four touchdowns. His 51 attempts is
10th-best in section history.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Martin Henderson and Peter Yoon contributed to this
report.</TE>

<LD>Jockey Patrick Valenzuela, who had a narrow turf victory Saturday
with favored Rolly Polly in the Sen. Ken Maddy Handicap, has a
legitimate shot at winning all four of today's grass races on a
holiday card at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   In the second, a starter allowance at 1 1/2 miles, Valenzuela will
be on likely favorite Nates Colony, a proven stayer who has run well
at the distance before.</LD>
<LD>   In the fifth, Valenzuela will be aboard Kithira, a three-time
winner in France who drops out of Grade I company.</LD>
<TE>   Valenzuela's mount in the seventh, the second division of the
Ramser, is Nobilissime, a winner at the race's distance. Then, in the
ninth, Valenzuela will ride the Bobby Frankel-trained Six Hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Monrow, who has won five of seven on the Bay
Meadows turf course, heads a full field in today's seventh at that
track. The $35,000 optional claimer is at a mile on turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Rene Douglas. He is running away with another riding
title at Arlington Park. Heading into the long weekend, he had a
152-82 advantage over Elvis Trujillo.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Peter Wilson. The trainer, who has a string at Bay
Meadows, had only three wins from his first 49 starters this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Nates Colony in the
second, American Pastime in the third and using all in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/25. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $13/$152.40. Total money bet: $174.</TE>

<LD>The Kings have killed 11 of 12 penalties in their first two games,
ahead of their pace from last season, when they killed 86.6% to rank
third in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   "Probably the way we play, we'd better be prepared to kill five or
six a game," Coach Andy Murray said. "We play hard, and I think we're
going to take some penalties because of how hard we play.</LD>
<LD>   "Six is probably too many, but if we're going through the game
with one or two penalties, we probably haven't played hard enough."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy, whose salary jumped from $6 million last season to
$7.25 million this season, remains the Kings' highest-paid player.</TE>
<TE>   Ten other Kings will make at least $1 million this season: Jason
Allison, $5.5 million; Felix Potvin, $3.55 million; Mathieu
Schneider, $3.5 million; Adam Deadmarsh, $3 million; Mattias
Norstrom, $2.5 million; Bryan Smolinski, $2.3 million; Aaron Miller,
$1.7 million; Jamie Storr, $1.595 million; Erik Rasmussen, $1.1
million; and rookie Alexander Frolov, $1.075 million.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze, playing in the minors, is guaranteed $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest-paid King is Jaroslav Bednar, who will make $330,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palffy, sidelined for the last few minutes of Saturday night's 3-2
victory over the Detroit Red Wings after suffering a strained groin,
was treated Sunday and is expected to play Wednesday night against
the Mighty Ducks at the Arrowhead Pond, Murray said.... In their last
eight meetings with the Red Wings at Staples Center, the Kings have
outscored Detroit, 26-15, while posting a 7-0-1 record.... Miller,
sidelined until early November after abdominal surgery last month,
will begin skating with his teammates this week.... Including three
playoff games against the Colorado Avalanche last April, the Kings
have drawn 14 consecutive sellout crowds to Staples Center. Thursday
night's game against the Avalanche will make it 15.</TE>

<HD>Samake Becomes Player Favorite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soumaila Samake, the 7-footer from Mali, in northwest Africa, smiled
at Shaquille O'Neal's insistence that the 13th Laker, assuming there
is one, would be Samake.</LD>
<LD>   It was late Saturday night in Oklahoma City and Samake, having led
the Lakers in rebounding for a second consecutive exhibition game,
walked slowly through a concrete tunnel toward an idling bus.</LD>
<LD>   Teammates passed and jabbed at his arm. Samake peered down at them
and nodded. O'Neal's favorite has become theirs too, along with
Jannero Pargo, the spindly guard from Arkansas.</LD>
<TE>   The securing of roster spots in training camp often has little
regular-season bearing for the Lakers, who have their eight or nine
rotation players and then a handful of practice players, in all 12 on
guaranteed contracts in an era when NBA owners are bracing for the
dollar-for-dollar luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers carried 15 players two years ago and 13 last season and
are considering going with 12 this year, even with O'Neal unlikely to
be available when the season opens in a little more than two weeks.
Phil Jackson is asked about a 13th man, and he narrows his eyes and
says, "We'll see." The players are of a more-the-merrier spirit. They
believe Samake, 24, is the pure backup center they've lacked and
Pargo is the point guard who can push the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on what the league finances look like come next summer,
Jerry Buss could be $10 million into the luxury-tax bracket (with a
payroll of about $61 million), and he's certain to consider the
ramifications of another salary or two on top of that, no matter how
small.</TE>
<TE>   And so in that economic environment, Samake looked upon his
opportunity with a little curiosity. He may play well and there may
be no job. He may play well and have Jackson decide the greater need
is in the backcourt.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know what to tell you," he said in thick, measured
English. "I just try my best."</TE>
<TE>   Samake, who did not play college basketball, played last season in
Sicily. He played 34 games for the New Jersey Nets two seasons ago.
He is occasionally awkward but is heavy on potential, and Jackson
acknowledged after Samake's 10-point, 13-rebound game in Little Rock
that his talent was "intriguing."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been so-so," Samake said. "I want to be much better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the frontcourt possibilities swirl about him, as O'Neal
recovers from toe surgery and Mark Madsen takes treatment on his
hamstring and Slava Medvedenko's development plods and Samaki Walker
plays necessary minutes at center, Robert Horry floats through
another camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried," Horry said. "We'll know more in a couple of
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   In his last guaranteed season -- the Lakers hold a $5.3-million
option -- Horry might be forced to start at least until O'Neal
returns, which usually is against Jackson's better judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "You know me," Horry said, "I never have any desires. Whatever
happens for me, happens for me."</TE>

<HD>Fractured Kneecap Will Sideline McDyess</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another damaging blow to the New York Knicks, forward Antonio
McDyess will be sidelined indefinitely because of a fractured left
kneecap.</LD>
<LD>   The Knicks announced the news Sunday, a day after McDyess injured
the knee with 1:55 left in an exhibition game loss to the Phoenix
Suns.</LD>
<LD>   The injury was initially diagnosed as a hyperextension, but an MRI
exam revealed the fracture.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a devastating blow for Antonio, knowing how hard he has
worked up to this point," Knick President Scott Layden said. The
injury happened to the same knee that was operated on last season,
sidelining McDyess for all but 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   McDyess will get a second opinion, and a course of treatment will
then be determined. Layden said there was no damage to the patella
tendon repaired a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Our medical staff feels this is not a career-threatening injury,"
Layden said.</TE>
<TE>   McDyess is the second Knick starter to be sidelined by an injury.
Guard Latrell Sprewell arrived for training camp with a broken right
hand and the Knicks fined him $250,000 and told him to stay away from
the team for failing to report the injury in a timely manner.</TE>

<TE>   Forward Marcus Fizer of the Chicago Bulls was charged with having
a loaded gun in his car and driving with a suspended license early
Sunday morning in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois State Police Sgt. Wayne Winterberg said Fizer was pulled
over just past 2 a.m. for having tinted windows on his sport-utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Police then found Fizer was driving with a suspended license.
While preparing to tow his car, police searched it and found a
.40-caliber gun, Winterberg said.</TE>

<HD>McMurray Gets It Right and Wins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie McMurray, driving in only his second Winston Cup race, shocked
the NASCAR world Sunday with a victory in the UAW-GM 500 at Concord,
N.C.</LD>
<LD>   McMurray, scheduled to move up from the Busch Series next year,
was pressed into service early by team owners Chip Ganassi and Felix
Sabates when veteran Sterling Marlin, who led the series point
standings much of the season, was knocked out for the final seven
races of the season because of a fractured vertebra.</LD>
<LD>   McMurray, 26, has never won a Busch race. He drove to a 26th-place
finish in his Winston Cup debut last week at Talladega, Ala.</LD>
<TE>   After taking the lead for the final time on Lap 304 of the 334-lap
event, McMurray appeared on the way to an easy win. But a slight
bobble in the fourth turn four laps from the end allowed Bobby
Labonte to cut into most of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   But McMurray was able to hold off Labonte and actually pulling
pulled away on the final lap to win by 0.35 seconds -- about five car
lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it," McMurray said in the victory circle. "This
was a really hard situation with Sterling being hurt, but what an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Series leader Tony Stewart, Labonte's teammate, finished third and
increased his lead over Jimmie Johnson in the point standings, 4,128
to 4,031. Johnson finished sixth.</TE>
<TE>   McMurray led four times for a race-high total of 96 laps as he
broke Kevin Harvick's 1-year-old record as the quickest winner in
NASCAR's modern era. Harvick won in his third race after replacing
the late Dale Earnhardt in the second race of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher delivered a perfect ending to a near-perfect
season.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who finished among the top three in every race this
season, won his third consecutive Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, his
11th win this season in 17 races.</TE>
<TE>   The Ferrari driver finished second five times and third once. His
run comes a few days after Formula One officials recommended a plan
to handicap a car by adding extra weight if its team builds an early
points lead next season.</TE>
<TE>   The five-time world champion led a 1-2 finish for Ferrari, with
Rubens Barrichello in second. Schumacher was assured the title three
months ago with six races remaining. His previous best season was
nine wins, which he did three times.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher started from the pole and covered 53 laps of the
3.6-mile circuit in 1 hour 26 minutes 59.698 seconds. Barrichello was
half a second behind. Ferrari finished 1-2 for the ninth time this
season, and the drivers finished 1-2 in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was third and Juan Pablo Montoya was
fourth in a Williams, clinching third place in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Starr ended a 65-race winless streak as he beat NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series points leader Mike Bliss in the Las Vegas 350.
Starr and Bliss, who also drove a Chevrolet, circled the 1.5-mile Las
Vegas Motor Speedway just feet apart over the final four laps. Starr
held a lead of about a truck length beginning the final lap and beat
Bliss by 0.492 seconds -- two lengths.... Doug Kalitta raced to his
third top fuel victory in four events, winning the NHRA O'Reilly Fall
Nationals in Ennis, Texas. Kalitta drove his Mac Tools Dragster to a
4.582-second run at 322.58 mph to beat Cory McClenathan (6.565 at
130.62). Del Worsham beat Bruce Sarver in the funny car event and Jeg
Coughlin won the pro stock division.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Roger Federer defeated Jiri Novak, 6-4, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, to win the
CA Trophy indoor tournament at Vienna. Federer, 21, is eligible to
play in the Tennis Masters at the end of the season. Federer pulled
off the victory in 2:09 and earned $120,000.... Paul-Henri Mathieu
defeated three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten, 4-6, 6-3,
6-1, to win the Lyon Grand Prix in France.... Kim Clijsters rallied
to defeat Daniela Hantuchova, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, to win the Porsche Grand
Prix at Filderstadt, Germany.</TE>

<TE>   OneWorld of Seattle finished the first round of the America's Cup
challenger series unbeaten, defeating Oracle of San Francisco by 40
seconds today in a makeup race in Auckland, New Zealand. It was the
third consecutive loss for Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld was the only team with eight wins from eight races in the
round-robin competition, but finished even with Switzerland's Team
Alinghi, which had seven wins in eight starts.</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Didn't Intend This</HD>
<DH>Santiago makes St. Louis pay for walking Bonds, hitting a
two-run homer that lifts Giants to 4-3 victory and 3-1 series lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Will they ever learn?</LD>
<LD>   Benito Santiago knows that the man ahead of him in the San
Francisco Giant lineup, Barry Bonds, is the greatest single-season
home-run hitter in major league history. Santiago knows that he is a
37-year-old catcher who was thought to be at the end of his career a
few years ago.</LD>
<LD>   So he says he understands when teams walk Bonds over and over to
get to him. Santiago says he doesn't take it personally, that his
manager, Dusty Baker, tells him not to.</LD>
<TE>   But inside, Santiago seethes with emotion and aches for the chance
to show them the error of their ways.</TE>
<TE>   He got the perfect chance Sunday night at Pacific Bell Park, Game
4 of the National League championship series against the St. Louis
Cardinals. The score was tied in the eighth inning with two out and
Bonds coming up against St. Louis right-hander Rick White.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody in the ballpark knew what was coming. Sure enough, four
intentional balls later, the spotlight was on Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago had taken a called third strike on his last trip to the
plate against White. This time he worked the count full.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis pitching coach Dave Duncan, in a visit to the mound, had
told White, "You don't have to center cut this to him."</TE>
<TE>   White tried a sinker, the same pitch that got Santiago in his
previous at-bat. This time it turned into a center cut to rival the
best of any steakhouse in Union Square. Santiago took a corkscrew
swing and hit a towering home run to left, causing the sellout crowd
of 42,676 to let out a roar that could be heard all the way across
the bay in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   With clutch relief by closer Robb Nen in the ninth, the Giants
held on for a 4-3 victory and a commanding three games to one lead in
the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco victory tonight in Game 5 would mean the first
all-California World Series since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just unbelievable," Santiago said of his blast. "I don't
know how to describe it."</TE>
<TE>   As Santiago reached the dugout, shortstop Rich Aurilia yelled,
"Way to go, you old .... "</TE>
<TE>   Even Aurilia said he couldn't quite figure out how Santiago, with
his body twisted at an odd angle, got enough power to hit it out.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Santiago said, "I think to hit a ball like that, you have
to put a little strain on it."</TE>
<TE>   For much of Sunday evening, it appeared the night would belong to
another old veteran whose career was thought to be over. St. Louis
right-hander Andy Benes, Sunday night's starter, was in rehab for a
knee injury and contemplating retirement when pitcher Darryl Kile
died in June. The Cardinals called up Benes and he responded with
much of his old effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   But never more so than Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Benes was given a two-run lead in the first inning, Jim Edmonds
driving in one with a groundout and Tino Martinez singling home
another.</TE>
<TE>   Benes held that lead, shutting out the Giants on two hits into the
sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   But then he walked Kent and, forced to pitch to Bonds, pitched
around him, walking the Giant left fielder as well.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa called on White to pitch to
Santiago. But White didn't fare so well with the next batter, J.T.
Snow, who hammered a double off the wall in left-center to tie the
score.</TE>
<TE>   With Nen on the mound, the ninth inning began with a strikeout of
pinch-hitter Kerry Robinson. But not an out. Santiago couldn't
control the third strike, the ball getting away for a wild pitch, and
Robinson reached safely.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vina followed with a single and, after a groundout,
Edmonds singled home a run, leaving the potential tying run at third
and the potential winning run at first.</TE>
<TE>   Up came Albert Pujols.</TE>
<TE>   Down he went, Nen putting him away with a hanging slider.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to hit the ball in the air," Pujols said. "He
was making a lot of mistakes on that at-bat, but I just kept missing.
He threw me a hanging slider. He threw me a fastball. He just got
lucky. What can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Nen's "luck" would have to stretch over one more batter, J.D.
Drew. With a 2-2 count on Drew, Nen backed off the mound, then struck
him out with another slider.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward La Russa wasn't about to second-guess his decision not
to pitch to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the most dangerous hitter in the game right now," La Russa
said, "and it's tough to walk into that clubhouse after giving him a
chance to beat you."</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- He is given a uniform, but doesn't play. Instead, he
sits in the St. Louis dugout and offers encouragement and high-fives.
And the Cardinals respond.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a someone who has yet to celebrate his sixth
birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Kannon Kile, one of the three children of Cardinal right-hander
Darryl Kile, who died of a heart attack in June, was dressed in a
uniform bearing his father's number 57 this weekend. He took his
place with the Cardinals on the sideline at Pacific Bell Park for the
pregame introductions Saturday and sat in the dugout for Games 3 and
4 of the National League championship series.</LD>
<TE>   "Before the game, he was working with Tino [Martinez] and [Jim]
Edmonds on their swings," joked St. Louis right-hander Matt Morris.
"He's just an inspiration for all of us.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, just seeing him, we want to see how he's doing and
ease his pain, and he's the one who comforts us. It's amazing. He's
like a miniature D.K. It's good to see him laughing and hanging out
with the guys again. It puts things in perspective a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll high-five you no matter if it's a strikeout or you hit a
home run. It's fun having him."</TE>
<TE>   During Saturday's game, Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa leaned over
and asked Kannon the score.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet you half our guys didn't know the score," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   Kannon did.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morris, tonight's Cardinal starter, gave up the home run to Kenny
Lofton in Game 1 that led to a near brawl when Lofton became
infuriated over an inside pitch his next time up. Lofton assumed the
Cardinals felt he was showboating after hitting the ball out.</TE>
<TE>   Not Morris.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even see his trot," Morris said. "I was turned around,
looking at the ball, to see if it was going to get out."</TE>

<HD>Radcliffe Breaks Marathon Record</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Paula Radcliffe ran the fastest marathon ever by a woman Sunday in
only her second effort at the grueling distance.</LD>
<LD>   The 28-year-old British runner's victory in a chilly, windy
Chicago Marathon in 2 hours 17 minutes 18 seconds was 89 seconds
faster than the previous world record set by Catherine Ndereba of
Kenya in the same race last year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's rounded off a brilliant year for me," Radcliffe said. "I was
really just concentrating on my race, waiting until I got to 15, 16
miles until I ran a bit quicker."</LD>
<TE>   In remarkable condition after training in the Pyrenees mountains
of southern France, she won the London Marathon in her debut at that
distance April 14 in 2:18:56.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since London, I knew I was capable of doing it," said
Radcliffe, a two-time world cross-country champion. "This is what
I've been working towards."</TE>
<TE>   With temperatures in the 30s, Radcliffe ran the second half of the
course a minute faster than she did the first, even though she was
facing a stiff wind over the last few miles.</TE>
<TE>   She broke away from Ndereba in the 17th mile. Ndereba, who won the
race the last two years, finished second in 2:19.29.</TE>

<LD>What was it like?</LD>
<LD>   "It was just like, 'Wow. Is this really happening?' " A.J.
Pierzynski said.</LD>
<LD>   "Tough to swallow," Torii Hunter said.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't believe it. I didn't believe it was happening," Eddie
Guardado said.</TE>
<TE>   They were talking, of course, about the bottom of the seventh
inning Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Angels got out their Thunder Stix in that half of the
inning. They scored 10 runs and almost batted around twice.</TE>
<TE>   And everyone knew, when the inning finally ended, that the Twins
were about to conclude the season that almost wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "You just try to be real with yourself," Hunter said. "They had it
in the bag when they got those runs."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, they did. The Angels bagged a trip to the World Series with
their 13-5 victory over the Twins. The Angels won all three games in
Anaheim to clinch the best-of-seven series, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   For a brief time, it appeared the series might head back to
Minnesota. When the Twins scored three runs in the top of the seventh
to take a 5-3 lead, that possibility was on a lot of minds.</TE>
<TE>   And then, as the bottom of the seventh sent them spiraling through
the corridors of hell, the Twins realized they would be heading back
to Minnesota alone. The Angels would be staying behind to party.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating to see the game slip away right out of our
hands," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Through several rounds of interviews after the game, Hunter kept
referring to the eight runs the Angels had scored in the seventh
inning. Maybe he lost track. Maybe it was just wishful thinking.
Eventually, he was told the Angels scored 10 runs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 10?" he said. "I'll think about that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Mientkiewicz thought a lot about what all those runs meant as
the inning dragged on and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we were nine outs away from going home," Mientkiewicz
said.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the only time all season when contraction
didn't sound like such a bad idea.</TE>

<LD>... Even in defeat there was a certain confidence among the [Twin]
players. They are certain this was no one-shot wonder. They know they
are good and they know they should stay good if the team remains
together.</LD>
<LD>   To that end, the players should get together over the winter and
light a few candles with the hope of finally getting a new owner.
Nothing is sure under the current regime. Remember, owner [Carl]
Pohlad tried to sell them down the river once already.</LD>
<LD>   "After what happened last winter, we don't count our chickens
before they hatch," Doug Mientkiewicz said. "But teammates like this
don't come around every day. We just kept turning heads all year."</LD>
<TE>   The bottom line is that, even though Twin fans are stunned that
they won't see their heroes again until 2003, they got a summer's
worth of great entertainment. The team was fun to watch. It played
well. And it ignited baseball the fever in Minnesota that had been
missing for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   This fairy tale did not have that lump-in-the-throat, heavenly
choir-singing happy ending. But it was an interesting story
nevertheless. The beginning was horrible. The middle chapters were
fabulous. Only at the end did things go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, not bad. Wait till next year.</TE>

<LD>And so, the fellow who was supposed to bunt the runners along --
small ball, baseball insiders like Doug Mientkiewicz love to call it
-- drilled a high slider from Johan Santana into the right field
stands. With one swing, Adam Kennedy had given his team the lead, and
jolted the Twins so badly that their relievers would yield seven
more.</LD>
<LD>   This is what Mientkiewicz had said Saturday night in response to
the suggestion that the Twins could use a momentum-shifting power
ball every now and then: "The last couple games we've had too many
guys who want to be the hero every time you step up to the plate. I
read a story today about us and home runs. That was the worst story
at the worst time in the history of the media for us. We didn't get
here by hitting home runs."</LD>
<LD>   Neither did Kennedy, by the way. But you know what, Doug? The
Angels' second baseman is living proof that you don't have to be Babe
Ruth to become Babe Ruth for a single postseason series. Or a single
game. Or even a single at-bat.</LD>
<TE>   You either take the moment and run with it, or you don't.</TE>
<TE>   Here was a fellow who, when the opportunity presented itself,
didn't say "Whoa ... whoa ... whoa. This isn't what got us here. This
isn't my game. I'm supposed to settle for a nice, quiet base hit up
the middle."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he attacked that hanging slider by Santana to pull the
Angels back ahead and send a Rally Monkey-lovin',
Thunder-Stix-clappin' crowd of 44,835 into hysterics.</TE>

<HD>Favre Retains the Upper Hand</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>New England fans booed every time former Patriot Terry Glenn touched
the ball. Then they turned on their own players.</LD>
<LD>   The Super Bowl champions heard plenty of jeers Sunday as Brett
Favre threw three touchdown passes to lead the Green Bay Packers to a
28-10 victory and hand the Patriots their third consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn, who had three catches for 19 yards, said his teammates
reminded him that although the fans were booing him, they were booing
the Patriots too.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Brady, in his second season as a starter, was intercepted
three times, sacked twice and threw a touchdown pass after the
Packers led, 28-3.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing. It's frustrating and disappointing. It's
something I haven't felt in a long time," said Brady, last season's
Super Bowl most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   Favre's experience came through as he threw his 301st touchdown
pass, moving past John Elway on the all-time NFL list. Favre trails
only Dan Marino's 420 and Fran Tarkenton's 342.</TE>
<TE>   "It means I'm playing and producing, and we're winning. That's
about it," said Favre, who made his 163rd consecutive start -- an NFL
record for quarterbacks. "What matters is winning."</TE>
<TE>   The Packers (5-1) won for the fourth consecutive time as Ahman
Green scored his first two touchdowns of the season and ran for 136
yards. Despite playing without starting defensive ends Joe Johnson
and Vonnie Holiday and four sidelined defensive backs, the Packers
had no trouble stopping the Patriots (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to get a great four-man rush with our guys and
disrupt [Brady's] rhythm," Packer Coach Mike Sherman said. "We've
handled adversity the entire season. We've been losing players left
and right."</TE>
<TE>   Even the return of top receiver Troy Brown, who sat out the
Patriots' last two games because of a knee injury, wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We let them walk in here and beat us in our own house," New
England defensive tackle Steve Martin said. "We probably made every
mistake you could make."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots turned over the ball four times, lost three of four
replay reviews and committed critical penalties that led to two
touchdowns.</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   TWINS: Twins 1, Angels 0--Jacque Jones lined to right on a 2-and-0
pitch, Tim Salmon making a nice sliding catch. Someone should explain
to Jones that leadoff hitters should work the count better than he
has in this series. Cristian Guzman flied to center. Corey Koskie
walked. Koskie took second on a wild pitch. David Ortiz doubled to
right, Koskie scoring. Ortiz stood at home plate and watched the ball
instead of running. You'd think he'd want to run as much as he can to
drop some of that weight. Torii Hunter popped to first. One run, one
hit, one left.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Twins 1, Angels 0--David Eckstein was thrown out by Koskie
trying to beat out a bunt. He slipped coming out of the batter's box
or he would have been safe. Darin Erstad beat out a slow bouncer to
second. Salmon singled to left, Erstad to second. Garret Anderson
forced Salmon, Erstad to third. Troy Glaus flied to center. No runs,
two hits, two left.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 0--Doug Mientkiewicz flied to left. Dustan
Mohr doubled to left center. A.J. Pierzynski singled to shallow left,
but Mohr took advantage of Anderson's poor throwing arm and scored.
Pierzynski was thrown out trying to advance to second, then pumped
his fist because he knocked in the run. I guess if you only had two
hits the whole series, you'd be excited too. Oh, and if Pierzynski
were a smart baserunner, he'd still be at first. But go ahead and
pump your fist anyway. A.J. Luis Rivas struck out looking. One run,
two hits, none left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 0--Brad Fullmer grounded to second. Scott
Spiezio grounded to short. Bengie Molina grounded to short. No runs,
no hits.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 0--Jones batting. Thom Brennaman keeps
referring to USC as "Southern Cal, " which is the best way to show
everyone that you've never been anywhere near USC. Jones, who went to
USC, flied to right. Guzman flied to center. Koskie flied to center.
No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Adam Kennedy homered to right. The
Angels have hit 14 homers in the playoffs, 12 with the bases empty.
Eckstein grounded to second. Rivas bobbled the ball but still had
time to throw him out. Erstad grounded to short. Salmon popped to
short. He is hitless in the series. One run, one hit.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Brennaman let us know that Curt
Schilling is 21-1 against NL West opponents. That would be
interesting if this were the NLCS and if Arizona were still in the
playoffs. Ortiz flied to center. Hunter hit a drive to left center
that Erstad ran down. Mientkiewicz grounded to short. No runs, no
hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Anderson singled to right. Glaus swung
at the first pitch and popped to the catcher. Fullmer grounded into a
4-6-3 double play. No runs, one hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Mohr flied to deep center. Pierzynski
singled to center. Rivas grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. No runs,
one hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Twins 2--Spiezio homered to right. Molina
grounded to third. Molina's so slow, Koskie could have run the ball
all the way to first and still beat him by two steps. Kennedy homered
to right. Take that, Homer Hanky. Eckstein grounded to second. Erstad
grounded to short. Two runs, two hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 3, Twins 2--Jones beat out a high chopper to the
pitcher. Guzman sacrificed. Brendan Donnelly pitching. Koskie struck
out swinging. Jones took third on a wild pitch. Ortiz swung at ball
four and struck out. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Twins 2--Salmon singled to left. Anderson
singled to right center, Salmon to third. Time for a Fox Instapoll:
"If Steve Lyons and Tim McCarver were put in a booth together, how
long before all the oxygen would be sucked out of the room by their
constant yammering?" Glaus hit a ground ball to third. Salmon was
caught in a rundown between third and home and was tagged out.
Runners on first and second. Poor baserunning by Salmon. Johan
Santana pitching. The kid in the monkey suit is back. Maybe he's
Peter Mayhew's son. Shawn Wooten, batting for Fullmer, struck out
into a double play. The runners were going on the 3-and-2 pitch and
Anderson was easily thrown out at third. No runs, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 5, Angels 3--Hunter flied to right. Mientkiewicz
singled to center. Mohr singled to left center, Mientkiewicz to
second. Pierzynski singled to right, loading the bases. Francisco
Rodriguez pitching. Bobby Kielty, batting for Rivas, walked, scoring
Mientkiewicz. The runners moved up a base on a wild pitch, Mohr
scoring. Jones flied to center, Pierzynski scoring. Someone should
show Molina how to block a plate. Mike Scioscia perhaps? Guzman
grounded to second. Three runs, three hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 13, Twins 5--David Lamb to second. Spiezio singled
to right. Molina singled to left. Chone Figgins ran for Molina. After
failing in his attempt to sacrifice, Adam "Mr. October" Kennedy
homered to right. That Jim Edmonds trade looks pretty good right now.
LaTroy Hawkins pitching. Eckstein hit a shot to third and beat the
throw to first. Erstad singled to left, Eckstein to second. Salmon
singled to left, loading the bases. Alex Ochoa ran for Salmon. J.C.
Romero pitching. Anderson walked, Eckstein scoring. Glaus struck out
swinging. Wooten singled to right, Erstad scoring, bases are still
loaded. The runners moved up on a wild pitch, Ochoa scoring. Spiezio
singled to left, Anderson and Wooten scoring. This is unbelievable.
Bob Wells pitching. Figgins singled off the shortstop's glove,
Spiezio to second. Kennedy singled to left, loading the bases.
Eckstein was hit by a pitch, Spiezio scoring. Erstad grounded to
first, Figgins scoring. Ochoa struck out looking. The World Series
starts at Edison Field on Saturday. 10 runs, 10 hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 13, Twins 5--Jose Molina catching. Ochoa in right.
Ben Weber pitching. Koskie singled to center. Ortiz flied to center.
Hunter grounded into a 1-4-3 double play. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 13, Twins 5--Mohr to center. Mike Cuddyer to right.
Tom Prince catching. Kyle Lohse pitching. Anderson grounded to
second. Glaus struck out looking. Wooten popped to first. No runs, no
hits.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 13, Twins 5--Troy Percival pitching. The hardest
three outs in Angel history. Mientkiewicz flied to right. Fox is
showing Donnie Moore; let the man rest in peace. Mohr flied to
center. Prince popped to short. No runs, no hits, no hex. The Angels
advance.</TE>

League West and avoid the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   That's what they heard, the Angels did.</LD>
<LD>   No inexperienced playoff team was going to beat the Yankees. These
Angels would have no chance against the Yanks. Good to see you guys,
and wait till next year.</LD>
<TE>   And then the Angels whacked the stuffing out of Yankee pitching,
won three straight against New York and sent the Yankees home.</TE>
<TE>   So, gosh, it might be better if the Angels could play the A's in
the American League championship series instead of Minnesota. The
Angels heard that too.</TE>
<TE>   They know the A's, they play well against the A's. They weren't so
good in the Metrodome and Brad Radke owned the Angels. The Twins also
had fate and destiny and some divine right to stick it to Bud Selig
and contraction in their back pocket.</TE>
<TE>   And then the Angels won four straight against the Twins, twisted
Twin bats around their little fingers, taunted them by letting them
take a two-run lead in the top of the seventh Sunday, put up a
10-spot in the bottom of the seventh and stuck it to the Contraction
Boys.</TE>
<TE>   And now it's beginning again.</TE>
<TE>   Giants or Cardinals?</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds or Albert Pujols?</TE>
<TE>   California fever or old friends Jim Edmonds and Chuck Finley?</TE>
<TE>   Angel pitching coach Bud Black said it would be pretty cool to
play the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my old team," Black said, "the team I rooted for when I was
growing up -- Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Tito Fuentes, Willie McCovey,
Juan Marichal. Want me to go on? And it's the team I played for. It
was an honor to play for them for four years."</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn said it would be pretty cool to play the
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Chuck Finley's team," Washburn said. "I want Chuck to make
it. When I broke into the big leagues, Chuck helped me a lot. I
respect the man so much. He's a great pitcher and a great guy and it
would be great to see him."</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels play the Giants in the World Series, Los Angeles
will finally sit up and take notice.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger fans, if only out of spite, will root for the Angels to
beat the despised Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to make a bet with the mayor of San Francisco," said Tom
Daly, mayor of Anaheim. So far Daly has collected a case of bagels
and a case of hot dogs from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the
satisfaction of knowing that Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak will be
wearing Mickey Mouse ears and an Angel T-shirt around city hall for a
day.</TE>
<TE>   Playing the Giants will focus the fans of Southern California on
the gem that is Edison Field.  If the Angels play the Cardinals,
there will be so many emotions on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals hold close to them the memories of pitcher Darryl
Kile, the Southern Californian who died in his hotel room earlier
this season, and of Jack Buck, their beloved radio announcer. Kannon
Kile, 5, scampered around the Cardinal dugout Sunday, a happy little
boy representing the father that is gone.</TE>
<TE>   And Edmonds and Finley are still embraced and admired by many
Angel players.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon and Troy Percival both said they would love to see
their buddies in the World Series and dread playing against them.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be both weird and nice," Salmon said. "I just don't know
what to say about that."</TE>
<TE>   Finley, who was a rookie on the 1986 Angel team that was one
strike away from the World Series, told Associated Press in San
Francisco Sunday that "it would be kind of weird going back there
that late in October. Usually when I go back there that late, I'm
visiting friends in the PR department and the tractor pulls and stuff
are starting up."</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds said the Angels are "the closest friends I have except for
this team." But he also had a dig at the laid-back Anaheim fans of
the bad old days. "It's good for the city, I guess, for them to
pretend like they care about baseball for a couple of weeks," he said
in San Francisco. Wouldn't it be nice for Angel fans to welcome
Edmonds back to town, to maybe remind him of the sellouts in July, to
show him the power of the Rally Monkey, to serenade him with the
clamor of the Thunder Stix.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Giants or Cards, it's not going to matter. All that
matters is how the Angels play.</TE>
<TE>   It was all about the Angels, their constant singles and doubles,
their unwillingness to be intimidated by Yankee experience or
mystique, monuments or history in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   And it was all about the Angels, their exquisite pitching, the
home run swings of Troy Glaus and Adam Kennedy, about their calm in
coming from behind, in the series, in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   So it will be all about the Angels in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   If they didn't fear the Yankees, will Bonds set their stomachs
clenching?</TE>
<TE>   Will Salmon and Percival and Garret Anderson think Edmonds and
Finley deserve a title more than themselves?</TE>
<TE>   This season has been about the Angels playing each game against
each opponent as if it was the most important game of the season,
then forgetting that game and playing the next.</TE>
<TE>   Will Bonds hit home runs off their pitchers? Probably. Will
Edmonds make a great play in the outfield? Most likely. Will the
Angels lose a game? Hard to imagine a sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Angels be overwhelmed by anybody or any team? When will
we stop thinking that way? The Angels have.</TE>

<KH>ST. LOUIS 28, OAKLAND 13</KH>
<HD>Bulger Impressive in His First Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>One quick possession was all Marc Bulger needed Sunday to calm his
nerves and give the St. Louis Rams a lead they'd never relinquish.</LD>
<LD>   The third-string quarterback, who came into the league two years
ago as an obscure sixth-round draft choice with New Orleans, threw
three touchdown passes and ran for another in his first NFL action as
the Rams won their first game of the season, 28-13, over the
previously unbeaten Oakland Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   "If you know you can play, you don't have to worry about it,"
Bugler said. "You'll get your chance."</LD>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk, who was slowed by back spasms last week against
the San Francisco 49ers, returned to form by running for a
season-high 158 yards. His 32-yard run, which followed Damione Lewis'
interception of Rich Gannon's pass, put the ball at the Oakland one
with 11:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, who started in place of injured second-stringer Jamie
Martin, scored on the next play to give the defending NFC champions
(1-5) a 28-6 lead. The touchdown triggered thunderous cheers from a
crowd that hadn't seen its team win a home game since Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner, out with a broken finger, was the first person to
greet Bulger after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say enough about a guy who comes in in such a big game
and plays with such poise," Warner said. "He played the way he had to
play to win this football game."</TE>
<TE>   Bulger completed 14 of 21 passes for 186 yards and three
touchdowns with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders (4-1), who entered the game leading the NFL at 40.5
points and 461.5 yards a game, had only two field goals and 229 yards
through the first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The dismal performance didn't stop Jerry Rice, who caught seven
passes for 133 yards on his 40th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "That is amazing for a guy who has done it as long as he has,"
said Ram cornerback Dre' Bly. "For him to be 40 years old and still
be out there playing every snap and not coming out of the game and
just doing what's done since he's 23 is just unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Rice caught a 53-yard pass on the game's first play, which
actually led to a momentum-turning defensive stop by the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth-and-one from the St. Louis three, Zack Crockett was
stopped for no gain by linebacker Tommy Polley, who missed the
previous two games with an injury.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger guided the Rams 97 yards in nine plays. He completed a
17-yard pass to Isaac Bruce -- his first NFL pass -- then connected
with Torry Holt for 50 yards. He found Bruce in the corner of the end
zone for a seven-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Coach Bill Callahan denied that the Raiders overlooked the
Rams, or Bulger.</TE>
<TE>   "He did get significant playing time in the preseason, and he
understands the system," Callahan said. "I think they were
intelligent with their approach. We were very diligent about how we
prepared for this team. My hat's off to them."</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 43, WASHINGTON 27</KH>
<HD>Lewis Delivers a Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>The chant in the locker room was "Mike the man! Mike the man!" Boo
Williams even did an impersonation of Michael Lewis filming a
commercial to capitalize on his newfound fame.</LD>
<LD>   "Shut up, Boo," said Lewis, finally getting a bit embarrassed.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, the former beer delivery truck driver, had his biggest game
since becoming an NFL rookie last season at age 29. He had 356
combined yards -- including kickoff and punt returns for touchdowns
-- as the New Orleans Saints beat the Washington Redskins, 43-27, on
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I never looked at making it this far when I was playing arena
ball," said Lewis, who never went to college and has played for teams
such as the New Jersey Red Dogs and the Louisiana Bayou Beast. "But
the opportunity was there when I came here. And I'm going to take as
much as I can from it. It's my turn. I've got to go out there and
make a mark for myself."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis might have had Arena League flashbacks in a wacky game that
included five touchdowns of 60 yards or more. The Saints -- off to
their best start since 1993 at 5-1 -- scored their most points since
1987. They took a 20-0 lead after rookie Patrick Ramsey, making his
first NFL start, threw three interceptions in his first five passes
for the Redskins (2-3).</TE>
<TE>   The teams combined for 23 penalties for 177 yards, and
Washington's first scoring drive covered 75 yards -- 36 more than New
Orleans' first four scoring drives combined.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the weirdest games I've ever been associated
with," said Bruce Smith, the Redskins' 18-year veteran defensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Steve Spurrier was exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically we're not smart enough to give ourselves a chance to
win," he said. "Careless penalties, careless turnovers here and
there. We look like we don't care whether we win the game or not.
It's pitiful watching us play right now.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to make some corrections. We're trying to find out
the guys who want to bust their tails and play their assignments.
Those who don't, we gotta make changes if we can't get 'em to play
and play disciplined. We looked like a very poorly coached team --
offense, defense, special teams."</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Fox Confident This Series Won't Be a Hound</HD>
<DH>Network executives are enthusiastic about Angels' appeal
and the potential World Series story lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a lot of enthusiasm around the Fox television studios in
Los Angeles on Sunday after the Angels clinched their first World
Series trip.</LD>
<LD>   "This is fantastic," Fox Sports Chairman David Hill said moments
after the Angels' 13-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   "Phenomenal," is how Fox Sports President Ed Goren summed it up.</LD>
<TE>   They are confident that their network, which will televise the
World Series beginning Saturday, has a hit on its hands.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they can call it "Fox and the Monkey," not to be confused
with the 1981 Disney animated film, "The Fox and the Hound."</TE>
<TE>   "The Rally Monkey lives," Hill said. "I love the monkey."</TE>
<TE>   Hill and Goren said it doesn't really matter who the Angels play
in the Series -- San Francisco, which leads the NL championship
series, three games to one, or St. Louis. They believe the Angels
have captured the nation's fancy.</TE>
<TE>   "How wonderful it is in these times of high-salaried professional
athletes to see the purity of a bunch of guys just playing for a
ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Just 14 days ago this was a small-market, low-revenue team. Now
we've got a big-market, high-revenue team. Cinderella is going to the
big dance. People love underdogs."</TE>
<TE>   Goren used his wife, Patti, as an example of how the Angels have
affected people.</TE>
<TE>   "Patti is not huge baseball fan, but after attending Friday
night's game her reaction was, 'Wow!' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Hill: "With the Angels you've got fresh young players who are
so exciting and play as the consummate team. Viewers have learned to
expect the unexpected with this team.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into the postseason the question was, would Los Angeles
embrace this team? We now know Los Angeles has embraced this team and
I believe the whole country has as well."</TE>
<TE>   Television ratings provide some evidence. The last two games of
the American League championship series got better ratings than
comparable games in the same time slots last year.</TE>
<TE>   The overnight rating for Game 3 between the Angels and Twins on
Friday night was a 7.4 with a 12 share. The overnight rating for Game
3 of the Arizona-Atlanta NL series last year was a 7.1/12.</TE>
<TE>   Game 4 of the AL series this year got a 6.9/12, compared to a
6.3/11 for Game 4 of the NL series last year.</TE>
<TE>   Another good sign is the L.A. ratings are going up as the
postseason progresses. Game 3 got a 17.5/32 in L.A., Game 4 an
18.7/36.</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives also are excited about the World Series story
lines.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to the Angels, there are so many story lines we
need a seven-game Series to get them all in," Goren said. "Or maybe
an eight-game Series."</TE>
<TE>   And new ones keep popping up. How about a 190-pound second
baseman, a Southern Californian, hitting three home runs in a
postseason game?</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey will no doubt be one of the stories, even though
there may be some bah-humbug types who don't like the little critter.</TE>
<TE>   "If the series between the Angels and Twins had gone one more
game, we were going to have a monkey in our pregame show studio,"
Hill said. "Since we'll be doing our pregame shows on site during the
Series, I don't know if we'll be able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey was created in June 2000 when a couple of members
of the video crew at Edison Field decided to put a clip of a bouncing
monkey on the scoreboard. The clip came from the 1994 movie "Ace
Ventura, Pet Detective."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rallied to win the game that night, and soon the Angels
got their own monkey, the white-faced capuchin featured on NBC's
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   So NBC will have a minor role in this Fox-televised Series.</TE>
<TE>   And of course Disney, which owns the Angels as well as ABC, will
have a major role.</TE>
<TE>   That's just one of the strange twists that make this World Series
so intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   Another is that Fox owns the Dodgers. And the Dodgers once
employed Angel Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   If the Giants end up in the Series, there are more twists. They
are managed by another former Dodger, Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   And the Giants' star player, Barry Bonds, epitomizes today's
high-priced athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Some people might want to call such a Series, "The Angels and the
Devil."</TE>
<TE>   If the St. Louis Cardinals manage to make it to the Series, there
is another story line.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Joe Buck, who will announce the Series with Tim McCarver, is
the son of legendary Cardinal announcer Jack Buck, who died in June.</TE>
<TE>   However things turn out, Fox has one more wish.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is a seven-game World Series, that would be ideal," Goren
said.</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 34, CINCINNATI 7</KH>
<HD>Paper Tigers Can't Stay With Steelers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Jon Kitna had the best game of his career against the Pittsburgh
Steelers last year. He followed it with the worst performance of his
life.</LD>
<LD>   Kitna threw three interceptions -- two to Lee Flowers -- and lost
a fumble while getting sacked, helping the Steelers roll to a 34-7
victory over the winless Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "They did us a favor out there, let's face it," said Flowers, who
matched his career total for interceptions. "We don't need to get too
high right now. We played well, but at the same time, we were in the
right position at the right time.</LD>
<TE>   "Not bad-mouthing Kitna, but I thought he made some bad throws
today. It wasn't like we had to make great breaks on the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Kitna inadvertently drew up the blueprint for beating the Steelers
last December when he attempted 68 passes and threw for 411 yards.
New England and Oakland used a similar passing strategy to beat the
Steelers this season.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Pittsburgh went after Kitna with a "Steal Curtain"
approach: Pressure the quarterback, let him throw it up for grabs and
steal it away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been playing since fifth grade," Kitna said. "I've never
played more poorly than I did today. I've never been more
disappointed in myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers (2-3) also got a 99-yard kickoff return from rookie
Antwaan Randle El, the second-longest in team history, to open the
second half and put them ahead, 31-0.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Coach Dick LeBeau had joked that if his team won
Sunday, he would dive into the Ohio River.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Bengals went right into the tank once again.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals are 0-6 for the fifth time since 1991, when they
started their run as the NFL's worst franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the laughingstock of the league," running back Lorenzo Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing. It's a disgrace. Teams just look at you with
no respect."</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 23, JACKSONVILLE 14</KH>
<HD>By George, Titans Run for It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The Tennessee Titans got a much-needed victory by sticking with what
they used to do best.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie George rushed for 100 yards for the first time this season
and scored two touchdowns, and the Titans ended a losing streak at
four by beating the Jacksonville Jaguars, 23-14, on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Titans were last in rushing in the league, and George had
averaged only 2.7 yards per carry. But Coach Jeff Fisher said running
the ball always is the plan against Jacksonville and nothing would
stop him from sticking with George, who ran for 113 yards</LD>
<TE>   "He has confidence going in every week that he's going to make a
difference, and this week, he did. Eddie George is fine," Fisher
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars (3-2) had won three in a row and were tied for the AFC
South lead. But the Titans (2-4) won for the first time since their
opener and defeated Jacksonville for the seventh time in their last
nine meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a win we need to get on the right track, and the players
deserve all the credit for this, because they responded this week and
got themselves ready under difficult circumstances," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee knocked out a starting quarterback for a second
consecutive game and faced a rookie the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Titans knocked Danny Wuerffel out of the game but
rookie Patrick Ramsey came on to lead the Washington Redskins to a
31-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   This time, it was Mark Brunell, the league's second-rated passer,
who suffered a concussion after being hit at the sideline by
cornerback Samari Rolle on the first series. Brunell played one more
series before leaving, and rookie David Garrard replaced him.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans held Jacksonville to a season-low 198 yards, 68
passing. Kevin Carter had two of the Titans' three sacks, and the
Titans intercepted two of Garrard's seven passes. He completed four.</TE>

<KH>TWIN NOTES</KH>
<HD>Present Hurts but Future Looks Good</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Twins accomplished more than even they expected, escaping the
contraction gallows, winning the American League Central division and
upsetting the Oakland Athletics in a division series.</LD>
<LD>   So the upstart pennant contenders chose to focus on everything
that went right in their wild ride to the AL championship series,
which ended Sunday in a 13-5 loss to the Angels in Game 5 at Edison
Field.</LD>
<LD>   Qualifying for the World Series would have been great, the Twins
said, but they're proud of what they've done.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a good year, we're a good young club, we've got a lot of
upside and this is the first time through for us," General Manager
Terry Ryan said. "We have to take some of the positives out of what
happened here, and hopefully we'll benefit next year by some of the
things we've experienced."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have a talented young nucleus and a rich minor league
system, providing optimism about future postseason runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our farm system is healthy and we're a relatively young roster,
especially our position players, and we've got the pitching and the
defense," Ryan said. "With that, you would think that we've got some
of the ingredients to carry this over."</TE>
<TE>   Players are determined to keep the ball rolling.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I wouldn't mind doing this again and I'm sure the other
guys wouldn't mind either," All-Star center fielder Torii Hunter
said. "I had so much fun the whole playoffs; all the intensity and
adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get older, smarter and a little more experienced.
Now, we know what it takes. We know the way the game is and what the
playoffs are about. We've got a taste and want to taste it again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans, considered among the most passive in baseball, left a
lasting impression on the Twins, energizing the home team with
Thunder Stix and cheers.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins were certainly impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were into those games and they were beating those
things," Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Our crowd gets us going, and
theirs got them going. That's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff batter Jacque Jones went two for 20 in the series without
a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't do my job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like if I would have been more productive in this series,
maybe we would have done a better job of winning some games.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is just work hard this winter, learn from this and
try to come back better. That's what I'm going to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado appreciated the kind comments of Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia, who sought out the Minnesota closer while the Angels
celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   "He stopped me when I was walking off the field and said we're a
hell of a club," Guardado said. "He just wanted to let me know he
liked the way we play, which tells me a lot about Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "When another manager does something like that, you know he's
really a class act. You have to respect that."</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Time for Twins to Raise White Hankie</HD>
<DH>They lavish praise on the Angels, and Hawkins questions
whether manager burned out the bullpen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The relief the Minnesota Twins sought throughout the American League
championship series arrived in those frantic final moments while the
Angels celebrated and reality set in at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Players left the railing of the dugout steps slowly Sunday as a
crowd of 44,835 banged Thunder Stix in applauding the first-time AL
champions, who eliminated the bullpen-drained Twins with a 13-5
victory in Game 5.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' 10-run seventh inning against three relievers summed
up the story of the series for the Twins, who repeatedly turned to
their bullpen for help it failed to provide against the Angels.
Fatigue could have been a factor, considering Manager Ron Gardenhire
leaned on the group when the best-of-seven series shifted West, but
even the Twins said they were overmatched.</LD>
<TE>   Relief came in believing the Angels are just that good, enabling
the Twins to leave the red-covered Southland with peace of mind that
eluded them on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, those guys are really good," center fielder Torii Hunter
said. "They've got a good squad, and they did their thing against our
bullpen. Our guys have been great all year, we've got one of the best
bullpens in the league, but those guys are hot.</TE>
<TE>   "They make contact, they get the [bloopers] to get 'em started,
and the next thing you know, they start to hit the ball hard and go
deep. Everything they hit was in the right spot the whole series. We
might have made some mistakes, but they capitalized on every one of
them. They were just the better team and showed it."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had enough showstopping moments to fill multiple
highlight packages, or blooper shows from the Twins' perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Johan Santana, LaTroy Hawkins, J.C. Romero and Bob Wells were on
the spot in the 10-hit, 15-batter seventh Sunday, capping the
bullpen's failure in a record-setting meltdown. The Twins matched the
1929 Chicago Cubs and 1968 St. Louis Cardinals in giving up the most
runs during an inning in postseason history, acknowledging they were
as demoralized as they seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shocking because we've been pitching so well," said closer
Eddie Guardado, who recording a save in Game 1 at the Metrodome in
his only appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "But we just didn't execute this series. We didn't get our job
done, plain and simple, and we all know it."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota relievers had the league's fourth-lowest earned-run
average at 3.68. That number increased to 4.41 in an AL division
series victory over the favored Oakland Athletics and ballooned to
13.50 against the Angels. The bullpen gave up 19 hits and 16 earned
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "In that lineup, you don't see many holes," Minnesota designated
hitter David Ortiz said. "Our bullpen is one of the best bullpens in
the whole league, but they hit our best pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever they hit the ball the ball was finding holes. You see
what they did against our bullpen. That shows you nobody can predict
what's going to happen in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins said Sunday's results were predictable because Gardenhire
burned out the bullpen. The first-year manager used five relievers in
the Angels' five-run eighth inning in Game 4, matching an AL
championship series record; and Hawkins and Romero, nicknamed "the
Rock," appeared in all three games at Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire put them in a hard place, Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just exhausted," said the setup man, one of the AL's best
this year. "Me and JC have been in those situations all year and had
success.</TE>
<TE>   "That just wouldn't have happened if we were fresh. They wouldn't
have done that against a fresh J.C. Romero or LaTroy Hawkins."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire believed he had no choice. "They had snowballs rolling,
and you're just trying to stop 'em somehow," he said. "You try to use
your matchups that you've done all year long, but it just didn't work
out. That team is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   And accepting it provided the Twins' relief.</TE>

<KH>MINNESOTA 31, DETROIT 24</KH>
<HD>Finally, a Team Vikings Can Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>After a shaky start, Daunte Culpepper and the Minnesota Vikings
picked up the offensive tempo and their first win.</LD>
<LD>   Culpepper threw for 295 yards and two touchdowns and ran for
another score to rally the Vikings past the Detroit Lions, 31-24,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't tell you exactly how good this feels after losing four I
felt we should have won," Culpepper said.</LD>
<TE>   Moe Williams got the clinching touchdown on a two-yard run with
2:12 to play. Culpepper had a 25-yard completion to Randy Moss, their
longest connection of the day, to set up the score.</TE>
<TE>   The win snapped an eight-game losing streak for the Vikings (1-4).
The skid began last season when the Lions, then 0-12, beat Minnesota
at the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew good things were eventually going to happen and today we
made plays down the stretch and good things happened for our
ballclub," Byron Chamberlain said.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing for three quarters, Minnesota tied it on
Culpepper's 45-yard screen pass to Michael Bennett, who eluded
several defensive backs for the score with 5:25 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (1-4) started at their 19 on the next possession, and
Chris Hovan batted away a third-down pass by Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions had a final chance when Harrington drove them from their
31 to the Minnesota eight. The rookie kept the drive going with a
23-yard pass to Az-Zahir Hakim on third down.</TE>
<TE>   But on second and goal, Corey Chavous picked off Harrington's pass
to the corner to clinch Mike Tice's first NFL coaching victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big win because we came from behind and scored a bunch
of points in the fourth, and held them when we had to and made a big
defensive play at the end," Tice said.</TE>
<TE>   The interception spoiled an otherwise solid performance by
Harrington, who was 25 for 41 with 309 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES GAME 5 ANGELS 13,
MINNESOTA 5</KH>
<HD>Ghost Busters</HD>
<DH>First World Series berth buries four decades of haunting
memories</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Heaven can wait. The Angels are going to the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   At 5:04 p.m. Sunday, the Angels cast aside their image as bumblers
and stumblers and losers. After four decades of frustration and
humiliation, the Angels are champions of the American League, bound
for their first World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not even able to make sense of this," said outfielder Tim
Salmon, the longest-suffering Angel. "I feel like I'm dreaming."</LD>
<TE>   On a day when Babe Ruth was reincarnated as Adam Kennedy, a team
without a superstar accomplished what so many All-Stars and Hall of
Famers passing through Anaheim could not. There are no individual
honors so great, closer Troy Percival suggested, as the honor
conferred upon the Angels on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Angel immortality," Percival said, "for this entire team."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy became the fifth player to hit three home runs in a
postseason game, a short list that includes Ruth and Reggie Jackson.
In a 13-5 thumping of the Minnesota Twins, Kennedy hit solo home runs
in the third and fifth innings, then hit the three-run homer that put
the Angels ahead for good in a 10-run seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, formerly known as the guy the Angels got for Jim Edmonds,
will henceforth be known as the guy who powered the Angels into the
World Series. The Hall of Fame called for his bat. The red sea of
44,835 demanded a curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   And no longer will the Angels be known solely for an
awful history, for sorrows known to Angel fans by shorthand--one strike
away, one win away, 11-game lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Good things always happened to someone else," said coach Joe
Maddon, whose Angel career started as a minor league catcher in 1975.
"It's so wonderful to lay our negative history to rest and build a
new history starting today."</TE>
<TE>   The baseball gods paid the Angels back Sunday, and how. A
black-and-white portrait of the team's founding owner, Gene Autry,
hung from the suite occupied by his widow, Jackie. The ceremonial
first pitches were thrown out by three of Autry's favorite players --
Jim Fregosi, Bobby Knoop and Buck Rodgers, who returned as manager
and nearly gave his life for the team in 1992, when the team bus
crashed and he was seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still the cowboy's team," Rodgers said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Langston, Autry's last major free-agent signing in 1989,
visited the clubhouse. Gary Di- Sarcina, the team leader through the
lost decade of the 1990s, called to extend congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   And, although Gene Autry passed away four years ago, Jackie Autry
smiled, drenched in champagne. Autry's boys were in the World Series.
Finally, they had won one for the cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he's watching it from somewhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As shortstop David Eckstein caught the last out, a pop fly hit by
Tom Prince, the Angels erupted in celebration. The players piled atop
Percival, and the pile oozed toward first base and slowly broke up.
Brothers Bengie and Jose Molina, the Angel catchers, hugged. Percival
escorted his protege, rookie Francisco Rodriguez, to the mound and
embraced him there.</TE>
<TE>   After the party moved inside the clubhouse, several players
returned to the field, doffing their new American League championship
caps to the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia gave the championship trophy to Salmon, who
has known nothing but frustration since making his major league debut
with the Angels in 1992. Salmon ran a victory lap around the warning
track, thrusting the trophy toward seemingly each and every fan.</TE>
<TE>   "You always hear those stories about one strike away,"
Salmon said. "I know this is not the World Series trophy, but this is
huge. I wanted the fans to be part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for them. They've been through so much pain
and frustration. It's nice to give something back to them. It couldn't
get much sweeter than that it happened here."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won the best-of-seven series, four games to one. If
they're not the best team in the major leagues -- and who's to say
they're not? -- they're the hottest team, at the most important time.
In dismissing the Twins and New York Yankees from the playoffs, the
Angels went 7-2. They hit .376 against the Yankees. They outhomered
the Twins, 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1929 World Series, the Philadelphia A's pounded out 10 hits
in one inning, setting a postseason record that stood alone for 73
years.</TE>
<TE>   Until now. In 2002, the Angels collected 10 hits in an inning
twice, in the game that eliminated the Yankees and in the game that
eliminated the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Victory did not come easily, despite the score. The Twins
rallied to take a 5-3 lead in the seventh inning, scoring against the
suddenly mortal Rodriguez on a bases-loaded walk and bases-loaded
wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott Spiezio singled to start the bottom of the seventh, and
Bengie Molina singled too. Kennedy, who does not start against
left-handers, fouled off a bunt against left-hander Johan Santana.
Then he took a full swing, another foul.  Then he took a full swing and
homered, his third home run of the game in the biggest game of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "My first reaction was, this just doesn't happen," center fielder
Darin Erstad said. "I was about ready to pass out."</TE>
<TE>   For Kennedy, the most valuable player in the series, and for the
rest of the Angels, the World Series starts Saturday at Edison Field.
For Mo Vaughn, who bellowed in spring training that "they ain't got
no flags hanging at friggin' Edison Field," that American League
pennant ought to put to rest once and for all the notion that you can
either play for the Angels or play for a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no more 'we can't get it done,' " Percival said. "We've
got it done this far. We've got four more games to win."</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Three overtime games this season toughened the Buffalo Bills for just
the kind of comeback they engineered against the Houston Texans.</LD>
<LD>   Drew Bledsoe, the NFL's leading passer, threw two touchdown passes
in the final 10:39 and Travis Henry rushed for 159 yards and
touchdowns of one and 23 yards, leading the Bills to a 31-24 victory
on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We just have tremendous confidence in each other and it all
starts with Drew," wide receiver Peerless Price said. "With him we
knew we can win."</LD>
<TE>   Houston (1-4) dueled with Buffalo (3-3) into the fourth quarter,
taking a 24-17 lead on a halfback pass from James Allen to Billy
Miller, a former USC receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe and the Bills, who had also trailed 17-3 in the game,
didn't flinch.</TE>
<TE>   He connected with Eric Moulds, the NFL's leading receiver, for a
23-yard touchdown pass on a drive aided by two 15-yard penalties
against Texan linebacker Jay Foreman.</TE>
<TE>   The most costly penalty was a taunting call on third down
following an incomplete pass at Buffalo's 34 that gave the Bills a
first down.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't believe that I did it," Foreman said. "It was a
selfish play. I feel real bad. The last two weeks we've had 56 guys
working hard, and then a stupid, bonehead play on my part helps them
score, and that's the touchdown that ties it."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe broke the tie with 3:55 remaining on a 26-yard touchdown
pass to Price, who caught the ball, did a backstep and ran past
safety Matt Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   "We always have the confidence that if there's time on the clock,
we can come back," Bledsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe completed 19 of 33 passes for 254 yards, his lowest output
of the season. Price led the Bills with eight catches for 121 yards.</TE>

<LD>Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "John Daly has the reputation of
being wildly inconsistent, but he's never posted scores like this in
the same week: four over par, one over par and 400,000 under par.</LD>
<LD>   "Those represent his rounds Wednesday and Thursday at the PGA Las
Vegas Classic -- and his luck playing high-limit slot machines at
Bally's on the Strip on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Daly, playing $100 and
$500 slots, was on the green to the tune of almost $2 million before
walking out with $400,000."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the USC season rushing record, including
bowl games?</TE>
<TE>   Durable: Greg Cote in the Miami Herald: "Sunday marked Green Bay
quarterback Brett Favre's 163rd consecutive NFL start.</TE>
<TE>   "That has shattered the all-time record for the game's most
volatile position -- a number nearly 100 games beyond that of the
second-longest active QB streak, 68, by Colt Peyton Manning.</TE>
<TE>   "Favre's streak might be as safe as Cal Ripken's in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Old-timers' reunion: Joe Stein of the San Diego Union-Tribune
points out that it has been 30 years since George Allen coached his
Over the Hill Gang to Super Bowl VII.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's second coming of the OHG is in Oakland, where the
Raiders have the same number of thirtysomething players (16) as the
Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   There's a connection: Allen's son, Bruce, is an executive with the
Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Ready Teddy: UCLA tailback Ted Narleski's recent induction into
the UCLA Hall of Fame was a reminder of his outstanding game against
USC in 1950. Narleski scored three touchdowns in UCLA's 39-0 rout,
the worst conference loss by the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Far-out tales: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Latrell Sprewell's agent said Spree hurt his hand trying to right
the vessel when it was struck by a huge wave. Now the agent admits he
fibbed.</TE>
<TE>   "What really happened was Sprewell hurt his hand hurling a harpoon
to ward off an attack of the monster whale, Moby Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   Big gardening job: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel takes two
shots:</TE>
<TE>   * "I don't really care about Andy Rooney's opinion on female
sideline reporters; I just wish someone would take a pair of hedge
clippers and trim those eyebrows of his."</TE>
<TE>   * "Now that the Cornhuskers are terrible, what are Nebaskans going
to do for entertainment on weekends? Guess it's time to break out
lawn chairs and bug zappers."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Playing a full league schedule, USC has won the Pacific 10
Conference football title outright or shared the conference
championship nine times while finishing with one loss.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Marcus Allen, 2,427 yards, 5.6 average, 1981.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jim Fassel of the New York Giants confiding to Adrian
Wojnarowski of the Bergen (N.J.) Record on the loneliness of being a
head coach: "Sometimes, you're really hurting inside and as the head
coach, there's not a lot of people to sit around and [vent] to.</TE>
<TE>   There's nobody there.... I mean, there's nobody."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,
viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One exception: No
products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: "Baseball as America"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</LD>
<TE>   When: Through Dec. 15</TE>
<TE>   Among the displays in "Baseball as America" is Henry Aaron's 1974
Atlanta Brave home jersey. Resting beneath Aaron's familiar No. 44 is
a 1996 letter from a fan explaining how he chose to name his adopted
son Aaron Henry. The man wrote that he wanted his son to grow up to
be as dignified and proud as Aaron was when he chased Babe Ruth's
all-time home run record.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting the fan's letter is a threatening letter deriding
Aaron's achievements and vowing that no African American would break
Ruth's record.</TE>
<TE>   It is perhaps the most poignant display in the exhibit, which
features a large collection of artifacts that for the first time are
on loan from the Baseball Hall of Fame and Library in Cooperstown,
N.Y. The Aaron display captures the meaning of the American game in a
single, convincing visual. The exhibit also features a number of
significant artifacts that will please both trained eyes and everyday
fans. Among the artifacts is George Brett's bat from the infamous
"pine tar game" in 1983; a T-206 Honus Wagner card, the rarest and
most expensive baseball card; a ball dating to the 1860s said to be
used by Abner Doubleday; and one of Sandy Koufax's four Cy Young
Awards.</TE>
<TE>   But the soul of the exhibit is the interaction between country and
game: a crude home plate fashioned from scrap wood and used in a
World War II Japanese American internment camp; a letter from
Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy smoothly soliciting the political
support of activist Jackie Robinson; a bound copy of the Dowd Report
with the simple inscription "In the Matter of Peter Edward Rose," and
a baseball pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center.</TE>

<HD>Texas' Brown Comes Up With Knee-Jerk Reaction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas Coach Mack Brown's decision to take a knee at the end of
Saturday's first half against Oklahoma was textbook logic and a move
every NFL coach except Steve Spurrier would have made.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, this kind of thinking has no place in the college game
and might prevent Texas from ever winning another national title.</LD>
<LD>   Situation: Oklahoma had just scored a touchdown and two-point
conversion to cut Texas' lead to 14-11 with five seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma botched the ensuing squib kick, however, the ball
bounding straight into a Texas player's arms at midfield with no time
lost on the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of allowing Texas quarterback Chris Simms one free shot at
the end zone, Brown ordered Simms to take a snap and let time expire.</TE>
<TE>   Texas was driving against the wind, Brown reasoned, and was going
to get the ball to open the second half anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like a Hail Mary, at the 50-yard line, into the wind
didn't make sense at the time," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   W-R-O-N-G!</TE>
<TE>   Brown needs to remove his 10-gallon CEO hat and awaken to the
reality that national championships are won with equal parts talent,
luck and serendipity.</TE>
<TE>   In a sport that has no playoff, the payoff can come with a ball
ricocheting off someone's face mask.</TE>
<TE>   In the NFL, five losses get you into the postseason tournament
with a shot to win the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In college, five losses get you fired with a shot to become an
analyst for ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   So, when you have a chance to score in the college game, you try
to score.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming Simms can heave the ball 50-plus yards, even into a wind,
what's the harm? Standing at the end of that Simms pass could have
been Roy Williams, a future top-10 NFL pick who stands 6 feet 4, and
maybe, just maybe, could have out-jumped a couple Sooners for the
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Kordell Stewart and Michael Westbrook if Hail Mary plays work.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Brown and Oklahoma's Bob Stoops is Stoops
seems to understand you never leave an opportunity on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, trailing Missouri by a point, Stoops could have taken
the lead with a fourth-quarter field goal but instead faked the kick
and scored the game-winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, down by 11 in the first half, Stoops went for it on
fourth and two at the Texas eight when a field goal might have been
the smart play.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, quarterback Nate Hybl's hard count got a Texas freshman
to jump offside, giving Oklahoma first and goal. The Sooners turned
three points into eight.</TE>
<TE>   The college coaching creed ought to be: take a shot and maybe
we'll be lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has won 28 consecutive games, but would not have won the
national title last year if not for a lucky bounce, a Boston College
pass that caromed off a Miami cornerback's knee into the arms of a
defensive tackle, who turned this plum into an 80-yard interception
return in an 18-7 win.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Miami escaped with a one-point win when another Florida
State kicker missed a last-second field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Is Miami lucky or good?</TE>
<TE>   Miami is both.</TE>
<TE>   Never think it beneath you to win a game because the other team's
center sailed a snap over the kicker's head 24 hours after breaking
up with his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Trust fate, assume the improbable can and will happen, hope an
official's blown call will go your way and, most important, watch the
Weather Channel.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Tennessee should have lost a game to Arkansas, but got to
sing "Rocky Top" when the Razorback quarterback fumbled without being
touched. Tennessee went on to win the national title.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Nebraska was able to capture a share of the national
title because, during the regular season, it won a game against
Missouri on a pass that bounced off a player's shoe into the arms of
a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, UCLA probably lost a shot at the national championship
when a hurricane pushed a September game against Miami to December.
Miami was not nearly as good in September as it was later.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Spurrier won his only national title at Florida only
because Texas used a fourth-down play to upset Nebraska in the Big 12
title game. (Note: John Mackovic was the Texas coach then, not
Brown.)</TE>
<TE>   The Texas win knocked Nebraska out of the Sugar Bowl and allowed
Florida to avenge its regular-season loss to Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier was a genius, for sure, but he also wasn't afraid to say,
"God smiled on the Gators today."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Oregon kept its national-title hopes alive because UCLA
missed an extra point and a possible game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   The message? Keep plucking, keep chucking and never play by the
book.</TE>
<TE>   When in doubt, take a chance, not a knee.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   All those terrific marquee matchups changed little in the national
landscape. The only teams eliminated from the championship pool were
two-loss Florida State and Tennessee. Not even Texas, despite its
loss to Oklahoma, has been eliminated from contention.</TE>
<TE>   We wrote in this space last month that no non-bowl championship
series conference had a chance to earn a spot in one of four BCS
bowls, but now we're scratching our head a bit with Air Force. We had
no idea the Falcons of the Mountain West would race to a 6-0 start
and no inkling Notre Dame would be a top-10 squad when the teams meet
next weekend in Colorado Springs. If Air Force can beat Notre Dame,
there's a chance it can sneak in, although it's still a long shot.
The Falcons are only No. 18 in the Associated Press poll and would
have to finish in the top six of the final BCS standings to secure
one of two automatic at-large spots. The school could be considered
for a spot if it finished ranked in the top 12, but probably
wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame improved to 6-0 with Saturday's win over Pittsburgh,
but had a bad day in the booth. Former Irish player Allen Pinkett,
now a radio analyst for Irish football games, had to apologize for
commenting during the game that a Pitt receiver had fallen as though
felled by a sniper. "I knew when it came out of my mouth that it
wasn't going to sound right," Pinkett told the Chicago Tribune. Yeah,
no kidding. What's more, Pinkett was raised in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb.</TE>

<HD>Miami Sets Record for Being No. 1</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami has itself a record-setting streak -- most consecutive weeks
ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll.</LD>
<LD>   The Hurricanes, who extended the nation's longest winning streak
to 28 games with a 28-27 victory over Florida State, remained in the
top spot Sunday for a record 19th straight poll.</LD>
<LD>   In voting by the 74 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP
panel, Miami received 65 first-place votes and 1,841 points.</LD>
<TE>   Miami took over at No. 1 on Oct. 14, 2001, and remained there for
the final 10 polls and won the national title. The Hurricanes (6-0)
have been first in all nine polls this season, starting out as the
preseason No. 1 pick.</TE>
<TE>   USC and Miami were tied for most consecutive polls at No. 1. The
Trojans were No. 1 for 14 weeks in 1972 and the first four weeks in
1973.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of movement in the rankings. The most significant
was Iowa State moving into the top 10 for the first time at No. 9,
and Florida dropping out after being in 209 consecutive polls.</TE>
<TE>   Florida (4-3), 36-7 losers to Louisiana State, had taken over the
longest-running poll streak from Nebraska, which dropped out three
weeks ago after a record run of 348 in a row. The current leader is
Michigan at 71 straight polls.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma, with a 35-24 win over Texas, remained No. 2, while the
Longhorns fell five places to No. 8. The Sooners received the
remaining nine first-place votes and 1,776 points. Virginia Tech,
which beat Boston College, 28-23, Thursday night, moved up to No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn and Wisconsin also dropped out with Colorado, Alabama and
Bowling Green the new additions, at Nos. 23-25, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green (5-0) made the poll for the first time since Dec. 2,
1985.</TE>
<TE>   The USA Today/ESPN coaches poll has the same first five as the AP.</TE>

<TE>   Timmy Chang threw two quick touchdown passes to key a 42-point
first quarter as Hawaii defeated Nevada, 59-34, Saturday night in a

possessions. The 42 points fell seven short of the NCAA record for
one quarter.</TE>

<LD>I am sitting in the Edison Field press box. The Thunder Stix are
still pounding, the champagne has begun to spray in the clubhouse and
Tim Salmon, a rock of stability amid so many years of instability, is
circling the diamond, holding the American League championship trophy
over his head, symbolically capturing the pinnacle moment in 41 years
of Angel history.</LD>
<LD>   For someone who was there at the start (and dare I acknowledge
that march of time?), for someone who was sitting in the bar at the
Lord Baltimore Hotel the night before the Angels played their first
game in 1961 and saw Paul Richards, the Oriole manager, slip an arm
around Gene Autry's shoulders and say, "Cowboy, I love you, but
starting tomorrow we're going to kick your ... ," I can't help but
feel a sweep of emotions seep through the cynicism and dispassion
that is the byproduct of being present for all or part of every Angel
season.</LD>
<LD>   The boss, of course, won't like that.</LD>
<TE>   He won't like his national baseball writer acknowledging a degree
of emotion, being touched personally by this Angel accomplishment,
but it is difficult to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   It is like Jim Fregosi, once a teenage Angel shortstop on his way
to becoming an All-Star and ultimately managing the Angels to their
first division title in 1979, was saying before joining Buck Rodgers
and Bobby Knoop in delivering the ceremonial first pitch Sunday. He
said that for anyone who has ever been involved with the Angels, who
is familiar with the heartaches and the mismanagement and the
improbable litany of injuries and deaths, that "seeing them reach the
World Series for the first time is special, indeed."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to escape the lure of this 2002 team and its
displays of heart and fortitude, traits absent in so many other Angel
summers. It is difficult to avoid seeing -- in players like Shawn
Wooten, Ben Weber, Brendan Donnelly and the clutch Scott Spiezio --
the same frustrations of so many of those Angel summers and how their
spirits finally came together this year.</TE>
<TE>   I mean, how can you not be drawn to the personality of a team that
the late Bill Rigney, who almost led the Angels to a 1962 pennant, or
Gene Mauch, who came so close in the controversial playoffs of 1982
and '86, would have admired (as Mauch has said he does). This team
has the same grass-stained passion and fundamental approach that
mirrors their own teams.</TE>
<TE>   No, the Angels of 2002 do not have the zany characters that the
Angels of '62 did.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Rigney liked to say that if they had won the pennant
that year he would never have been able to find all of his
celebrating players in time for the World Series. The 2002 team may
not have a Bo Belinsky or Dean Chance keeping the manager up all
night with his escapades, may not have a Leon Wagner or Art Fowler or
Lee Thomas turning every bus ride into a comedy hour, but who can't
admire the intensity of Troy Percival, the hustle of David Eckstein,
the confidence of Jarrod Washburn, the sweet stroke of Garret
Anderson, the electricity of Francisco Rodriguez, the leadership of
Darin Erstad?</TE>
<TE>   Who can't be attracted to how it has all come together under Mike
Scioscia and his staff?</TE>
<TE>   I make no apologies.</TE>
<TE>   It is the price of 41 years on the beat, of barren Angel seasons
in the stands and standings.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the camera of the mind is blurred by a sea of red.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I see Adam Kennedy bring equality to that trade for Jim
Edmonds and mimic Mr. October with three home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I see the Angels wipe out the Minnesota Twins in five games
after wiping out the New York Yankees in four, batting around every
weekend in this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I see Percival (and wouldn't it have been different for Mauch
in '82 and '86 if he had been blessed with Scioscia's bullpen?) put a
bottle of champagne on the Edison Field mound and I see Salmon with
that championship trophy. How can it be anything but an emotional tug
and the highlight moment for a franchise that so often changed
managers, general managers and philosophies, one year building from
within, the next cornering the market on free agents, allowing Nolan
Ryan to leave, bringing in Reggie Jackson, always trying to "win one
for the cowboy before it was too late."</TE>
<TE>   Well, it didn't happen for the cowboy, whose resiliency and
passion always seemed to overshadow the fact that he may not have
always had a firm hand on his organization's reins, but the Angels
won this year. They received their championship trophy from an
honorary American League president named Jackie Autry because they
got serious about stability under former general manager Bill Bavasi
and scouting director Bob Fontaine Jr., drafting and developing the
nucleus of the current team despite financial restrictions during the
last years of the Autry regime and the current Disney ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Stoneman, who succeeded Bavasi in 1999, has enhanced the
nucleus, and gone now are 16 years of ghosts, 41 years of
frustration. The Parade of Agony is over. On Sunday, Tom Prince, who
was to be the last batter of the game, hit a foul ball that caromed
into the press box and was rolling on the floor when I picked it up.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues called it the appropriate souvenir, my 41-year reward,
from Baltimore in April of '61 to Anaheim in October of 2002. I don't
agree.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry boss, but my reward was Salmon with that trophy.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 6 IN THE NFL MIKE PENNER</KH>
<HD>Rams Become Trailblazers Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You never could rely on the Raiders and the Rams when they were here,
so should anything be different now?</LD>
<LD>   Pre-game tale of the tape:</LD>
<LD>   Won-lost records: Raiders 4-0, Rams 0-5.</LD>
<TE>   Average points scored per game: Raiders 40.5, Rams 14.8.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks physically unable to play: Raiders 0, Rams two.
Quarterbacks going head-to-head: the Raiders' Rich Gannon, bidding
for his fourth consecutive 350-yard passing game, versus the Rams'
Marc Bulger, bidding to survive his first NFL start.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, this was a bigger mismatch than Los Angeles versus the
moving vans, 1995. Bigger than "Today's Round-Table Debate: Georgia
Frontiere versus Al Davis on the merits of the passing game."</TE>
<TE>   Final score from St. Louis: Rams 28, Raiders 13.</TE>
<TE>   One week after scoring 49 points against Buffalo and two weeks
after scoring 52 points against Tennessee, the Raiders managed two
field goals and a meaningless fourth-quarter touchdown against a
banged-up Ram defense that had launched a full-scale retreat in a
37-13 loss to San Francisco seven days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, forced into the lineup because of injuries to Kurt Warner
and Jamie Martin, pierced the Raider defense for three touchdown
passes en route to an economical, efficient 14-for-21 performance and
186 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   Who is Marc Bulger, and what is he doing taking down the NFL's
last undefeated team?</TE>
<TE>   He's a second-year pro from West Virginia, originally drafted by
New Orleans in the sixth round in 2000 and did not play a down for
the Rams in 2001. He spent a lot of time watching Warner, and
evidently he's a bright kid, because after losing, Raider Coach Bill
Callahan paid Bulger the ultimate backhanded compliment: "He
understands the system."</TE>
<TE>   Intriguingly, Bulger made his historic debut on the same day
Raider wide receiver Jerry Rice turned 40. There's a chance these two
events are not totally disconnected. For those wondering if the
Raiders' old legs and lungs would hold up through Christmas, the
answer may have been provided Sunday: They might not make it through
Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams also won on the same day the Minnesota Vikings defeated
the Detroit Lions, 31-24, at the Metrodome. The Rams and Vikings, two
playoff perennials waiting until Columbus Day Weekend for their first
victories of the 2002 season. Ordinarily, no victory over the Lions
is worthy of celebration, but the Vikings doused Coach Mike Tice,
oh-for-the-NFL no longer, as they moved from 0-4 to 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   Thus on Sunday, the football team from Minnesota ended a
season-opening losing streak at four games as the baseball team from
Minnesota concluded a four-game losing streak. Tough times in those
Twin Cities -- the Twins' season is over, the Vikings still have much
to do before they salvage theirs. Go you Timberwolves!</TE>
<TE>   Victories by the Rams and the Vikings left the NFL with only one
winless team after six weeks, and you didn't need six weeks to figure
out the last team standing would be the Cincinnati Bengals. The
Bengals lost to Pittsburgh, 34-7, dropping them to 0-6 for the fifth
time since 1991. Coaches change, quarterbacks change, divisions
change, but the Bengals are always there when you need them, as the
1-3 Steelers most definitely did.</TE>
<TE>   "They did us a favor out there, let's face it," said Steeler
safety Lee Flowers after intercepting Bengal quarterback Jon Kitna
twice to double his career interception total.</TE>
<TE>   Trying his best not to bite the hand that had just fed him,
Flowers did what he could to be kind to Kitna, who was sacked five
times and intercepted three times. "Not bad-mouthing Kitna," he
began, before deciding to bad-mouth him anyway, "but I thought he
made some bad throws. It wasn't like we had to make great breaks on
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   This was volatile stuff, bulletin-board fodder, remarks to be
stored away and used for inspiration the next time Cincinnati and
Pittsburgh get together.</TE>
<TE>   Except these are the Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Kitna pretty much agreed with Flowers, maintaining that he had
never played a worse game in his life, and "I've been playing since
the fifth grade."</TE>
<TE>   Kitna's blocking back, Lorenzo Neal, on hand to lend emotional
support, added, "We're the laughing stock of the league. It's
embarrassing. It's a disgrace. Teams just look at you with no
respect."</TE>
<TE>   The traditional routes of franchise improvement aren't working for
the Bengals. Trades backfire. They sign the wrong free agents. The
Bengal war room on draft day sounds like a Comedy Central pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the Bengals need to look for players in different
places.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the Bengals need to sign some New Jersey Red Dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, they were beaten by a quarterback, Tommy Maddox, who used
to play for the Red Dogs, indoors, for the Arena League. Maddox, who
threw for 62 touchdowns for the Dogs in 2000, completed 16 of 25
passes for 216 yards in the rout of the Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox's favorite target that season in New Jersey? Wide receiver
Michael Lewis, who scored 15 touchdowns for the Dogs in 2000 and had
356 combined return and receiving yards Sunday in the Saints' 43-27
triumph over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among those 356 yards: a 90-yard kickoff return for a touchdown
and an 83-yard punt return for a touchdown. Lewis also had a 58-yard
pass reception to set up a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Long live the New Jersey Red Dogs ... except that proud franchise
has been defunct for more than a year. They've gone to a better
place, or at least a better place than the Bengals find themselves
today.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy Builds His Own Kind of Camelot as MVP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments before the defining moment of his career, Adam Kennedy was
still searching for definition.</LD>
<LD>   Seventh inning, left-hander Johan Santana on the mound for the
Minnesota Twins, Kennedy wandered behind the dugout and into the
underground batting cages.</LD>
<LD>   There stood platoon-mate Benji Gil, taking his hacks.</LD>
<TE>   "You batting for me?" he asked Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Even after hitting two home runs in his first two plate
appearances, Kennedy didn't believe.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the trailing Angels put their first two hitters on base
against Santana and it was time for him to leave the on-deck circle,
Kennedy wasn't certain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never really sure," he said, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he knows. Today, all of a monkey-tied and balloon-burned
Orange County knows.</TE>
<TE>   Unusually, Kennedy batted.</TE>
<TE>   Stunningly, after failing to bunt the ball four feet, he clobbered
it 400 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, a guy not even considered versatile enough to play
every day will now play forever in the record books.</TE>
<TE>   Babe Ruth, George Brett, Reggie Jackson, Bob Robertson and Adam
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   They are the only players to hit three homers in a postseason
game, but only Kennedy's shots were powerful enough to haul 41 years
of misery into a World Series.</TE>
<TE>   His final three-run blast in Game 5 Sunday gave the Angels the
lead for good in a 13-5 clinching victory over the Twins in the
American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   As the ball sailed over the right-center field fence, Edison
Field's red tide crashed while first-base coach Alfredo Griffin threw
up his hands and nearly collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, this can't be happening, this is not real," Griffin
said.</TE>
<TE>   What's not to believe?</TE>
<TE>   A third home run by someone who was initially supposed to bunt?</TE>
<TE>   A third home run by a left-handed hitter against a left-handed
pitcher who had retired him all seven of the previous times they had
dueled?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the 0-and-2 count that made Griffin feel faint.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it was something about a guy being voted ALCS most
valuable player even though he was benched for one of the five games.</TE>
<TE>   To add to the intrigue, the first person to hug Kennedy when he
reached the dugout was Gil, a right-handed hitter who usually
replaces him against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the amazement, a guy who just hit three home runs in a
postseason game is not sure if he'll start the next one.</TE>
<TE>   OK, Mike Scioscia, what if your opponent in the World Series
opener starts a left-hander?</TE>
<TE>   "We'll talk about that," said Scioscia with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe by then, Kennedy's fixed stare and frozen grin will thaw.</TE>
<TE>   While most of the other Angels spent their postgame celebration in
a raucous, weeping, tequila-swigging delirium, Kennedy spent it in
shock.</TE>
<TE>   When his teammates returned to the field to thank the fans,
Kennedy remained in the clubhouse, initially to receive his MVP
trophy, but later because he just didn't know where to go.</TE>
<TE>   To hit nearly half as many homers in one postseason game as you
did in the regular season -- seven -- is understandably confusing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is surreal," he said quietly while riding an elevator to the
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   For the obscure player who symbolizes this unknown team, there was
no better word.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was traded here from the St. Louis Cardinals for cocky Jim
Edmonds. He doesn't talk much. He doesn't play every day because the
club is not convinced he can hit left-handers. He is not happy, but
he doesn't complain.</TE>
<TE>   "I struggled with it last year, but I realized, that doesn't
work," said this Riverside-reared son of a coach. "Now, I come ready
to play every day and just work harder if I don't."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he works too hard. Like Sunday morning, when he
struggled so much during pregame work that he finally walked out of
the batting cage and quit.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see his mind working, and sometimes it works too much,"
batting coach Mickey Hatcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to the plate to lead off the third inning, hitless in his
previous nine at-bats, Kennedy approached Hatcher with a request.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have repeatedly urged him to be more patient at the
plate when leading off an inning, but, just this once, couldn't he
please ... ?</TE>
<TE>   Said Hatcher: "He asked, 'Can I swing at the first pitch?' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Kennedy: "Mickey said, 'If you feel like it, do it.' ... And
I felt like it."</TE>
<TE>   First pitch, home run to right.</TE>
<TE>   Two innings later, home run to right-center.</TE>
<TE>   "I grabbed him in the dugout and said, 'Bro, I've seen thousands
of guys hit two home runs,' " Gil said. "But if you can hit three,
man, that's really special."</TE>
<TE>   But after Scott Spiezio and Bengie Molina singled to start the
seventh inning, with the Angels trailing, 5-3, who would've thought
that Kennedy would get a chance?</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, Scioscia liked Kennedy in a bunt situation, and he
liked the sound of his line-drive out against Santana on Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "When he swings the bat well, he can hit anybody," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   So the bunt attempt came first. But when it was fouled off,
Scioscia surprised everyone again by taking off the sign.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sciosica: "They were pitching for a bunt. We thought it was
good to let Adam turn it loose."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spiezio: "I got to give him huge credit to take that bunt
off. He thought Adam's concentration would go up after missing the
first one."</TE>
<TE>   It was a matter of a manager knowing his players, even if that
player is sometimes still unsure.</TE>
<TE>   Two foul balls later, when he knocked a hanging slider out of the
yard, the usually stoic Kennedy shouted in surprise.</TE>
<TE>   When Gil found him in the middle of the champagne-splattered
clubhouse, they hugged for what seemed like forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see it in him today," Gil said. "Earlier, when he asked
me if I was hitting for him, I said, 'I don't know, bro. But I hope
not.' "</TE>

<HD>Once Again, Giants Have No Backup Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Houston Mitchell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Giant Coach Jim Fassel knew his team was in trouble the
moment it was learned Michael Vick would not start at quarterback for
the Atlanta Falcons.</LD>
<LD>   Fassel set the tone in his address to the team Wednesday. "We've
been beaten by backup quarterbacks before," he said.</LD>
<LD>   It happened again Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Johnson, a nondescript third-year man, completed 19 of 25
passes for 257 yards, ran for one touchdown and threw for another as
the Falcons beat the Giants, 17-10.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, 1997, the Giants were 1-0 under first-year coach
Fassel when they went to Jacksonville. The Jaguars' top two
quarterbacks, Mark Brunell and Rob Johnson, were injured, so Steve
Matthews -- claimed on waivers from the Chiefs 18 days earlier -- got
the nod.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars won, 40-13. Matthews was 23 of 35 for 252 yards. Other
than that start, Matthews threw eight passes in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Fassel said, "I believe that when a backup comes in, everybody
else steps it up."</TE>
<TE>   Backups had beaten the Giants before Matthews -- Jay Schroeder
with the Washington Redskins in 1985 and Tommy Maddox with the Denver
Broncos in 1992 -- but even considering only Fassel's era, there have
been some whoppers.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 21, 1998, the Dallas Cowboys started Jason Garrett in
place of the injured Troy Aikman for a Monday night game against the
Giants. Garrett, who hadn't started since 1994, passed for 224 yards
and Dallas won, 31-7. Garrett is now a backup for the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are champing at the bit to get a chance to get on the
field," Garrett said this week. "They're going to be ready to play,
and they are going to be dangerous because you don't know as much
about them as the guys you see on film all the time."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 12, 2000, the Giants thought they had caught a break when
the Rams' Kurt Warner sat out with broken finger. Backup Trent Green
threw for four touchdowns and ran for another in a 38-24 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith ran for 59 yards in 13 carries as the Cowboys edged
the Panthers, 14-13. That gives him 365 yards on the season, 175
short of Walter Payton's career record of 16,726 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has been remarkably consistent this season. He has had
between 52 and 70 yards in every game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Rams' left tackle Grant Williams broke his right leg and will
have surgery today.</TE>
<TE>   * Jaguar right tackle Maurice Williams broke his right leg.</TE>
<TE>   * The Giants lost defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, who tore his
right Achilles' tendon.</TE>
<TE>   * Two quarterbacks -- Jacksonville's Mark Brunell and Carolina's
Rodney Peete -- were knocked out of games with concussions.</TE>
<TE>   Among other injuries, Chiefs' defensive tackle Ryan Sims
dislocated an elbow; Lion tight end Mike Ricks injured his groin and
the Saints had two players hurt -- linebacker Charlie Clemons (groin)
and cornerback Michael Hawthorne (lower leg).</TE>

<HD>Iran Defends Title, Wins Asian Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending Asian Games champion Iran retained the gold medal it won in
Bangkok four years ago by defeating Japan, 2-1, Sunday in the 2002
tournament final in Busan, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee,
presented the gold medals to Iran, which won the tournament for a
record fourth time, having also triumphed in 1974, 1990 and 1998.</LD>
<LD>   A goal in the 48th minute by Javad Kazemeyan put the Iranians in
control, although the Japanese looked more like the dangerous team on
several occasions. Mohsen Bayatiniya doubled Iran's lead in the 88th
minute, but Japan stormed back with a deserved goal of its own
through Satoshi Nakayama, the team's offensive standout, 60 seconds
later.</LD>
<TE>   Japan Coach Masakuni Yamamoto brought an under-21 team to the
Asian Games, his intent being to give the players valuable experience
for the 2004 Athens Olympics. Winning the silver medal exceeded even
his own expectations.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea Woes</TE>
<TE>   The future of South Korea Coach Park Hang-Seo appeared uncertain
Sunday even though his team claimed the bronze medal at the Asian
Games with a 3-0 shutout of Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is not the right time to talk about my future as coach of the
national team," said Park, who replaced Dutchman Guus Hiddink after
the World Cup. "I am disappointed that we did not win the gold and I
would like to apologize again to all the people who expected that we
would.</TE>
<TE>   "As I said after the [semifinal] loss to Iran [on penalty kicks
after a 0-0 tie], you cannot compare this team with the World Cup
side. They had two years to prepare and we had only three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's goals Sunday were scored by Park Dong Hyuk, Lee
Chun-Soo, one of five World Cup players in the team, and Choi Tae-Uk.</TE>
<TE>   England Complains</TE>
<TE>   England's Football Assn. said Sunday that it has filed a complaint
with UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, over the racist abuse of
its players by Slovakian fans and the treatment of its own fans by
police in Bratislava during Saturday's 2-1 Euro 2004 qualifying
victory over Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   "We have protested in the strongest possible terms," said Paul
Newman, an FA spokesman. "We also feel that some of the crowd
measures employed by the police were inappropriate to say the least
at times, and we have photographic evidence that will be shown to the
authorities on that issue."</TE>
<TE>   Two England fans were wounded by security guards in a shooting
outside a bar near the team hotel before the game, an incident
witnessed by England Coach Sven Goran Eriksson and several of his
players.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard it," Eriksson told Reuters. "I saw it from my window. I
was watching a tape when I heard shooting and I thought it was
fireworks. I got up and it was like the Wild West."</TE>
<TE>   Another Upset</TE>
<TE>   Club America, the defending Mexican league champion, was beaten
for the second game in a row since the return of Coach Manuel
Lapuente when it lost, 3-2, to Atlas on Saturday night in
Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   Las Aguilas (the Eagles) had been unbeaten in their first 10 games
of the season under interim coach Mario Carillo, but have slipped
since Lapuente returned from a two-month medical leave.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory, on goals by Gabriel Caballero, Rodrigo
Valenzuela and Juan Pablo Rodriguez, was especially satisfying for
Atlas Coach Fernando Quirarte, the former Mexico World Cup player who
recently took charge of the previously struggling team.</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Lipatin and Cuauhtemoc Blanco scored for Club America.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the league's hottest team, the Red Devils of Toluca,
romped to a 5-1 victory over the Jaguars of Chiapas, with
league-leading scorer Jose Saturnino Cardozo of Paraguay grabbing a
second-half hat trick.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Three-Point Plan That Went Awry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA makes a couple of kicks and maybe Bob Toledo can trade the hot
seat that every pundit in America has him occupying for a recliner.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA makes a couple of kicks and maybe the Bruin coach is puffing
on a fat cigar with his feet up today, working the remote and
reviewing a sweet victory over two-time defending Pacific 10
Conference champion Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA makes a couple of kicks and maybe everyone is talking about
Toledo's clever trick play that resulted in a 53-yard touchdown pass,
the emergence of big-play threats Craig Bragg, Tab Perry and Tyler
Ebell, and the continued maturation of a roster full of freshmen and
sophomores.</LD>
<TE>   But an extra-point kick is blocked, a field-goal try is missed in
the last two minutes, Oregon sneaks away with a 31-30 victory, and
every play Toledo called is inspected, dissected and rejected as
idiotic.</TE>
<TE>   Forget that the Bruins were picked to finish sixth in the Pac-10
after losing 23 seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Forget that starters Rodney Leisle, Manuel White and Ben Emanuel
were sidelined because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Forget that a 4-2 record is what any knowledgeable observer could
have expected from this team at this point in a rigorous schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The avalanche has begun.</TE>
<TE>   New Athletic Director Dan Guerrero hasn't been on the job long
enough to find an ax, let alone sharpen it. But this week he will be
deluged with calls for Toledo's head.</TE>
<TE>   Two UCLA boosters with enough clout to merit seats in the
press-box area weighed in moments after Toledo had called a fake
field goal on fourth and 15 in the third quarter, with Chris Griffith
lined up for a 45-yard attempt that could have given UCLA a
nine-point lead. The Bruins picked up only eight yards.</TE>
<TE>   Booster No. 1: "Stupid. Stupid. Stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Booster No. 2: "Ab-so-lute-ly un-be-lieve-a-ble."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the move qualified as stupid is certainly
debatable, but those who know Toledo know that this is one coach who
doesn't like field goals, even when his kicker is reliable.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, is inexplicably slumping after three solid
seasons. But he tried only 13 field goals last season, 14 in 2000 and
18 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He made 34 of the 45, including a respectable nine of 15 from more
than 40 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Given a choice, though, Toledo often goes for it on fourth down or
will try a fake.</TE>
<TE>   And when the kicker gives him reasonable doubt--Griffith was only
six for 10 entering the game and had an extra-point kick blocked
minutes earlier--the coach would rather put the outcome in the hands
of his offense than the fickle foot of fate.</TE>
<TE>   However, none of that addresses why Toledo's play-calling became
conservative during the last drive, the one that ended with Griffith
missing from 46 yards with 1:54 to play.</TE>
<TE>   By way of explanation, Toledo made three points.</TE>
<TE>   The running game was finally clicking. Ebell had eclipsed 100
yards rushing and five runs early in the drive netted 35 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Also, UCLA wanted to whittle down the clock so Oregon would have
less time to retaliate after a score.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Bruins finally reached field-goal range, the coach
didn't call a deep pass because he wanted to avoid the possibility of
a sack.</TE>
<TE>   So Ebell ran twice, losing three yards, and Cory Paus misfired on
a pass to Brag that would have gained only five yards, bringing up
fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's worst nightmare, the one he'd relived since going through
a nearly identical scenario a year ago in a one-point loss to the
Ducks, was realized.</TE>
<TE>   Those three points Toledo made to justify his strategy? He needed
three more from Griffith to avoid them sounding hollow.</TE>

<LD>Like that white horse familiar to USC fans, the Trojan running game
galloped into the Coliseum on Saturday and rekindled a sense of power
and pride.</LD>
<LD>   It was a brief flashback to past triumphs, when USC routinely ran
the ball down the throats of opponents behind what seemed like an
endless procession of stellar tailbacks -- Garrett, Simpson, Bell,
White, Allen.</LD>
<LD>   But as any USC fan can attest, the running game has been more miss
than hit in recent seasons. Just like the horse, which appears and
then retreats into the tunnel after a USC touchdown, the running game
has frequently disappeared after showing signs of becoming a force.</LD>
<TE>   So, what will be different this time? After the Trojans' rushing
success in a 30-28 victory over California, it's difficult to tell.
If nothing else, they appear to have settled on a tailback who gives
them the best chance of moving the ball.</TE>
<TE>   By rushing for 176 yards in 39 carries, Sultan McCullough may have
ended USC's tailback-by-committee experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like rotations," McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   USC shouldn't either. Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   When the season started, Coach Pete Carroll said he wanted to give
his three senior tailbacks -- McCullough, Justin Fargas and Malaefou
MacKenzie -- a chance to run the ball. With MacKenzie becoming more
of a pass-catching threat and playing some fullback, McCullough and
Fargas split the bulk of the carries in the Trojans' previous games
against Washington State and Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Fargas carried once.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted one guy to get a feel for the game," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Some might question what took so long for coaches to settle on
McCullough. After all, he has been the Trojans' most consistent
rusher the last three seasons. His 176 yards against Cal tied a
career best and was the 11th 100-yard game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   But the former Pasadena Muir High standout has also been
inconsistent. Despite having sprinter's speed, McCullough often has
resembled a jumble of wasted motion -- too many stutter steps and
head fakes; too often running to the outside rather than finding a
seam and cutting downfield.</TE>
<TE>   He was at his best against Cal, running hard and with purpose. It
was the type of effort 19th-ranked USC could use the next two weeks
in pivotal Pacific 10 Conference games against No. 22 Washington and
No. 6 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive line also stepped up against a not-great-but-decent
Cal defense, quieting its critics, at least for a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we were going to run the ball -- there was no option,"
freshman tackle Winston Justice said. "If we were going to win, we
were going to run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   And the Trojans did it the way they used to -- by wearing down
Cal's defensive front.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell on their faces they were giving in," guard Lenny
Vandermade said.</TE>
<TE>   In posting their sixth consecutive victory at the Coliseum, the
Trojans achieved season-high totals for yards (466), rushing attempts
(51) and time of possession (38:32), and tied season bests for first
downs (28) and plays (90).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before USC's running game got going and its defense buckled down,
Cal appeared on its way to a runaway victory. The Golden Bears were
leading, 21-3, in the second quarter and had a first down at the
Trojan 32 when quarterback Kyle Boller fumbled and the ball was
recovered by linebacker Matt Grootegoed.</TE>
<TE>   USC went on to score on four of its next five possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Cal Coach Jeff Tedford said Boller had injured his left
(non-passing) hand on the first series and re-injured it after he
fumbled.</TE>
<TE>   When it was suggested that the turnover allowed USC to escape
Cal's stranglehold, Tedford disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our foot was only on their throat for a very short time," he
said. "We scored 21 points and after that ... they came back. They're
a great team."</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans can be better, especially early in games, said
receiver Kareem Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "We sputter too much at the beginning of games," Kelly said. "We
can't do that against teams like Washington."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Shaun Cody and offensive tackle Jacob Rogers each
suffered injuries to their right knees Saturday and will undergo MRI
exams today, Carroll said.</TE>
