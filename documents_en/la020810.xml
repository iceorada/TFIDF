<HD>Javier Batiz, a Guitar Legend in Mexico, Reemerges</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* A childhood friend of Santana's, he became a
cult hero even though he stayed home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story starts in Tijuana in the 1950s with two kids who played
together in a rock 'n' roll band, the TJs. They both had dreams. But
one went north and the other went south.</LD>
<LD>   Those choices would make an enormous difference to the careers of
the two budding Mexican guitarists, Carlos Santana and Javier Batiz.
From San Francisco, Santana would emerge as one of the most
influential and celebrated figures in rock history. In Mexico City,
Batiz would find his early success stymied by a conservative social
climate hostile to the growth of rock music and its rebel culture.</LD>
<LD>   Feeling defeated, Batiz moved back to Tijuana in 1970, just as his
old friend's career was taking off across the border. Though he's
continued to perform and record steadily since, Batiz slipped into
relative anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Nicknamed El Brujo (the Wizard), he became a cult figure unknown
even to the new generation of Mexican rockers who started to flourish
in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Santana, however, never forgot the effect of seeing El Brujo play
for the first time one Sunday afternoon in the kiosk of a Tijuana
park.</TE>
<TE>   "The first electric guitar I heard was Batiz's," Santana has said.
"I was listening to the sound of the guitar and I thought ..., 'Man,
this is my future.' "</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old Batiz, who gives a rare Southern California
performance tonight at the Museum of Latin American Art in Long
Beach, is enjoying a modicum of new recognition. Aficionados looking
for the real roots of rock history in Mexico are increasingly finding
Batiz and his blazing guitar at the source.</TE>
<TE>   Although some still believe that Mexican rock started in the '80s
with groups such as Cafe Tacuba and El Tri, Batiz was actually at the
birth of the country's rock scene two decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Batiz looks as if he's been cryogenically frozen. He's as trim as
a teenager, with a huge frizzy Afro that smacks of Sly &amp; the Family
Stone.</TE>
<TE>   Through the beard and bush of hair, his skin appears barely
wrinkled. He speaks almost perfect English, but with a heavy accent.</TE>
<TE>   When he hams it up, which is often, everything he says sounds
funny. Even his tribute to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I'm an icon in Mexico--Batiz. Whoooo!" he said during an
interview this week at the museum.</TE>
<TE>   But his light mood can turn suddenly serious. His eyes well up
with tears when recounting the discovery of his musical talent as a
child. His widowed mother, an English teacher who loved to sing at
home with friends and relatives, taught him to play his first four
chords on his guitar. The rest just came to him, as if by magic.</TE>
<TE>   "When it dawned on me, 'God, why am I playing like this? Why am I
singing like this?' I have a range of four octaves, I play my guitar
like nobody else plays, I was 12 years old and nobody taught me.
Why?"</TE>
<TE>   He's struggles to hold back the feeling before giving the answer.
"God," he says finally. "Only God."</TE>
<TE>   God, and the blues in his blood.</TE>
<TE>   Batiz fell in love with American blues artists by accident when he
happened to tune to a maverick show late at night on a Tijuana
station, broadcast from a ship off the coast of Rosarito, as he
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   With his band the TJs, he loved to play the music of Little
Richard and Fats Domino. Batiz says he persuaded a teenage Santana to
play bass in the band, in exchange for guitar lessons. (The
superstar's manager could not confirm the recollection.)</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the two Tijuana kids shared a lifelong love for the
roots of rock. A few years ago, Batiz says, Santana gave him a rare
copy of a song they liked to play together, "Watch Your Step" by
Little Bobby Parker, who grew up in East L.A.'s R&amp;B scene during the
'50s. Santana reportedly picked up the record on a trip to Sweden and
saved it for his old friend.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Batiz had his first hit with a version of Chuck Berry's
"Memphis, Tennessee." He rode the country's rock wave, la onda
roquera, until it came crashing down after a Woodstock-style music
festival held in 1971 at Avandaro. Mexican society was freaked out by
the images of their youth skinny-dipping, smoking pot and swearing in
public.</TE>
<TE>   From that point on, says Batiz, rock was seen as a threat to
society. When work dried up, some continued to play at improvised,
underground places known as Hoyos Funkies, or Funky Holes.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost everything," he recalls. "All the riches and the limos
and the houses, and even the marriages, because we couldn't work
anymore. A lot of groups disintegrated, and it took 20 years to get
back again."</TE>
<TE>   A beaten-down Batiz returned to Tijuana, writing a hit song from
the experience, titled "Coming Home." After his mother died, he
bought his childhood home where he now lives with his wife and
daughter, Charleena, 8.</TE>
<TE>   Batiz admires the energy and innocence of youth. And he's hopeful
new talent will have an easier time getting recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people coming forward now," he says of Mexico's
new rock talent, "so that before everything is taken for
granted--again!--a lot more people can say, 'Listen, this is what I
play.' "</TE>
<TE>   Javier Batiz plays today at the Museum of Latin American Art, 628
Alamitos Ave., Long Beach, 7:30 p.m. $25. (562) 437-1689.</TE>

<HD>A New Shell for the Bowl Delayed Until at Least '04</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last summer, representatives of Hollywood Bowl and its main tenant,
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., grudgingly acknowledged that an
ongoing legal battle with local preservationists would delay plans to
replace the 73-year-old trademark white orchestra shell with an
acoustically superior shell. The new and improved Bowl, they said,
would be forced to postpone its opening from July 2002 to July 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Make that 2004--at least.</LD>
<LD>   The latest move in the shell game took place on Thursday, when
both sides argued their case in the state Court of Appeal. But
regardless of the appellate court ruling--a decision from the
justices could take up to 90 days--delays caused by the legal process
mean it's already too late to ramp up to begin construction on the
new orchestra shell in time for the 2003 Bowl season.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a long lead time in ordering of items, and there is
off-site construction required--and then you have to take down the
old shell," said Patricia Mitchell, chief executive officer of the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. "There wouldn't be time to get all
that done before the 2003 season." Mitchell said that construction
would have to begin right after the Bowl summer season ends in late
September for a new shell to be in place for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Craig Hodgetts, whose Culver City firm Hodgetts &amp; Fung
Design Associates designed the new shell, agreed. The new structure
will require 482 tons of steel. And, as was the case last year, the
steel would have to be ordered now--preferably several months ago--to
begin construction after the Bowl season. Such a step will not be
taken while the matter remains tied up in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing something back is always an effort," Hodgetts said.
"There's certain time and energy that has to go into getting it back
up to speed."</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied a request
by preservationist Robert Nudelman, president of Hollywood Heritage,
and another preservationist group, Friends of the Santa Monica
Mountains Parks and Seashore, to halt construction on the shell. The
plaintiffs filed an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments presented in court Thursday were a virtual reprise of
last year's conflict. Attorneys representing Los Angeles County,
which owns the Bowl, and the Philharmonic maintained that the white
shell is deteriorating, is too small and does not provide proper
orchestral acoustics, leaving orchestra members unable to hear each
other. A full orchestra cannot fit under the dome, they argued,
leaving players and their expensive instruments vulnerable to sun and
rain.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have said they exhausted all possible options for
preserving the existing shell before reaching the conclusion that the
structure had to be scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lawrence Teeter, attorney for Nudelman and the others,
argued that replacing the old shell rather than figuring out a way to
renovate it is like "preserving the Statue of Liberty by destroying
it and putting up new statue with a torch and a book." He argued that
history can be preserved and acoustics improved at the same time, if
the builders adopt what the preservationists call their "maximum
shell conservation alternative," which calls for adding two more
outer "rings" to the Bowl shell.</TE>
<TE>   Teeter also reiterated a scenario repeatedly denied by the
Philharmonic and Los Angeles County: that the parties want to create
a bigger shell not to serve the orchestra, but to expand the Bowl's
capability to present rock concerts and other pop events.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic's Mitchell said delays could possibly drive up
shell construction costs. "There is an assumed escalation in cost,
and now it will have been delayed for two full years," she said. "On
the other hand, when we put it back out to bid to the subcontractors
in an economic and construction climate that is different, we might
get some relief from that escalation. You don't know until you do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Shell construction will be paid for with $18 million in county
funding approved by voters specifically for that use and for making
other stage improvements. Mitchell said the Philharmonic remains
confident that the funds will be sufficient to cover construction
costs, even with possible increases due to delays.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Parker, the attorney representing Los Angeles County, said
during court arguments that Bowl watchers should take note that the
current troubled state of Los Angeles County finances should not
affect plans to go forward with the project. "The voters approved the
funds," she said. "We can't use it for our health or probation
systems, much as we might like to."</TE>
<TE>   After the appellate court rules on the matter, the dissatisfied
party has the option of seeking a California Supreme Court review of
the matter. James Arnone, attorney for the Philharmonic, calls it
"inconceivable" that the appellate court will rule in favor of
Nudelman and the other plaintiffs. But, he said, if that happens, the
Philharmonic will accept the decision rather than attempting to take
the matter to the higher court.</TE>
<TE>   Teeter, however, says he and his clients are unwilling to accept a
ruling that calls for destruction of the shell. "We are going to the
Supreme Court, without fail," he said.</TE>

<HD>Will Spike Emerge From the Shadows?</HD>
<DH>Television* After 'Buffy's' darkest season ever, she and
her vampire lover may be searching for new ways of confronting their
personal demons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a match made in, well, not heaven. Among the most riveting
developments last season on UPN's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was the
odd pairing of just-back-from-the-dead Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) and the drop-deadly handsome and ageless, platinum-blond
bloodsucker Spike (James Marsters).</LD>
<LD>   Television has rarely seen anything like the passionate, sometimes
violent and abusive relationship between these longtime adversaries,
reluctant allies and, in the series' sixth season, haunted lovers.</LD>
<LD>   It's a long way from the '60s innocence of "Bewitched," on which
sweet witch Samantha had a joyful relationship with mortal husband
Darrin. As recently as the late '80s series "Beauty and the Beast,"
Catherine Chandler managed to find true love in the tunnels of New
York with feline-faced man-beast Vincent.</LD>
<TE>   Heck, Buffy herself spent her first two seasons in puppy love with
Angel (David Boreanaz), the mopey vampire with a soul who eventually
went all evil, was re-redeemed and moved on to his own series.</TE>
<TE>   This was a challenging season for "Buffy," one of television's
most insightful dramas about growing up and female empowerment, with
demons and vampires and the evil they conjure serving as metaphors
for life's many trials.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't simply because the series moved from the WB to UPN.
Buffy was still reeling from the death of her mother, as well as her
own death at the end of the fifth season.</TE>
<TE>   Resurrected by Wiccan Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and reluctantly
alive, she spent much of the season in a depression, unable to enjoy
life after being ripped out of what she called "heaven" by her
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Many critics, and even some longtime fans, thought last season was
too dark for too long, and series creator-executive producer Joss
Whedon has conceded that two of his goals were to have the
increasingly solitary Buffy face the inner demons that accompany
maturity and explore the dark side of her power. The show also toyed
with the notion of its human characters confronting their demon
aspects and demons like Spike and 1,120-year-old vengeance demon Anya
(Emma Caulfield) developing their humanity.</TE>
<TE>   In exploring the morally complex relationship between Buffy and
Spike, Whedon and co-producer Marti Noxon were able to touch darker,
edgier and more sexually oriented story lines. In fact, its
volatility, including steamy and surprisingly graphic sex scenes, was
a constant topic on the multitude of Buffy-related Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   Spike has been called the most creative villain on television, and
he's one of the most striking: a stylish-in-black night stalker with
a killer smile and cheekbones to die for. He also has a bitingly
sarcastic wit (the writers seem to give him many of the best lines),
delivered in a roguish British accent that gave way to a more
homespun Northern California accent (the actor grew up in Modesto)
when Marsters appeared recently as the star attraction at
Shore-Leave, the annual sci-fi fan convention in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Marsters, 29, spent two afternoons signing autographs and fielding
questions from an adoring throng of mostly female admirers who
conceded that Spike may be a psychopathic killer with two Slayers
already under his belt but who believe that he's also incredibly
sensitive and romantic and that maybe, just maybe, Whedon should let
him be redeemed. Already, Spike has gone from loathsome on arrival in
Sunnydale to likable to lovable.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is that Spike has been used in different ways,"
Marsters noted. "He's had different jobs on the show: as disposable
villain, hapless wreck for comedic purposes, wacky neighbor by design
and then love interest."</TE>
<TE>   The actor is thankful that the show's writers "have been forced to
explore the character so Spike would fit into these different roles."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's darker themes were somewhat facilitated by the move to
UPN, Marsters said. "There were a lot of things we couldn't do at the
WB, while UPN gave Marti and Joss a very long leash to explore. It's
an interesting synergy. At the time when Marti was really taking the
reins, we moved to UPN. It seems that Joss' crucible of experience,
the thing that he draws from, is his adolescence, and Buffy is no
longer an adolescent. Marti's crucible seems to have been in her
mid-20s and it's just perfect: Now we have someone who wants to
explore herself with this metaphor. So we get a new head writer and a
new network, all of which facilitates exploring Buffy as a young
adult, plus UPN didn't have so much of a need for us to quell the
darker side."</TE>
<TE>   As last season ended, Spike apparently sought to rid himself of
the implanted pain chip that had neutralized him as a vampire while
leaving him free to kick demon tail. To the audience's, and possibly
to Spike's, surprise, his soul was reinstated in the last episode.</TE>
<TE>   Consequences of that action--whether Buffy will be able to love
Spike-with-a-soul, whether Spike will hate himself after feeling
guilt for centuries of death and torture--will probably be major plot
lines this year.</TE>
<TE>   Plotting is Whedon's job. After signing a new four-year,
$20-million deal with 20th Century Fox Entertainment, Whedon will
continue making "Buffy" and its spinoff, "Angel," for that studio and
produce other new series. The first one up is "Firefly," a sci-fi
fall series for Fox that Whedon described as a space-age western, an
"anti-'Star Trek' " with no aliens. There's also a Saturday morning
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" cartoon for Fox and "Ripper," a spinoff
for the BBC starring Anthony Stewart Head, the English actor who
plays Buffy's "watcher" Giles.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Buffy," whose new season begins Sept. 24, Whedon and Noxon
have let it be known that Amber Benson, who as Tara died last year,
will appear again, and that Head will return for 10 episodes as
Giles. Also reappearing: ditsy vampire Harmony (Mercedes McNab),
flamboyant Hell goddess Glory (Clare Kramer), renegade Slayer Faith
(Eliza Dushku) and Spike's old flame, Drusilla (Juliet Landau).</TE>
<TE>   The biggest comeback will be Sunnydale High, destroyed at the end
of the third season in 1999, now rebuilt and enrolling Buffy's sudden
sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), who is the same age Buffy was
when the show began in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Whedon has said that not only will the show be more positive but
that Buffy "is going to find herself in the position of becoming a
leader.... She's going to have to approach her calling, and her
problems, from a very different perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Marsters, with a lot of theater experience and a few brief guest
appearances on series including "Northern Exposure," made his
entrance in "School Hard," the third episode of "Buffy's" second
season. Spike and his loopy vampire girlfriend, Drusilla, arrived as
the Sid and Nancy of Sunnydale, with Marsters patterned on Sid
Vicious, Billy Idol and "Lost Boys"-era Kiefer Sutherland.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told very bluntly that I'm not going to be here very long:
'Dude, you're going to die, you're cannon fodder,' " Marsters said
with a laugh. "I did one season of 10 episodes and the story arc was
very well completed. And they brought me back for one episode in
Season 3--they often do that with characters for an episode or
two--and I thought, well, maybe I'll get one this year, maybe I'll
get one next year."</TE>
<TE>   By Season 4, Marsters was invited to join the cast full time,
reflecting his huge popularity among fans and growing favor with
Whedon.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that James was great from Day 1," said Whedon. "The
question was how much he would become a part of the show. As writers,
we were getting to know him as a good bad boy. He brings a lot of
soulfulness that's genuine to the role."</TE>
<TE>   He's done a lot of Buffy-esque things this year, including
providing Spike voice-overs for the new animated series as well as
the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" X-Box video game from Fox Interactive.
His character has starred in various "Buffy" comic books, and
Marsters has modeled for his own collectible action figure and
released a CD by his band, Ghost of the Robot.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few obstacles the actor faces is, understandably, the
sun. Spike is necessarily pale, so Marsters, who undergoes painful
peroxide treatments for his hair twice a month, stocks up on sun
block and generally avoids the beach until twilight.</TE>
<TE>   The other challenge is "keeping rail-thin. I've been after a body
type since I got on the show. When I came to L.A., I was 200 pounds
and working out, and then I got the role.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing a vampire for six years, it's hard to be hungry, but I'm
a metaphor for hunger, psychological and sexual. And I noticed that
the only vampires to really hit the American consciousness and stay
there were almost unhealthily thin, with the one exception of the
original, Bela Lugosi."</TE>

<HD>Skirball Concert Opens a Door to Madagascar's Bright Styles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Madagascar has recently been visible in the world music arena
primarily via the scintillating efforts of the group Tarika. But the
island nation off the southeast coast of Africa has a cultural
tradition reaching far beyond the efforts of any single musical
entity.</LD>
<LD>   The performance of guitarist D'Gary at the Skirball Cultural
Center on Thursday offered a fascinating view of one aspect of that
tradition, the tsapiky musical style.</LD>
<LD>   A blending of African and southern Madagascar elements, tinged
with references to early accordion music, the style was, in D'Gary's
gifted hands, brightly melodic and crisply swinging, its groove
enhanced by offbeat rhythmic combinations.</LD>
<TE>   D'Gary's guitar work was inspired by the music of the island's
morovany, a box zither. And his ability to transform its note-rich,
arpeggio-filled approach into an expressive guitar style has earned
him justified praise as an inventive virtuoso.</TE>
<TE>   His playing was further enhanced by the use of open tunings, with
the bottom strings on his guitar lowered to produce big, booming bass
sounds.. His singing was less compelling, although mildly pleasant as
result of the husky, intimate timbre of his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-percussionist Xavier-Martial Francois and singer-dancer
Rataza added considerably more color to the musical mix. Francois'
manipulation of a small shaker was a marvel of subtle rhythmic drive,
and Rataza's penetrating vocals were supplemented--though too
rarely--by some vigorous dance moves.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the extraordinary technical guitar feats that D'Gary
offered in virtually every number, however, the relative sameness of
the music became wearying by the close of the set. Nor was the
performance aided by the detached demeanor of the performers, who
seemed disconnected from the audience and one another.</TE>

<HD>Heston Tells of Disease</HD>
<DH>The actor announces that he has Alzheimer's symptoms but
will continue his NRA and political activism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlton Heston, veteran Oscar-winning actor and president of the
National Rifle Assn., announced Friday that he has symptoms similar
to those of Alzheimer's disease. The announcement was made at a news
conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel via a taped statement from
Heston.</LD>
<LD>   Looking strong and determined, the 77-year-old Heston, who played
such heroic figures as Moses and Ben-Hur during his five-decade film
career, said that despite the announcement, he's "neither giving up
nor giving in. For an actor, there is no greater loss than the loss
of his audience. I can part the Red Sea," he stated, referring to his
role as Moses in the 1956 classic "The Ten Commandments," "but I
can't part with you."</LD>
<LD>   Heston had prerecorded the statement Wednesday. His spokesperson,
Lisa Powers, said Heston wanted to do it by videotape because of the
nature of the announcement. "It is very emotional and personal,"
Powers said. "He wanted to deliver the statement appropriately and in
its entirety."</LD>
<TE>   Heston said he made the announcement now, "because when the time
comes, I might not be able to." He added that he would continue as
president of the NRA--his fourth term will be up in April--and plans
to maintain his political speaking schedule and campaign stumping for
Republican candidates this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But Heston clearly took the occasion to signal a farewell of
sorts. He concluded by quoting William Shakespeare, who wrote his own
farewell through the words of Prospero in "The Tempest":</TE>
<TE>   Be cheerful, sir.</TE>
<TE>   Our revels now are ended. These our actors,</TE>
<TE>   As I foretold you, were all spirits and</TE>
<TE>   Are melted into air, into thin air.</TE>
<TE>   His statement also acknowledged the support of his longtime wife,
Lydia; their children, Fraser and Holly; and their three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke with him this morning, and I think he's a little relieved
that he has told his fans, the media, friends and family," Powers
said. The development regarding his health "has happened within the
last couple of weeks," she added. "He has been talking to his
physicians, and they kind of came to the decision to let the public
know. Mr. Heston would like to work as long as he can."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Heston has been as well known for his
political activism as for his acting. Having been involved with
Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s civil rights movement, he has
taken on a more conservative bent on other issues in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   At a Time-Warner stockholder's meeting in 1992, he took on the
media company for releasing a song by rapper Ice T titled "Cop
Killer."</TE>
<TE>   A longtime member of the NRA, he was elected to its presidency in
1998 and was awarded an honorary life membership in 1990--only the
16th ever given. He is widely credited with increasing the NRA's
membership rolls from 2.8 million at the time of his election to its
current 4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Heston's involvement with the NRA is part of a long legacy of
civic activism, said Wayne La Pierre, the NRA's executive vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not some flash-in-the-pan Hollywood figure with some
pop-culture political view that vanishes tomorrow morning," he said.
"He's the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   Heston's announcement was reminiscent of a 1994 statement released
by his friend and political bedfellow Ronald Reagan, whose "sunset of
my life" letter told the American public that he had been found to
have Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Brady, chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence,
released a statement Friday acknowledging her group's ideological
differences with Heston and the NRA but offering solidarity with his
family.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand how painful Alzheimer's disease can be for those
suffering from it and for their loved ones. Our thoughts are with Mr.
Heston and his family during this difficult time."</TE>
<TE>   Heston made his film debut in the 1950 film noir "Dark City" and
hit his stride two years later in an Oscar-winning best picture, "The
Greatest Show on Earth." That film marked his first collaboration
with director Cecil B. DeMille. The two paired up four years later
for the blockbuster religious epic "The Ten Commandments." In 1959,
he received his one and only Academy Award, for best actor, in the
epic "Ben-Hur," directed by William Wyler.</TE>
<TE>   Heston continued to star in period epics during the 1960s, most
especially as the tragic hero in 1961's "El Cid," John the Baptist in
1965's "The Greatest Story Ever Told" and artist Michelangelo in
1965's "The Agony and the Ecstasy." Perhaps his best-loved film is
the 1967 sci-fi epic "Planet of the Apes." Last year, he had a cameo
part in Tim Burton's remake.</TE>
<TE>   Heston has always been quick to spoof his stolid image, twice as
guest host on "Saturday Night Live" and in such movies as "Wayne's
World 2" (1993) and the Disney's "Hercules" (1997).</TE>

<HD>Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Boy</HD>
<DH>Movies* 'Signs' director M. Night Shyamalan says his films
convey his 'personal journey.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For someone who makes such dark and scary movies, M. Night Shyamalan
seems like an extremely well-adjusted guy.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old film director grew up in a posh suburb of
Philadelphia. His parents, with whom he is still quite tight, were
doctors, and they still live near their son in suburban Philadelphia.
He's been married for nine years and is the father of two young
daughters. His film career has been blessed. At 29, he was nominated
for an Academy Award for best director for his blockbuster thriller
"The Sixth Sense" (1999) and his current film, "Signs," took in more
than $60 million in its opening weekend.</LD>
<LD>   And his insightful examinations of the trials and tribulation of
adolescence have had critics calling him the next Steven Spielberg--a
recent Newsweek cover article, in fact, dubbed him "The New
Spielberg." His deft handling of adolescent angst also brings to mind
the early films of French auteur Francois Truffaut and Italian
neo-realist Vittorio De Sica.</LD>
<TE>   And like just like the protagonists in Truffaut's 1959 classic
"The 400 Blows" and De Sica's seminal 1948 drama "The Bicycle Thief,"
Shyamalan's films are populated with somber young boys who carry the
weight of the world on their shoulders--a troubled world in which the
adults offer little if any real help.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview earlier this week, the effusive Shyamalan says the
young protagonists of his movies don't really reflect what he was
like at that age. Rather, he says, "these little boys kind of remind
me of important things in life. I don't have a son but I kind of
imagine what a son would want from me and need from me."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Sixth Sense," Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is such a sensitive
lad that he sees and communicates with dead people. In "Unbreakable"
(2000), Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) is trying to cope with his
parents' marital problems and his father's increasingly odd behavior
after a train accident. And in "Signs," Morgan (Rory Culkin) is
dealing with the untimely death of his mother, his father's emotional
distance and the fact that the world may be coming to an end when
malevolent green aliens invade Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The adult male protagonists in Shyamalan's films also follow a
pattern--they are restrained, noncommunicative, distant. They are all
trapped in an emotional straitjacket. In "The Sixth Sense" child
psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) wants to help Cole but
can't seem to help himself. He happens to be dead but he doesn't know
it. Willis' David Dunn in "Unbreakable" doesn't know why he is the
only survivor of a devastating railroad accident or has become a
living embodiment of a comic book superhero. And in "Signs," Graham
Hess (Mel Gibson) is a recent widower and former priest who has lost
his faith and has shut himself off from his two young children.</TE>
<TE>   When Shyamalan made "The Sixth Sense," his eldest daughter was
just 2, and the film, he says, reflected his fears about being a good
parent.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbreakable," he says, examines the need for boys to envision
their fathers as superhero figures. "Kids see their parents as
superheroes," he says, "especially their dads--the kind who never
cries and never gets scared. I imagined what if one kid's feeling
about his father was correct."</TE>
<TE>   For "Signs," he decided not to include a mother in the mix, but to
add the role of Graham's younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix), a
disenchanted former minor league baseball player who has moved back
home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a much more interesting family," he says. "It was not the
standard mother, father, children, boy, girl, who are trapped in this
house but somehow a fragmented nuclear family. Then when I thought
about the mom not being there, that was a kind of powerful feeling of
wow--this is a weakened family, a kind of a family limping when we
find them. And the brother moving in just added to the dysfunctional
nature of their makeup at the beginning of the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Shyamalan, who was born in India, raised as a Hindu but whose
parents sent him to Catholic school for discipline, admits he was a
sensitive kid like his young protagonists. "I was an overly sensitive
kid for sure," he says, "and definitely shy. But with my friends I
definitely wasn't shy. I was the smallest guy. I was the one leading
everyone around. That kind of evolved into making movies where I am
bossing everybody around now. I get paid to boss everybody around."</TE>
<TE>   He says his family--Shyamalan has a sister who is six years
older-- is exceptionally close because of the "immigrant
mentality--you come here and you live close to each other and take
care of each other."</TE>
<TE>   Shyamalan says that he didn't get his inspiration to make movies
about children from his idol Spielberg. "I don't think inspiration is
the right word," he explains. "It is more that those movies really
spoke to me. He was making movies about 10-year-old boys and I was 10
years old, so it is almost like a direct connection. I was seeing
myself in those movies and maybe that identification just stuck with
me--frozen."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Spielberg's view of children and adults has changed
radically as he's gotten older and become a father. The wonderment of
"E.T. the Extraterrestrial" (1982) has given way to the dark,
despairing take on children and families in "A.I. Artificial
Intelligence" (2001) and the current "Minority Report."</TE>
<TE>   Like Spielberg, Truffaut and De Sica, Shyamalan, who has earned a
reputation in his brief career as obsessively single-minded in his
approach, sees his movies as intensely personal.</TE>
<TE>   "They reflect anxieties or issues I was dealing with at each of
those stages of my life," he says. "You know what I mean, whether it
is anxiety about work or family or marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, if I keep conveying the personal journey that I am
going through in real life with these characters, each of the movies
will be genuine and a continued connection with the audience--a
little biography of my life."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for your article on standing ovations ("Standing Ritual,"
by Diane Haithman, Aug. 2). I believe they should be reserved for
extraordinarily fine theater. If standing ovations become standard,
how do you express appreciation for the truly outstanding? Jump up
and down on your seat?</LD>
<LD>   BILL BERGFELDT</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood</LD>
<TE>   In the New York theater, a standing ovation is reserved for the
highest-quality performance. On other occasions, those who want to
get out of their seats early move to the side aisles to applaud and
then run.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles' larger theaters, you will find three or four folks
jump to their feet, the people behind them can't see, so they jump up
too. This is not a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   In Equity waiver houses and other small venues, you don't see
standing ovations, which leads me to think some folks in the audience
of larger theaters want the performers to see them.</TE>
<TE>   JOYCE-RUTH BUNKIN</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Haithman's perceived distinction between East and West
Coast audiences' proclivity to stand at the end of a performance: I
attended many a Broadway show in eight years in Manhattan, and can't
remember one, no matter how marginal, for which the audience didn't
stand.</TE>
<TE>   I always felt the (largely tourist-filled) audiences were
congratulating themselves on attending live theater as much as
anything. They seemed to stand as much for themselves as for the
performers, as if to say, "We know what an appreciative audience does
at the end of the show--ain't we sophisticated?"</TE>
<TE>   JOEL GOLDES</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park</TE>
<TE>   Appreciation can only be shown by the length of the applause. This
is always cut short in Los Angeles because half the audience is on
its feet and moving to the doors.</TE>

<TE>   Thanks to David Pagel and The Times for the bravery to challenge
the basic premise that "the art history of surfing" actually exists
("Another in a Cresting Wave of Exhibitions," Aug. 3).</TE>
<TE>   Like quack scientists, the Laguna Museum has developed an M.O.
that begins with a weak premise like "an examination of Hot Rod
Culture and its influence on fine art" and ends by providing us with
"proof" as inane as a '60s poster from a motorcycle event listing
Billy Al Bengston as a special guest. Wow!</TE>

<TE>   Classism at Work</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's article "When Personal Tragedy Becomes Public
Spectacle" (Aug. 2) was right on target. It is so very obvious why
Samantha and not Casey got so much media attention.</TE>
<TE>   It has nothing to do with the Pennsylvania coal miners, who, thank
the high heavens, were found safe. It is all about what I call
classism.</TE>
<TE>   Casey's parents were from the "wrong side of the tracks."
Therefore, their loss is just not as important as those who live and
look better than they do.</TE>

<TE>   While I agree with Rosenberg's commentary about the life cycle of
these stories on abducted children, I have to point out his failure
to mention the excessive coverage of the missing Milwaukee girl,
Alexis Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, wait ... that's right, there's been very little coverage
outside of Milwaukee. Yet young Patterson--who is black--has been
missing since the middle of May. I think I remember hearing that it
was because her abduction overlapped that of Elizabeth Smart, and,
you know, resources can only be stretched so far.</TE>
<TE>   I probably shouldn't care, as a white male, about Patterson's
abduction, but I do. I care because it bothers my conscience that the
media obsess over one missing girl and not another. As if one
life--the life of a fair-haired white child--is more important than
that of a black one.</TE>

<TE>   I've come to realize it's not the media's fault. They run on
ratings, and they get ratings because people watch. They are big
business now, and their mission is to make a profit for their
shareholders. I'm not saying I like that, but that is how business
works in a capitalist society.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger question is: Why do people watch it? Why do they want
to be party to sensationalizing murder and mayhem? And why do people
want to insinuate themselves into someone else's misery? If people
stopped watching it, the stations would have to come up with some
other way to get viewers.</TE>

<TE>   Cher the Survivor</TE>
<TE>   Drama! Implants! Info-commercials! Man, where has Richard Cromelin
been? In his review of Cher's glorious farewell concert ("A Diva's
Adieu," Aug. 8), he said a true diva, which according to him Cher is
not, survives adversities and keeps on bouncing back. Here are the
facts:</TE>
<TE>   She outlives early folk rock hippie phase ("I Got You Babe") to
return as a true TV icon in "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour."
Introducing the world to her deadpan comic delivery and Bob Mackie
fashions.</TE>
<TE>   She marries Greg Allman. Renegade rocker.</TE>
<TE>   She outlives the built-in bias of being a "pop" singer to star in
many important movies, culminating in getting an Oscar for
"Moonstruck." I don't see Whitney or Mariah anywhere close.</TE>
<TE>   She suffers from Epstein-Barr syndrome and drops out at the peak
of her movie career.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter Chastity comes out as a lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   She sees her former partner, Sonny Bono, die in a freakish ski
accident, and delivers one of the great moments in VH1-"Behind the
Music" history by delivering an amazing eulogy.</TE>
<TE>   She scores a No. 1 worldwide single and album with "Believe" while
in her 50s, surviving her infomercial "ridicule" phase.</TE>
<TE>   Liza, whom Cromelin cites as the real thing, is only reliving her
mother's life (I think she's on Night 2 of her mom's TV biopic). Cher
is the real deal! She can act, she can sing, she can cry--she can

<HD>Down in Front! No Ovation Required</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for your article on standing ovations ("Standing Ritual,"
by Diane Haithman, Aug. 2). I believe they should be reserved for
extraordinarily fine theater. If standing ovations become standard,
how do you express appreciation for the truly outstanding? Jump up
and down on your seat?</LD>
<LD>   BILL BERGFELDT</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood</LD>
<TE>   In the New York theater, a standing ovation is reserved for the
highest-quality performance. On other occasions, those who want to
get out of their seats early move to the side aisles to applaud and
then run.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles' larger theaters, you will find three or four folks
jump to their feet, the people behind them can't see, so they jump up
too. This is not a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   In Equity waiver houses and other small venues, you don't see
standing ovations, which leads me to think some folks in the audience
of larger theaters want the performers to see them.</TE>
<TE>   JOYCE-RUTH BUNKIN</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Haithman's perceived distinction between East and West
Coast audiences' proclivity to stand at the end of a performance: I
attended many a Broadway show in eight years in Manhattan, and can't
remember one, no matter how marginal, for which the audience didn't
stand.</TE>
<TE>   I always felt the (largely tourist-filled) audiences were
congratulating themselves on attending live theater as much as
anything. They seemed to stand as much for themselves as for the
performers, as if to say, "We know what an appreciative audience does
at the end of the show--ain't we sophisticated?"</TE>
<TE>   JOEL GOLDES</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park</TE>
<TE>   Appreciation can only be shown by the length of the applause. This
is always cut short in Los Angeles because half the audience is on
its feet and moving to the doors.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to David Pagel and The Times for the bravery to challenge the
basic premise that "the art history of surfing" actually exists
("Another in a Cresting Wave of Exhibitions," Aug. 3).</LD>
<LD>   Like quack scientists, the Laguna Museum has developed an M.O.
that begins with a weak premise like "an examination of Hot Rod
Culture and its influence on fine art" and ends by providing us with
"proof" as inane as a '60s poster from a motorcycle event listing
Billy Al Bengston as a special guest. Wow!</LD>

<HD>Hello Again, Dolly</HD>
<DH>Parton, touring for the first time in a decade, brings the
songs of her mountain home to adoring fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were only a couple of signs during Dolly Parton's performance
Wednesday at the House of Blues to indicate she was on her first
concert tour in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   One was the exaggerated way she established eye contact with fans
in each quarter of the overstuffed room, a gesture more suited to an
arena than to a club. The other was the video screen opposite the
stage scrolling the lyrics of each song.</LD>
<LD>   If Parton wasn't 100% secure with the words halfway into this
13-city tour, she was in total command of the fans, who greeted her
with an unusually effusive roar.</LD>
<TE>   Although that crowd was ready to genuflect at the altar of
Parton's celebrity, she quickly put the focus on her music,
specifically on the roots-oriented mountain sounds she has returned
to in recent years, to modest commercial success and considerable
critical acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the outrageous public persona Parton has maintained for
nearly four decades, she silenced the boisterous Dolly-heads to a
hush as she launched a series of songs from her new "Halos &amp; Horns"
album and its two bluegrass-centered, Grammy-winning predecessors,
last year's "Little Sparrow" and 1999's "The Grass Is Blue."</TE>
<TE>   When one fan shouted, "We love you!" Parton smiled and in her
familiar Tennessee drawl shot back, "I love you too--now be quiet!"
Then she sang "Mountain Angel," a haunting fable of a charmed young
woman who suffers a tragic fate after giving her love to an
undeserving man.</TE>
<TE>   It had the aura of a folk tale, as do many of the songs Parton has
written since being dropped by her last major label in the early
'90s, just as country radio put her in the Over the Hill Gang.</TE>
<TE>   Now Parton, 56, seems as pleasantly surprised at being back on
tour as her fans are to hear her live again. "I never stopped writing
songs during all that time when I wasn't getting played on the radio
and when nobody was interested in me at a label," said Parton, curled
up on an oversized chair upstairs at the club a few hours before show
time. "And I didn't pursue it that hard. I thought, 'Good Lord, I've
been so lucky, I've had a great career, there's no point in trying to
shove myself down people's throats if they don't want it.' "</TE>
<TE>   She was wearing a relatively subdued dark denim jacket and pants,
nowhere near as flashy as the filmy, sparkling pink dress she would
change into for the concert. Her short blond locks are less imposing
now than in her Truly Big Hair heyday, when she reigned from the late
1960s through much of the '80s as one of the queens of country music.</TE>
<TE>   Having spent most of the '80s making one pop-oriented record after
another, she underwent a musical rebirth in 1994 with "Heartsongs,"
recorded live at her Dollywood theme park, in which she mixed some of
her early country hits with songs of the Carter Family and other
country, bluegrass and mountain music pioneers. It continued with
"Hungry Again," a 1996 album whose title song began, "The thrill, the
desire, the excitement is gone," neatly summing up Parton's feeling
about her own career direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote it as a love song just to have a commercial song, but
actually when I came up with the title," she said Wednesday, "that's
exactly what I was thinking: writing and singing like I was hungry
again."</TE>
<TE>   A tall order for a woman who will never worry again where her next
meal is coming from, thanks to a long string of country hits that she
parlayed in the late '70s into pop crossover success ("Here You Come
Again," "Islands in the Stream"), movie ("9 to 5") and TV stardom as
well as Dollywood, in Pigeon Forge, one of Tennessee's top tourist
attractions, about 35 miles from Knoxville.</TE>
<TE>   All that diversification shunted Parton's songwriting aside, which
gnawed at her because she takes songwriting more seriously than any
other aspect of her career.</TE>
<TE>   Over dinner one night in 1998 with friend and producer Steve
Buckingham, a senior vice president at Santa Monica-based Welk Music
Group, Parton got the idea to try a full-on bluegrass album.</TE>
<TE>   Welk had recently bought the bluegrass-oriented Sugar Hill Records
label, and Buckingham told Parton that Sugar Hill had run a survey of
interested parties asking who they'd most like to hear do a bluegrass
record who'd never done one. Parton topped the list.</TE>
<TE>   The story tantalized Parton. "I had two months that I knew were
pretty flexible.... I said, 'If you think we can do it in six or
eight weeks, I know what songs I'd do.' So I just gathered 'em up, I
wrote a few, and we had it ready. That was 'The Grass Is Blue.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Grass" and "Little Sparrow" have sold between 175,000 and 200,000
copies apiece and won her two Grammy Awards. "Halos &amp; Horns" is off
to a respectable start by roots music standards, logging more than
50,000 copies in its first month, according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm the happiest I've ever been, artistically," she said.
"I don't have to deal with managers--I manage myself--I make all my
own decisions and have my own label.... I own my own masters, so I
write 'em, I publish 'em, I own 'em, and I'm producing 'em.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm home-owned, home-operated," she said with a
saleswoman-on-fire toss of her head. "I'll be selling out of the
trunk of my car if I need to."</TE>

<LD>   Stricken Eszterhas Delivers Mea Culpa</LD>
<LD>   Joe Eszterhas, the flamboyant screenwriter of guilty-pleasure
movies such as "Basic Instinct" (1992) and "Showgirls" (1995), said
Friday that he was diagnosed with throat cancer 18 months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Though he was a "militant smoker" who cultivated a "rock 'n' roll"
image, he now regrets making cigarettes so integral to his movie
plots, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece. By glamorizing
smoking, he said, his hands--and Hollywood's--are "bloody."</TE>
<TE>   "I have been an accomplice to the murders of untold numbers of
human beings," Eszterhas said. "I am admitting this only because I
have made a deal with God. Spare me, I said, and I will try to stop
others from committing the same crimes I did."</TE>
<TE>   Since having much of his larynx removed, he's "alive but maimed,"
Eszterhas said, explaining that he no longer has trouble swallowing
or breathing but has some difficulty talking. He is being treated at
the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   'Kane' Continues Streak in British Film Poll</TE>
<TE>   For the 40th year running, Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane" took top
honors in a British Film Institute poll of 144 international movie
critics and directors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the critics, Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" took the second
spot, followed by Jean Renoir's "La Regle du Jeu" ("The Rules of the
Game"). In the directors' ranks, Francis Ford Coppola's "The
Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II" came in second and third.</TE>

<TE>   Imax Moves to the Mainstream</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to boost profits, Imax Cinemas has signed on with
Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency, BBC News reports. The goal:
getting mainstream movies released on its large-screen format at the
same time they hit your neighborhood theater.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the company dealt almost exclusively in science or
nature movies specially shot for Imax Cinemas on film much larger
than the normal 35-millimeter film. Converting films to its format
costs about $3 million apiece, but that sum, says Imax, is
significantly reduced by the technology currently available.</TE>
<TE>   Imax had previously convinced the Walt Disney Co. to convert
"Fantasia 2000" and "Beauty and the Beast" (1991) to its high-tech
format, which offers images on screens up to 10 stories high. The
Disney cartoon "Treasure Planet" will come out on Imax at the same
time it goes into general release. And the Oscar-winning "Apollo 13"
(1995) will be re-released on the really big screen later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Imax hopes that CAA's talent relationships will help it land up to
six high-profile movies a year.</TE>

<TE>   MOCA's Warhol Show Is a Profitable One</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art has yet to meet attendance
projections for its "Andy Warhol Retrospective" but it will make a
hefty profit on the widely publicized exhibition, which ends Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Though MOCA expected attendance of about 200,000 at the specially
ticketed show, the figure stood at 145,000 as of Aug. 3. Nonetheless,
the museum expects to net $2.7 million from contributions and ticket
sales. And its shop has racked up $1.1 million in sales during the
exhibition.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   CBS has picked up a drama script by Judith McCreary focusing on
Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal and a fictional teammate who becomes a
coach after suffering a career-ending injury, Variety reports.
O'Neal, one of the executive producers, is due to appear in the pilot
and in periodic guest spots through the series....CNN anchor Willow
Bay and Walt Disney Co. President Robert Iger became the parents of a
boy on July 29.... Britney Spears says she'll be taking a six-month
leave from performing.... Sony Pictures and Revolution Studios are
moving Paul Thomas Anderson's romantic comedy "Punch Drunk Love" from
awards-candidate-heavy December to less-crowded October. The film,
which stars Adam Sandler and Emily Watson, will open in Los Angeles
and New York on Oct. 1.</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls on the Ballot</HD>
<DH>Arts* County Museum of Art and the Natural History Museum
hope to leverage public, private funds into $600 million in
construction funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This, the leaders of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County have been saying for
months, is the quiet phase.</LD>
<LD>   In their campaigns to raise up to $300 million each for new and
improved buildings, both museums' leaders said, they were looking to
lock up major commitments with billionaire philanthropists like Eli
Broad before taking their campaigns public.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, when museum leaders and the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors joined to unmask the first round of prospective
donors, it wasn't Broad, or any of the other usual philanthropic
suspects. It's the taxpayers of Los Angeles County, and instead of
competing, the museums are working together.</LD>
<TE>   Under a proposed $250-million bond issue that supervisors agreed
to put on the Nov. 5 ballot, the county's voters are being asked to
make matching-fund contributions of up to $98 million to each museum,
along with $54 million to a handful of other cultural projects around
the county. The bonds would be paid for by boosts in property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal cites "earthquake and fire safety improvements," but
the proposed projects also include new buildings, and the funds would
play a key role in both museums' plans to dramatically renovate or
replace existing structures.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Rich, LACMA's president and director, calls the bond
proposal "an experiment in public policy" that holds the promise of
bringing public and private investment together for broad benefit.
But it's also a surprise. In a January interview, Rich said all
construction funds for the project would be raised from private
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "You can strangle me on that, but that's what we were thinking in
January," she said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, Rich said, the two museums, whose buildings and
collections are owned by the county, have polled citizens about their
willingness to earmark public money for museum improvements. She said
the results, which she declined to release in detail, showed strong
support, especially for children's programs.</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when county health services face severe cutbacks--a
separate tax measure on the November ballot is aimed at keeping that
wolf from that door--veteran fund-raisers and anti-tax activists say
the museums have a challenging sales job ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   In at least some circles, "the taxpayers are looking at this as a
frivolous request at a time when the county is assuring voters that
it's in dire straights," said Kris Vosburgh, Los Angeles-based
executive director of the statewide Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.
Though bond-issues promoters are stressing seismic and safety aspects
of the proposal, he asserted, it amounts to "money for spiffing up
museums."</TE>
<TE>   Rich and other bond boosters are quick to say that this approach
is neither a slam dunk nor a blank check. To pass, the bond needs a
two-thirds majority--a level met by just three of the nine county and
statewide measures on last March's gubernatorial primary ballot.
Under the proposed bond measure's provisions, the money will be
gathered through property taxes and will only be released if the
institutions separately raise roughly $1.15 in private funds for
every dollar in public money they receive. The museums have until
November 2012 to do their share of the fundraising.</TE>
<TE>   By one county analyst's estimate, if the cultural institutions
meet their private fund-raising targets, the bond issue would cost
the owner of a $250,000 home $6.96 over the first year and $6.04 the
next, declining for the next 28 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum says it hasn't sought specific pledges
from major individual donors yet, and won't make any donor
announcements before the election. LACMA leaders say they don't know
when they'll be ready to unveil major donations. Both institutions
say they won't have major new details to add before November, but
just as they collaborated in polling to investigate the prospects for
a bond issue, they plan to collaborate on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   As for the region's major philanthropists, "obviously, nobody's
excited about making commitments with their stocks way down," said
Broad on Friday. He called the bond measure, which allows the county
essentially to borrow money and pay the debt over 30 years, an
ingenious plan that could capitalize on low interest rates and serve
as "a catalyst" to inspire other gifts. Asked when he plans to
disclose his own contribution to LACMA's project, Broad said that "if
the bond issue passes, and I assume it will, it will probably be some
time next year."</TE>
<TE>   Broad, who has hinted that his gift would be something more than
$23 million, said he thinks the museum's board members together need
to come up with $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   The bond campaign is likely to stress the museums as a resource
for children. Under the proposed bond, both museums are required to
increase their free admissions to children and free tours to school
groups by 50% over 2001-02 levels. But it will also stress the idea
of a public and private fundraising collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that seems quite different, using public funds
to leverage private philanthropy. It's more than just about museums.
It's something about the psyche of L.A.," said Jim Ferris, director
of USC's Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. However, "I think
there's a risk," Ferris said. "If the community's not willing to
support something, someone might say, 'Why should I invest my
resources in it?' Especially since philanthropists like to leverage
their resources. On the other hand, you might have someone who wants
to be a hero and step up. It depends on the philanthropists, and I
don't know which kind we have more of."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, said Edward Abel, president and chief executive of the
American Assn. of Museums in Washington, D.C., "there is a greater
use today of bonds as a challenge for the private sector to match.
It's a growing trend around the country, in particular for
government-owned museums."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, local governments in Palm Beach, Fla., and Dallas are
each laying groundwork for votes on bond issues to fund cultural
projects--in Palm Beach, a museum; in Dallas, a performing arts
center (whose architects include Rem Koolhaas).</TE>
<TE>   Leaders at LACMA and the Natural History Museum say this alliance
is the most ambitious collaboration ever between the institutions, an
arrangement that may be eased by the common backgrounds of LACMA's
Rich and the Natural History Museum's director, Jane Pisano. (Rich
came to her position after a longer career in administration at UCLA;
Pisano took over the Natural History Museum in 2001 after a similar
career at USC.) "We speak the same language," Rich said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps their greatest challenge is the fact that, in both cases,
their new or improved buildings remain far from fully defined.
Officials say design decisions are still being made on both projects,
and even if all needed money was in hand, groundbreaking would be at
least two years away at LACMA, and perhaps four years away at the
Natural History Museum, which just announced Steven Holl as its
architect on July 1.</TE>
<TE>   In September, LACMA expects reports from architect Koolhaas on the
feasibility of the project's key elements, including the razing of
four buildings, the reuse of the existing plinth beneath the LACMA
complex, and the proposed tent-like roof. But Rich and other LACMA
officials say they will resist attaching a price tag to LACMA's
ambitions for at least several more months, until they have more
information.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is expected to seek up to $300 million in building
costs and another $100 million to boost its endowment, figures Rich
will neither affirm nor dispute, except to say, "It's floating around
there."</TE>
<TE>   Added Rich: "I wish the stock market were different. I have no
idea what the impact of that is going to be, but certainly it's made
it harder, not easier." If the measure fails, "we keep going, and try
to do as much as we can from private fundraising," said Rich. "But as
bonds go, this is not a big one, and it is pretty targeted and pretty
controlled in terms of where the money will go and how it's
allocated. It's not a free-for-all."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest buildings in the LACMA complex date to the 1960s. The
Natural History Museum, housed in an Exposition Park building that
dates to 1913 (with several additions added over succeeding decades),
plans a dramatic renovation costing as much $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   So far, said the Natural History Museum's Pisano, "we're not ready
yet to ask [major] donors for funds because we don't have a design.
We need to have more information about the design of the building and
the nature of the exhibits."</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how ambitious the institutions' renovation plans,
Pisano said, any physical changes will mean meeting more recent and
demanding safety standards. "Over the years, the deferred maintenance
has become very great. It's time for a major investment in these
facilities," said Pisano.</TE>
<TE>   Once the decision was made to go forward with the bond measure,
Rich said, county and museum officials designed "a geographical
embrace" to the bond measure--that is, to add further elements that
might encourage support around the county.</TE>
<TE>   "We own the buildings. If they fall down, it's going to be our
responsibility," said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who labels
the bond proposal "a historic opportunity."</TE>

<HD>A Toast to a Man Who Left His Imprint on L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the family and fans gathered at Trader Vic's Thursday night,
Welton Becket was an architect whose work is often seen but whose
name is not much heard. Drive around Los Angeles and Becket's most
iconic structures--the Capitol Records building, the Cinerama Dome,
the Music Center--are impossible to miss; the man could bring
imagination even to the prosaic office tower. But his admirers
consider his profile, and that of the corporate firm he ran, in need
of dusting off.</LD>
<LD>   "In a way, Los Angeles is BecketLand," said Alan Leib, a
self-described architecture geek and one of a number of
thirtysomethings here to celebrate the forgotten modernist's 100th
birthday. "His signature style was his own turn on International
Modernism, but more futuristic, less linear. He'd build a dome, or a
round building, like Capitol Records." To Leib and others, Becket
hasn't gotten his due because of a bias against corporate
modernism--a category that bears the same stigma as military music.</LD>
<TE>   Becket's admirers were at Trader Vic's not only to pay homage to
the man who died in 1969 after working in Los Angeles for almost five
decades, or to sip the Polynesian bar's sweet, umbrella-topped
drinks. They were there, too, to discuss an event for the spring, a
centennial celebration with a panel of scholars and designers, an
appearance by architecture historian Alan Hess ("Googie: Fifties
Coffee Shop Architecture") and a Museum of Contemporary Art tour of
Becket buildings. (The event will be put together by the Los Angeles
Conservancy and its Modern committee, several of whose young cultists
were in attendance Thursday.)</TE>
<TE>   For years, Becket was largely overlooked by the architecture
establishment, but as postwar Modernism's star has risen, so has his.
Besides his style, Becket is known for designing what is arguably the
country's first suburban department store, Bullocks Pasadena (1947),
as well as originating "total design," by which a single firm handles
all stages of a project.</TE>
<TE>   Becket's two granddaughters, who were cutting the cake Thursday
night, knew their grandfather only from the buildings in the city
they grew up in. But his son Bruce, a distinguished man in a blue
blazer who runs his own architecture firm, described a humble man who
ran with Walter Pidgeon, Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan in his early
days, who hired out-of-work movie-set designers during World War II
to design hotels and offices. Becket also liked to drink amid the
bamboo ceilings and puffer-fish lamps of Trader Vic's, part of the
Beverly Hilton he designed; the group received a tour of the hotel
before the night ended.</TE>
<TE>   Welton Becket, his son said, prided himself as a pragmatic guy, a
team player, as proud of his master planning of Century City in the
late '50s as for his signature buildings. "He'd liked to be known for
doing good, practical work," said Bruce. "The old firm of Welton
Becket and Associates was known for serving the client. Today you
have a generation of architects producing work to get attention. That
[work] is short-lived, I think."</TE>

<LD>This time, it's for love. That's the premise, anyway, of the latest
so-called reality series.</LD>
<LD>   "The Last Resort," a half-hour show premiering Sunday at 10 p.m.
on ABC Family, has a big island and a bunch of attractive couples but
little else in common with other prime-time survival contests. The
question on this miniseries is not who will last long enough to
strike it rich or even who will fool around with whom but whether the
couples will leave Hawaii with their fragile relationships intact.</LD>
<LD>   Over five consecutive nights, host Kala'i Miller and two
therapists will guide four couples in crisis through various
exercises aimed at helping them determine whether to take part in a
"recommitment ceremony" or go separate ways. In the premiere, the
couples jump off a cliff while holding hands, slow dance and then
spell out their conflicts as we eavesdrop on their sessions with the
"relationship coaches."</LD>
<TE>   The couples seem to have an ordinary array of issues:</TE>
<TE>   * After two months of marriage, the pregnant Mirit fears that
Allan no longer is attracted to her.</TE>
<TE>   * Teresa, who met boyfriend Gordon online, feels "suffocated" by
his 20 phone calls a day.</TE>
<TE>   * CoCo, who has been dating Lance for five years, suspects he may
be messing around on her.</TE>
<TE>   * Steve feels stuck in the middle because his disapproving mother
won't speak to his wife, Leslie, despite seven years of marriage and
three daughters.</TE>
<TE>   This is the unscripted programming version of an after-school
special: Viewers are meant to learn something.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Resort" may have honorable intentions instead of
eviction votes and strategic flings, but it offers little pleasure,
guilty or otherwise.</TE>

<HD>Mexico to Impose Duty on Apples</HD>
<DH>Trade: The U.S. is expected to challenge the 40%
anti-dumping tariff, which could sharply reduce sales from the
upcoming harvest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico turned up the heat in a long-running trade dispute Friday,
imposing a 40% tariff on U.S. apples and accusing U.S. growers of
dumping cheap fruit on its domestic market.</LD>
<LD>   If the tariff remains in place for long, it could have serious
repercussions for U.S. apple growers, who have seen prices drop
sharply in recent years because of overproduction and cheap foreign
competition. Since the signing of the free-trade agreement between
the U.S. and Mexico in 1994, disputes over apples, tomatoes, sugar
and avocados have made agriculture one of the most contentious arenas
in the bilateral relationship.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. government is expected to challenge the decision.</LD>
<TE>   Desmond O'Rourke, an agriculture consultant, said a 40% tariff on
Red and Golden Delicious apples could sharply reduce U.S. sales to
Mexico, which bought $125 million worth of apples in 2001 and is the
leading U.S. apple export market with 30% of foreign sales. That
would push more apples into the global market and depress prices.
"The impact would be very severe if it continues for long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government faces fierce pressure from apple growers in
Chihuahua, who initially filed an anti-dumping complaint against U.S.
growers in 1997. After Mexico imposed a 101% tariff on U.S. fruit,
which froze the U.S. out of that market for months, the two sides set
a minimum price for U.S. apples sold in Mexico. But Mexican growers
challenged that agreement in court, and the government reopened the
dumping case.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bryant, a Seattle-based lobbyist representing the U.S. apple
industry, expects the two sides to return to the negotiating table
soon. "We had been working with the Mexican government for months,
and I hope we could continue to work with them to develop a mutually
acceptable solution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As news of Mexico's decision filtered through the U.S.
apple-growing community on Friday, trade activity ground to a halt,
said Rebecca Baerveldt, international marketing manager for the
Washington Apple Commission, whose growers produce more than half of
the nation's apples. "Just the rumor of the reimposition of the
tariff has basically halted sales because the importers don't want to
be stuck with having to deal with that high of a tariff," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After four years of rock-bottom prices, business was starting to
look up for U.S. apple growers. Apple prices averaged 23 cents a
pound in 2001, up from 18 cents a pound the previous year. Until
Friday's news, apple prices were expected to remain firm for the next
harvest, which begins in the coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>2 Cadiz Execs Cut Stake in Firm</HD>
<DH>Environment: Former, current chairmen sell their shares.
The company's water project faces obstacles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two top executives of Cadiz Inc., which is negotiating with local
water officials to build a controversial $150-million water storage
project in the Mojave Desert, have sold millions of dollars' worth of
shares in the Santa Monica company over the last several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The executives are Dwight Makins, a board member and former
chairman, and Cadiz Chairman and CEO Keith Brackpool. Makins had
earlier disclosed his sales of 252,800 Cadiz shares, more than half
his stake, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, while Brackpool
told analysts about the sale during a conference call Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Brackpool said that 500,000 of his Cadiz shares held as collateral
for a bank loan had been sold by the bank in July without his prior
knowledge or approval. He did not identify the bank or disclose its
reasons beyond noting that some of the shares had been set aside as a
marital settlement.</LD>
<TE>   During the same call Brackpool also expressed confidence that a
critical and long-awaited approval of the Mojave project would come
shortly from the Interior Department, and he sharply criticized Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) for introducing legislation that could
delay or block that approval. The department's Bureau of Land
Management must approve permits for the project because it will have
environmental impacts on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool said that "all indications are [Interior] believes
they've done everything necessary [to protect the environment] and
will go ahead here and issue the permit."</TE>
<TE>   But an Interior Department spokesman said Friday that the project
was still under review. Cadiz "can say anything they want, but the
decision will be made back here in Washington, and we have not yet
made that decision," spokesman John Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mojave project, which Cadiz is planning to build in
partnership with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California, has come under criticism by environmentalists. Opponents
say the project, which would store surplus Colorado River water for
use during dry years, would extract more water from the local water
table than would be replaced by natural means, causing possible
environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics question whether the debt-laden Cadiz, which owns
the land on which the project would be built, has the financial
strength to meet its obligations. Cadiz has said that a
water-monitoring system it has proposed should address the
environmental concerns, and that it can call on financing adequate to
meet its obligations on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz shares closed Friday at $5.05, up 28 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>State's Jobless Rate Declines</HD>
<DH>Employment: Seasonal factors--rather than a strong labor
market-- may be responsible for the dip to 6.3%, economists caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate dipped to 6.3% in July, and employers
reported a net increase of 7,500 jobs, more than the nation as a
whole, according to figures released Friday by the state Employment
Development Department.</LD>
<LD>   The data might appear to be good news, contrasted with government
figures released last week showing that employers nationwide boosted
their payrolls by only 6,000 jobs in July. But economists cautioned
that seasonal factors may be largely responsible for California's
gain, and pointed to abundant evidence of an anemic labor market.</LD>
<LD>   The state still has 35,500 fewer nonfarm payroll jobs than it did
a year ago, and more than half a million residents are receiving
unemployment benefits. Hours worked in manufacturing declined over
the month, underscoring continued weakness in that hard-hit sector.
Even temporary help jobs, a much-watched bellwether of hiring, sagged
in July, dashing hopes that California's job creation is set for a
strong rebound any time soon.</LD>
<TE>   "Employers remain extremely cautious," said Esmael Adibi, director
of the Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in
Orange. "They may not be laying off a lot of people, but they aren't
doing much hiring either."</TE>
<TE>   California's 6.3% July jobless rate was down from a revised 6.5%
in June. The U.S. unemployment rate in July was 5.9%, unchanged from
the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   The tally of monthly job gains and losses can be volatile, with
data reported one month subject to revisions the next. Seasonal
factors make the task even more difficult, which is why economists
were particularly wary of data this month showing that government
hiring was largely responsible for California's July job gains.</TE>
<TE>   Public payrolls showed an increase of 24,000 jobs, most of that
coming from local schools. But education jobs are notoriously
difficult to adjust for the summer exodus of teachers from their
classrooms. On a non-adjusted basis, local education payrolls were
down 112,000 jobs while state education positions dropped by 19,700.
Thus the seasonally adjusted "gain" really means that teaching
payrolls in July fell less than government counters would have
expected in the height of summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the harder seasonal trends to capture," said Tom
Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast, who doubts
that government hiring is having much influence on the state's labor
market, given California's budget woes.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale trade and retail trade also showed small gains over the
month.</TE>
<TE>   But a greater number of sectors showed job losses, led by
manufacturing, whose employers shed 9,900 additional jobs in July.</TE>
<TE>   California's manufacturing sector, like that of the nation, has
been hammered by the economic downturn. The nation's factories got a
boost in the first quarter as U.S. companies restocked depleted
inventory.</TE>
<TE>   But signs have emerged that this momentum is slowing. A leading
index of factory activity released this month showed that U.S.
manufacturing growth stalled in July after several months of gains.
In California, the manufacturing workweek dropped steeply to 40.1
hours in July from 41 hours in June.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not encouraging," said Howard Roth, chief economist with
the California Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Roth was similarly disappointed by data showing that payrolls of
personnel supply firms were down 1,800 in July and remain 17,500 jobs
lower than they were a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary workers are a good barometer for future hiring because
employers who get an uptick in orders frequently take on temps before
adding workers to their payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's unemployment remained unchanged at 4.1% in July.
Ditto for San Diego County at 4.2% and San Bernardino County at 5.8%.
Ventura County's jobless rate increased to 5.3% last month from 4.9%
in June.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County's jobless rate jumped to 6.7% in July from 5.8%
the month before, mainly because of higher agricultural unemployment
in the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles County showed a decline in its unemployment
rate to 6.7% in July from 7.3% in June.</TE>
<TE>   However, economists said the difficulties in adjusting for
seasonal fluctuations in teaching employment make it more likely that
L.A.'s unemployment rate didn't change much from the previous month</TE>

<HD>Disney to Review Hiring of Board Kin</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: By employing four relatives of directors,
company may not comply with proposed federal rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. said it is reviewing whether employing relatives of
its board members complies with proposed federal rules.</LD>
<LD>   The company also filed sworn statements from Chief Executive
Michael Eisner and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs certifying
the accuracy of the company's financial reports. A new Securities and
Exchange Commission rule requires such certification by Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Disney said in a regulatory filing that four of its independent
board members had relatives who were employed by the company last
year, which might not be allowed under rules proposed for independent
directors. The rules proposed by the New York Stock Exchange would
not consider a director independent if a relative had worked with a
company in the last five years.</LD>
<TE>   The company said that children of board members Reveta Bowers,
Stanley Gold and Raymond Watson were employed by Disney in various
divisions in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Gold works in the consumer products division and Raymond
Watson is employed by the Disney Channel cable television network.
Craig Bowers has since left a position in Disney's Internet group.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said the wife of board member John Bryson is
employed by the Lifetime cable network, in which Disney holds an
indirect 50% interest.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. lost more than a
third of their value Friday and pulled down the storage sector after
the company said it expected weaker full-year sales than Wall Street
had expected.</LD>
<LD>   After an early trading delay, Emulex shares plunged, closing down
$8.34at $15.27 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Lynch storage analyst John Roy said he did not think the
company's guidance was terrible news, but he noted, "People are
looking for bad news."</LD>
<TE>   Brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston cut its 12-month price target

to range from $305 million to $325 million.</TE>
<TE>   The news dragged down shares of data storage rival Brocade
Communications Systems Inc. by $1.92 to $15.36, and shares of QLogic

<HD>Family Eyes Options for Register's Parent</HD>
<DH>Media: The Hoileses will discuss over the weekend ways to
liquidate some holders' shares. An IPO and a partial sale are
possibilities.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The family that owns Freedom Communications Inc., parent company of
the Orange County Register, will meet this weekend to discuss ways
that disaffected shareholders can cash out their holdings, including
a possible initial public stock offering or partial sale of the
business.</LD>
<LD>   Under pressure from dissident shareholder Tim Hoiles, grandson of
company founder Raymond Cyrus Hoiles and an 8.6% owner who is pushing
for the company's sale, about 50 members of the conservative Hoiles
family plan to examine 12 options for raising money and hope to have
winnowed the list to three or four by Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The list will be forwarded to the board, which meets Tuesday. The
board is not expected to take immediate action.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a company that's been around for nearly 80 years, and I
expect the shareholders will take the necessary time to reach an
informed decision about something so important," said Samuel C.
Wolgemuth, chief executive of Irvine-based Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   But all is not harmonious. Hoiles and other family members,
unhappy with Freedom's financial performance in recent years, want to
liquidate some or all of their shares to diversify their holdings.
Much of the old guard appears to favor a go-slow approach. Insiders
predict that sparks could fly at the session this weekend at the
Costa Mesa Marriott Suites. The meeting is closed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the special session begins, Hoiles, 50, said his
proposal to sell the company would not receive fair consideration
because of opposition from management and some board members. Hoiles
claims to have the support of 40% to 60% of shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles said he blames bad business decisions by Freedom executives
for a decline in the company's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, the present management has lost me about 25% of my equity
in the past five to seven years," Hoiles said. "They got into
magazine and Internet ventures that Freedom had no business getting
into."</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles is no stranger to family spats. His father, Harry Hoiles,
waged an unsuccessful battle in the 1980s to break up Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which owns 28 daily newspapers, 37 weeklies and eight
television stations, last year had revenue of $760 million and lost
about $94 million amid the nationwide advertising downturn and
softening economy, said sources familiar with the results. The
business also reportedly wrote off $103 million for magazine,
Internet and other losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Register, the crown jewel of the Hoileses' holdings, is a
standard-bearer of libertarianism and the dominant newspaper in one
of the country's most politically conservative counties.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder Robin Hardie said, "Although there's an acceptance of
the need to change, many of us want the company to remain private and
don't want to sell it."</TE>
<TE>   John Morton, a newspaper analyst based in Maryland, said he would
be surprised if the Hoileses sold Freedom, which he believes could
fetch $1.5 billion to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Owning a newspaper is different than owning a green bean
cannery," he said. "There's a real emotional attachment to it."</TE>
<TE>   Morton said the family might try to buy out Tim Hoiles or spin off
part of the company. Whatever it chooses, the Hoileses probably will
remain majority owners, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Tim Hoiles said he negotiated with shareholders
to buy him out, at one point for as much as $92 million. No agreement
was reached.</TE>
<TE>   If Freedom were put on the block, it probably would attract
interest from such potential buyers as Gannett Co., Knight Ridder
Inc. and Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Hoileses were so inclined, now might not be a good
time to sell, Edward Jones analyst Jake Balzer said. With many
businesses scaling back their acquisitions, Freedom probably would
fetch less than it would have just 18 months ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the company public might even be a less palatable option,
said Tom Madden, a partner at online research firm IPO Monitor. In
the first seven months of this year, 56 IPOs raised a total of $13.6
billion. In the same period two years ago, 342 IPOs took in $78.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was an anemic market for IPOs," he said. "This year
it's almost dead."</TE>
<TE>   At the Register, the staff is closely monitoring events, said a
staff writer who requested anonymity. Employees recently peppered
Wolgemuth with questions at a staff meeting, asking him about the
likelihood of a sale.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't affecting peoples' work, but it's definitely on their
minds," the writer said. "Reporters are keeping their ears open."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing to Be Sold at Bargain-Basement Price</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Bankruptcy Court judge accepts Hong Kong
billionaire's $250-million offer for controlling interest in
fiber-optic network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., once worth more than $50 billion, agreed Friday
to sell a majority share in the company for a mere $250 million,
giving a company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing the
world's largest fiber-optic network and leaving banks and other
creditors with a tiny fraction of the $12.4 billion they are owed.</LD>
<LD>   The price tag underscores the steep devaluation of
telecommunications assets in recent months as conditions in the
industry have worsened, and also marks the beginning of the final
chapter of the nation's fifth-largest bankruptcy case.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as late May, Li's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and partner
Singapore Technologies Telemedia were offering $750 million in cash
for a 79% stake in a restructured Global Crossing. But that offer was
rejected by creditors as inadequate, and other offers weren't
accepted.</LD>
<TE>   The new bid, backed by creditors and approved early Friday by
Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in New York, gives the company $250
million in funding and gives Global Crossing's banks $300 million in
cash along with a 6% stake in the restructured company. Hutchison and
STT would get a 61.5% stake and other creditors would split an equity
stake of 32.5% and $25 million in new debt.</TE>
<TE>   Holders of Bermuda-based Global Crossing's stock, once worth more
than $62 a share, will get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good thing for the buyers, because they get a very
robust set of assets at a super-basement price--over 100,000 miles of
fiber in 27 countries and 200 cities," said Roger Wery, a
telecommunications specialist at consulting firm PRTM.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the sharply lower final bid, Wery added: "Somebody must
regret the decision they made earlier" to reject the initial offer.
The low price also "drags down the value of the rest of the market"
at a time when WorldCom Inc. and several other telecom firms are
either in bankruptcy or teetering on the edge of financial collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Hutchison and STT executives said their offer
"represents the best outcome" for Global's creditors, customers and
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere said Friday that he
didn't regret passing up the higher offer from Hutchison and STT:
"It's all in the rearview mirror. I think the end result for the
banks and the creditors and for the company is a great one."</TE>
<TE>   Michael S. Pascazi, president of Fiber Optek Interconnect Corp.,
which expressed interest in buying Global but was never taken
seriously, strongly disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing smacks of desperation ... and the gain to the
Hutchison group will be staggering," Pascazi said. "Are creditors and
bankers so fearful of tomorrow that they'll take whatever they can
today?"</TE>
<TE>   The deal with Singapore-based STT and Hutchison still must win
regulatory and legal approvals and then pass muster as the heart of
Global Crossing's final restructuring plan.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's buyout could reignite concerns in Washington
about critical telecommunications infrastructure being purchased by
foreign companies. Earlier this year, several lawmakers objected to
the first deal with Hutchison and STT, noting that Hutchison owner Li
has close ties with the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   Li is among the richest men in Asia and presides over a global
empire that includes telecommunications and real estate companies as
well as supermarkets and the world's largest private port.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said he believes regulators and Congress now will look more
favorably on a Hutchison-STT deal "if it can help keep competition
and allow some of the critical national assets, like ours, to
survive."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing plans to file its plan Sept. 16, and hopes to win
court approval and emerge from bankruptcy protection in late January.
The company will keep its teleconferencing unit, its network in
Britain, and Global Marine, which builds, maintains and repairs
undersea fiber networks. All three had been for sale, but offers for
them were deemed too low. Legere and other Global Crossing managers,
most of whom have received lucrative retention bonuses, would get an
8% stake in the reorganized company.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the Asian firms will take over Global
Crossing's 58.5% ownership in Asia Global Crossing, which operates a
fiber network serving parts of Asia. Until recently, Hutchison and
STT both had partnerships with Asia Global, fueling speculation that
the two companies will move to invest in Asia Global separately.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global, also based in Bermuda, has embarked on its own
fund-raising effort, and could end up in bankruptcy itself as part of
a comprehensive restructuring. Asia Global is said to be looking for
about $250 million in funding and is reviewing several potential
investment offers.</TE>
<TE>   "Asia Global Crossing still does not have a fully funded business
plan, so our restructuring process is continuing," said Madelyn
Smith, a company spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller subsidiary ran into financial difficulty when Global
Crossing reneged on a deal to provide Asia Global with $400 million
in funding.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Asia Global has stabilized its balance sheet by
renegotiating terms with its banks and raising money through the sale
of stakes in several partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   When it emerges from bankruptcy, Global Crossing will be a far
different--and smaller--company, with little or no involvement from
Gary Winnick, the Los Angeles financier who presided over the company
since its founding in 1997. Winnick will not have shares in the new
firm, according to Legere, but he will remain chairman and a board
member until the company completes the bankruptcy process.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick came under intense criticism as details emerged of Global
Crossing's woeful financial condition and the millions of dollars the
firm paid out to executives in salaries and bonuses. He also has been
lambasted for spending lavishly at the company and then cashing out
more than $575 million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   While Winnick's salesmanship won the company billions of dollars
in funding to build the firm's massive network, Global Crossing never
made a profit and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI and
Congressional investigators are looking into whether its executives
used accounting schemes to mislead investors about the company's
deteriorating condition.</TE>
<TE>   Crippled by hefty debt payments and an industrywide meltdown,
Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy Jan. 28, becoming the first in a
series of telecom disasters that attracted intense scrutiny from
Congress and federal regulators. The company listed $22.4 billion in
assets and $12.4 billion in debts, making it the nation's
fourth-largest Chapter 11 filing at the time. WorldCom's bankruptcy
filing in July made Global the fifth-largest such case.</TE>
<TE>   The Hutchison-STT agreement came after weeks of scrambling to
collect and review bids. More than 60 firms initially expressed
interest, but that number quickly narrowed to a handful of serious
candidates. Global Crossing postponed the final phase of its sale six
times, and considered a late offer from a group led by David Walsh,
who was Global Crossing's president and chief operating officer until
being forced out by Legere last year.</TE>
<TE>   If certain conditions aren't met or the deal is canceled, the
companies can collect a $30-million fee.</TE>

<HD>Townhomes and Condos Not Unattached for Long</HD>
<DH>Housing: Buyers scoop up nearly all available new attached
units in Southern California as construction falls far behind demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers in search of recently built homes nearly picked the Southland
clean this spring, driving supplies to record lows. The dearth of new
attached housing was particularly acute: Only one townhouse in Los
Angeles and Orange counties was unclaimed at the end of June.</LD>
<LD>   The lone unit, in a gated community in Malibu with an asking price
of $769,000, reflects the widening chasm between housing demand and
new construction in the state's largest metropolitan areas.</LD>
<LD>   Production of all types of housing in Southern California has
fallen well below peak levels from the mid-1980s, but a new report
shows the shortfall in available townhomes, condominiums and other
attached units has reached extraordinary depths.</LD>
<TE>   Meyers Group found only six new townhomes or duplexes unsold at
the end of June between Rincon Point in Ventura County and the
Mexican border, a region with more residents than each state in the
U.S. except California and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The number of unsold homes that were finished or would be finished
within a month has sunk to the lowest point since the real estate
research firm in Irvine began tracking what's known as standing
inventory in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a one-week supply of new attached and single-family
homes existed regionwide during the quarter that ended in June, which
almost certainly will lead to higher prices. Typically, a four-week
stockpile is needed to balance supply with demand, analysts at Meyers
Group said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disheartening," said Ray Pearl, who heads the Los Angeles
and Ventura County chapters of the Building Industry Assn. of
Southern California, an industry trade group. "It's just another
example of the huge demand for housing and the difficulty in
providing the supply."</TE>
<TE>   Even for Southern Californians, who have been known to wait months
to learn whether their names have been selected in lotteries of
potential buyers or to camp out for days to buy homes sold on a
first-come basis, the scarcity of new units was remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a warning," said Joe Carreras, the lead regional planner for
the Southern California Assn. of Governments. "If you want to avoid
further price escalation and other side effects of too little
housing, then this is not good news."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in new construction has occurred at the same time that
falling interest rates have driven up demand. Earlier this week,
mortgage applications reached their highest level in more than a
decade, according to a report released by the Mortgage Bankers Assn.
of America.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers' choices, meanwhile, are dwindling. In Orange County, only
23 new single-family homes--and no attached homes--were available at
the end of the quarter, a drop of 84% from a year earlier. In Los
Angeles County, the number of new homes fell to 147 units, half the
number that were available at the end of the quarter a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders are much more active in other, smaller metropolitan
areas of the country. In Seattle, for instance, more condos and
townhomes were sold in the second quarter than in Orange and Los
Angeles counties combined.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more new units could be sold in Southern California if they
were available," said Jeff Meyers, whose Irvine firm compiled the
quarterly report. "But a limited supply is really catching up to us
now since we have job growth and favorable interest rates."</TE>
<TE>   With home prices climbing to record highs nationwide, some U.S.
metropolitan areas have seen construction of townhomes and
condominiums rise. In Chicago, slightly more than half of all new
homes sold are attached.</TE>
<TE>   But development of attached units has become rare in Southern
California. In Orange County, such housing accounted for about 63% of
new units built in 1992. Today only about 18% of the units coming to
market are attached.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cite several factors that have led to the decline in
construction of condos and townhomes in California. Construction
defect lawsuits are the most common complaint of builders, who could
face disputes as long as a decade after completing a project.</TE>
<TE>   Although builders say the cost of settling predictable lawsuits
makes condo development too risky, other market observers believe
that poor construction standards are to blame. And insurers, often
stuck with paying $4 or more in claims for every $1 taken in
premiums, essentially have stopped writing coverage for condo
construction, an insurance trade group said.</TE>
<TE>   Condo developments often face opposition from nearby homeowners,
who fear their presence will lower property values while adding
unwelcome density and street traffic. Analysts say consumer
preference for single-family homes and lenders' reluctance to finance
such projects after the market was saturated in the 1990s also
contributed to the decline.</TE>
<TE>   Remedies that could stimulate production of attached units have
been elusive. New laws and recent court rulings have yet to settle
long-standing differences between builders, insurers, trial lawyers
and consumer advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Those groups have been meeting with state legislators, trying to
craft a bill that may be approved by the Assembly before it breaks at
the end of the month. The proposal would grant builders a certain
amount of time to resolve disputes before homeowners could file
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance lobbyists are uncertain whether the new proposal would
reduce costs enough to lure back underwriters to the attached market,
or to curb fears over rising defect litigation on single-family
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is that you will reduce the number of cases coming to
trial by solving them, but we don't know to what degree that will
happen," said Mark Sektnan of the American Insurance Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In California, only 5,600 attached homes came to market last year,
the vast majority of them in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Several new projects are in the works, but supply is expected to
fall far short of demand.</TE>
<TE>   At Playa Vista, whose initial phase over the next three years will
put 3,200 condos, townhomes and apartments in West Los Angeles, as
many as 10 potential buyers could vie for each home, said Ken Agid,
vice president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we built all 13,000 units that we potentially have," Agid said
of the project, "we would still have difficulty in supplying the
demand."</TE>
<TE>   The builders of the lone Malibu townhouse left at the end of June
easily found a buyer. Co-developer James Rodgers expects the property
to be in escrow by early next week.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Announced in Phone Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Telecom: AT&amp;T, Lucent and others were accused of collecting
rental fees for outdated or unused models.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc. and other phone makers have
agreed to pay up to $300 million to settle a class-action lawsuit
accusing them of collecting exorbitant monthly rental fees for
outdated or unused phones.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, announced late Friday, was accepted by a Circuit
Court judge in Illinois, where the case was set to go to trial this
week.</LD>
<LD>   It's unclear how many telephone customers will share in the
settlement, but a Lucent spokesman said up to 30 million customers
could qualify for part of the settlement. Attorneys will place
advertisements in general newspapers to notify potential recipients.</LD>
<TE>   The case, filed in 1996, takes aim at the controversial practice
by phone companies of continuing to collect rental fees for rotary
phones and other old models that most customers long ago replaced
with cheaper, more advanced models. Many consumers have continued to
pay the phone rental fees, which ran $4.25 a month for a basic phone,
not realizing that new phones cost as little as $15 at electronics
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent said it would take its part of the settlement, $162
million, as a charge against its fiscal third-quarter results to be
announced next week, Bloomberg News reported. AT&amp;T, the largest U.S.
long-distance phone company, said it is paying $130 million before
taxes in the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also includes prepaid calling cards, which are
being donated to charities, Lucent said.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T into smaller local telephone
companies, customers could choose to keep leased phones or buy new
ones. The lawsuit accused the companies of misleading actions over
the leases and charges for them, Lucent said.</TE>
<TE>   Avaya Inc. and NCR Corp., former units of Lucent and AT&amp;T, also
will pay part of the settlement, which must be approved by the court.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based AT&amp;T, the largest U.S. long-distance company, spun
off Lucent, its phone equipment arm, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   All companies involved said they did not admit liability in the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   NCR spokesman John Hourigan said his company would be liable for
about 3% of the settlement, according to terms of NCR's 1996 spinoff
from AT&amp;T. He couldn't provide the exact amount that Dayton,
Ohio-based NCR would pay.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Newman, a spokeswoman for Avaya, said that the company had
not yet figured out its share of the agreement and that it would not
be final until the suit's claims and attorneys' fees are resolved.
Basking Ridge, N.J.-based Avaya is the office telephone unit spun off
from Lucent in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement agreement was disclosed after the markets closed.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Lucent fell 2 cents to $1.49, AT&amp;T
rose 20 cents to $10, Avaya climbed 10 cents to $1.40, and NCR was
unchanged at $27.</TE>

<HD>Blue Chips' Week Is Best Since Sept.</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow and S&amp;P 500 rise for fourth day. Emulex
warning weighs on tech shares; Nasdaq slips for the day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks shrugged off early losses Friday to rack up their
fourth day of gains and cap their best week in nearly a year. But
technology stocks slid as a sales warning from Costa Mesa-based
Emulex reminded investors that the profit outlook for corporate
America is still cloudy.</LD>
<LD>   "The fundamentals haven't improved, and the tech picture hasn't
improved," said Frederick Sears, a fund manager at Eastern Point
Advisors.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.43 points, or 0.4%, to
8,745.45. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 3.18 points,
or 0.4%, to 908.64, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index
fell 10.40 points, or 0.8%, to 1,306.12.</LD>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, while
losers outnumbered winners by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow climbed 5.2%, giving the blue-chip gauge its
largest percentage weekly gain since a late-September jump after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 gained 5.1% for the week. It was the third straight
winning week for the Dow and S&amp;P 500. Despite Friday's loss, Nasdaq
rose 4.7%, snapping a five-week losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was light Friday as investors sat on the sidelines in
advance of Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting. Stocks gained this
week, in part, on hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates in an
attempt to lift the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists do not expect the central bank to cut as early as
next week, but Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist bucked the
trend, saying he thinks the Fed will lower its target rate by half a
percentage point.</TE>
<TE>   "The single biggest thing that fueled this week's rally was
speculation the Fed will be more aggressive, and that we could see a
cut as early as Tuesday," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer
at Value Line Asset Management. "It is our view that expectation is
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Growing skepticism about a rate cut helped push up yields on
shorter-dated Treasury securities, while yields on longer-term
Treasuries plummeted. The yield on the six-month Treasury bill inched
up to 1.59% from 1.58% on Thursday, while the yield on the benchmark
10-year T-note fell to 4.26% from 4.39%--its biggest one-day slide in
six months.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest economic news, the Labor Department reported Friday
that the productivity of U.S. workers grew in the second quarter, but
at a sharply slower pace than the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Emulex kept the pressure on technology stocks, falling $8.34, or
35%, to $15.27, making it the biggest percentage loser on Nasdaq and
pulling down shares of rival data storage equipment makers. Emulex
said it expects sales to be weaker than analysts expected amid a
difficult environment for business spending.</TE>
<TE>   Worries over corporate scandals remain near the top of Wall
Street's list of concerns, heightened by WorldCom's disclosure late
Thursday of more accounting problems. The news came only days before
Wednesday's deadline for top officers of almost 1,000 big U.S.
companies to certify their financial results to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar eased against the euro and the
Japanese yen, while gold and oil futures rose.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold-mining stocks rallied as the price for the metal rose.
Newmont Mining added $2.05 to $26.78, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp;
Gold rose 98 cents to $16.19. The Amex index of gold stocks climbed
6.1%.</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. Laboratories surged $4.59, or 47%, to $14.39 and ranked as
the biggest percentage gainer on Nasdaq. France-based Bureau Veritas
said it had agreed to buy the quality-control services provider for
$83 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Best Buy bounced up $1.71 to $21.26, recouping part of
Thursday's 36% loss suffered when the retailer cut its profit outlook
for the second time in two months as consumers curtailed spending.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth, the third-largest local phone company, fell 65 cents to
$23.95. Phone stocks were the worst-performing industry group in the
S&amp;P 500 this week, with BellSouth dropping 7.7% and Verizon
Communications declining 5.4%. Verizon rose 55 cents to $30.25 on
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Napster's Assets Go Up for Auction</HD>
<DH>Internet: A securities firm is seeking a buyer that could
outbid Bertelsmann.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For sale: One of the world's best-known brands, with 60 million
former customers. New and improved technology included, with no
liabilities from past legal unpleasantness. May come with
generational icon.</LD>
<LD>   The assets of file-sharing service Napster Inc. went up for
auction Friday with an asking price of $25 million and a deadline
eight business days away.</LD>
<LD>   A securities firm hired by Napster's creditors will try to drum up
interest between now and the Aug. 21 bid deadline, pitching everyone
from venture capitalists, music retailers and media firms to major
record labels that drove Napster into bankruptcy this year.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just going to be keeping our heads down and marketing up to
the last minute," said Rick Chance, managing director of Trenwith
Securities in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   German publishing giant Bertelsmann, which had advanced Napster
more than $85 million in loans, is funding the Redwood City,
Calif.-based firm's operations during its bankruptcy reorganization.
It promised in writing to bid $9 million more at an auction to be
conducted at an Aug. 27 hearing, bringing the total value of
Bertelmann's bid to more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the creditors committee named by the bankruptcy judge is
hoping it can do better, and it hired Trenwith to try.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, which includes the law firm of former Napster
litigator David Boies and some music and software companies, thinks
the judge might not count most of Bertelsmann's initial $85 million,
in which case the winning bidder could put up as little as $25
million.</TE>
<TE>   That's still a lot for a dormant business, even with the
bankruptcy process washing away liability from the labels' massive
copyright infringement lawsuit. Napster's new service allows for
payments to be made to song owners, but it hasn't yet struck deals
with major labels to put music on it.</TE>
<TE>   But over time, authorized online music distribution will be a
billion-dollar business, and Napster is the brand to beat, Chance
explained in a 14-page brochure and an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of a play is more long term," Chance said. "You first
need a belief that this is going to be a major distribution channel."</TE>
<TE>   The brochure says that although competitors such as Listen.com are
getting more digitized music from labels, burning CDs still is
difficult. And Chance said pirate services are losing more court
battles, so legitimate services eventually will do well.</TE>
<TE>   In that contest, Napster's service is easy to use and can tap its
old customers, the brochure says: "According to a Harris Interactive
poll taken when the Napster site was operational, 70% of Napster
users indicated they would be willing to pay for the service."</TE>
<TE>   The current economic environment isn't a good one for technology
sales, Chance said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this is a tough time for any marketing of assets," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Chance's efforts may benefit from the recent ouster of Bertelsmann
Chief Executive and Napster champion Thomas Middelhoff.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's new leaders haven't told Napster CEO Konrad Hilbers
and founder and Chief Technology Officer Shawn Fanning what they plan
on doing with Napster if or when a sale is consummated, Hilbers said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Napster had been slated to become part of Bertelsmann's
direct-sales group under executive Klaus Eierhoff. But Eierhoff was
fired last week.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, when Hilbers hadn't heard anything from
Middelhoff successor Gunter Thielen, he said he "personally contacted
Eierhoff and explained the strategy. Now, unfortunately, he is gone
too."</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal with Bertelsmann, Napster's executives are barred
from trying to shop the company to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   But the upheaval in Germany means they probably will be more
responsive to prospective bidders who come to ask questions. They
also are more likely to stick around if someone else wins the
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Fanning, 21, would sign up with a different Napster
owner, Hilbers said it depended on the buyer's intentions.</TE>
<TE>   "The current management team is committed to building a digital
music platform," he said. "If someone comes in and wants to use the
Napster brand for an MP3 player, they don't need the management team
to do that."</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Recalls PT Cruisers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Almost every PT Cruiser built since the line went into production a
little more than two years ago is being recalled to repair a problem
that could cause a leak in the fuel tank, the Chrysler Group said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The only ones not being recalled are 2003 model year vehicles that
went into production in July. Owners will be notified by mail.</LD>
<LD>   The PT Cruiser has been one of the most successful vehicles in the
Chrysler Group's lineup. Of the 464,315 built in the 2001 and 2002
model years, 425,083 had been sold through the end of July.</LD>
<TE>   One analyst said nothing should be inferred about the overall
quality of the car.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bum part that may or may not reflect a real-world
problem," said Jim Hall, vice president of automotive consulting firm
AutoPacific Inc. He added that it could be a sign of quality issues
with the part supplier.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler would not reveal the name of the supplier, as is
customary when announcing a recall.</TE>
<TE>   If a spark should come in contact with leaking fuel, it could
ignite a fire, Chrysler spokeswoman Ann Smith said. Officials
discovered the leak after a government crash test in May, she said.
Chrysler subsequently conducted an internal investigation into the
leaks before issuing the recall.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Chrysler's parent, DaimlerChrysler, rose 40 cents to
close at $43.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former officials of Sunbeam Corp., a household appliance maker
seeking bankruptcy protection, won a judge's approval to pay $31
million to settle a federal class-action lawsuit with shareholders
who alleged fraud.</LD>
<LD>   After a hearing in West Palm Beach, Fla., U.S. District Judge
Donald Middlebrooks approved the settlement, to be paid in part by
Sunbeam insurers.</LD>
<LD>   In the lawsuit, filed in 1998, more than a dozen Sunbeam
stockholders accused former Chief Executive Al Dunlap and former
directors of artificially inflating revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Boca Raton, Fla.-based Sunbeam, which reported $2.39
billion in fiscal 1999 sales and a $299.5-million loss, fell less
than 1 cent to 8 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<LD>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had a
35% increase in second-quarter net income to $1.05 billion, or $681 a
share, as its insurance units raised prices and had fewer claims.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings excluding gains from sales of securities were $1.03
billion, or $673 a share, beating the $550 average estimate of
analysts.</LD>
<LD>   Units General Reinsurance Corp., the third-largest reinsurer, and
Geico Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. car insurer, are benefiting from
higher rates after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which generated
$58 billion in claims.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growth in the productivity of U.S. workers slipped sharply in the
second quarter, the government reported, but managed to maintain
positive momentum in the face of a sluggish economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department said worker output per hour in nonfarm
businesses advanced at a 1.1% annual rate in the second quarter, down
from the upwardly revised 8.6% pace in the previous quarter and the
weakest showing since the second quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The fall in productivity growth reflected a much slower pace of
economic output, as the number of worker hours fell for a fifth
straight quarter. Output rose at a 0.5% clip in the quarter, down
from a 6.2% increase in the first quarter, while hours worked fell at
a 0.7% rate.</LD>

<HD>Sonicblue CEO Ousted After Loan Dispute</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Potashner said Sonicblue Inc. ousted him as chief executive and
chairman over an ultimatum he made that board members repay their
sweetheart loans early or resign.</LD>
<LD>   Potashner said he was fired from the maker of Replay TV after
describing his boardroom confrontation on the issue to a newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Potashner's immediate replacement, interim CEO L. Gregory Ballard,
denied that the loan dispute was behind the ouster but said the board
would reevaluate the loans now that investors are scrutinizing
accounting at many companies. He refused to discuss the board's
reasons for the dismissal.</LD>
<TE>   Potashner and other board members received loans from the company
to purchase stock in RioPort Inc., a company partly owned by
Sonicblue that has yet to go public. Only Potashner is required to
repay his loan with interest.</TE>
<TE>   The loans to Sonicblue board members were not illegal when they
were issued in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nor were such loans uncommon--server maker Sun Microsystems Inc.
disclosed Friday that it loaned $6.4 million to six executives and
board members in 2001 and this year, of which $5.4 million was
outstanding.</TE>

<BD>City News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor Jim Hahn and Councilman Jack Weiss sent a letter to
Adelphia Communications Corp. urging the troubled cable company to
abandon a plan to increase rates.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of the many issues that have eroded consumer confidence
in Adelphia, we urge you to withdraw your request to increase current
subscription rates," the officials said in the letter to Erland
Kailbourne, the company's interim chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   The officials cited Adelphia's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing, the federal arrest of Adelphia's founder and his sons on
federal charges of bilking shareholders and looting the company
coffers, and a civil lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in calling the rate increase proposal "ill-advised."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the City Council called for any future agreements
with Adelphia for city cable franchises to include guarantees of
high-speed Internet and data connections, which Weiss said were
promised to subscribers but have never been delivered.</TE>

networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus and the users who swap digital

their record labels.</LD>

<HD>Bridgestone Returns to Profit in First Half</HD>
<DH>Tires: U.S. sales turn around dramatically after being hurt
by the Firestone recall. The firm expects earnings to quadruple this
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp. said Friday that it returned to
profitability in the first half of the year as sales in the United
States made a dramatic turnaround after the massive tire recall
scandal that nearly destroyed its U.S. Firestone brand.</LD>
<LD>   Bridgestone, the world's largest manufacturer of tires and other
rubber products, also announced plans to invest $250 million to
expand global production to cope with the shift to larger tires as
well as growing demand for tires in industrializing nations.</LD>
<LD>   The tire maker said it would stop producing some lower-grade tires
in Japan and switch to producing more of the larger and more
expensive tires. Production will increase in Asia, including
Thailand, Indonesia and China, as well as in Poland and South
America, it said.</LD>
<TE>   For the six months ended June 30, Bridgestone earned $200 million
on sales of $9 billion, the company said. It lost more than $250
million in the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "These types of results show that the recovery at Firestone is
progressing well," President Shigeo Watanabe told a news conference
in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgestone was badly hurt by a recall of 6.5 million tires two
years ago at Nashville-based Bridgestone/Firestone after the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating tires
alleged to have been involved in hundreds of deaths and injuries.
Bridgestone/Firestone later expanded the recall.</TE>
<TE>   The tire maker, which has had to settle hundreds of lawsuits over
the recalled tires, expects better times as the company recovers from
the recall costs.</TE>
<TE>   It said Friday that it expects to quadruple profit for this year
to $579 million, up from $141 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgestone's profit shrank last year after it took a $1.7-billion
loss for tire recalls and litigation fees and for closing a plant in
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first half of this year, sales in North America jumped
12% from a year ago to $4.1 billion. Sales were solid in truck and
bus tires as well as in tires for passenger cars and minivans, driven
by a demand for Bridgestone tires, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgestone's U.S. sales bounced back this year after a strategic
decision to emphasize its Bridgestone brand in the United States. The
deterioration in its 102-year-old Firestone brand also has been less
than many analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgestone said Firestone was expected to report a $50-million
profit in the 12 months ending in December after two years of losses,
up from an earlier forecast of a $10-million profit.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a lagging economy that slowed sales in Japan, Bridgestone
sales here edged up 1% in the first half to $4 billion. Sales in
Europe grew 8% to $977 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the year, Bridgestone expects demand for tires in
the United States to remain strong and sales in Japan and Europe to
hold steady. But the company pointed to the weakening U.S. dollar and
uncertainty in Japan's economic recovery as possible danger signs
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   A strong dollar helps exporters such as Bridgestone by lifting the
value of its overseas earnings.</TE>

<HD>Poll's Findings Renew Pessimism Among Brazilian Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian financial markets fell Friday as a fresh election poll put
a damper on investor optimism over the country's record loan deal
with the International Monetary Fund.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil's currency, stocks and bonds rallied sharply Thursday after
the IMF announced it would lend the troubled country $30 billion,
briefly putting a lid on market fears that a leftist may be elected
president in October.</LD>
<LD>   Those same fears, however, roiled markets again Friday after a
local polling firm released a survey showing the market's top pick
for president, government-backed candidate Jose Serra, falling
further behind two left-leaning opponents.</LD>
<TE>   There also was speculation that a separate poll due out Sunday
would show Serra slipping into fourth place, an event that might
prompt the former health minister to pull out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Serra dismissed the talk as "market rumors."</TE>
<TE>   "The IMF deal was fantastic, but it would be naive to think that
all of our problems have suddenly been solved," said Alexandre
Vasarhelyi, head of foreign exchange at ING Barings.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's currency, the real, fell nearly 4% against the dollar,
erasing Thursday's gains despite an attempt by the Central Bank to
prop up the currency. The real has shed more than 23% of its value
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's benchmark Bovespa index slid 3.2%, dragged down by
heavy losses across the board. On Thursday, the Bovespa surged 4.5%,
posting its biggest one-day percentage gain of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Though the market remained enthusiastic about the IMF bailout, few
expected the accord would be enough to fuel a long-term rally in
Brazilian assets, analysts said.</TE>

<LD>A House committee plans to subpoena information from Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney unit to see if WorldCom Inc. executives received
favorable treatment from the investment firm in doling out shares of
initial public stock offerings.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee is investigating whether
Salomon analyst Jack Grubman sold executives the stock to help win
investment banking business. The company has said privacy laws
prevented it from providing the data on people who bought the stock.</LD>
<LD>   "The subpoena will solve that problem," said Peggy Peterson, a
spokeswoman for Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), who heads the panel.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans have said they remain unsatisfied with
Grubman's response at a committee hearing last month that he didn't
recall whether former WorldCom CEO Bernard J. Ebbers and other
executives had been allowed to buy newly offered shares that were
sure bets.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy last month after
revealing it hid billions in expenses. Lawmakers have accused Grubman
of not scrutinizing WorldCom's finances because of his close
relationship with Ebbers.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service on Friday raised Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
long-term credit ratings, saying the Wall Street bank enjoys high
market shares in its merger, equity and brokerage businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The upgrade marks a break from the gloom that has settled over
many investment and commercial banks suffering from underwriting
declines, exposure to such risky credits as WorldCom Inc. and
Argentina, and more exacting scrutiny of their research practices.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's raised Goldman Sachs' senior unsecured debt one notch to
Aa3 from A1. Goldman shares rose $1.15 to $75.45 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>

<HD>Blast Rocks Building, Kills 25 in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In what was either a horrific industrial accident or a terrorist
attack, a powerful explosion ripped through the eastern city of
Jalalabad on Friday, leaving at least 25 people dead and destroying
dozens of homes.</LD>
<LD>   Initial police reports said the midday blast in Nangarhar province
was caused by a car bomb at the Afghanistan Construction and
Logistics Unit, a construction company.</LD>
<LD>   But Deputy Gov. Mohammed Assef Qazi later told radio reporters
that the source may have been explosives stored on the premises.</LD>
<TE>   Assef said that the death toll may reach as high as 40 and that 80
people were hospitalized. The explosion knocked out power in the city
after damaging a nearby hydroelectric facility.</TE>
<TE>   The company was once a nongovernmental agency funded by the United
Nations to rebuild Afghanistan's war-ravaged infrastructure. But the
firm reportedly became private in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Sultan, military commander for the district, told
Associated Press that he believed an explosives-laden car was
detonated in a basement garage of the building. He blamed the blast
on "Al Qaeda and the Taliban, the enemies of Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Accident or act of terrorism, the explosion added to the jitters
that many Afghans feel as the first anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks nears. There have been recent concerns that Al Qaeda is
stepping up operations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military Friday reported several recent encounters with
Al Qaeda fighters, the latest being a firefight this week in which
six members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network were killed.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a sniper shot and wounded a U.S. soldier with the
82nd Airborne Division in eastern Afghanistan. The unidentified
sniper escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, 13 Al Qaeda prisoners escaped from a high-security
prison in Kabul, the capital. All were slain after being cornered by
security forces and refusing to surrender; three killed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan security forces say they intercepted a would-be suicide car
bomber July 29 who had planned to attack President Hamid Karzai. The
driver was captured before he could detonate the bomb, and he later
confessed to being a member of Al Qaeda, government officials said
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Jalalabad was the hometown of Afghan Vice President Haji Abdul
Qadir, who was killed July 6 outside his office in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Friday
that he did not view the recent clashes as a sign of escalating
activity by Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "These recent events underscore the fact that while we've made
good progress in the war against terror, it certainly is far from
over in Afghanistan and throughout the world," Rumsfeld said.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. State Department designated the Communist Party of the
Philippines as a foreign terrorist organization.</LD>
<LD>   The party's military wing, known as the New People's Army, has
been fighting for three decades to establish a Marxist state.</LD>
<LD>   "The New People's Army strongly opposes any U.S. presence in the
Philippines and has killed U.S. citizens there," Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell said in a statement. The terrorist designation makes
it illegal for U.S. residents to give the group money or other
support and requires U.S. banks to freeze the group's assets.</LD>

<HD>Arafat OKs Foreign Role in Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Friday after
high-level talks between Palestinians and the United States that
American, Egyptian and Jordanian officials would oversee reforms to
Palestinian security services.</LD>
<LD>   Security reforms and elections pledged by Arafat under
international pressure are seen as crucial to reviving talks with
Israel on a Palestinian state after 22 months of violence against
Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington on Thursday, National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and three other Cabinet
members addressed Palestinian reforms to help overcome the Middle
East's bloody stalemate.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat, in an interview Friday with the Arab satellite channel Al
Jazeera, described the talks as "positive and constructive" and said
it was agreed that foreign experts would help overhaul the
Palestinian security apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an agreement that Americans, Egyptians and Jordanians
will come and administer the training of our security branches,"
Arafat said from his West Bank compound.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon branded the
Palestinian Authority a "murderous gang."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians said Sharon's broadside was an attempt to
sabotage their first high-level talks with Washington in months.</TE>
<TE>   There was new violence Friday as Israeli troops shot dead a
Palestinian in the West Bank town of Tulkarm, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The army said soldiers acted after being fired upon. Tulkarm has
been occupied by the military and under curfew since June, after a
spate of suicide bombings in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for a possible Iraqi missile attack in the event of
a U.S. assault on Baghdad, Israel has activated a new Arrow-2
antimissile battery, Israeli security sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials believe that the Arrow can fend off attacks such
as the Scud ground-to-ground missile barrages Israel suffered during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>

<HD>Progress Hems In Nomadic Herders of Tibet</HD>
<DH>Asia: Fencing, says China, saves grassland. Critics charge
that it's destroying a way of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>DAMSHUNG, Tibet</DL>
<LD>For centuries, change came only with the seasons to Tibet's alpine
grasslands, painted rusty yellow in winter and emerald green in
summer.</LD>
<LD>   Yaks and sheep roamed free in lush pastures more than two miles
high. As the chill of winter neared, nomadic herders moved the
animals into the valleys through mountain passes festooned with
colorful prayer flags.</LD>
<LD>   These days, barbed-wire fences surround the beasts, and a yak
sperm bank has opened for business.</LD>
<TE>   A far-reaching policy designed to protect grasslands and improve
the nomads' livelihoods is bringing rapid change to Damshung, a
county of pastures in the foothills of the snowcapped Thangla
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a big believer in 'zoo culture,' " said Melvyn Goldstein,
a Tibet expert at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "I
don't believe that Tibetan nomads should be the same as they were in
1959 any more than farmers in Ohio should be the way they were in
1900."</TE>
<TE>   But the economic development initiative, launched by the Beijing
government a decade ago in other range-land areas of China and about
a year ago in parts of Tibet, has raised serious questions about what
is best for Tibet's unique culture and natural environment.</TE>
<TE>   Many pro-independence Tibetans see the policy, which uses
technology and improved infrastructure to encourage a shift from
subsistence herding to industrial livestock production, not only as
bad for the environment but also as an assault on the foundation of
Tibetan identity and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "The nomadic instinct to move from one place to another is in our
psychology and culture," said Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the
Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala, India. "This mobility is
indicative of the freedom of the open spaces of Tibet."</TE>
<TE>   China and Tibet maintained complex relations for centuries, but in
1950, the new Communist government in Beijing sent troops into Tibet
and claimed sovereignty over the region. After an abortive uprising,
Tibet's traditional government, headed by the Dalai Lama, fled into
exile in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials blame the nomads' "unscientific" herding methods
for a degradation of the grasslands that make up 70% of Tibet. Grass
yields per unit of land are down, they argue, noxious weeds are
replacing usable grasses, and soil erosion is spreading.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the government also see degradation, but instead blame
official policies and mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that is not in question is the singularity of Tibet's
environment. Scientists widely agree that the region's high-altitude
pastureland is one of the world's important ecosystems, like tropical
rain forests or arctic tundra, which should be preserved as a
functioning habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The Tibetan plateau covers 850,000 square miles, accounting for
one-quarter of China's total land area. Like America's Great Plains,
Tibet's grasslands have supported and benefited from the grazing of
large animals. Wild yaks, asses, gazelles and antelopes unique to
Tibet still roam the area, although in decreasing numbers.</TE>
<TE>   In Damshung, which means "chosen valley" in Tibetan, 90% of the
county's 36,000 inhabitants are drokpa, or nomadic herders.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, nomad families sign long-term contracts to
use plots of state-owned land, which are sized according to the
family's number of animals and the land's estimated capacity for
supporting livestock.</TE>
<TE>   The government encourages them to build houses and barns to
replace their traditional yak-hair tents, and pays part of the cost
of putting up barbed-wire fences to enclose each plot.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the enclosures is good because it ensures that grass for
the animals to eat in springtime will be protected," Losang, a herder
and mother of three, said as she doled out bowls of rich homemade
yogurt for guests.</TE>
<TE>   With a herd of 11 yaks, 17 sheep and six goats, Losang's family
lives below the local poverty line, getting by on $121 to $242 a
year. The family sells the animals for grain or slaughters five or
six sheep at their fattest in summer and then sells the meat in
Lhasa.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrating nomads in permanent settlements also enables the
government to provide more social services, from roads and health
clinics to schools and electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, before the new initiative got underway, Losang and
her family built their first house, with wooden beams, an earthen
floor and a low wall surrounding a yard. They got electricity last
year, and their first television, recently purchased, sits on a shelf
near pictures of Tibetan Buddhism's highest clerics, the Dalai Lama
and the Panchen Lama.</TE>
<TE>   Although nomads have generally welcomed new houses and fences for
their winter pastures, "not all the nomads accept the new policies,"
said Chungda, the government's second in command in the county. "But
their concepts are gradually changing."</TE>
<TE>   Nomads have especially balked at officials' insistence that they
"rationalize" their herds by selling or slaughtering more animals,
turning them into cash or food as insurance against the vicissitudes
of the environment. Damshung also runs a sperm bank that tries to
breed bigger, healthier yaks.</TE>
<TE>   One local nomad says he slaughters as few animals as
possible--just enough to enable him to survive or give to family
members in need. He earns extra income by selling salt and yak
butter.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pity for the animals," he said. "I have enough of
everything for myself, and I'm satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   That viewpoint reflects the Tibetan nomads' traditional aim of
maximizing herd size, motivated partly by Buddhist compassion for the
animals but also as a survival tactic.</TE>
<TE>   In Tibet's harsh environment, heavy snowfalls and periods of
severe cold often destroy large parts of herds and plunge nomads into
poverty. In the winter of 1997-98, for example, 3 million livestock
were lost in Tibet, as much as 70% of the animals in some townships.
Nomads take years to rebuild their herds after disasters like this.</TE>
<TE>   Mobility and herd diversity have traditionally been nomads' keys
to surviving these conditions by evenly allocating animals to
grasslands and taking advantage of local variations in climate and
vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   Many nomads have traditionally had home bases in the valleys,
where they spend two-thirds of the year. In summer, they move their
herds into the mountains to let their winter pastures regrow.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, nomads divided pastureland among clans--which had
strict rules governing when, where and for how long herds could
graze--and nomads who violated the rules could be fined.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that outsiders fail to acknowledge the wisdom and
sophistication of Tibetans' traditional livestock management, which
has allowed nomads to thrive for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply focusing on pasture or livestock development fundamentally
ignores the tight linkages between culture and the land," wrote Wu
Ning, an expert on range land at the Chengdu Institute of Biology, in
a recent article.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the policy oppose curtailing nomads' mobility and say
that fences could spark conflicts over access to water and could
hinder the migration of wild animals.</TE>
<TE>   The massive investment in fences and artificially seeded pastures
could place financial burdens on officials and herders--who share the
costs--without any certainty of returns, critics add.</TE>
<TE>   Markets cannot be created by fiat and, until they develop, the
critics contend, Tibet will be ill-suited to the commercial ranching
found in capitalist economies.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that scientifically, it's a bit dubious that there is
tremendous pressure from overstocking and overgrazing," said
Goldstein, whose studies in Tibet have found excess grassland
capacity. He said he suspects that some Chinese statistics on
increasing numbers of animals are inaccurate and constitute a flimsy
justification for the new policies.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we seldom went down to the local level to survey the
situation. We just sat in our offices and made up figures to report
to the Tibet Autonomous Region authorities," admitted a retired
official in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in charge of agriculture and
livestock policies.</TE>
<TE>   Many variables in the debate remain unknown, including climate
change. Chinese meteorologists say global warming might be
responsible for higher temperatures and less rainfall on the Tibetan
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   While nomads in other areas, including Africa and the Eurasian
steppes, have been pushed into increasingly inhospitable lands by
advances in irrigation and agriculture, Tibetan nomads continue to
thrive in the same harsh environment where their pastoralism
developed centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the nomads are widely misunderstood, and experts say outsiders
still harbor many misconceptions about them. One is that they are
constantly on the move. In fact, many stay at their home bases for
all but a few months of the summer grass-growing season.</TE>
<TE>   The two or three times that they break camp and move each year,
nomads pile their tents and belongings on yaks' backs in an hour or
two. Most treks between summer and winter pastures are no more than
40 miles, or a day on horseback. Because livestock spend most of
their time grazing and putting on fat for winter, nomads avoid when
possible long treks that burn animals' calories.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some Westerners' shock at the modern world intruding on
Tibet's idyllic grasslands, many of the nomads are happy to see their
standards of living improve.</TE>
<TE>   But one nomad who has become a prosperous businessman observed:
"Nomads are very conflicted about whether or not to come down from
the mountains and live a more settled life. Some young people find
the traditional lifestyle boring."</TE>
<TE>   Having chosen a more modern lifestyle, he still feels conflicted,
but knows there's no going back.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I felt superior to my friends at home. I had flown in
airplanes and seen big cities," he recalled. "But when I returned
home, I discovered that although they had nothing, they were
extremely happy, while my new life was filled with many worries."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The next time the Tel Aviv soccer team plays a home game, it will
probably be in Bulgaria.</LD>
<LD>   The reason: No professional soccer team has been allowed to play
in Israel for months because the sport's European governing body
considers the country too dangerous. So Israeli teams must go
elsewhere for their games, losing the home field advantage and the
packed stadiums that go with it.</LD>
<LD>   Take a game in which the northern Israeli city of Haifa played
Belarus in Cyprus last month. A paltry 50 fans showed up for the
game, which was played in a 22,000-seat stadium. But 500 Cypriot
police were stationed in and around the stadium to guard the Israeli
players.</LD>
<TE>   "We play, but we don't play in Israel, and it's a huge
disadvantage," said Ronan Dorfan, a senior sports writer for the
newspaper Haaretz.</TE>
<TE>   It is not only sports that is affected by the ongoing violence.
Entertainers have stopped coming to Israel, which until two years ago
was a lucrative gig for musical groups and singers touring Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, the big-name musical acts Rage Against the
Machine, Radiohead, Alanis Morissette, Lou Reed and REM all staged
concerts here in a single month. Last August, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers were supposed to play here, but after three suicide bombings
in as many days, the group canceled, even though 20,000 tickets had
been sold.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is coming," said Yadidya Fraiman, an Israeli musician. "
'Isolation' is certainly a word that fits."</TE>
<TE>   Concert promoter Shuki Weiss, who has brought the likes of Bob
Dylan to Israel, said the hope was that the violence would stop and
the shows would go on.</TE>
<TE>   "But it didn't get better," he said. "We have to start from
scratch again. We have to begin at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   The problem now is twofold. One is that suicide bombers have
transformed Israel into a place where safety is a constant concern.
The bombers have targeted restaurants, nightclubs, hotels and buses,
not only in Jerusalem but in all parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The second issue is that Israel has come under harsh criticism,
especially in Europe, for its treatment of Palestinians. That has led
to entertainment being used as a forum for criticism, both here and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   One performer affected was Achinoam Nini, one of Israel's most
popular singers, who was stunned when two protesters climbed onstage
during a London concert in June and chided her about the Israeli
treatment of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big trauma for Noa at the time," said her manager, Asher
Bitanski. "We were afraid it might repeat itself, but it didn't in
any of the venues we played."</TE>
<TE>   Bitanski said the hecklers apologized the next day after learning
the singer was a leader in the Israeli peace movement. She had
performed at the 1995 peace rally in Tel Aviv where Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli performers are also being shunned because of safety
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the famed Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was forced to
cancel an eight-week tour in the United States because no one would
insure it. Zeev Dorman, the chairman of the orchestra, said fears of
some kind of terrorist attack were a major part of the problem, so
the orchestra will appear in Australia and Taiwan instead.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorman also said he thinks the insurance question is something
that can be worked out over time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was show business," he said. "They couldn't work it
out. I don't think it's a hint of the future."</TE>
<TE>   Within Israel, the effect on sports and entertainment has
manifested itself in a number of ways. Last month, eight singers
canceled their appearances in the opera "Salome," played by the
Israel Philharmonic, citing safety concerns. This year's normally
popular Jerusalem Film Festival attracted a relative handful of
foreign actors, directors and other members of the film industry. The
Tel Aviv film festival was canceled because so many in the industry
were begging off.</TE>
<TE>   In June, three foreign performance ensembles pulled out of the
Israel Festival, one of the country's largest cultural events. Two
cited security reasons. The third, the Belgian-based Groupov Theater
Ensemble, said the treatment of Palestinians had prompted the
cancellation. Earlier this year, a professional basketball team from
Turkey refused to play a game in Tel Aviv because of security
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Dorman, the orchestra chairman, said he can understand how
performers might want to cancel, particularly because Israel looks so
dangerous from afar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very serious to cancel, but again I cannot blame them," he
said. "When you see it on television, it's frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Fraiman, the musician, said the flight of entertainers has created
an atmosphere in which almost any celebrity visit causes a slight
upswing in mood here.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear of some second-tier movie star coming here, and people
feel encouraged," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Matan Vilnai, the Israeli minister of culture, science and sports,
believes performers and athletic teams need to return to Israel. He
cited the fact that there has never been a terrorist incident at a
concert or sporting event in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Professional sports leagues should raise the flag of freedom and
give the chance for sports to bring people together," he said.
"Entertainers also should be loyal to their fans, and I think Israeli
audiences very much appreciate performers who come to Israel in these
times."</TE>

<LD>Iraqi opposition groups meeting with Bush administration officials:</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi National Congress: A London-based umbrella group of
opposition figures created in 1992 and headed by longtime exile Ahmad
Chalabi. The INC worked in northern Iraq until its 1996 ouster by
President Saddam Hussein's army, which prompted accusations that
America failed to protect the group.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi National Accord: This London-based group of Iraqi exiles was
involved in an unsuccessful 1996 coup attempt against Hussein. The
group, which includes former military men, has had links with some
U.S. intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Democratic Party of Kurdistan:
Estimated to have as many as 80,000 armed men organized into
militias, the groups are leery of a U.S. attack against Hussein
unless they are guaranteed continued autonomy in areas of northern
Iraq now under their control. The factions are bitterly divided: The
PUK is led by Jalal Talabani and the KDP by Massoud Barzani.</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq: This Shiite
group, which says it has 10,000 armed men inside Iraq, opposes any
U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Hussein, instead supporting an
Iraqi-led effort or one by other countries. Shiites are bitter that
the U.S. did not help in their revolt against Hussein at the end of
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Constitutional Monarchy Movement: This movement's goal is to
return to the monarchy that existed before a July 1958 coup. It is
led by Sharif Ali bin Hussein.</TE>

<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Massive landslides and flooding have killed 70 people in
south-central China's Hunan province and caused hundreds of millions
of dollars in damage, the official New China News Agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The landslides and flooding caused by heavy rainfall affected the
cities of Chenzhou, Hengyang, Yongzhou and Zhuzhou, which have a
combined population of 3.5 million, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Property losses were estimated to be more than $240 million.
Officials in the region could not be reached immediately for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Provincial and municipal governments have formed emergency rescue
and relief teams and sent officials to the affected areas.</TE>
<TE>   The toll could rise because mining is a key industry in part of
the hard-hit area and many people were working underground at the
time of the deluge, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal floods have killed almost 900 people nationwide since
May.</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, meanwhile, authorities said Friday that torrential
rains this week left nine people dead and six missing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims were swept away by flash floods or landslides,
said the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some southern provinces in the country also faced the prospect of
further deluges, government meteorologists said.</TE>

<LD>Heavy rain and wind swept southern Russia's Black Sea coast Friday,
threatening more of the flooding that has killed at least 34 people
in the region. This village was hit with a 6 1/2-foot wall of water.</LD>
<LD>   At least five people died in other parts of Europe this week in
floods caused by pounding storms, some dropping record rainfall.</LD>
<LD>   The wall of water roared through Nizhnaya Bakanskaya on Thursday.</LD>

with her dog--the only thing she did not lose--in a shack that
survived the flood. "I've lost everything I've saved during my life."</TE>

<HD>Japan Stunned by Sudden Fall of Popular Politician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The surprise resignation from parliament Friday of feisty former
Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka, one of Japan's few prominent women
legislators, dismayed many here and had tongues wagging about the
ironic fate of the popular politician.</LD>
<LD>   The colorful, blunt-talking Tanaka stepped down midmorning from
her seat in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, under a
cloud of allegations that she had misused state funds meant to pay an
aide's salary, charges she has repeatedly denied.</LD>
<LD>   It was an ignominious end to the nine-year parliamentary career of
Tanaka, 58, whose directness makes her stand out here like a red
dress in a sea of black suits. Though Japanese tend to shun
confrontation, her sharp tongue won her points with a public largely
disgusted with the nation's politics.</LD>
<TE>   She had made her agenda reforming the scandal-ridden bureaucracy
and machine-style politics of the ruling party, to which she
belonged, even though her father had been the king of pork-barrel
politics.</TE>
<TE>   That her father, the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, also had
resigned amid a scandal--bribery allegations led him to quit in 1974
but he nevertheless remained a shadow shogun--added to the atmosphere
surrounding her abrupt departure.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers published extra editions. News reports broadcast
continuously throughout the day. And Japanese constituents shook
their heads in chagrin. Some were disgusted that Makiko Tanaka had
gotten mired in scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected her to do a lot, but she totally betrayed me," groused
Eiko Shinozawa, 45, a female accountant in Tokyo. "It was all a
facade, and she was just as lowdown as the rest of the lot."</TE>
<TE>   More people seemed to feel betrayed that Tanaka had opted to
resign rather than continue to fight for reforms and that she would
no longer be around to call it as she sees it.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it's so disappointing," said Sakae Hirose, 60, a Tokyo
salaryman. "Of course, her scandal is a problem and it's bad. But
she's got vitality. She is strong and able. It's a pity she was
sullied by dirty Japanese politics that got her involved with this."</TE>
<TE>   Some suggested that the allegations were small potatoes in the
spectrum of Japanese political scandals and that she might have been
set up by bureaucrats or members of her Liberal Democratic Party,
with whom she often took issue.</TE>
<TE>   In a characteristic remark, she once publicly branded three top
leaders of the LDP as "bonjin, gunjin and henjin"--bland man,
military man and strange man. The man she called strange is current
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He nevertheless named her foreign
minister last year because of her popular appeal, only to sack Tanaka
after her continual high-profile clashes with bureaucrats and several
most undiplomatic gaffes.</TE>
<TE>   But others said she resigned to spare herself a fuller
investigation and to pave the way for her 31-year-old son to run for
her seat in October. On a television talk show, investigative
journalist Yoshiu Arita accused her office of failing to account for
more than $800,000 of taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka's tiny office at parliament was closed Friday, a box of
newspapers and mail waiting outside. Phones went unanswered. In the
early evening, she showed up at her Tokyo residence, which was
thronged with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka explained that she had been contemplating the resignation
since last month, when the LDP stripped her of voting power and
rights within the party for two years in the wake of the alleged
violations. "There was no point to continuing, since I couldn't do
any substantial work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like my wings were torn off, and realistically, I can no
longer work as a lawmaker," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There was some speculation among the public that she might run as
an independent, but it seems unlikely, given her rationale for
quitting. The LDP is overwhelmingly the dominant political party.
"She was just alone, belonging to nothing," said political analyst
Hiroshi Takaku.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against her are rather murky: that state money
allocated for her secretaries disappeared and that she used staff
members paid by her family-run bus company to assist her.</TE>
<TE>   She denied the charges. In a parliamentary hearing on the matter
last month she seemed uncharacteristically timid, constantly turning
for help to her lawyer and accountant when grilled by fellow
legislators.</TE>
<TE>   She apologized Friday for the lingering doubts. As a result of the
ethics committee hearing, she said, "it's regrettable that citizens
still have the impression that I didn't clear up the allegations
against me."</TE>
<TE>   It would be a stretch to say that Tanaka's resignation deepened
pessimism about the political paralysis here: It would be hard for it
to get any worse. The public is weary of the lack of change and
seemingly endless scandals that have driven several other prominent
politicians from office in recent months. Koizumi, installed as prime
minister last year amid soaring popularity and hopes for change,
hasn't been able to accomplish much reform. His ratings plummeted
after he fired Tanaka.</TE>
<TE>   Her ratings too had been falling, though not as drastically, in
recent months in the wake of the scandal and newsmagazine accounts of
her alleged disorganization and verbal abuse of her aides. Recent
polls nonetheless labeled her as one of the public's top choices for
prime minister--a rather moot point now, since parliament fills the
post from among its members.</TE>
<TE>   "No one could have imagined this six months ago," Koizumi said
Friday.</TE>

<LD>Mourners in ragged clothing wept and placed flowers Friday over the
caskets of 14 Colombians who were killed when a rebel mortar shell
struck Bogota's skid row just before this week's presidential
inauguration.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people milled around the caskets, which were placed on

<HD>U.S., Iraqis Envision Life After Hussein</HD>
<DH>Politics: Opposition leaders meet with officials in
Washington in a display of unity. The administration pledges to
protect dissidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In talks with the six leading Iraqi opposition groups, the Bush
administration Friday stepped up its efforts to outline a new
political future for Iraq after a hoped-for ouster of President
Saddam Hussein and pledged to "enhance" its work with the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   The two-hour meeting was also designed to signal new unity--at
least in public--both among the disparate array of opposition forces
and within the Bush administration, U.S. officials said. The talks at
the State Department were attended by a cross-section of top
administration officials often seen as at odds with each other over
Iraq strategy.</LD>
<LD>   "We focused on the importance of coordination. We have
coordination within the U.S. government," a senior administration
official told reporters after the talks.</LD>
<TE>   The official said the time had come for the Iraqi opposition to
"engage more deeply and more prominently on a whole range of issues,
both with each other, with the international community and Iraq's
neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the United States pledged to "protect" the Iraqi
opposition from oppression by Baghdad, although the senior official
refused to spell out the American commitment.</TE>
<TE>   He did say that if Hussein moved against ethnic Kurds in northern
Iraq, as the Iraqi leader has done in the past, the United States
would respond. The official did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials clearly hope that this is a turning point in the
other half of the Iraq campaign--forging a representative group of
Iraqis to plan for the aftermath of any military operation and to
step in and help once Hussein is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Decades of squabbling among Iraq's rival ethnic and religious
groups have prevented the creation of an effective opposition, a
major factor in helping Hussein maintain control over a deeply
divided population.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a point generally--and this was affirmed during the
discussions--where a lot of momentum has built across the board,
where things that were between difficult and impossible before at a
variety of levels are now achievable and necessary," the senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The six opposition groups and the Bush administration now plan to
intensify efforts to create a political alternative and widen the
opposition base.</TE>
<TE>   Washington will back a major conference of Iraqi dissidents,
probably in Europe, within the next few weeks to develop practical
plans for a political takeover, according to U.S. and Iraqi
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The conference could be similar to the U.S.-sponsored talks among
Afghan opposition forces near Bonn last year to forge a united vision
for a new government after the Taliban regime was toppled by a
U.S.-led military alliance.</TE>
<TE>   In separate briefings, the Iraqi opposition and U.S. officials
said they had agreed on the principles for a new government in
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Our vision is for a democratic Iraq with a government that
respects the rights of its citizens and the rule of law, no longer
threatens its neighbors, renounces the development and possession of
weapons of mass destruction, and maintains the territorial integrity
of the country," State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is clearly hoping that a unified opposition can
play a critical role in persuading reluctant allies to join the
campaign against Hussein by making clear that Iraqis themselves, not
just President Bush, are seeking to oust the Iraqi leader.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition leaders, based in Britain, Iran and the
Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq, said the United States
showed a new resolve during the session, at which Undersecretary of
State Marc Grossman and Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith
played host.</TE>
<TE>   "We sense more seriousness and commitment" from the U.S.
government to overthrow Hussein's regime, said Hamid Bayati, a senior
official of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
which is based in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell dropped in on the meeting and
said, "Our shared goal is that the Iraqi people should be free,"
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney is to have a videoconference with those
at the meeting today from his vacation home in Wyoming. Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice also are expected to meet them as talks continue
into next week, Iraqi sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld bristled Friday at the suggestion that political turmoil
in Afghanistan augurs ill for a post-Hussein Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing if Iraq were similar to
Afghanistan, if a bad regime was thrown out, people were liberated,
food could come in, borders could be opened, repression could stop,
prisons could be opened?" Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Friday that he did not yet have a timeline for a U.S.
campaign to oust the Iraqi leader, adding that he might not even make
a decision by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The timing might be linked in part to the administration's ability
to keep the opposition together--and on the same page about what
comes next.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi participants were Sharif Ali bin Hussein of the
Constitutional Monarchy Movement, Iyad Alawi of the Iraqi National
Accord, Abdelaziz Hakim of the Supreme Council of the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, Hoshyar Zebari of the Democratic Party of
Kurdistan, Ahmad Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress and Jalal
Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition summit came a day after House Majority Leader Dick
Armey (R-Texas) cautioned against rash action against Iraq, signaling
the first rift within party ranks over Bush's top foreign policy
priority.</TE>

<HD>A Recipe for Disaster for Martha Stewart's Empire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legal and business pressures on Martha Stewart are mounting, as
federal investigators step up probes into allegations of insider
stock trading, prosecutors press her friends to testify against her
and investors continue to batter her company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors this week added one of Stewart's friends to those
cooperating in their inquiry into Stewart's trades last year of
ImClone Systems Inc. stock. This comes on top of reports that an
assistant to Stewart's stockbroker is negotiating a plea agreement in
exchange for testimony against her.</LD>
<LD>   As investigators for the Justice Department, Congress and the
Securities and Exchange Commission focus on Stewart's inner circle,
her multimedia empire is suffering and its very public chief
executive is trying to maintain a low profile.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart's strategy--crafted by an array of corporate lawyers from
both Washington and New York--has been to lie low and avoid
self-incrimination. Stewart has cut back on regular TV and radio
appearances and, other than carefully worded statements, has avoided
commenting on the matter when questioned in public.</TE>
<TE>   Although keeping out of the limelight is a time-honored and often
successful legal practice of the rich and powerful, white-collar
crime experts say, that tactic is uniquely difficult for Stewart,
whose company's fortunes depend on her public relationship with
American consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Stock in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.--which publishes
magazines, produces television and radio shows and sells merchandise
through Kmart stores and its Web site--has lost two-thirds of its
value since the scandal broke. And the longer the inquiry drags on,
the more the company risks losing revenue as advertisers and
customers grow wary of association with Stewart and her legal morass.</TE>
<TE>   For once, Stewart seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time, implicated in an insider trading scandal as prosecutors and the
American public are hunting for corporate wrongdoers, whom they see
as modern-day robber barons.</TE>
<TE>   "She is feeling the pressure," said Ira Lee Sorkin, a white-collar
criminal defense lawyer, former federal prosecutor and onetime
director of the SEC's New York office. "This all has got to have an
impact, even if you didn't do anything wrong. It's got to hurt you.
It's got to have an emotional impact."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who has denied wrongdoing, has not been charged with any
crime. She and her spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the investigation say two key witnesses are
cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation of Stewart's
activities before and after she sold her 4,000 ImClone shares Dec.
27, the day before the Food and Drug Administration announced it
would reject the company's application for a cancer drug. The
company's stock plunged on the news.</TE>
<TE>   Among those being interviewed, a source close to the inquiry said,
is Stewart's friend Mariana Pasternak. She was flying with Stewart to
a resort in Mexico when Stewart says she made several calls about
ImClone's performance and eventually sold her shares.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also are working on a plea agreement with Douglas
Faneuil, an assistant to Stewart's Merrill Lynch broker who first
confirmed Stewart's statements about her ImClone trade, then
recanted, the Wall Street Journal reported.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the number of people who can provide information,
clearly she has got a lot to worry about," said Christopher Bebel, a
securities lawyer with Houston firm Shepherd, Smith &amp; Bebel who
previously worked as a federal prosecutor and SEC enforcement lawyer.
"The pressure wears on them all. And that is going to work to the
government's advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The potential witnesses also could help prosecutors prove
inconsistencies in Stewart's statements, leading to possible
obstruction of justice charges, legal experts say. Insider trading
often is difficult to prove.</TE>
<TE>   This week, after Stewart declined to be interviewed by a
congressional committee investigating the ImClone matter, Rep. Bart
Stupak (D-Mich.) said on the "Today" show that Stewart should be
subpoenaed to answer questions about ImClone if she is not more
forthcoming by Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been trying for a month to interview her personally, but
her lawyers have refused to let that happen," said Ken Johnson,
spokesman for Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), head of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating the ImClone
matter. "Her attorneys have given us statements that have been in
conflict with other statements that have been made and, in some
cases, her own story has been tweaked several times."</TE>
<TE>   One of Stewart's lawyers, in a letter to the committee, responded
that she has not refused to be interviewed but rather asked that such
an appearance be delayed until her legal team is "better informed"
about the government's allegations against her.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to put a nice spin on it, saying it's premature,
but what they're actually saying is that she's not going to testify,"
said John Coggins, a law professor at Columbia University and an
expert in securities law and white-collar crime. "The unanimous view
of defense counsel is that when you're in the kind of position she's
in, you cannot testify. You are just inviting perjury and obstruction
of justice charges."</TE>
<TE>   It's a strategy demonstrated most recently by former Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and others, who earlier this year invoked his
5th Amendment right against self-incrimination before a congressional
committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Stewart built her company by showing mainstream America the
ways of gracious domestic living. Her corporation's fortunes depend
on her public acceptance. So far, among those speaking out in support
have been fans via an e-mail campaign.</TE>
<TE>   That makes declining to answer questions particularly tricky.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure Congress brings is knowing that people do not like
looking like Mafia dons, which is what [taking] the 5th Amendment
looks like to most American citizens," Coggins said. "That's got to
be true for Stewart."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with ImClone began in late December, when prosecutors
allege that Samuel D. Waksal, then the company's chief executive and
a friend of Stewart, learned of the FDA's pending announcement
rejecting ImClone's cancer-fighting drug Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal then allegedly warned family members, including his father
and daughter, to dump stock before he unsuccessfully tried to sell
ImClone shares himself on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said she sold her stock as a result of a standing
agreement with broker Peter Bacanovic, also the broker for Waksal's
daughter, to sell if shares fell below $60, as they did that day.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking into whether such a "stop-loss" order
existed. Bacanovic's assistant, Faneuil, originally said there was
such an order but has since changed his account.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with congressional investigators, Stewart's
attorneys first said she arranged the stop-loss order in late
October, a House Energy and Commerce Committee spokesman said. But
after the committee pointed out that the stock had fallen below the
$60 mark twice in November, her lawyers said they had erred and meant
to say she made the stop-loss order at the end of November.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James Greenwood (R-Pa.), who heads the House panel's
oversight and investigations subcommittee, said Friday that e-mails
between Bacanovic and Faneuil suggest that they knew about pending
bad news affecting ImClone on Dec. 27 and may have tried to inform
Stewart that day.</TE>
<TE>   As often happens in white-collar cases, Stewart's biggest problems
come not from her ImClone sale--which most experts say would be tough
to link with insider trading--but in what she may have done afterward
to cover it up.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of insider trading case that normally would not
be criminally prosecuted and might not even be civilly prosecuted,
but there is a harsher, more unforgiving environment today," said
Columbia University's Coggins, noting that the $43,000 in losses that
Stewart averted on her ImClone sale is probably less than she already
has spent on her legal team.</TE>
<TE>   "But prosecutors have always had this attitude that they will be
unforgiving and punitive if you lie to them once an investigation
begins, and that's to protect their own processes."</TE>

<HD>The New Import: Teachers</HD>
<DH>First it was nurses. Now recruiters are tapping the
Philippines to help fill a void in American classrooms.</DH>

<LD>The new teacher struggles to keep the algebra lesson on track. An
eighth-grader is fiddling with a broken pencil sharpener. Another
sneaks out of the Compton classroom. "Please be good," the teacher
begs in accented English.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Banas, where are you from?" one student asks.</LD>
<LD>   The teacher smiles.</LD>
<TE>   Relson Banas points to a spot on a classroom map, and a collective
gasp goes up. "You mean you came all the way across the Pacific,"
asks another student, "to teach us?"</TE>
<TE>   Who would pay dearly to cross the ocean to teach middle-school
math in one of Southern California's lowest-performing school
districts? Who would leave behind a 2-year-old daughter to share a
house with four other adults in South-Central Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Banas did. And many of the Philippines' best teachers are about to
follow his lead.</TE>
<TE>   Banas, who arrived in the United States in January, is the first
ripple in a wave of experienced, English-speaking foreign teachers
about to land on American shores. With school districts needing to
hire 200,000 teachers a year to stem a national shortage, private
recruiters plan to place at least 15,000 foreign teachers in American
classrooms over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be long before people will be saying, 'Relson, you
brought along the whole island,' " Banas says.</TE>
<TE>   The recruiting agencies are also eyeing India and China. But the
Philippines--with an English-speaking school system founded by
colonizing Americans--is emerging as the chief source of recruits.
The recruiting companies, once devoted to bringing nurses to the
U.S., are now switching to teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Central to their success is putting the financial burden on the
job seekers, not the schools. Foreign teachers pay the job agencies
about $7,500, which covers the costs of passage and recruitment--and
provides recruiters with a profit of up to $1,000 a head. With the
teachers themselves picking up the tab, their recruitment is a free
lunch for U.S. school districts.</TE>
<TE>   These pipelines are so new that they have gone unnoticed by many
U.S. educators. Nevertheless, recruiters have found customers in the
Boston and Houston school districts. Chicago, Philadelphia and New
York City have made inquiries. But the strongest market so far has
been mid-size school districts in Southern California, which are
struggling to meet a federal mandate for "highly qualified" licensed
teachers. Philippine recruits, some of whom have advanced degrees,
begin the credentialing process even before they leave the islands.</TE>
<TE>   In the last academic year, San Bernardino hired 41 Philippine
teachers, Inglewood 50 and Compton 58, including Banas.</TE>
<TE>   The story behind this new bandwagon begins with a couple in the
San Fernando Valley and 150 pioneers determined to reciprocate a
little-known act of American generosity from a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Randy Henry, an engineer at Xerox, and his wife,
Susan, a native of the Philippines, read a newspaper report on the
teacher shortage in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Henry, daughter of a teacher, had grown up hearing stories
of the Thomasites, 540 American teachers who arrived in the
Philippines in 1901 aboard the U.S. Army transport ship Thomas and
built an English-speaking educational system in what was then an
American colony.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, her company, Universal Agency, had been bringing
Philippine nurses to staff American hospitals and nursing homes. She
wondered if she could do the same with teachers, so well-prepared in
the Thomasite tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign teachers are not new to American classrooms. Exchange
programs are common, but those teachers must go home within three
years. Some large U.S. school districts have tried recruiting
foreigners but found the process too costly. The Henrys, working out
of their home in Northridge, decided that a private firm could bring
teachers both permanently and at no cost to the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Henry quit Xerox and put his retirement money into Universal
Agency. To find teachers, the couple traveled to Susan Henry's
hometown of Cebu, the Philippines' second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   The response was overwhelming. At a seminar for Cebu teachers, the
Henrys had planned for 200 to show up; 1,500 did. The lure was clear:
Many U.S. teachers get starting pay of $30,000 or more, while their
most experienced counterparts in the Philippines are lucky to earn
$5,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Henrys culled the applicants by demanding five years'
experience and requiring a passing grade on an exam based on the
California Basic Education Skills Tests, which California teachers
must pass to earn their full credential. Worried that applicants
might have too rosy a view of U.S. education, Randy Henry screened
"The Substitute 2," a movie about a violent high school in the urban
core.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with teachers' resumes, the Henrys began receiving a few
bites from school districts. San Bernardino called first. Susan Henry
explained that Universal--drawing on prospective teachers'
fees--could provide air fare to the Philippines for district
recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino had planned to hire 20 teachers. It ended up with
twice that many, including the former dean of education at a Cebu
university. A month later, the school district in Boston hired nine
teachers from Cebu. In the spring, Inglewood hired 50.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an absolute gold mine," says Douglas Agatep, the Inglewood
schools' chief human resource officer. Officially, the Philippine
government is "flattered" by the recruiting, but it worries about the
possible effect on education there.</TE>
<TE>   "It is definitely a brain drain," says Erlinda Alburo, head of the
Cebu Studies Center at the University of San Carlos, where some of
the recruited teachers taught. "They take the best teachers we have."</TE>
<TE>   Compton, a struggling district that only recently emerged from an
eight-year state takeover, was desperate for qualified
teachers--particularly in math and science. In the spring of 2001,
Compton officials, working with the Henrys, took a recruiting trip to
the Philippines. At one interview site, a line of 300 applicants
stretched around the block.</TE>
<TE>   By May 2001, the district had made offers to 58 teachers. They all
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Relson Banas was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old had grown up in a rural community outside Iloilo,
the son of a successful rice farmer. He moved to the city to attend
college, earning a master's degree in education, and taught math at a
Catholic school.</TE>
<TE>   Single and living with his mother, Banas had adopted a relative's
baby daughter. He did not have the $7,500 fee required by the
recruiting program.</TE>
<TE>   He took the offer anyway, scrounging half the fee from friends and
relatives. He would pay them back, and the other half to the Henrys,
once he was on the payroll in Compton.  "This was the chance to
practice my vocation in the land of milk and honey," Banas says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first teachers arrived in Los Angeles just before Christmas
2001, four months late--and very anxious. An INS agent at the
airport, glancing at visas that showed "Compton Unified School
District," asked: "Did you bring a bulletproof vest?"</TE>
<TE>   All Banas knew of his new city was that Venus and Serena Williams
grew up there. "I thought Compton was a place where everyone played
tennis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just getting to the United States had been an ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Banas and the other teachers, who had been scheduled to leave in
August of last year, were delayed when the Immigration and
Naturalization Service demanded that they obtain preliminary
California teaching credentials before getting visas.</TE>
<TE>   The state had no experience granting preliminary credentials to
teachers while they were still overseas. California fingerprints all
prospective teachers electronically, but there were no facilities to
do so in the Philippines. Then the teachers' ink-on-paper
fingerprints were caught in a post-Sept. 11 backlog, as the number of
visa background checks soared.</TE>
<TE>   In the Philippines, the recruits--most of whom had already quit
their jobs--grew desperate. Banas took a part-time job teaching
ballroom dancing to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the schools that had hired them were
desperate too. They were forced to rely on substitutes until Jan. 7,
when the first teachers arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The Henrys personally greeted all of them at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "At last!" cried Banas, as he spotted the Henrys.</TE>
<TE>   "What took you so long?" Randy Henry joked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At 7 o'clock each weeknight, Banas takes a seat on a living room
couch, alongside the four other teachers with whom he shares the
$1,500-a-month rented home. Together they watch the game show
"Jeopardy." It is a half-hour break from lesson plans and a chance to
test their assimilation.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't know the identity of California's governor until "Gray
Davis" came up as an answer on the show. But they ace the questions
related to literature, science and movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeopardy" is a rare ritual of familiarity in an extraordinarily
difficult adjustment. The teachers say the Henrys have done their
best to help them, organizing outings on holidays and advising them
on American standards of promptness. Philippine churches in Carson
have assisted some of the teachers, lining up van services to take
them just about anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm honored to be of service," says their driver, Francisco
Arzadon, also known as "Brother Ike." He is paid $100 a month by each
of six teachers to provide 24-hour transportation service.</TE>
<TE>   But the teachers see Los Angeles as too large, too sprawling, and
especially--for people from the tropics--too cold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just freezing here," says Banas.</TE>
<TE>   For recreation, he walks to Magic Johnson Park or wanders the
aisles of a local thrift store. On weekends, the teachers often head
to a shopping mall, where the crowds remind them of the streets back
home.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the teachers have become close, because few members of
their families have accompanied them--at least during this first
year. The separation is hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy, come home," Banas' 2-year-old daughter, Aliah, pleads over
the telephone one recent night. For a few minutes, the normally
effusive Banas can't say anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I am grateful for my roommates and my fellow teachers," he
finally says. "It's a slice of home for us. It's a refuge."</TE>
<TE>   The American classroom--for all its wonders--is not.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Get to work, get to work," Banas begs his afternoon class at
Whaley Middle School. In the Philippines, his easy manner and corny
math jokes were enough to handle students, some so well-behaved that
he wondered if they understood the material. Here, merely holding the
students' attention is the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, his offer of M&amp;Ms to those who stay quiet doesn't
work. So he has students dance on the floor's linoleum tiles,
channeling their energy into a lesson on graphing. He gently chides
those who don't behave or find comedy in his accent.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Banas," says one miscreant, with a feigned Philippine lisp,
"we want to play."</TE>
<TE>   Banas presses on. Like the other Philippine teachers, he is in awe
of the number and quality of textbooks and materials available to
them. Teachers in the primary grades, whose classes back home
sometimes swelled to 60, cannot get over the small class sizes
mandated by California.</TE>
<TE>   But controlling American children is daunting. The teachers have
little experience dealing with rowdy behavior. In the Philippines,
they say, there is more respect; students stand when they enter the
room. On a van ride home, one Compton teacher asked Brother Ike: "Are
all American children this rude?"</TE>
<TE>   Southern California principals are mostly impressed, saying their
new instructors are better steeped in their subject matter than many
of their American counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "They are among our best teachers," says Principal Kelcey
Richardson of Compton's Dominguez High School, which has six of the
new arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   But principals also say the Philippine teachers are too quick to
refer poorly disciplined students to administrators instead of
handling disruptions themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers have been well-received in Inglewood and San
Bernardino. But in Compton, union members, school board trustees and
parents have questioned whether the Pacific Islanders are a good
match culturally for poor African American and Latino youngsters.
"They seem to have some problems connecting with our kids," says
school board member Marjorie Shipp.</TE>
<TE>   Some students have found otherwise. When Yz Barrientos, one of
Banas' housemates, asked her students to make a list of courageous
people, one put the teacher herself on the list--just below Martin
Luther King Jr.--for "coming over and teaching me."</TE>
<TE>   Justyn Brisbon, who served as eighth-grade vice president this
spring at Whaley, says Banas was his best instructor. "He won't move
on ... until the entire class gets what he's saying," says Brisbon.
"He's good, and he knows what he's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Banas is now teaching math in summer school in preparation for his
first full year in an American classroom. Once he passes the third
and final section of the California teachers exam, he will be
eligible to teach in Compton for at least four more years.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, he says, he will apply for permanent residency
in hopes of extending his teaching career here.</TE>
<TE>   Banas is also greeting other Philippine teachers who are getting
visas and coming over. The last of Compton's and San Bernardino's
teachers arrived this summer. Inglewood is only now receiving the
final 29 of its 50 teachers. These districts say they may return to
the Philippines to hire even more.</TE>
<TE>   When they do, the Henrys will be ready for them. The couple hope
that their new Cebu office, which will offer U.S.-bound teachers
classes in speech, classroom management and Spanish, will give them a
leg up on a growing number of competitors, one of which just guided
60 teachers to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Banas recently bought a Kia Sportage, making him one of the first
of the recruits to purchase his own car. He teaches a ballroom dance
class Saturdays. In search of a bigger place closer to school, Banas
and three other teachers have found a new home in Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine teachers gather on Friday once a month to compare
notes. Some have signed up for Spanish classes. Banas is talking
about pursuing a doctorate in education.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, though, he is determined to find someone to teach him
to play tennis. "I figure now that I'm in Compton," he says with a
grin, "I should play the local game."</TE>

<HD>Thousands Turn Out to Pay Tribute to Voice of the Lakers</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Chick Hearn is eulogized at Brentwood church,
honored by fans at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL, ANTHONY McCARTNEY and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It figured that Chick Hearn would call the play-by-play at his own
funeral.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the flesh, of course--not even Hearn was capable of that.
But time and again, as the longtime Laker announcer was eulogized
Friday, mourners reached into his deep bag of "Chickisms" to describe
a man whose wordplay, descriptive powers and passion gave his
basketball team--and, in a sense, his city--a colorful soundtrack for
42 years.</LD>
<LD>   Not even Cardinal Roger M. Mahony could resist.</LD>
<TE>   Looking ahead to a fourth consecutive Laker championship, Mahony
told mourners: "I am going to go outside and look up in the sky,
because I think for the last time we will see the meteor go by, and
we will wave so long.</TE>
<TE>   "This one's in the refrigerator."</TE>
<TE>   It was a line that might have brought shocked gasps at any other
funeral, but those who were there--a who's who of basketball greats
and local political leaders--understood that Mahony was simply
quoting one of Hearn's most beloved aphorisms, used to signal that
the Lakers had put a game out of reach and were on their way to
victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was a phrase that also came up repeatedly at Staples Center,
where thousands of Laker faithful filed all day through a darkened
arena to pay their respects at the empty broadcast booth where Hearn
finished his career. Francis Dayle "Chick" Hearn died Monday of brain
injuries suffered in a fall at his home in Encino. He was 85.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the fridge, but the light will always be on," a fan wrote
in one of more than a dozen thick memorial books spread out on
black-draped tables in a concession area at the downtown arena. Next
to the books were keepsakes for the mourners: photographs of Hearn
that included a handy list of Chickisms on the back--"slaaaaaam
dunk," "frozen rope," "faked the floperoo," "give and go," "no harm,
no foul," "triple-double," "air ball," and so on through a lexicon
that was part English, part basketball and all Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn began broadcasting Laker games in 1960, when the team moved
from Minneapolis to Los Angeles and became, along with Dodger
announcer Vin Scully, one of the most omnipresent public figures in
Southern California over the following four decades.</TE>
<TE>   His role as a unifying force was apparent at Staples Center, where
people of all ages, races and cultures turned out to honor Hearn. And
it was a prominent theme of his funeral, which drew several
generations of Laker stars to the St. Martin of Tours Roman Catholic
Church in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Elgin Baylor and Jerry West were there, as were Keith Erickson and
Pat Riley, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, Rick Fox and Kobe
Bryant. Many had to duck as they walked through the church's front
doors. Some former players, their hair gray or long gone, shuffled
down the aisles on rickety knees and ankles, a giveaway of Hearn's
longevity.</TE>
<TE>   Other mourners included Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, Gov. Gray
Davis, Scully, retired UCLA coach John Wooden and Laker fan
extraordinaire Jack Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony Sets the Tone</TE>
<TE>   Mahony conducted the 90-minute service, which leaned heavily on
eulogies by current and former Lakers players. But it was Mahony's
homily that set the tone.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said Hearn's biggest accomplishment was to bring "a
spirit of unity and harmony" to Los Angeles on a scale that few
people, if any, have been able to do.</TE>
<TE>   "He dropped down barriers in this community," said Mahony, who
recalled watching diverse crowds squeeze together on the escalators
of Staples Center, all unknowingly united by the voice of Chick
Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to bring together people from all kinds of
backgrounds, races, languages, ethnic groups," he said. Hearn, he
added, "helped our city more than anyone can dream or imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hearn's unifying spirit, his work ethic, kindness and
gruff impatience were common themes that ran throughout eulogies by
Johnson, Fox, West and granddaughter Shannon Newman. His closed
casket rested at the front of the sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "He always made me feel like I was worthy of wearing a Laker
uniform," said a tearful Fox, who wore his white Laker warmups to the
funeral. He thanked Hearn's wife, Marge, sitting in the front row,
for "keeping Chick going for 42 years."</TE>
<TE>   "It is our turn to be there for you," Fox said. Hearn would
frequently mention his wife of 64 years during broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   West's Recollections</TE>
<TE>   West, who began with the Lakers the same year as Hearn, recalled
how the announcer got cabin fever every year waiting for the season
to start and was quick to anger when the team's airplanes were
delayed on the tarmac, often yelling, "Let's go!" from his seat.
Later, when West became the Lakers' general manager, he said Hearn
would call and demand that he begin making trades to help the ailing
team. "This is after we won 10 in a row."</TE>
<TE>   "Chick was, without a doubt, the most impatient person I've met in
my life," West said, "besides me."</TE>
<TE>   West said there will be many Hearn impersonators who will use
Chickisms while announcing. "And they will fail miserably because
they're not Chick Hearn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department officers and private security guards
surrounded the church. Only 400 people were invited to the funeral,
which was broadcast on Los Angeles television stations. Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal was in Florida and team owner Jerry Buss was out of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Although the pews held plenty of the famous, tall and powerful,
they also contained other, less-celebrated people whose lives were
touched by Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   John Werhas was the only speaker whom most of the crowd didn't
recognize. He played basketball at USC during the late 1950s, when
Hearn was a Trojan announcer, and they remained friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We loved Chick not because of his dedication" to basketball's
superstars, said Werhas, now senior pastor at Yorba Linda Friends
Church, but "because he loved us, the common man."</TE>
<TE>   19,000 at Staples Center</TE>
<TE>   At Staples, a line of mourners snaked out the front doors and
around the corner for much of the day. Some 19,000 people filed into
the arena, past larger-than-life photographs of Hearn at various
stages of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, hawkers did a brisk business in T-shirts memorializing
Hearn. Inside, a scoreboard flashed Chickisms and the huge video
screen played local TV coverage of Hearn's death.</TE>
<TE>   As he shuffled forward in line, Ken Gootnick, 39, recalled a
lifetime of listening to Hearn, who turned him into such a fan that
he twice attended celebrity basketball camps with the announcer and
recently opened a basketball complex in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   What set Hearn apart?</TE>
<TE>   "His passion for the game," Gootnick said. "You could feel it in
his words. He was the most descriptive broadcaster I've ever listened
to. I knew everything that was happening on the court when I listened
to him."</TE>
<TE>   Special Connection</TE>
<TE>   James Dale West, 76, cried as he passed Hearn's booth. West said
he saw the Lakers in person only once, at the Sports Arena shortly
after their arrival in Los Angeles. Otherwise, he said, he relied on
Hearn to paint the game for him in his Compton home.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the only way I got to know the Lakers," West said. "He
helped me to know the players."</TE>
<TE>   West, a teacher at Crenshaw High School for 50 years, said he felt
a special connection to Hearn, who broadcast 3,338 consecutive Laker
games from 1965 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Longevity is important in any field," West said. Hearn, he said,
showed up every night, "even though he had all kinds of excuses and
reasons not to."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, West had heart surgery, just as Hearn did last
year. After the surgery, he said, he made a list of people he
admired.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was No. 1--because of "the streak."</TE>
<TE>   Another fan at Staples, Sandra Martin, moved to Los Angeles in
1979 from Minneapolis. At the time, basketball was still a mystery to
her. Hearn changed that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I'd been watching basketball in a dark room and
somebody flipped on the lights," she said. "He taught all of us the
game."</TE>

<HD>'Enemy' Citizen Jailing Criticized</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Americans as 'combatants' are entitled to
counsel, lawyers panel says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Leaders of the American Bar Assn. criticized the Bush administration
Friday for jailing several American citizens as "enemy combatants"
without charging them with a crime or giving them a fair chance to
prove their innocence.</LD>
<LD>   Only Congress has the power to write the laws, they said, and no
law has given administration officials blanket authority to arrest
and detain U.S. citizens who are picked up on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   "There is genuine reason for concern about a president's--or
anyone's--power to unilaterally declare that an American citizen who
is arrested in the United States, far from any battlefield or combat
arena, is part of the enemy and thus may be treated as an enemy
seized in battle," they said.</LD>
<TE>   At minimum, the administration should explain its policy on
handling "enemy combatants" and seek the approval of Congress, the
bar leaders said.</TE>
<TE>   The task force report marked the first time the national lawyers'
group has directly confronted the administration over its legal
response to the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The report stopped short of opposing the Bush policy, however, and
its criticism was narrowly targeted. It did not fault the military's
holding of 600 Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
or the arrest of more than 1,200 immigrants in the United States for
questioning after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, the military has clear authority to hold enemy
soldiers, and noncitizens can be held for even minor violations of
immigration law.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking here only about U.S. citizens detained on U.S.
soil," said Robert Hirshon of Portland, Maine, the ABA's outgoing
president. "We are a nation of laws, and we think U.S. citizens must
be given access to counsel and to the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Two men now in custody have been labeled in court documents as
"enemy combatants," barred from consulting lawyers and told they can
be held indefinitely without trial.</TE>
<TE>   Yaser Esam Hamdi is a Saudi national who was picked up by U.S.
troops fighting in Afghanistan. He was sent to Guantanamo Bay, where
officials learned he was born in Louisiana and thus could claim U.S.
citizenship. In April, they transferred him to the naval brig in
Norfolk, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Padilla, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native, is being held at the brig
in Charleston, S.C. He was arrested May 8 at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport and accused of plotting to set off a "dirty"
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi and Padilla have filed writs of habeas corpus to contest
their detentions.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Bush's lawyers claimed extraordinarily broad powers to
arrest and detain people whom the president deems to be terrorists or
enemy combatants. This "exercise comes within the president's core
war powers," the lawyers said in a brief filed in Hamdi's case, and
"the court may not second-guess the military's enemy-combatant
determination." That went too far even for the conservative U.S. 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. On July 12, it sent Hamdi's
case back for another hearing before a trial judge in Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson said the judges were not ready to
embrace such "a sweeping proposition."</TE>
<TE>   Neal R. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who chaired the ABA's panel, said
the detentions of Hamdi and Padilla appear to violate a 1971 law that
declared: "No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by
the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress."</TE>
<TE>   "The validity of these detentions is suspect," Sonnett said. "This
is the first time in modern law that people have been detained
incommunicado and perhaps for the rest of their lives without being
allowed to talk to a lawyer and go into court."</TE>

<HD>In Colorado, a Town Braces for a Nightly Rain of Terror</HD>
<DH>Boulder: Thousands of starlings roost above a trailer park,
leaving grounds and buildings dung-covered. City says the birds are
protected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Each night at 7:45, the birds come back. Four thousand starlings
screech, caw and snap their way into a stand of cottonwoods, landing
high above Mapleton Mobile Home Park.</LD>
<LD>   As the birds settle in, there's another sound, reminiscent of the
patter of a summer rainstorm. Only it's not rain. It's the steady
"plop-plop" of thousands of birds pooping--splattering people, plants
and property from eight stories up.</LD>
<LD>   Walkways accumulate an inch and a half of droppings in a day. Car
paint corrodes under the near-constant fusillade from the birds.
Flowers and vegetable gardens are shredded. No one living under the
trees can remember the last summer in which they enjoyed their
patios, decks or yards.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, homeowners--many of them elderly--have slapped 2x4s
to roust the birds. They've shot fireworks into the trees. They've
honked horns. Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Boulder, which owns the 128-unit mobile home park, has
prohibited residents from disturbing the birds. It is also
considering a resolution declaring all of Boulder a bird sanctuary,
making it illegal to harm any bird within the city limits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is ridiculous," said Debbie Feustel, who recently moved to
the park. "The city talks about a bird sanctuary, but what about us
having a sanctuary in our own homes?"</TE>
<TE>   This flock of starlings has returned for the last 10 years to
these cottonwoods, nesting for four loud, smelly, disgusting months.
It's not the birds that upset the homeowners, it's the stench and the
unfathomable volume of the droppings. Folks say this is the messiest
summer yet.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Baker, a 78-year-old diabetic whose wheelchair ramp has been
rendered unusable because of the nightly bombardment, is at her wit's
end.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a prisoner in my own home," she said, wrinkling her nose at
the acrid smell wafting in through her open windows. The chicken-coop
stench clouds much of the mobile home park, a few narrow streets
nestled in a wooded copse just two blocks off Boulder's main drag.</TE>
<TE>   In a town that likes to call itself the People's Republic of
Boulder, where scarcely a plant or animal is without some protected
designation, the rights of the birds to live freely trump the rights
of Mapleton's residents to live poop-free.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what makes Boulder the loony, special place that it is:
socialism run amok," said Boulderite Jon Caldara, who is the
conservative voice on the Boulder Daily Camera's opinion page.
Describing the town's proud liberal leanings, Caldara says the place
is run by "do-gooders on caffeine."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the joy of living in Colorado, many say, is having Boulder
to mock. The Denver Post calls Boulder "the little town nestled
between the mountains and reality." Berkeley of the Rockies. The
phrase "Only in Boulder" is a frequent punch line to what is seen as
the Boulder joke.</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   Boulder has officially mandated that pet owners be referred to as
"pet guardians."</TE>
<TE>   The city of 100,000 has signed the Kyoto, Japan, accord to combat
global warning; the United States has not done so.</TE>
<TE>   Barrie Hartman, a Boulderite hired by the Denver Post to explain
the city to its southern neighbors, recalled a Boulder County
sheriff's deputy who responded to an accident in which a car slammed
into a tree. "For those of you in Boulder," the deputy wrote in his
report, "the tree was already dead."</TE>
<TE>   Only in Boulder.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Boulder is loath to harm a tree. That's part of the
difficulty in eradicating the starlings from the Mapleton Mobile Home
Park. According to John Pollak, Boulder's assistant director of
housing, the city has dispatched foresters and agricultural experts
to the neighborhood to determine the best way to handle the birds.</TE>
<TE>   "We are certainly not going to kill the birds," Pollak said. "No
one is interested in cutting down the trees. We are exploring options
for encouraging the birds to move."</TE>
<TE>   Edie DeWeese, Baker's exasperated daughter, has explored her own
options.</TE>
<TE>   "I've called exterminators all over the region," she said. "They
all say, 'Oh, you're in Boulder? We don't work there.' You can't kill
anything in Boulder, but my mom's living in a disgusting, unhealthy
mess."</TE>
<TE>   The European starlings were brought to this country from Britain
in the 18th century. They haven't bothered making friends since then.
Simply put, the birds are bullies.</TE>
<TE>   In the park here, the flock's arrival is preceded by the hurried
scramming of other local birds, who can't abide starlings. Some of
the neighborhood's 200 residents say the park's squirrels, deer,
foxes and other creatures have been run off by the bossy birds.</TE>
<TE>   Even the bird-loving Audubon Society identifies the Sturnus
vulgaris as "messy, quarrelsome, aggressive, and noisy."</TE>
<TE>   The rhythms of the Mapleton neighborhood are now dictated by the
comings and goings of the flock. A 5:45 wake-up call rains down from
the trees as the birds leave for a day of insect-eating elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The return of the birds every evening is an unsettling sight.
Sheltered under raincoats and hats, residents of the Mapleton Mobile
Home Park assemble in the only safe place--the middle of their
street. As far as possible from the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Peering into the darkening sky, the huddled folks raise their
arms, cringing and pointing: "Here they come!"</TE>
<TE>   Framed against a skyline of towering cottonwoods, a blot of small
black specks comes into view. Swooping and wheeling in a feathered
swarm, the flock flaps and squawks its way home, more than 80 feet
over Mapleton Street.</TE>
<TE>   "When the birds are coming in at night, you don't want to run from
your car to the house; you'll get dumped on," said DeWeese.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, Mark Bowen decamped into the street with his
visitors from Ohio. They gestured with their beers, marveling at the
complex choreography that sends the soaring birds careening to bed
down in assigned trees. During such aerial shows, shouts of
"Incoming!" invariably ring out.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, Ellen Brown stalks out of her home, brandishing
an impressive black handgun. Muttering, she squeezes off a few noisy
rounds from the unloaded BB gun into the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Pop! Pop! A covey of starlings swoops from one tree to another.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had an Uzi, I'd love it," she said, glaring at the sky dark
with winged pests. "I want to see blood and feathers. I don't care
what the city says. Bird sanctuary? Pah!"</TE>
<TE>   She stalks off down the street, still firing the weapon, the pop,
pop sound receding with her.</TE>
<TE>   Her neighbors shake their heads, chuckling good-naturedly. Under
the circumstances, someone was bound to crack.</TE>

Helena.</LD>
<LD>   The teens were part of a Utah-based program for troubled youths
that state officials there shut down last week.</LD>
<LD>   The youths were "cold and dirty" when found, but they otherwise

<LD>A National Park Service ranger was killed in a shootout with
suspected smugglers near the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said in
Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   The ranger was responding, along with the U.S. Border Patrol, to a

<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two laptop computers that had been missing from the military command
center coordinating the war in Afghanistan were recovered Friday, and
a suspect in the theft was in custody, an Air Force spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   One of the computers that disappeared Thursday from U.S. Central
Command contained classified information.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Mike Richmond, a spokesman for the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations, wouldn't comment on a motive but said the
laptops apparently weren't taken because of the information they
contained.</LD>
<TE>   The computers were recovered from a private residence. The suspect
is a member of the military who had access to the secure area where
the laptops were kept, but Richmond declined to identify his branch
or rank.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one who was on the list and had access, and in the course
of talking to him and others, we got a confession out of him,"
Richmond said.</TE>

<HD>Environmental Act's Reach Disputed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Justice Department lawyer, defending against environmentalists
suing the Navy for its use of low-frequency sonar, ignored a White
House office's objections to argue in court that a basic
environmental law does not apply just outside U.S. waters, according
to documents obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   A memo by a Navy assistant general counsel and e-mails between
Navy officials illuminate a dispute within the administration over
whether the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires the
government to prepare environmental impact statements before acting,
applies in the so-called exclusive economic zone, 12 to 200 nautical
miles off U.S. coastlines.</LD>
<LD>   The documents, provided by a congressional aide, state that the
Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office that
oversees the law's implementation, and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration disagree with the Navy's interpretation of
the law.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department argument was made in a case filed by
environmental groups to try to force the Navy to analyze the
environmental effects when it tests low-frequency sonar equipment
designed to find submarines in shallow waters. The same kind of sonar
used in these tests has been blamed for stranding whales of four
species in the Bahamas in 2000. Seven of those animals died.</TE>
<TE>   At stake, according to environmentalists and their congressional
supporters, is whether citizens and the courts will have a right to
protect the aquatic environment from a broad range of activities in
the 188-mile-wide zone.</TE>
<TE>   "If the government was to adopt a policy that [the law] does not
apply in the exclusive economic zone, it would be a major shift of
environmental policy and it would be legally wrong," said Andrew
Wetzler, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which
is involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The military, which undertakes its own environmental assessments,
argues that losing the case would mean sacrificing military readiness
to bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to colleagues, Thomas N. Ledvina, the Navy's deputy
assistant general counsel, stressed the importance of the case since
most of the Navy's operations and research take place within the
exclusive economic zone. "Because we already do environmental
analysis ... this is a case of greatly increased regulatory pain
without much corresponding environmental gain," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic members of Congress interpreted the latest action as
another Bush administration effort to weaken protections for valuable
natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   "I am incredulous that the Bush administration may actually be
considering rolling back central environmental protections of our
oceans and marine environment," said Sen. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, chairman of the Commerce subcommittee on oceans,
atmosphere and fisheries and a possible 2004 presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the various agencies refused to discuss the
internal dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on Environmental Quality convened a meeting Tuesday
"to develop a unified position," according to the Navy memo. But Dana
Perino, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said "no agency objected to
[the Navy's] litigating position."</TE>
<TE>   However, since the issue of whether the National Environmental
Policy Act applies in the exclusive economic zone had never been
litigated, Justice Department lawyers sought input from various
agencies, according to a Justice Department attorney, who spoke on
the condition that he not be named because the case is still in
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   They found a variety of interpretations. The National Marine
Fisheries Services, which is under the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, for example, has an official policy of
applying the act in the zone.</TE>
<TE>   In the case, the Justice Department is arguing that the law would
not have extraterritorial application unless Congress explicitly
applied it, which it did not.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups argue that the environmental policy act
concerns how policies are made, so it applies to U.S. government
policy decisions, regardless of where their effects may be felt.</TE>

<HD>NYC Mayor Seeks Full Restaurant Smoker Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The city said Friday that it will try to ban smoking in all bars and
restaurants by focusing on the potential health threat to hospitality
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will ask the City Council next week to
outlaw smoking in the roughly 13,000 establishments not covered by
the current law, which permits smoking in bars and in restaurants
with fewer than 35 seats.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the second time in as many months that the Bloomberg
administration has targeted smokers; in July, it raised the cigarette
tax from 8 cents to $1.50 a pack.</LD>
<TE>   "If you are a bartender or a waiter or waitress and work in an
establishment where there is smoking, in an eight-hour day it's the
equivalent of you smoking half a pack of cigarettes yourself," said
Bloomberg, who quit smoking 18 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "No employer would allow their employees to work in a place with
asbestos in the air," he said. "This is just as dangerous and that's
why we should stop it now."</TE>
<TE>   Elena Deutsch, director of tobacco control at the American Cancer
Society, said the mayor's proposal would protect workers.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone shared their concern.</TE>
<TE>   "Being subjected to smoke is part of my job," said bartender Tony
Trincanello, leaning on an ashtray-strewn counter at Milos' Greek
restaurant in midtown Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the New York State Restaurant Assn. dropped its
long-standing opposition to the current smoking law after a survey
showed most members were in favor of it.</TE>
<TE>   The association will now poll members about whether they support a
full ban on smoking, said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president
of an association chapter.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Won't Yield the Oscar Stage to N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ, DANA CALVO and CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's never too early for Oscar season to begin, although the
squabbling now isn't over the movies but over the March telecast
itself. As usual, Miramax Films' larger-than-life impresario Harvey
Weinstein is in the middle of the fight.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Weinstein's very public pronouncement about luring all or
part of Hollywood's biggest ceremony to New York City was met with
polite skepticism Friday from the president of the Academy of Motion
Pictures Arts and Sciences, and indignation from others.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's ridiculous," said producer Lili Fini Zanuck, who
produced the 2000 awards with her husband, Richard. "The Oscars are a
Hollywood tradition."</LD>
<TE>   Sounding weary from the sudden attention, academy President Frank
Pierson said, "I would say this is a little media frenzy, which is
fine but, for the record, we're not moving the Oscars to New York."
The academy has not yet received a formal proposal from Weinstein,
nor has the organization even spoken to New York Gov. George Pataki
or Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom have publicly praised the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement Friday, Pierson said: "The academy is not
moving the Academy Awards telecast to New York.... Discussion about
the possibility of broadcasting a segment of the telecast from New
York could take place, but not before a producer is on board. No
producer has been appointed."</TE>
<TE>   Pierson seemed more open to the idea when he spoke to The Times
late Thursday: "This year it was harder to bring Woody Allen to
Hollywood than it would be to move part of the show to New York."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been taken by surprise by this," said former academy
President Robert Rehme, who noted that the academy is contractually
obligated to base the show at the new Kodak Theatre in Hollywood,
which is billed as Oscar's home. "It's the 75th anniversary of the
Academy Awards. They're planning a lot of special events," Rehme
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein said that giving New York a piece of the Oscars will
bring revenue and comfort to a city that is still suffering from the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   This is Weinstein's second effort to aid New York with an
entertainment event. Last year, he and Cablevision Systems President
James Dolan produced "The Concert for New York," which raised $35
million for victims of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein has earned a reputation for orchestrating media
frenzies, particularly around Oscar time. He dismissed speculation
that his motivation is no more than a publicity stunt to draw
attention to his big-budget Oscar film, "Gangs of New York," which
will be released at Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing like this would ever help someone's Oscar chances. People
don't vote for a film just because we bring the Oscars to New York,"
Weinstein said, dismissing the speculation. "And what are all those
cynics doing to help New York after 9/11? I'd like every skeptic to
personally match the $1-million dollar check I wrote to the relief
effort."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein and the independent movie company he and his brother Bob
founded 23 years ago in New York are a fixture on Academy Awards
night. Miramax has received 165 Oscar nominations since 1988 and has
had a best picture nomination each of the last 10 years, winning for
1998's "Shakespeare in Love" and 1996's "The English Patient."
Weinstein was one of the pioneers of bare-knuckle Oscar campaigning,
which today is common practice among studios.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said he and Dolan are putting together an "all-star
committee" of businesspeople, artists and academy members to work
with government officials and others to formalize a proposal for the
academy within 30 days. He intends to approach a number of
high-profile media leaders, including Comcast chief Brian Roberts and
Lachlan Murdoch, son of News Corp. head Rupert Murdoch, for donations
to make the move possible. And he hopes to find an influential
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to assure the academy it won't cost them anything," said
Weinstein, who promised to appeal to downtown hotels, airlines and
New York-based fashion designers to get on board with the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   As for the show itself, few if any details of the proposal have
been worked out. For instance, how can the show logically be divided?
Would the presentation for best actor take place in New York and best
actress in L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   "By not having all the stars in one place, you diminish the
appeal," said producer Mark Johnson, who won an Oscar in 1989 for
"Rain Man" and sits on the academy's board of governors.</TE>
<TE>   New York was spotlighted at the 74th Academy Awards in March, when
Allen made his first appearance at an Oscar presentation. He
introduced a retrospective saluting the city's role in film history.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson said his only conversation with Weinstein about the Oscar
telecast was in January, when Weinstein suggested either moving the
program to New York or making the event bicoastal. Pierson said he
rejected both ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "It was financially and economically impossible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein said the idea is not without precedent. From 1953 to
1957, the show was telecast from Hollywood and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki and Bloomberg said Friday that they weren't after just the
GOP and Democratic national conventions in 2004, but also had set
their sights on Oscar night 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place to stay for big events," Bloomberg said. "This
is a showcase place."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said through his spokeswoman that
he was unaware of the move by officials in New York to lure the
Academy Awards there. But the mayor said that, while he doesn't
object to sharing the Oscars next year, he would object to a
permanent move there.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles will always be home to the Academy Awards,"
spokeswoman Julie Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks it's a nice gesture to the people of New York to share
the ceremony temporarily, but he wants L.A. to remain the home of the
Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said Friday that he had not discussed the
possibility with Pataki or anyone else. He said he learned of it from
news accounts that day.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly don't want to move it," Davis said. But he added
that he would support sharing the Oscar ceremonies "on a one-time
basis" with the Big Apple to help recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "One time only," he said. "Hollywood is in California, not New
York."</TE>
<TE>   That stance is in part because the miniature gold-plated statue
has significant revenue implications for L.A., where the ceremony and
surrounding festivities pumped an estimated $61 million into the
local economy this year, according to Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the L.A. County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get a limo in this town on Oscar night," Kyser said.
"And the best hotels are booked solid."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the biggest loss from any wholesale relocation of the
Oscars would be the tremendous public relations value associated with
the event. Broadcast around the world, it has become a global
infomercial for L.A. "You can't put a dollar value on being able to
send out the message every year that Los Angeles is the center of
motion pictures, glamour and entertainment," Kyser said. "That is
priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said the proposal to split Oscar night would enable
California to make a classy "nod to New York and help galvanize our
business."</TE>
<TE>   But not all of the skepticism came from Hollywood insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "What sort of pain does Harvey Weinstein think has to be healed,
if he thinks he can heal it with a single evening of long carpets,
long cars and long skirts?" asked Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of
the New Republic magazine. "What precisely will an orgy of glitz in
Manhattan do for the widows and orphans on Staten Island and Queens?
Studio heads now appear to believe they have spiritual authority in
American society."</TE>

<HD>Powell Brokers Parking Peace</HD>
<DH>New York: Mayor Bloomberg threatened to tow cars of
diplomats owing fines. Calling City Hall, secretary of State voiced
concerns about repercussions abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After a personal phone call from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell,
who temporarily put aside such concerns as Afghanistan and Mideast
peace to deal with cars, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a truce
Friday in New York City's diplomat parking wars.</LD>
<LD>   The result: Municipal tow trucks will not haul away illegally
parked autos belonging to officials of foreign consulates, as
Bloomberg had threatened.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration pledged in return to help collect a
portion of fines owed the city and to limit the number of license
plates it issues to some representatives of foreign governments.</LD>
<TE>   "We have an agreement in principle," Bloomberg announced at a City
Hall news conference. "It is not signed. There are still details."</TE>
<TE>   But by his cheerful tone, Bloomberg clearly was optimistic that
representatives of the city and the State Department, after
negotiations that ended before dawn Friday, finally had solved a
problem that has frustrated generations of mayors and motorists.</TE>
<TE>   With seeming impunity, especially in Midtown Manhattan where many
consulates are situated, diplomats have parked cars in no-parking
zones in violation of traffic regulations.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the vehicles have blocked fire hydrants.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the parking habits of the diplomats are more
than a nuisance and could create additional hazards when emergency
vehicles are trying to move through normally crowded streets.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the Bloomberg administration announced it would
begin towing illegally parked cars with consular plates Friday unless
the Bush administration went to court for an injunction.</TE>
<TE>   The focus was on the 700 vehicles with consular license plates in
the city. The U.S. State Department registers these vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Consulates, which chiefly provide visas, promote commerce and care
for foreign nationals, enjoy a lesser degree of diplomatic immunity
than members of missions to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. members whose cars also are registered by the federal
government are issued different diplomatic license plates with the
initials DPL.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, 1,600 vehicles have DPL plates.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, as talks between the Bush administration
and the city appeared stalled, Powell called Bloomberg and asked him
to return to the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials contended that towing consular cars
would violate treaties and harm international relations unless the
vehicles created an immediate safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   These officials also feared retaliation against U.S. diplomats in
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had
contended that foreign diplomats not only were flouting the law but
were running up huge fines in unpaid parking tickets.</TE>
<TE>   One estimate put the total owed with interest at $22 million--a
figure the mayor said Friday was inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   "The $22 million would never really stand up. There are lots of
cases where one car got five tickets in half an hour and the courts
would throw out at least four of them," Bloomberg said. "There are a
lot of cases where you can argue we would never collect the
interest."</TE>
<TE>   "I think you've got to be careful in using that figure," the mayor
cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably more like a tenth of that."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said some details in the agreement still needed to be
worked out, but representatives of the State Department had pledged
it would dramatically reduce the number of consular license plates
and would help the city "through a variety of moral persuasion and
financial withholding" to collect some of the fines.</TE>

<HD>White House Issues Rules on Patient Privacy</HD>
<DH>Health care: Critics call standards lax, while the
administration says they strike the right balance. Providers do not
need consent to share records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration released final medical privacy regulations
Friday that will require doctors, HMOs and hospitals to tell patients
how they use their medical records.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike privacy rules approved by the Clinton administration,
the Bush rules do not require health-care providers to obtain
patients' consent before sharing their medical records with insurance
companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush regulations also allow health-care providers, pharmacies
and drug companies to profit from the use of patient records, giving
them broad leeway to use medical information to market their
health-care products.</LD>
<TE>   When the 443-page rule, ordered by Congress six years ago, finally
takes effect in April, it will for the first time provide all
Americans with basic privacy protections for their medical records.</TE>
<TE>   But privacy advocates argued that the rules fall woefully short of
what is needed, and it was clear that the debate over patient
consent, the use of medical records for marketing purposes and the
effect of confidentiality on patient care would continue in Congress,
state legislatures and political campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news," said Janlori Goldman, director of Georgetown
University's Health Privacy Project, who was highly critical of many
of the regulations' specific provisions, "is that they did allow the
rule to go into effect."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials said some sharing of medical
information--when a doctor orders a prescription or refers a patient
to a specialist, for example--is necessary, and the new rules strike
just the right balance.</TE>
<TE>   In providing basic privacy protections, Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said the administration worked to avoid
"creating greater hardships or more health-care bureaucracy for
patients as they seek to get prompt and effective care."</TE>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Health Plans, a trade group representing
more than 1,000 HMOs, and the Federation of American Hospitals
applauded the administration for issuing balanced, workable rules.
The Health Insurance Assn. of America said the regulations were less
onerous than the Clinton administration rules but would "inevitably
increase the cost of health care."</TE>
<TE>   But some of Congress' strongest defenders of patient privacy,
comparing the new rules to the Clinton administration regulations
they replace, said Americans had actually lost confidentiality
protections.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called the Bush regulations a
"serious setback for medical privacy." Referring to the intense
lobbying by the health-care industry, he said they were "yet another
example of the Bush administration favoring the interests of powerful
corporations over those of ordinary Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said, "The Bush
administration is going backwards in privacy protection by creating
huge loopholes that will significantly undermine privacy for most
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   The American Psychiatric Assn., perhaps the strongest defender of
patient confidentiality among health-care providers, expressed deep
disappointment and said the regulations could actually lower the
quality of health care.</TE>
<TE>   With few guarantees on the privacy of their medical records, some
patients "may simply decide not to come for certain kinds of care or
they may withhold information that would be very important in
treating their condition," said Dr. Paul Applebaum, president of the
association.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients, afraid that information about their medical
condition could lead to the loss of a job or insurance, already hop
from doctor to doctor, pay for medical bills out of pocket and refuse
to seek care.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Bush administration's rules, a physician or hospital can
send a patient's medical information to an insurance company even if
the patient paid the bill in cash to prevent that.</TE>
<TE>   Such practice will "play havoc with patient confidentiality" and
further erode the quality of care for some patients, said Richard
Sobel, senior research associate at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Some privacy experts found the marketing provisions of the new
regulations the most troubling of all.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules prohibit a doctor or pharmacy from selling patient
names and health-care information to a third party--a drug company,
for example. However, the rules allow the physician or pharmacy to
accept payment from the drug company to send all their patients
taking one drug for heartburn a letter recommending that they switch
to one manufactured by the company paying for the solicitation.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, Goldman said, "the administration is legalizing one of
the more reprehensible practices: the selling of people's medical
records."</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration's regulations would have allowed
similar marketing practices but with two key conditions, Goldman
said. First, physicians or pharmacies sending such letters would have
had to acknowledge they were being paid to do so. Second, they would
have been required to give patients the opportunity to opt out of
receiving similar letters or phone calls in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Now both of those safeguards are gone," Goldman said. Under the
Bush regulations, a marketing tactic used in Florida recently would
be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a Walgreens drugstore, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., three
doctors and a hospital used patient information to market the
antidepressant Prozac. A 59-year-old woman who received from
Walgreens a free one-month trial of the drug has filed a class-action
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's release of the final rule, which will be published
Wednesday in the Federal Register, appears to bring to a close
Congress' years-long effort to establish basic privacy rights for
patients. The process began in 1996 with the passage of the Health
Insurance and Portability Act, which was intended to make health
insurance more accessible and transferable by standardizing and
streamlining the record-keeping practices of health-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   The law also called for action to protect the privacy of medical
records and said that if Congress failed to pass such legislation by
1999, the secretary of Health and Human Services should draft privacy
regulations. After congressional efforts stalled amid disagreements
over how to handle teenagers' reproductive health information and
consumers' rights to sue health-care entities that violated the
privacy rules, the Clinton administration took up the task.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration released its privacy rules just one
month before President Bush took office, and the new administration
initially said it would let the Clinton rules stand. Bush had
promised during the 2000 campaign to increase medical privacy
protections.</TE>
<TE>   But health insurance companies, hospitals and HMOs lobbied hard to
scuttle the rules, arguing that they would be too costly and would
interfere with patient care. The Bush administration agreed, and in
March it released its proposed rules. Most significantly, the Bush
rules no longer required patients' consent for the release of their
medical information, and they allowed greater use of patient
information for marketing purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials noted that some Clinton provisions
would have had unintended consequences, possibly delaying the release
of information to a referred specialist or preventing a husband from
picking up his wife's prescription if the pharmacy did not have her
consent form on file.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy advocates said those problems could have been corrected
with minor adjustments to the regulations. But the Bush
administration, appearing at times to suggest that confidentiality
and access to care were incompatible, made dramatic changes to those
provisions.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Tip Network Scaled Back</HD>
<DH>Surveillance: Workers with access to homes won't use new
hotline, Justice Department says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, backing away from a controversial
anti-terrorism plan in the face of a public backlash, said Friday
that it will no longer solicit terrorism tips from utility workers,
postal employees and anyone else with access to people's homes.</LD>
<LD>   That pledge scales back President Bush's recently unveiled plan to
set up a nationwide network of domestic tipsters from within the U.S.
work force who the administration believes are in a "unique position"
to report suspicious activity.</LD>
<LD>   The administration still plans to enlist potentially hundreds of
thousands of workers this fall as part of Operation TIPS. But
officials have decided that workers with access to homes and private
property will not be authorized to use the special nonpublished
tipster hotline, Justice Department officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The notion of cable television workers or meter readers reporting
what they considered to be "suspicious" activity in someone's house
had riled senators and civil libertarians alike, sparking protests
and congressional opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "People were obviously uncomfortable with that, and we were
sensitive to that and wanted to listen to the public's concerns,"
said a Justice Department official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The move heartened civil rights advocates, who say they don't want
the government encouraging people to snoop on their neighbors. The
Operation TIPS program has become a rallying point for critics who
maintain that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has gone too far in scaling
back civil rights in the name of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "They're backpedaling, and I'm glad they're backpedaling," said
Laura W. Murphy, head of the Washington office of the American Civil
Liberties Union, in an interview. "It's quite a relief ... knowing
that even the Ashcroft administration is not immune to public
criticism."</TE>
<TE>   But Murphy questioned whether limiting the program means "the true
demise of government-sanctioned peeping Toms or is just a public
relations effort to stem the criticism." Congressional critics,
meanwhile, predicted the changes will not be enough to derail
legislation proposed last month that seeks a ban on the program.</TE>
<TE>   David Carle, spokesman for Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J.
Leahy (D-Vt.), said concerns go beyond the issue of access to homes.
Another central question is what will happen to records of the tips
once they are referred to law enforcement agencies for review.</TE>
<TE>   "The bipartisan concerns in Congress about this program are not
likely to be satisfied by this change. There are many questions still
without answers, including how the data will be used and stored by
government agencies and other concerns about the structure and scope
of the program," Carle said. "Justice Department officials have
offered scant information that makes it unclear whether even they
know how the program would actually work."</TE>
<TE>   Leahy and other senators pressed Ashcroft at a congressional
hearing last month to explain how the program would work if, for
instance, a telephone or cable worker spotted something "suspicious"
during a call at someone's house.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft gave a fairly noncommittal response. While he indicated
that the information would not be stored in a databank, as originally
suggested, he refused to exclude the use of such tips in the
administration's new program. "Telephone repairmen have the
opportunity, just like you have an opportunity, to call the FBI at
any time," Ashcroft responded.</TE>
<TE>   In the two weeks since that hearing, however, opposition to the
plan has grown, prompting Justice Department officials to ban tips
regarding private homes altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "The department never intended that workers calling the hotline
would report on anything other than publicly observable activities,"
according to an updated plan released by the Justice Department on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "However, given the concerns raised ... about safeguarding against
all possibilities of invasion of individual privacy, the Department
of Justice has decided that the hotline number will not be shared
with any workers, including postal and utility workers, whose work
puts them in contact with homes and private property."</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service indicated last month that it did not want to
participate in the program because of civil rights concerns. The
Justice Department is now in discussions with officials from the
shipping, trucking, maritime, and other transportation and service
industries to enlist their support in getting workers to call in tips
once the program begins, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration said initially on a Web site promoting the
program that it expected a million or more workers to participate,
but officials said Friday that figure was not meant to be taken
literally.</TE>
<TE>   Even as plans changed, the administration continued to insist that
the use of utility and postal employees "made sense" because they
have been identified as targets of terrorism, as in the case of last
year's anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some law enforcement officials have questioned whether the tip
system would overwhelm agencies with referrals for what could prove
to be mostly bogus leads.</TE>
<TE>   But a Justice Department official involved in the program, who
asked not to be identified, said authorities are convinced, based on
the hundreds of thousands of terrorism-related tips received since
Sept. 11, that the program "will be useful."</TE>
<TE>   Officials also denied a report that tips to the Justice Department
were being referred to the TV show "America's Most Wanted." The
report was based on a misunderstanding between a receptionist and a
reporter, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Louisiana Confirms 7 West Nile Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The death toll from the worst outbreak of West Nile virus in the U.S.
climbed to seven Friday as Louisiana health officials said two more
people had died of the mosquito-borne disease. The governor of
Mississippi declared a state of emergency as the number of cases
there increased.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were identified as a 76-year-old woman who died Aug. 2
and a 94-year-old woman who died Sunday. Both lived in parishes north
of New Orleans, across Lake Pontchartrain, that have reported more
than 30 cases of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The number of cases in Louisiana has risen to 85, and the state is
still waiting for test results on 90 blood samples, said Dr. Raoult
Ratard, the state epidemiologist. To avoid delaying results for the
most seriously ill, Louisiana will test only people who appear to
have nervous system infections: meningitis or encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain.</LD>
<TE>   The Louisiana outbreak is the deadliest since the virus killed
seven people and hospitalized 55 others in New York in 1999, when the
disease was first detected in this country.</TE>
<TE>   All West Nile deaths this year have been in Louisiana, though
Mississippi officials were awaiting test results to confirm whether a
death there was due to the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie D. Musgrove declared a state of emergency
to warn residents to protect themselves. It cleared the way to seek
federal funding to fight the outbreak. Louisiana has already taken
the step.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) said she plans to ask the Air Force
next week to send in a Special Operations squadron to spray
insecticide in affected parishes. The 910th Flight Wing, based in
Ohio, specializes in insect control.</TE>

<LD>Meet the new teacher on the first day of school. She's never taught
anything. She doesn't know much about her subject, or how to manage
her loud and unruly class. Her emergency credential got her this far.
The California Board of Education considers her a "highly qualified"
teacher. Wrong.</LD>
<LD>   There aren't enough good teachers to go around in California,
especially in large urban districts like Los Angeles. Many don't want
to work in poor neighborhoods, where they are most needed, because of
hellish commutes, heartbreaking challenges or high crime. As a
result, the neediest students often get stuck with the weakest
teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Washington wants to change that. The "No Child Left Behind" law
requires that by the end of the 2005-06 school year there be a
"highly qualified" teacher in every classroom at schools that receive
federal money to help low-income students. Starting the day after
school begins this year, districts are supposed to fill any opening
at those schools with a fully credentialed teacher.</LD>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles Unified School District, this means that at the
beginning of the traditional school year next month no vacancy can be
filled by a teacher with an emergency credential at the 555 schools
that receive federal aid to help poor children. So far, 652 teachers
have been hired to fill 670 vacancies throughout the district. Close
to 200 of the new teachers hold full credentials; 104 have emergency
permits and 361 are in a highly competitive internship program.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer wants Washington to count intern teachers as
"highly qualified." He makes a good case. Interns get a head start
with a three-week introduction to teaching before school starts. On
the first day, they come prepared with lesson plans for two weeks,
support from a mentor and ongoing classes to review what worked and
didn't work and what needs changing, all part of their two-year
course. Without interns, Romer says, class sizes would have to
double.</TE>
<TE>   He rules out "combat pay," like a $5,000 bonus, to lure "highly
qualified" teachers to schools in poor areas because the district
also would have to pay more to every teacher already there. Because
of a severe teacher shortage, many California school districts like
Los Angeles need greater flexibility and an extra year or two to meet
the federal goal.</TE>
<TE>   Washington can help by quickly and dramatically increasing the
national pool of high-caliber teachers through special programs,
scholarships, loan forgiveness and other incentives. Those measures
worked after the Russians beat the United States into space. This is
one race America can't afford to lose.</TE>

<DH>Aviation: Military veteran and the rare spy plane he served
on will be at weekend's Camarillo Air Show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scouting for Russian fighter planes and surviving risky exploits
aboard a Cold War-era spy plane fuel the stories James "Moe" Movinski
likes to share with others on the air show circuit.</LD>
<LD>   The next mission for Movinski, 62, and the rare EC-121T Warning
Star Constellation he served on as an Air Force intercept control
technician, gets underway today at the Camarillo Air Show.</LD>
<LD>   Saved from a scrap heap in the mid '90s by the Moorpark-based
Global Aeronautical Foundation, the plane is the only combat Warning
Star Constellation still able to fly.</LD>
<TE>   "She is very significant," said Movinski, who lives in Carmichael.
"It really is a flying museum."</TE>
<TE>   Four other Constellations remain operational but were built as
transport aircraft, he said. One of those, nicknamed the "Miss
Camarillo," is also stationed at Camarillo Airport and will provide a
unique Constellation double-bill for this weekend's air show patrons.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Camarillo"--its interior converted into a museum--will be
parked nose-to-nose with its vintage military sister during the air
show. More than 850 Constellations, each distinguished by its
triple-tail design, were manufactured between 1943 and 1958 by
Lockheed. They were to be among the first high-speed, long-range
aircraft built for Howard Hughes' Trans World Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   World War II, however, steered the fleet into military service.
During the next 30 years, many of the planes would be used for cargo
and VIP transportation, combat reconnaissance and air-traffic
control.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Movinski. His 21-year Air Force career aboard various
Warning Star Constellations--the predecessor of today's AWACS
electronic surveillance aircraft--began in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1962, Movinski found himself in the middle of the Cuban
missile crisis. The high-flying, unarmed Constellations--with
sophisticated radar systems bulging from the domed underbelly--kept
searching for Russian MIG fighter pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians were wary of the U.S. reconnaissance planes that were
snapping aerial photographs of their Cuban missile outposts. It was
Movinski's job, and others like him, to provide MIG warnings to
low-flying reconnaissance aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "One day we were out there and two MIGs jumped us instead,"
Movinski said.</TE>
<TE>   From its high patrolling elevation, the Constellation's radar
equipment picked up two MIG warplanes closing in, Movinski said. The
Constellation's pilot commenced an immediate power dive to 50 feet
above the ocean where the aircraft was able to evade detection.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to get us, but we dropped down ... and just gave her
all the power and made it back to Miami," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Movinski's 10,000 hours in the EC-121T included six years of duty
during the Vietnam War, in which he directed aircraft to aerial
refueling tankers and guided rescue planes to downed pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Later, his lookout for Cuba-based MIG fighters would continue when
President Richard Nixon would fly south to Key Biscayne, Fla. And to
Iceland, to guard the air defense zone, flying side-by-side with MIG
fighters on their way to Cuba and back.</TE>
<TE>   The last batch of Warning Star Constellations had their final
service in 1977. Many were ripped asunder for scrap metal, Movinski
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the year I retired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His military career behind him, Movinski would not step onto
another Constellation until early 1995 when he was contacted by the
late Wayne Jones of Moorpark, who had purchased the EC-121T from the
Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in Tucson, where the aircraft was waiting to
be scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, 71, who died in June, founded the nonprofit Global
Aeronautical Foundation to help fund the cost of showcasing the
EC-121T at air shows.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will be able to enter the EC-121T cockpit and walk the
length of the plane. Movinski will be on hand today and Sunday to
describe the aircraft's sophisticated equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But how much longer Movinski will chronicle his life aboard the
aircraft in Camarillo is in question.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Jones, widow of Wayne Jones, wants the plane to be on
permanent display at the airport. The details have yet to be worked
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have to sell it or donate if I can't find a sponsor,"
Jones said. For this weekend, she said, the focus will be on sharing
a celebrated plane that was loved by her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll open it up at least one more time and let it be a memorial
to Wayne."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Camarillo Air Show will be held today and Sunday from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. at the Camarillo Airport, 555 Airport Way. Admission: $6
general, children younger than 12 free. For more information, call
383-0686.</TE>

<HD>Joe Allison, 77; Wore Many Hats in Country Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Allison, who co-wrote the 1960 Jim Reeves hit "He'll Have to Go"
during one phase of a wide-ranging career in country music, died Aug.
2 at a hospital in Nashville. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was respiratory failure after a long battle
with lung disease.</LD>
<LD>   Allison was a disc jockey, recording executive, producer and
publisher who worked with many of the top names in country music,
including Tex Ritter and Willie Nelson.</LD>
<TE>   He first found success as a songwriter, however, when Ritter
recorded Allison's "When You Leave, Don't Slam the Door" in 1946. It
rose to the top three on the country music chart.</TE>
<TE>   The song was one of several hits he wrote, often in partnership
with his first wife, Audrey. Their best-known number was "He'll Have
to Go," which Reeves recorded in 1960. Singer Jeanne Black later
recorded an "answer" song, "He'll Have to Stay," for which Allison
won a BMI Award.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, born in McKinney, Texas, started in country music as a
performer with Ritter after leaving the Army Air Corps at the end of
World War II. After the success of "When You Leave, Don't Slam the
Door," he moved to Nashville in 1949 to become a disc jockey at WMAK.
He soon had his own daily show on WSM and WSIX, where he hosted stars
including the Everly Brothers, Anita Kerr, Chet Atkins and Brenda
Lee.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles in 1952, succeeding Tennessee Ernie Ford
on his daily KXLA radio program. He also moved into television on
KTTV's "Town Hall Party" and ABC's "Country America."</TE>
<TE>   During this period, he helped found the Country Music Disc Jockey
Assn., which later became the Country Music Assn.</TE>
<TE>   His songs were recorded by an array of artists, including Nat King
Cole, Patsy Cline, Elvis Presley, Ry Cooder, Bing Crosby, Tom Jones
and Eddy Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   Allison moved back to Nashville in 1970 and became head of the
country music department at Paramount Records, where he helped groom
such stars as Joe Stampley and Tommy Overstreet. He also produced
Ritter's last album, "Tex Ritter: An American Legend."</TE>
<TE>   Allison spent his later years buying and selling antiques and
paintings, finally retiring in 1988 after a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Rita; sons Gregory Joe, Brian James
and Mark Woodward; and a brother, Jerry, all of Nashville.</TE>

<HD>Officials Aim to Improve Amber Alerts</HD>
<DH>Safety: State's abduction warning system, with two false
alarms in two weeks, is being fine-tuned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After five child-abduction alerts in California in the last 10
days--two of them false alarms--state officials, law enforcement
officers and broadcasters gathered Friday to hammer out ways to
improve the system.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called "Amber alert" network, which posts information about
an abducted child on radio, TV and digital freeway signs, has been
widely praised for helping in the rescue of two kidnapped Antelope
Valley teenagers last week. But the program, launched just two weeks
ago, also needs debugging.</LD>
<LD>   "We spent a lot of time going over its defects," Gov. Gray Davis
said at a Los Angeles news conference after the meeting. "We want to
make it work better."</LD>
<TE>   The fine-tuning process will take three months, he said. Ideas
from the meeting included standardizing the alert's format and
providing translations in Spanish, Chinese and other languages.</TE>
<TE>   Some participants said alerts should be restricted to kidnappings
by strangers and exclude custody-battle abductions, unless the child
faces harm.</TE>
<TE>   "The real danger of this system is, if you use it all the time, it
loses its effectiveness," said Tom Marshall, spokesman for the
California Highway Patrol. "You can't interrupt broadcasts three
times a day."</TE>
<TE>   Victim advocates say such fears are overblown.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it not worth it to save a child's life?" asked Jenni Thompson,
spokeswoman for the Polly Klaas Foundation in Petaluma.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Davis kicked off the California Child Safety Amber
Network, named after a Texas girl who was abducted and killed in
1996. Davis said he would sign a bill by summer's end that would
require law enforcement organizations to use the system. It's now
voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities activated an Amber alert for the first time on July 31
in Northern California, when someone reported having seen a child
being shoved into a van, according to the CHP. Soon, freeway signs in
the San Francisco Bay Area began flashing alerts. They stopped an
hour or two later, when police learned the teenager was a runaway and
the van belonged to his group home.</TE>
<TE>   The second alert, and the only statewide one so far, came Aug. 1
in the Antelope Valley case. Though the system generated calls that
led to the girls' rescue, it also was criticized because it took five
hours to activate. Law enforcement's goal is 30 minutes. Later that
day, a San Diego carjacking prompted an Amber alert in San Diego and
Imperial counties. The child was later found in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 2, an Amber alert again was issued in the Bay Area after a
12-year-old girl in a Chinese student tour group was reported to be
missing. The alert was canceled after she surfaced with her family.</TE>
<TE>   The next day in Sacramento, a sighting of a girl being grabbed
triggered another Amber alert in Northern California. Within hours,
she was found unharmed at home. Authorities believe the alert might
have discouraged her alleged abductor.</TE>
<TE>   The two false alarms show the need for higher alert standards,
said Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster), who wrote the pending
Amber alert bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not meant to be an announcement for any missing person,"
Runner said, citing the case of the Chinese girl as one that police
should have investigated further. "They weren't even sure she was
abducted. She was just missing, and all of a sudden they had freeway
signs up."</TE>

<HD>Angelyne Moves From Billboard to the Ballot</HD>
<DH>Politics: Voluptuous Hollywood icon files to run for city
council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Word that billboard icon Angelyne was running for office in the
proposed city of Hollywood caused a flurry of jokes Friday, most of
them about her figure rather than her grasp of figures.</LD>
<LD>   Gene La Pietra, president of the Hollywood Independence Committee
and a city council candidate, was among those who offered a few quips
about her "assets."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking forward to meeting her," he said--after running out
of comic material.</LD>
<TE>   Angelyne, the age-concealing actress who has appeared in the film
"Earth Girls Are Easy" and a Moby music video, filed her candidacy
papers Friday, along with 19 other council contenders. The documents
included a statement that said she has no reportable assets, despite
those billboards of her that began popping up in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, she insisted she is serious about making
Hollywood better. "I'm Angelyne. I'm the image of Hollywood. I want
Hollywood to rise to my occasion," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had no trouble getting the 20 signatures needed to
qualify for the Nov. 5 secession ballot. She stepped onto the
sidewalk with her petition and was surrounded by fans eager to sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never really thought about politics," she said. "I had an
overwhelming request from all sorts of committees and people to run."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Hollywood could use a makeover, the platinum-blond
candidate said, "My answer to that is, 'Duh.' "</TE>

<HD>Avila Plea in Killing: Innocent</HD>
<DH>Courts: The attorney for the man accused of Samantha
Runnion's kidnap and slaying raises the possibility of a change of
venue.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alejandro Avila pleaded innocent Friday to kidnapping, molesting and
strangling 5-year-old Samantha Runnion last month as questions
mounted over whether he could receive a fair trial in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The Lake Elsinore man's attorney said she was surprised that Dist.
Atty. Tony Rackauckas showed up at the arraignment to personally
argue the state's case. The unusual move came as Rackauckas made the
rounds of national talk shows this week after announcing Monday he
would seek the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a concern in this case that the media attention could
distort the process," said Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg,
comparing the intense coverage to that surrounding the O.J. Simpson
case. "It's causing a rush to judgment."</LD>
<TE>   Gragg complained that the media seem to know more about the
evidence than she does, citing DNA tests, fiber samples and
cell-phone records that law enforcement sources have said link Avila
to Samantha's murder. Even President Bush has labeled Avila as the
"killer of Samantha."</TE>
<TE>   Gragg said she would seek a change of venue if she concludes that
Avila cannot get a fair trial in Orange County. Rackauckas said he
believes Avila can receive a fair trial. The district attorney said
he will likely oppose efforts to change venue.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-profile child murder cases--including the trial of
Polly Klaas' accused killer--were moved because of pretrial
publicity. But some, like the Danielle van Dam case in San
Diego--were not. Scholars said Friday the Avila case could go either
way but agreed there are strong arguments for a change of venue.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University, said Orange
County's judicial district is large enough to find jurors who might
not be influenced by pretrial publicity. She said the case shares a
lot of elements with the Van Dam case, including the level of
coverage and the community's emotional involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Officials Speak Out</TE>
<TE>   What sets the Avila case apart is that so many high-ranking
officials have publicly declared the defendant guilty before his
trial. The day Avila was arrested, for example, Sheriff Michael S.
Carona said he was "100%" sure Avila was Samantha's murderer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably not too helpful to keeping the case in the
community when the leadership comes out and says he's 100% guilty,"
Levinson said. "If I had to bet, it's the kind of case where it would
not surprise me to see a change of venue."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Uelmen, law professor at Santa Clara University School of
Law, agreed. He said the public declarations of Avila's guilt have
been unusually damning. Uelmen also said it was unusual for
prosecutors to seal affidavits supporting the search of Avila's
apartment and his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what justification they have to keep it sealed ...
," Uelmen said. "I would think the defense would have access to it
before the preliminary hearing."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was playing with a friend near a row of garages at her
Stanton condo complex on July 15 when she was grabbed and forced into
a car by a stranger who had asked for help finding his puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 27, was arrested four days later and charged with
kidnapping, murder and two counts of lewd acts upon a child. Special
circumstances filed with the charges allow prosecutors to seek the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Suspect Denies Guilt</TE>
<TE>   Avila professed his innocence in an interview with The Times hours
before his arrest, saying he was at the Ontario Mills mall around the
time of the crime. But law enforcement sources say they have
collected evidence that contradicts his alibi, including preliminary
DNA test results and cell phone and credit card records that place
him near the area where Samantha was found dead.</TE>
<TE>   At his arraignment Friday, Avila peered through a glass partition
as Gragg entered his plea.</TE>
<TE>   Shackled at his waist, Avila spoke only once during his
arraignment, answering "yes" when Orange County Superior Court Judge
Ronald P. Kreber asked if he agreed to a delay of his preliminary
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Kreber put off the preliminary hearing, which is held to determine
if there is enough evidence to bring Avila to trial, after Gragg
complained that prosecutors had not turned over key evidence that,
according to various press reports, they have collected against
Avila.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas countered that his office will be giving the defense
2,000 more pages of evidence in the next couple of days, and handing
over even more in the next few weeks. He added that it would take at
least three months to gather all the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be careful here that we don't start a process where we
have a delay for the sake of delay," Rackauckas argued in court. "The
people have a constitutional right to a speedy trial. We wish to
invoke that right."</TE>

<HD>Propositions to Test Generosity of State's Voters</HD>
<DH>Election: Deadline passes for measures to qualify for
ballot. Those that make the cut seek billions of dollars for
education, trauma care and other programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deadline to qualify state and local propositions for the November
ballot passed Friday, and voters will be asked to raise money for
causes including education, emergency rooms and low-income housing.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in Los Angeles County will vote on a parcel tax that would
raise $150 million annually for the area's faltering emergency and
trauma-care network. They will also be asked to authorize a
$250-million bond issue to pay for upgrading several county science
and cultural institutions.</LD>
<LD>   Statewide, voters will be asked to approve bond issues to raise
money for low-income housing, water services and public education.</LD>
<TE>   Measures for individual school districts total more than $10
billion across the state, according to the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Jarvis organization, said
he expects the amount of the bond and tax proposals to create a
backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "Many voters are going to be facing sticker shock," Vosburgh said.
"There is a lot of anger, and it is much more than the usual
election."</TE>
<TE>   But a political consultant, Harvey Englander, said he expects
voters to look at the propositions individually. He said many of the
propositions face hurdles, not because they appear alongside other
proposed spending increases, but because of the weak economy and the
weak political coalitions behind some of them.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to Los Angeles County's health tax proposal, which was
put on the ballot by a 3-2 vote of county supervisors, Englander
said, "You'll have a strong argument in support, made by a powerful
supervisor such as Zev Yaroslavsky. But making the opposing argument
will be another powerful supervisor."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, voters will be asked to urge the U.S. Navy to
completely clean up the former El Toro Marine Corps base before it is
sold. The base, which closed in July 1999, is on the federal
Superfund list as one of the nation's most polluted sites.</TE>
<TE>   The Nov. 5 ballot measure asks the Navy to reconcile its cleanup
plan for El Toro with studies by Irvine and the county, which contend
that the Navy's plan is inadequate. Voters in March approved turning
the former base into a large urban park.</TE>
<TE>   A public demand for full cleanup could resonate beyond Orange
County. Congress is considering more military base closings in 2005,
meaning that more communities could be looking to the Navy's record
at El Toro. Pollution discovered at other closed bases has stalled
redevelopment and added millions of dollars in costs.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the November ballot will include a contentious
battle over the treatment of the city's homeless waged by two
supervisors who are expected to run for mayor in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Ammiano proposes building 1,000 low-cost housing
units in the next two years, while Gavin Newsom wants to reduce
funding for 8,000 or more people who live on the streets in one of
the nation's most expensive cities.</TE>
<TE>   In the city of Ventura, voters will decide whether to allow 1,390
luxury homes to be built on the city's hillsides. The developer has
agreed to set aside 3,000 acres as permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Measure A argue that the initiative includes a
detailed development agreement written by the hillside landowners
without input from the city. They say this would lock in approval of
certain aspects of the development before crucial environmental and
traffic studies were complete.</TE>

<HD>Meredith Baylis, 73; Danced With the Famed Ballets Russes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meredith Baylis, a former dancer in the fabled Ballets Russes de
Monte Carlo who went on to become a noted teacher in the Joffrey
Ballet School and then taught for two decades in Southern California,
has died. She was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Baylis died at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank on July 26 of
complications from heart surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Of Scottish-Irish descent, Baylis was born in Burbank on April 4,
1929, and came from a theatrical family. Her great-aunt Lilian Baylis
was the director of London's Old Vic Theatre from which both the
National Theatre of Great Britain and the Royal Ballet eventually
emerged. She studied ballet locally and in New York, graduated from
Burbank High School in 1947 and shortly afterward joined a national
touring company of the musical "Carousel." She later danced on
Broadway in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," "Can-Can" and "The Girl in
Pink Tights."</LD>
<TE>   In the 1951-52 season, she joined the Ballets Russes, then the
world's most glamorous classical dance company, dancing featured
roles and later working as a coach for the company until its closure
in 1962. "The Ballets Russes was the first blending of the Old World
and the New World in ballet," she told dance historian Jack Anderson
when he was researching a book on the company. "It linked St.
Petersburg [Russia] with America and Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Five years after the Ballets Russes folded, she was teaching at
the Joffrey Ballet School in New York City, formed as a training
adjunct to the ballet company founded by Robert Joffrey. Baylis
taught there for more than 20 years, pioneering the teaching of
ballet to deaf children. In 1979, she chose Ron Reagan to be a
scholarship student, not knowing that he was the president's son.</TE>
<TE>   She left Joffrey in the 1980s and returned to Burbank to care for
her father, continuing to teach on her own and with other Ballets
Russes alumnae.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a brother, Richard Baylis of Huntington Beach.</TE>

<HD>Black Bear Leads Officers on Chase</HD>
<DH>Saticoy: The 300-pound animal runs up a tree before it is
tranquilized. Authorities say drought is partly responsible for rise
in bruin sightings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 300-pound black bear startled some Saticoy residents and led
Ventura police and county animal control workers on a chase before
finally being cornered and tranquilized early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The bear was first sighted at Saticoy Elementary School shortly
after midnight, but it eluded Ventura police officers who were sent
to take it back to the mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Frightened Saticoy residents in the 10400 block of Darling Road
called in 30 minutes later to report a bear in their yard. With
police in pursuit, the bear jumped fences and ran through yards,
eventually climbing up a pine tree in front of the Villa Scandia
Apartments.</LD>
<TE>   A California Department of Fish and Game officer used a
tranquilizer gun to sedate the bear, causing it to fall from the
tree. It was then lifted onto an animal control truck and whisked
away to be examined by a veterinarian and later returned to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured, and no property was damaged during the
pursuit, said Lt. Brock Avery, a police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say a combination of drought conditions, urban
encroachment and the recent 20,000-acre Wolf fire north of Ojai have
prompted bears and other animals to venture into residential areas
seeking food.</TE>
<TE>   Already this year, there have been eight bear sightings in the
county, in part because of a mild and dry winter last year, officials
said. The first reports came in March, about four months earlier than
usual.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're in for a long haul," said Kathy Jenks, director of
the Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation. "Until we get
some good rains, this will not be the last" bear sighting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their size, black bears are agile creatures that typically
favor wilderness in places such as the Los Padres National Forest.
They rarely attack humans, but have been known to knock down garbage
cans and rip doors off cars and refrigerators while searching for
food.</TE>
<TE>   "California has a very healthy bear population, and whenever the
habitat can't support the number of bears, they don't just go quietly
into the night," said Roland Takayama, who works for the state
Department of Fish and Game. "They'll try to find places to eat and
water to drink."</TE>
<TE>   Those places are increasingly along the urban-rural perimeter.
Bears are often spotted in areas such as Ojai, but their search for
food and water is causing them to wander farther into populated
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The drought is affecting everything," Jenks said. "Places where
they would normally get water have been dry as a bone since March."</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't limited to Ventura County. On Tuesday, a mother
bear and her cub died in a house fire they started while foraging for
food in a home near the San Bernardino National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   And in July, a black bear squared off with police in a Monrovia
neighborhood for 14 hours. After using pepper spray, rubber bullets
and beanbag shots to try to prod the bear out of a tree, police
finally tranquilized it and returned it to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   Bears aren't the only wild animals wandering into residential
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Jenks said that coyotes, rattlesnakes and even mountain lions have
been known to enter urban areas in pursuit of food or water. Humans
often contribute to the problem by being sloppy with their garbage.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll surface in different places if they think there's going
to be a meal," said Patrick Musone, a community education officer
with the Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation.</TE>

<LD>UCLA physicians remain cautiously optimistic about the recovery of
formerly conjoined twins Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej
Alvarez, who are soon expected to begin receiving intravenous
feedings.</LD>
<LD>   The 1-year-old sisters from Guatemala, who shared a skull and
several key blood vessels, are in stable but critical condition in
the pediatric intensive care unit of UCLA's Mattel Children's
Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Monday, a team of surgeons worked for more than 22 hours
to redirect their shared veins and cover their brains, which were
exposed by separation.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors reported that the sisters have opened their eyes and
responded to stimuli such as pulling their hands away when squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   Bandages protecting the skin flaps that cover the twins' brains
have been changed and the skin looks good, said Dr. Henry Kawamoto
Jr., who led the plastic surgery team.</TE>

<LD>Passersby rescued two children and their mother after a car veered
off a road Friday and plunged 40 to 50 feet down a hillside, a fire
official said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident in the 3400 block of Coldwater Canyon Avenue occurred
about 4:30 p.m., said Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said that a boy and a girl, who appeared to be 5 to 7
years old, were thrown from the car and that the boy was pinned under
the vehicle. Authorities said neither child was in a seat belt or
child restraint.</LD>
<TE>   "Some good Samaritans saw what happened" and "extricated the boy
from under the car," Humphrey said. By the time a rescue team
arrived, the passersby had helped the three back up to the road, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The children and their mother were taken by helicopter to
County-USC Medical Center with serious but not life-threatening
injuries, Humphrey said.</TE>

<HD>Focus in Trustee Race on Reform</HD>
<DH>Election: Those running for community college board want to
prevent scandals such as one over chancellor's spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A desire to reform the troubled Ventura County Community College
District is a driving force among those seeking to become trustees in
November, including three alumni of schools in the system.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will have a chance to select three trustees to the board in
the Nov. 5 general election, which will include balloting for city
councils, school districts and special districts in Ventura County.
The general filing deadline for candidates was 5 p.m. Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Two incumbents filed for reelection to the five-member college
board, which is under fire for allowing Chancellor Philip Westin to
charge the district $119,000 in expenses over four years.</LD>
<TE>   Cheryl Heitmann, a small-business owner in Thousand Oaks, said the
financial scandal is a key reason she is running for the seat to be
vacated by board President Norman Nagel, a two-term trustee who
decided not to seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "The credibility of the district has been tarnished," Heitmann
said this week. "I think we need trustees with experience and
integrity who will put the focus back on guaranteeing our young
people an excellent education."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is elected to the board would help set policy for the
district and its 26,000 full-time students and hundreds of faculty
and staff members at Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Heitmann will run against Dan Peate, a former Moorpark College
student body president who once served as student representative to
the board of trustees. The Area 2 seat for which they are competing
represents Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Peate, 24, of Thousand Oaks, said he became increasingly motivated
to run as he learned about Westin's spending--and the board's
decision to give him a $30,000-a-year raise anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "When everything came out, I was definitely concerned about the
fiscal responsibility of the board," said Peate, an employee benefits
consultant for an insurance brokerage. "That's when I decided I would
run, because I'd really like to see some serious reform."</TE>
<TE>   Heitmann, 56, has the support of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, said union President Larry Miller. The faculty
union played a crucial role in pressuring the board to take action
against Westin, who was placed on paid administrative leave last
month. The board is currently conducting an investigation into his
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Heitmann, Peate and anyone else who wants to run for Nagel's seat
have until Wednesday to file, because under county rules, when an
incumbent chooses not to run, the deadline is extended three business
days.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Art Hernandez, 45, the Area 5 representative covering
portions of Oxnard, El Rio and Port Hueneme, is running for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes voters will appreciate his "long-term service to
Oxnard" as a proponent of Oxnard College, and his previous work on
local school boards.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they will look at how I conduct myself personally, in
regard to travel and expenses," Hernandez said. "I do very little
travel, if any."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was on the prevailing side of a 4-1 board vote in May to
extend Westin's contract and award him a 16% raise, pushing his
salary to $203,000 a year. The vote came two months after Hernandez
and his colleagues learned about Westin's spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   Some citizens became so upset by the move that they launched a
recall drive against one of the two trustees not up for reelection
this year, Al Jacobs. The other is Trustee Bob Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez now says that he made a mistake on the Westin vote. "Are
there some decisions I made that I would have changed? Yes, there
are," said Hernandez, who was elected to his seat mid-term in 2000.
"But I feel I have all the information now to make the right
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   One of his challengers will be Sylvia Munoz Schnopp of Port
Hueneme, who attended Ventura College from 1977 to 1979. The owner of
a marketing and media relations consulting company, Schnopp, 42, said
board members have no legitimate excuse for what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not doing their jobs," she said. "They should be asking
those tough questions and holding people accountable for every single
dollar spent. Where were the checks and balances for taxpayers, who
are now suffering the consequences?"</TE>
<TE>   Another Hernandez challenger will be Ron Segovia Dyste, a former
vice president at Ventura College who has the support of the faculty
union, Miller said. The third challenger is Deshay David Ford, 54, a
mental health counselor.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent John Tallman, a longtime Westin foe and the only board
member to oppose extending his contract, will run for reelection in
Area 1, which covers parts of Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme. He
will have the full support of the faculty union, Miller said.
Tallman, 71, was first elected to the board in 1994. "Tallman is a
hero," Miller said. "He's unbeatable."</TE>
<TE>   But two challengers will try to prove that wrong: David L.
Norrdin, a 43-year-old Ventura movie-theater attendant, and Mary Anne
Rooney of Oxnard, who teaches English as a second language to adults.
Rooney, 41, a former Oxnard College student body president, said she
is undeterred by Tallman's union backing and believes she can draw
the votes of those union members who think that "his time has run its
course.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been on the board for a long time," Rooney said. "That can
be a benefit and maybe hold him back in some ways, too, especially
now with the situation with Dr. Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be time for a fresh set of eyes and a fresh set of ears.
[Tallman] and I share similar views about the importance of serving
the students, and I would hope to continue that--with a fresh
approach."</TE>

<HD>15 Plead Not Guilty in Beating Death of Teen</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendants are alleged to have lain in wait and
attacked a gang member, Byron Benito, in revenge for the killing of
another man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifteen defendants, including five juveniles, pleaded not guilty
Friday to capital murder charges in the beating and fatal stabbing of
a 19-year-old gang member in Canyon Country.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe two 19-year-old defendants, Samuel Herr and
Esteban Alonso, lured their friend Byron Benito to a deserted
business park on Jan. 16, saying they wanted to smoke marijuana with
him.</LD>
<LD>   But when they arrived, Benito was attacked by more than a dozen
gang members, all from the Santa Clarita Valley, who were allegedly
seeking revenge for a killing hours earlier, Deputy Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. James Garrison said.</LD>
<TE>   Benito was beaten with fists and crowbars and stabbed 33 times,
the prosecutor said. He died of a stab wound to the lung, the coroner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Garrison said the gang members gathered in an apartment earlier
that day to grieve over the death of their friend Victor Flores, 19.
There they began talking of revenge and plotted how to get Benito
into position to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence linking Benito to the fatal shooting of
Flores, Garrison said.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the gang members selected Benito as their target
because "they viewed him as an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 15 defendants arraigned Friday, two
18-year-olds are awaiting fitness hearings in Juvenile Court,
Garrison said. And an arrest warrant was issued for Adam Rodriguez,
23, a fugitive also charged in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 18 to 1," Garrison said, describing a chaotic fight scene
in a vacant parking lot off Sierra Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Three defendants, including Katherine Henson, 21, the only woman
involved, also were stabbed in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Manrique, 19, was accidentally stabbed six times in the
back, allegedly by co-defendant Mario Aguillon, 15, who also suffered
stab wounds, Garrison said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the defendants, including Rodriguez, have been charged with
murder with the special circumstance of lying in wait and conspiracy
to commit murder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not yet determined whether they will seek the
death penalty against the adult defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, the juveniles who will be tried as adults are
ineligible for the death penalty but could face life in prison
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   All of the defendants, except Rodriguez, were in custody awaiting
trial. Garrison said they are all gang members except Herr and
Alonso.</TE>
<TE>   The other defendants are John Jimenez, 15; Daniel Carrillo, Jose
Jimenez and Alberto Mondragon, all 18; John Perez Romero, Jose De
Jesus Rodriguez, Robert Moreno and Tony Villasenor, all 20; Randy
Franco, 21; and Alfredo Hernandez, 22.</TE>

<HD>Residents in Dark After City Error</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents of a Chatsworth neighborhood have been in the dark since
March, when the city of Los Angeles shut off their street lights
after realizing it had failed to charge them for service since
President Richard Nixon's first year in office.</LD>
<LD>   The lights may be turned back on in a matter of days if residents
agree to pay current and future charges, a Department of Public Works
official said.</LD>
<LD>   The department's Bureau of Street Lighting realized its mistake in
February 2001. In March of this year it asked the residents of 73
homes to pay retroactively for three years of operating and
maintaining the lights, said Stan Horwitz, manager of the community
services division for the bureau. He called the request normal city
policy.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 42 residents who responded by written ballot, only 18 said
they were willing to pay. The street lights were then turned off.</TE>
<TE>   When the city offered a compromise, in which only current and
future charges were to be paid, some residents signed a petition
endorsing it. City officials say they would turn the lights back on
if a majority of the residents agreed to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Demanding retroactive payment for lighting since 1969 was
impractical, Horwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel that it's not their fault and they shouldn't have to
pay. And I can't argue with that."</TE>
<TE>   The error was discovered when a public works employee was drawing
maps for a new lighting district and couldn't find the Chatsworth
area's street light tax assessments on record, Horwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The street light tax is between $80 and $130 per household a year.
The amount was easy to overlook, because it is such a small fraction
of the department's revenue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell by looking at it that these particular lights
aren't being paid for," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn requested that public works officials turn the
street lights back on as quickly as possible, a spokesman said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   For safety reasons, residents asked that the streets affected not
be named.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan Lynn, 13, said his parents won't let him go out after dark.</TE>
<TE>   "The only good time is at nighttime because it's so hot during the
day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But his parents won't let him go to the skate park because they
"don't want me getting kidnapped."</TE>
<TE>   Jared Weintraub, 15, said, "It's really dark. You can't really go
outside to do anything, unless you have a flashlight."</TE>
<TE>   Judy Lebid, who has lived in the area with her husband for five
years, said she and neighbors always keep their porch lights on to
brighten the street at night.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, some areas are pretty dark.</TE>
<TE>   Lebid said that she was one of the minority of residents willing
to pay the three years in back taxes for lights and that she hopes
for a resolution to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people do not have lights, and it's not their choice," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Water District's Chief Won't Run</HD>
<DH>Elections: He bows out of race after conflict-of- interest
allegations. Many races are crowded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Water District President Jerry King said Friday that he
won't seek reelection to a second term after allegations of a
conflict of interest were lodged against him this week.</LD>
<LD>   King, a vice president of Psomas &amp; Associates in Costa Mesa, said
he didn't want "to get into the gutter" with critics who say he
shouldn't have met in an official capacity with Chino officials about
an annexation affecting district land because his firm is being paid
by the same city to push the project.</LD>
<LD>   King said Friday that he plans to continue working on
water-quality, environmental and recreation projects as a volunteer.
"There are a lot of things I want to finish that I don't need to be
an elected official to do," he said.</LD>
<TE>   About half a dozen candidates have filed to run for the seat to
which King was elected in 1998. The filing period will stay open for
five more days because King, as the incumbent, chose not to seek
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Friday was the filing deadline for candidates for all seats in
Orange County, except in races in which the incumbent is not running,
which extends the filing period.</TE>
<TE>   Several city races around the county feature well-known
candidates, adding local drama to the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle, now a local
lobbyist, is running for mayor against Anaheim Councilwoman Lucille
Kring and former La Habra Police Chief Steve Staveley.</TE>
<TE>   Though the seat is nonpartisan, Republicans and Democrats are
watching the race. Staveley, a Democrat, most recently was director
of the state attorney general's Division of Law Enforcement. The
other two candidates are Republicans. The mayor for eight years has
been Tom Daly, a Democrat, who is in a runoff race for county clerk
in November with Irvine attorney Bruce Peotter.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim council races, six candidates will vie for two seats:
Richard Chavez, Stephen Eichler, Manny Ontiveros, Robert Flores,
James Mills and Robert McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has 13 candidates competing for four council seats,
including two--one of whom is incumbent Miguel A. Pulido--running for
mayor. City officials said they would not release the final list of
names until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   And in Huntington Beach, the deadline for filing was extended
until 5 p.m. Wednesday after incumbent City Councilwoman Grace
Winchell failed to file for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven candidates have filed papers so far for four available
seats, according to City Clerk Connie Brockway. In addition, she
said, two candidates--Jennifer McGrath and Alan Leigh Armstrong--have
filed for the office of city attorney, which Gail Hutton is vacating
after 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   More than 160 candidates filed for 42 school board races around
the county. And more than 140 candidates filed for 37 seats with
various special districts.</TE>

<HD>Vatican Excommunicates 'Ordained' Women</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY POLK</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>The Vatican's powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has
excommunicated seven women ordained as priests by a bishop who has
broken with the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   The congregation said it acted after receiving no response to a
formal warning, which it issued July 10, giving the women 12 days to
acknowledge that their ordinations were "invalid and null," repent
and ask forgiveness.</LD>
<LD>   A decree of excommunication, signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,
head of the Vatican body that safeguards the church's doctrine of
faith and morals, said the women had failed to "give any indication
or amendment or repentance for the most serious offense they
committed."</LD>
<TE>   But, the decree said, the congregation hopes that the women "may
rediscover the path of conversion in order to return to the unity of
the faith and to communion with the church, which they have wounded
by their actions."</TE>
<TE>   Under the church's Code of Canon Law, an excommunicated Catholic
is excluded from the church and may not celebrate or receive the
sacraments or exercise any authority in the church.</TE>
<TE>   The women--four Austrians, two Germans and one believed to be an
American--did not respond publicly to the congregation's warning, but
the two U.S. groups that support the ordination of women--Future
Church and Call to Action--spoke in their defense.</TE>
<TE>   "If women and mothers had been integrated into our church's
decision-making structures, we would not have the clergy sexual abuse
scandal that we have today," said Linda Pieczynski, former president
of Call to Action.</TE>
<TE>   The women, Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Theresia
Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris Muller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and
Angela White, all former theology students in Linz, Austria, were
ordained June 29 by Bishop Romulo Antonio Braschi of Argentina in a
ceremony on the Danube River.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican agency called Braschi "a schismatic" and said "he has
already incurred excommunication." Braschi left the Roman Catholic
Church to found the 13,000-member Catholic Apostolic Charismatic
Church of Jesus King.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican says Jesus established the tradition of a male
priesthood by choosing only men as his apostles. It has urged women
to model their role on that of the Virgin Mary.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation cited the 1994 apostolic letter Ordinatio
Sacerdotalis (Priestly Ordination), in which Pope John Paul II said
that "the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly
ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitely held
by all the church's faithful."</TE>
<TE>   "For this reason," the Vatican agency said, "the above-mentioned
'priestly ordination' constitutes the simulation of a sacrament and
is thus invalid and null as well as constituting a grave offense to
the divine constitution of the church."</TE>

<HD>Foiled Club Gets Pointed in the Right Direction</HD>
<DH>Sports: Beverly Hills fencers find new space to practice.
Now they're something of a hit at a Westside mall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get right to the point, the Beverly Hills fencers were homeless.</LD>
<LD>   So when they were foiled in their attempt to hold sword fights in
their hometown, they shopped for a new home in an unlikely place: a
retail mall.</LD>
<LD>   That's the thrust of how the Beverly Hills Fencers' Club ended up
in a storefront in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-year-old club was squeezed out of its longtime headquarters
at a Santa Monica Boulevard recreation center earlier this year when
its practice space was cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   The fencers were forced to tote their blades between borrowed
workout spaces as they grappled with the high cost of Westside rents.</TE>
<TE>   "We have members from Fullerton to Westlake Village. We were
looking for a place that would be convenient to all," Kevin Walker,
the club's secretary, who is a graphics company executive and lives
in Santa Clarita, said of the unexpected displacement.</TE>
<TE>   "For months we were moving from one temporary space to another,
sometimes on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   One practice stop was a meeting room at the Westside Pavilion at
Pico and Westwood boulevards. Shopping center operators rent the
space for community group engagements.</TE>
<TE>   Roomy and close to a freeway, the site seemed perfect to the
swordsmen. So they advanced the idea of renting it long term and
establishing the club headquarters there.</TE>
<TE>   Mall operators parried that the space was often booked by local
organizations and was unavailable for full-time use by any one group.</TE>
<TE>   Reluctant to disengage, club members asked about the availability
of empty storefronts at the open-air western end of the mall. They
wouldn't mind practicing in the display windows in front of shoppers,
the fencers pledged.</TE>
<TE>   Even though fencing is hardly the mall's forte, officials there
agreed to take a chance. They offered a 2,000-square-foot former shoe
store to the nonprofit club for a cut rate of less than $4,000 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   The swordsmen lunged at the deal. They installed a bouncy,
3/4-inch plywood covering over the shop's tile floor to protect their
knees, hung retractable wiring harnesses from its ceiling to
electrically tally points scored when their epees touch opponents'
metallic vests, and moved in four months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, prices haven't been the only things slashed at the
mall.</TE>
<TE>   The flashing blades draw a steady stream of shoppers who stop to
peer through the display windows at club members and fencing students
spending hours honing their croise and prise de fer skills.</TE>
<TE>   The fencers play it to the hilt for their audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We sometimes feel like fish in a bowl, but it doesn't bother us,"
said Allison Brain, a competitor from Pasadena. "Sometimes there are
dozens of people watching us. Not many people have seen fencing, so
it's good for them to see what the sport is."</TE>
<TE>   This week, former Russian five-time world champion fencer
Alexander Romankov and countryman Boris Koretski, an Olympic gold
medalist, are helping teach at the club. They are working with club
coach Misha Itkin--a Brentwood resident who was their coach in 1988
when they made headlines by running doubles around their competition.</TE>
<TE>   "They were surprised by the setting," Itkin said as youngsters in
the class noisily leaped across the storefront practicing their
ballestra attack movements.</TE>
<TE>   Along with pounding feet, the session was punctuated with whoops
and the cracking sound of swords being whacked on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs neighbor Veronica Padilla, assistant manager of Shapes,
a women's boutique, said she has learned to live with the noise from
the salle, or fencing clubhouse. "We just turn up our music," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some fencers have become customers.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get here early, Shapes is where I go," said 15-year-old
student Tara Chang of Santa Monica--who was attired in a
less-than-stylish mesh foil mask and metallic lame  scoring jacket
for her lesson with Romankov and Koretski.</TE>
<TE>   The location has turned into a hit with parents too. Christopher
Kim drives 75 miles to deliver daughter Samantha, 12, and son Isaac,
14, to and from three-hour practice sessions four days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we spend so much time here, we do most of our shopping
here," said Kim, owner of a Westlake Village plumbing company.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest advantage of a shopping mall piste, or fencing field
of play, is the educational value it has for passersby, club members
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from India, so, culturally, seeing this is a big surprise,"
said one shopper, Narayan Khanna, a filmmaker who stopped to watch
club member Lauren Walker whack her opponent's blade with a grazing
froissement movement.</TE>
<TE>   "But I guess you can find anything in a mall in America."</TE>
<TE>   Touche.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 9, Undergoes Rare Double Transplant</HD>
<DH>Surgery: Anies Garcia is the country's second child under
10 to receive a new heart and kidney at the same time. She is
recovering nicely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fate is finally starting to smile on Anies Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   The 9-year-old has been on dialysis since she was 3, and this year
her heart started to fail following an unsuccessful kidney
transplant.</LD>
<LD>   But after UCLA paid for the surgeries and the parents of an
8-year-old boy donated his organs, the Whittier girl left Mattel
Children's Hospital on Friday the country's second child younger than
10 to have a kidney-heart transplant.</LD>
<TE>   In the hours before her mother took her home, Anies constantly
snacked--on grapes, crackers slathered with peanut butter, her
mother's yogurt--and glued school photos inside a dozen thank-you
cards for the herd of doctors and nurses who contributed their time.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said the girl's 10-day recovery time since the July 30
surgery was remarkable, recalling how just 16 hours after the
procedure was finished she gobbled down a bowl of tapioca pudding.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurt the first day, but I'm OK now," said Anies, eyes wide
below a fringe of long lashes. "I'm happy to go home."</TE>
<TE>   Anies, who was born with nonfunctioning kidneys, has been in and
out of the UCLA hospital about 70 times since she was born, said her
mother, Patty Mata, a Walgreen's cashier.</TE>
<TE>   The kidney from her first transplant five years ago failed less
than 12 hours after it was inserted, and she never was taken off
dialysis. Her heart weakened in the following years to the point that
it would take both a heart and kidney transplant for her to live.</TE>
<TE>   She was on Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance for low-income
people, which will not fund transplants if patients require more than
one to survive. Medi-Cal declined to cover the procedure because it
is still considered experimental, doctors and Anies' mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to contribute in some way to her operation, Anies sold
beaded bracelets she made from her bed in the intensive care unit,
netting about $70 from doctors and nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "Anies is just such a piece of work," said Dr. Robert Ettenger,
head of the pediatric transplant program. "This is a kid who was on
constant minute-to-minute monitoring, making bracelets while we have
to recognize the unmitigated horror that she might die before our
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Anies is the eighth child younger than 18 to undergo a
kidney-heart transplant. The youngest, an 8-year-old, is still alive
after undergoing the procedure in October 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Ettenger said he was near tears when he asked hospital director
Dr. Michael Karpf if UCLA, which performed her first transplant,
would donate the second procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no hesitation to say yes," Karpf said. "Here is a young
lady who is at death's door and doesn't have time to hassle about
payment. You take care of somebody for nine years, you don't abandon
them when they need you."</TE>
<TE>   Mata said the luck surrounding the procedure--finding a donor
within two weeks of signing up on the transplant list, the speed of
the procedure and rapid recovery--probably comes from years of
patience that their prayers would be answered. Rearing a child with
Anies' medical problems has forced both Mata, 24, and her daughter to
mature more quickly than usual.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to raise this medically fragile child at 15," Mata
said. "It would be overwhelming for anybody, but it forced me and
Anies to grow up together, really fast."</TE>
<TE>   Anies understands that no matter how good she feels now, she will
be vulnerable to health problems for the rest of her life. Her
doctors say each organ will last from eight to 12 years, making
future transplants a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Also, she must take 15 medications daily, some of which are
essential to keep her body from rejecting the donated organs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the girl has her future mapped out, starting with dressing
up as Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz" for Halloween and finishing
with a career as a doctor--"I don't know which kind. The medical
kind."</TE>
<TE>   Her pink-sandaled feet dangling from the bed, she enjoyed shaking
back her waist-length mane of dark crimped hair, twisted at the top
with purple butterfly clips. Doctors and her mother laughed at how
much more outgoing she has become since the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote a letter to her mother detailing her plans for her first
weekend at home.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get out of here we're going to get our hair and nails
done," she wrote in a round, childish hand. "Then we're going to the
mall and spend lots of money on clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother laughed. "It's nice to hear her being demanding. It
shows she's definitely feeling better."</TE>

cuts, the Davis administration is refusing to forward county
supervisors' request for a federal bailout until they reconsider
plans to close 11 clinics and end inpatient services at High Desert
Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors made those reductions in June in the hopes of spurring
the federal government to provide $1.4 billion to the troubled
Department of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   But the request for federal money must go through the state, and
California's top health official informed county officials Thursday
that the state will not forward it until the county holds additional
meetings and explains how it will protect patient access to care in
its smaller system.</LD>
<TE>   "I think there is opportunity to sit together and put more thought
into it," Dr. Diana Bonta, director of the state Department of Health
Services, said in an interview Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta and Grantland Johnson, secretary of California's Health and
Human Services Agency, also raised another concern--that the county's
request could complicate the state's negotiations with the Bush
administration over a wide array of health financing matters.</TE>
<TE>   Under discussion are policies ranging from Washington's proposal
to cap Medicaid reimbursement to the extension of a waiver that
permits California to send additional dollars to hospitals and trauma
centers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has indicated that it wants to deal with
all of the issues at once. Health officials say that could open up
the possibility of the federal government forcing the state to assist
Los Angeles at a time when California faces a $23-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The state's refusal to forward the bailout proposal brought groans
from county officials, who made the cuts in June over stringent
objections from health advocates and organized labor. Supervisors
argued that they needed to begin trimming the department immediately,
in part to convince Washington that they deserved another bailout.</TE>
<TE>   This would be the third bailout in seven years from Washington.
The county faces an $800-million deficit in two years because the
latest of those bailouts--approved in 2000--dwindles every year.</TE>
<TE>   County leaders, who have been discussing the bailout proposal with
state officials for weeks, accused the Davis administration of using
"delaying tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "The state is stalling us," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who
complained that his calls to Gov. Gray Davis have gone unanswered for
three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a health-care crisis in California that is not unlike
the energy crisis a couple of years ago," said Yaroslavsky, who last
month proposed a $168-million parcel tax to fund emergency rooms.
"The governor and his administration are going to have to suck it up
and try to deal with it now, or it is going to be a millstone hung
around all our throats."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Leaf, the chief operating officer of the county's health
department, said the situation needs to be resolved as soon as
possible because his agency needs to know whether it is getting the
bailout or must make another round of cuts.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said that the county needs to look at other ways
of saving money. Bonta, for example, said some public health agencies
elsewhere have moved their staff into private medical facilities to
avoid paying overhead.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said Los Angeles appears to be reversing course on
reforms it promised in order to secure its first two federal bailouts
in 1995 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, the county pledged to expand outpatient care, but is
now scaling back that type of care by shuttering the 11 clinics and
cutting contracts with private providers by 25%. "This is a radical
departure," Johnson said. "It is not a mere tweaking of the
arrangement. It is a wholesale shift in policy."</TE>
<TE>   County health officials defended their plans, saying it was the
best way to shrink the department and preserve as many services as
possible. They are planning a far deeper round of cuts should they
fail to secure the bailout by October.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said that it is hard to cut
hospitals in the sprawling county, but noted that the next round of
reductions includes closing emergency rooms at two hospitals. She
said that the state's delay makes dealing with that next step even
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't sound good," Burke said. "But we will keep talking and
trying to work it out."</TE>

thermometers topped 100 degrees in the San Fernando and San Gabriel
valleys. High readings Friday included 105 in Chatsworth, 102 in
Northridge and 101 in Van Nuys, Burbank and Pomona. The National
Weather Service said the valleys could experience readings of 100 or
more through next week because of a dome of high pressure blocking
coastal air from reaching inland areas. Meanwhile, at the Santa

<HD>County Jobless Rate Climbs in July</HD>
<DH>Economy: Losses in two sectors--agriculture and
government--cause unemployment to rise to 5.3%. An expert says the
region is still faring well despite the slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County job growth ground to a halt last month and
unemployment rose sharply as a slow march toward economic recovery
stalled, new state figures show.</LD>
<LD>   A loss of 2,400 farm jobs, reflecting a typical decline at the end
of the harvest season, drove county employment down to 303,300,
compared with a historic high of 308,500 two months earlier. It also
pushed local joblessness up to 5.3%, compared with 4.8% in June and
January's peak of 5.5%.</LD>
<LD>   California's unemployment rate in July was 6.6% and the U.S. rate
was 6.0%, without seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Schniepp, director of California Economic Forecast in Santa
Barbara, said Ventura County is holding steady on its path toward
full economic health.</TE>
<TE>   July's jobless rate was the second lowest for the month in the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ventura County, the numbers are not as robust as we thought
they'd be, but they're not that far out of line," Schniepp said. "We
don't see a double-dip recession. We just need to relax. We're used
to having everything all at once. But just be patient."</TE>
<TE>   Except for agriculture, government was the only employment sector
to lose jobs last month.</TE>
<TE>   Government employment declined by 900 jobs, while construction
grew by 300, retail by 200 and transportation and public utilities by
100.</TE>
<TE>   The 5.3% unemployment rate for July compares with 5.0% a year ago,
as the recession was beginning and before the Sept. 11 attacks sent
the economy into a tailspin. The number of jobless workers rose by
1,000 from a year ago to 22,600. Total jobs in the county dropped by
700 in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Of local cities, the three with the most farm worker residents had
the highest jobless rates: 8.4% in Santa Paula, 7.5% in Oxnard and
7.3% in Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   The white-collar east county had the lowest rate, with Moorpark
the lowest at 4.0%. Ojai, where one-fifth of the residents are senior
citizens, had a 2.7% rate.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's unemployment rate was tied for 17th best of 58
counties in the state, and on par with the rest of Southern
California, which has weathered the recession far better than the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County had a jobless rate of 7.3% in July and Santa
Barbara County's was 3.5%.</TE>

<HD>The Kosher Kitchen Is a Hit at Caltech</HD>
<DH>Tradition: Campus facility attracts not just Jewish
students, but Muslims, staffers and area workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years ago, Caltech officials were trying to lure a promising
high school senior who was also being courted by Ivy League schools.
Professors and administrators were all set to impress the prospect
with Caltech's academic resources. But the student's parents raised
an unexpected concern about sending their daughter to the Pasadena
school for four years: What could she eat?</LD>
<LD>   The young woman, who was Jewish, kept a kosher diet, and Caltech
had no kosher meal plan. Not only was there no kosher food on campus,
but the neighborhood has no kosher restaurants or grocery stores. So
Caltech, a school with the means to spend what it takes to solve a
problem, took a bold step: It built a kosher kitchen and hired a
full-time chef--all before that student showed up for classes.</LD>
<LD>   The new facility quickly became popular with other Jewish students
and Caltech staff. But it evolved in a surprising way: Muslims on
campus also began to take the kosher meals to adhere to their own
similar religious dietary requirements.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Caltech offers both kosher meals and halal dishes for
Muslims. The meal program has also tapped into a previously unmet
demand for religiously appropriate prepared meals beyond the cozy
2,000-student campus. Workers from nearby office buildings regularly
stop in for lunch, and Caltech provides kosher and halal meals for
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and two Pasadena private schools.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Caltech has been contracted by USC and UCLA to
establish kosher and halal meal programs at those campuses. Like
Caltech, those universities "don't want little things to stop people
from coming to their schools," said Joel Weinberger, the kosher chef
Caltech hired to start the program.</TE>
<TE>   In another sign of growing interest in upholding religious
standards for food, California in July enacted a law making it a
crime to fraudulently label meat "halal," just as earlier laws
outlawed phony kosher labeling.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger said he was attracted by Caltech's willingness to spend
whatever was necessary to maintain kosher dietary rules, which
require the separation of dairy ingredients from meat and set
standards for the killing and handling of animals. His kitchen is
kept locked to ensure it is not used for non-kosher meals.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the interest from off-campus, Weinberger said that on
some days he serves only about a dozen kosher meals. The program "is
not about money," he said. "It's to serve students."</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger, who has degrees in both restaurant management and
Jewish law, sought from the beginning to use the kosher program to
serve as broad a population as possible. When the kosher kitchen
opened, he also started a vegetarian meal program, since his kosher
setup made it easy to cook without using animal products.</TE>
<TE>   In his first month on the job, Weinberger said, he began asking
Muslim students how he could help them with halal meals. Kosher
restrictions generally go beyond halal requirements. Pork is
forbidden by both, but there is no ban on shellfish in halal rules as
there is under kosher limits.</TE>
<TE>   For most Muslim students, the kosher meals were acceptable, since
they did not contain pork and God's name is invoked in the slaughter
of kosher meats. Because halal rules prohibit the use of alcohol,
Weinberger does not use cooking wine.</TE>
<TE>   "A kosher kitchen generally surpasses any halal requirements,"
said Mahmoud Abdel-Baset, religious and social services coordinator
for the Islamic Center of Southern California. While acknowledging
some Muslims hold to more conservative standards, Abdel-Baset said he
and other Muslims eat kosher meats. In 1999, Weinberger invited
Abdel-Baset to view Caltech's kitchen. Abdel-Baset wrote a letter
affirming that the "ingredients and cooking facility are free from
any Islamically unlawful components," an endorsement posted on the
refrigerator door. Weinberger is now trying to find a way to
accommodate Muslim students with stricter requirements, such as those
who believe their meat must be slaughtered by a Muslim. Such meat
would not be kosher, and thus could not be prepared with the same
pots and utensils used for the kosher food, Weinberger said. He is
considering buying halal meat and having another staffer prepare it
in the non-kosher kitchen. "We're always trying to find the highest
common denominator," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Simon, a Caltech math professor who helped start the kosher
program, said he never expected the school to offer kosher food
because of its small size. "If a year before we started this you had
told me we would have kosher food, I would have fallen on the floor
laughing. It just didn't seem to be an economically viable
alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a professor at Caltech since 1981, said he thought it would
have been acceptable for students who require kosher food to live off
campus, where they could prepare their own meals, or to have kosher
food brought in from outside. But he said Thomas Mannion, who heads
the department overseeing Caltech's food service, told him, " 'That's
second-class and not acceptable.' Tom was adamant to not let food be
a decisive factor" for a student considering Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   The meal program has also enhanced campus life for Caltech's
faculty and staff, since meetings with colleagues over meals can now
accommodate everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Caltech's program also is a valuable community service, said Issac
Berkovits, who works at the nearby Indy Mac Bank on South Lake
Avenue. On a recent afternoon, Berkovits and half a dozen bank
colleagues, including Orthodox Jews and a Muslim, enjoyed a lunch of
steak, chicken and vegetables at Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   Berkovits, who lives in West Los Angeles, said that when he began
working in Pasadena two years ago, he was shocked to find no kosher
restaurants in the area. He learned of Caltech's kosher program one
day last year when he was searching the Internet for places to eat.
Berkovits said he had been bringing food from home or eating at
Baskin-Robbins.</TE>

<HD>Woodrow Mann Sr., 85; Mayor of Little Rock Sought Troops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Woodrow Wilson Mann Sr., who as mayor of Little Rock, Ark., urged
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to protect
black students during the desegregation crisis at Central High School
in 1957, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Mann died Tuesday in Houston of complications from a stroke he
suffered a few years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In what has been called the most volatile state-federal conflict
since the Civil War, Little Rock became a battleground for the 1954
U.S. Supreme Court ruling that held that segregation in public
schools was unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   "If this be the law," Gov. Orval E. Faubus said after Arkansas'
schools were ordered desegregated, "then every state in this Union is
nothing more than a vassal state to the central government."</TE>
<TE>   In a fairly transparent effort to stop the desegregation efforts,
Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard in early September,
claiming that "caravans" of segregationists were planning to disrupt
the entrance of the first black students at Central High School. But
Mann said that local police could have handled any unrest. If trouble
erupts, Mann said, "the blame rests squarely at the doorstep of the
governor's mansion."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 4, the day integration was to begin at the 1,900-student
campus, the guardsmen prevented the black students from entering
Central High.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mann never supported classroom integration, he later
wrote that he was bound to uphold the law. He urged Faubus to
withdraw the guardsmen.</TE>
<TE>   "Place the people of Arkansas once again on the path of compliance
with law and order," Mann urged Faubus in a formal message Sept. 17,
as national guardsmen continued to keep the black students out of
Central High.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, a judge granted NAACP lawyers an injunction that
prevented Faubus from using the National Guard to prevent the black
students from entering the high school. The governor removed the
guardsmen. At Mann's request, 50 state policemen were mobilized for
duty around Central High School and barricades were installed at both
ends of the street in front of the school.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 23, with state and local police standing guard, the black
students walked up the steps and into the building as a jeering crowd
of several hundred whites, some throwing rocks, threatened to rush
the school.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, with police unsure they could control the mob
outside the school, the black students were led out a back entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Mann sent Eisenhower a telegram asking for federal
troops to maintain order at the high school:</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate need for federal troops is urgent.... I am pleading
to you as President of the United States in the interest of humanity,
law and order, and the cause of democracy worldwide to provide the
necessary federal troops within several hours."</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower deployed 1,100 members of the Army's 101st Airborne
Division to Little Rock.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 25, with Army troops escorting them, the nine black
students again entered Central High School.</TE>
<TE>   Mann paid a heavy price for his stand, as did his family.</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters during the crisis that he had received threats
on his life because of his criticism of Faubus' action.</TE>
<TE>   Mann's son Woodrow Mann Jr., who was in his senior year at the
school, recalled the hate mail and the burned crosses.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed that regardless of his personal viewpoint on the
issue, as mayor, he had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of
the United States," Woodrow Mann Jr. told the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It was," he added, "a stand that was extremely unpopular with the
majority of Arkansas segregationists."</TE>
<TE>   Born Nov. 13, 1916 in Little Rock, the senior Mann attended the
University of Illinois on a music scholarship. After graduating, he
worked for a time at an insurance company in Chicago. During World
War II, he served on the staff of Adm. Chester Nimitz in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Arkansas after the war and worked in the insurance
business, which he continued to do after being elected mayor in 1956.
But his stand on Faubus' tactics and the city's decision to switch
from a mayor-council system to a manager-council form of city
government cost him his job in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   His stand also ruined his insurance business, his son told The
Times on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was elected mayor he had the largest independent
insurance agency in the state," he said. "When his term was over he
was basically out of business because he had lost [most of] his
clientele."</TE>
<TE>   Mann left Little Rock in 1959 and moved first to Dallas and then
to Houston, where he continued his insurance and mortgage banking
business until retiring in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   His son said his father rarely discussed the Central High crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very tough for him to recall," he said. "He was a native
Arkansan who loved the state of Arkansas. He felt he did what he was
required to do. Basically, he was vilified by the people in his home
state as a result of his stand.</TE>
<TE>   "It changed his entire life and he was very bitter about it until
the end of his life."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Mann is survived by a brother, Harold, of
Knoxville, Tenn.; two sisters, Freddie Schroeder of Houston and
Catherine Boyd of Little Rock; five grandchildren; and three
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Seeks a Reconciliation With O.C.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider
special rules the county would be required to follow to do business
again with Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm blamed for helping cause
the county's 1994 financial collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer's proposal would require the board to sign
off on each job Merrill Lynch handles for the county--a level of
oversight not required of any other Wall Street firm.</LD>
<LD>   This is not punishment but a form of protection for county funds,
Spitzer said. Merrill Lynch in recent months has been pursuing
renewed business with the county and other local agencies. If it
wants county business, Spitzer said, the firm must do it publicly at
a hearing.</LD>
<TE>   The supervisor noted that Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest
brokerage firm, has been accused of misleading investors in the Enron
scandal. In May, the firm agreed to pay $100 million and change some
of its research policies to settle charges by the New York attorney
general that Merrill Lynch analysts gave investors bad advice.
Merrill Lynch denies any wrongdoing in the Enron case.</TE>
<TE>   The county's investment policy--developed after the bankruptcy--is
silent on whether county departments can use Merrill Lynch's
services. Merrill Lynch officials have said they are eager to renew
ties with the county and have held talks with county Chief Financial
Officer Gary Burton and Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be interested in doing business at some point with the
county," said Bill Halldin, a Merrill Lynch spokesman. "We do think
that we could add competition for the county's business, and our
being in that competitive mix would benefit the county in terms of
the bids it would be able to get."</TE>
<TE>   Some county sources suggested that the proposal involved an issue
of control between Moorlach, who warned about financial problems
before the bankruptcy, and Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said, through spokesman Brett Barbre, "We're not
interested in contributing to supervisor Spitzer's media quota for
the day."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County lost $1.7 billion in its financial collapse. In
1998, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay the county $420 million to settle a
lawsuit alleging that the company encouraged former county Treasurer
Robert L. Citron to make risky investments that violated state law.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also paid a $30-million fine levied by the Orange County
district attorney's office to resolve a potential criminal case.</TE>

<HD>Caring for Addicts' Children</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Officer Sue Webber-Brown has police and social
agencies working together to help kids caught in raids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OROVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Moving quietly past piles of rotting garbage and empty soda cans, Sue
Webber-Brown and eight other members of a special narcotics unit
wince at the stench outside the dingy duplex apartment.</LD>
<LD>   It will top 100 degrees today in this dusty little town on the
Feather River, and the heat already is cooking an enormous trash heap
left by the mother inside, a methamphetamine addict.</LD>
<LD>   Gun in hand, tall and hefty in her police battle garb,
Webber-Brown can look formidable. But it's another side--one of her
colleagues calls her "mother to the world"--that has brought her here
today.</LD>
<TE>   She has a way of putting people at ease and a passion for helping
children, colleagues say. For Webber-Brown, this is more a rescue
mission than a drug bust. There are two children inside the
apartment--a 15-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. She and her
colleagues on the Butte County Interagency Narcotics Task Force are
here to take them away.</TE>
<TE>   A revolution in drug enforcement philosophy started in Butte
County 11 years ago, and Webber-Brown has become its national leader.
The idea was simple: The children found during drug raids are more
important than the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of this tiny county north of Sacramento,
programs for children endangered by drugs now exist in dozens of law
enforcement and child welfare agencies around the state and nation.
In most, a social worker works with police, often going along on
raids to provide immediate attention and care for children
traumatized by seeing their parents being taken away in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Before this, children in drug cases were often an afterthought.
Police and prosecutors focused primarily on seizing drugs and cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing police wanted to deal with, traditionally, was the
kids," Webber-Brown says. "They'd turn them over to grandparents or
friends, and they'd be back with their drug-addict parents in days."</TE>
<TE>   But that won't be the case on this day. Webber-Brown is focusing
on the apartment's drab green front door and what she is likely to
find on the other side. She is an investigator for the Butte County
district attorney's office. With her are police from state and local
agencies, a child services worker, a probation officer and a
prosecutor. If they find what they believe is there, the children
will be in foster care before the sun is down.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a mother who has been a methamphetamine addict for
years," she says. "Lately she has been selling her daughter's dolls
and their TV and Nintendo games for drugs."</TE>
<TE>   It's not difficult to know how Webber-Brown's empathy for these
children was born. She came up the hard way in Oroville, raised by a
"dysfunctional family" living in a trailer. During high school, she
worked three jobs. Afterward, she spent years trying to figure out
what to do.</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, however, it had begun to come together. She had her
second husband, her third child and the job she had been seeking for
years--as an investigator for Dist. Atty. Michael Ramsey on Butte
County's drug task force.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Butte County had one of the biggest
methamphetamine problems in the nation for a rural county. And it
still does. Outlaw biker gangs had set up major meth labs here, then
mom-and-pop operations run by addicts had taken over.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I had worked for, the task force," Webber-Brown
recalls. "On the raids, we'd be seeing these babies lying in their
own feces, in their own urine. Being a hormonal new mother, it became
my whole life.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in law enforcement was focusing on the children," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Husband Signs On</TE>
<TE>   Her first convert was her husband, Mitch Brown, now Oroville's
police chief. Working on a master's degree, he wrote his thesis on
the toxic dangers of meth labs. The report helped increase both state
use of child endangerment laws and awareness of long-term
environmental threats of methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Webber-Brown also had a friend who shared her feelings. Lisa Fey
Williams was a Butte County social worker then. The two women worked
to bridge the large gulf of distrust between police and social
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of social workers and police joining hands began to
spread, "at first, very slowly for years. Then it started picking up
some steam," says Webber-Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Now she has led training sessions for 12,000 social workers and
law enforcement officials across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Seven California counties have received state funding
intermittently in recent years, and two dozen others are trying to
launch their own programs for drug-endangered children programs.
Fifteen states already have received training, and half dozen have
programs running.</TE>
<TE>   But Webber-Brown is frustrated that the movement hasn't spread
even more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of program should be everywhere by now," she says. "If
you walk into a house and hit a bad guy with every charge you can,
why not add child endangerment? Most people still don't get it."</TE>
<TE>   The 15-year-old boy is terrified as the officers burst into the
living room, and he somehow manages to slip out the front door,
running and crying to a neighbor across the street. An officer
retrieves him after he has calmed down.</TE>
<TE>   His 12-year-old sister takes it all much more tranquilly. She
finishes a bath as if it's just the Avon lady calling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she has probably numbed herself to everything, because of
all that has happened in her life," says Heather Cowin , a child
services representative.</TE>
<TE>   Webber-Brown is in the living room, keeping one eye on the mother
while Cmdr. Keith Krampitz, with the state Department of Justice,
supervises a quick search. Almost immediately, as official reports
will later note, the officers spot a small packet of what turns out
to be high-grade methamphetamine on a living-room shelf, within easy
reach of the children.</TE>
<TE>   The mother reaches for a cigarette as the search progresses.
Webber-Brown tells her she can have a cigarette outside if she would
like.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the two women talk. Webber-Brown is holding a tape
recorder, and her real purpose is to gather admissions about both
drug use and child endangerment. Within a few minutes she has what
she needs. The mother also agrees to speak to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "My children mean the world to me," she says. "I've been wanting
to give it up for a while.... I have no problems with stopping. I've
stopped before."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Webber-Brown says, the 12-year-old girl has been molested
by her grandfather, and the boy has been physically abused by a
boyfriend of his mother.</TE>
<TE>   The mother will be arrested on charges of possession of illegal
drugs and child endangerment, Webber-Brown tells her. They will be
taking her away now and placing her children in foster care.</TE>
<TE>   Then she pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to say goodbye to your children now?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Could I have another cigarette first?" the mother replies.</TE>
<TE>   Though Butte County started its Drug Endangered Children program
in 1991, it wasn't formalized until two years later. And it wasn't
until 1999 that similar programs were receiving state money in six
other counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, San
Bernardino and Shasta.</TE>
<TE>   Despite sporadic funding, two dozen California counties have
joined the seven receiving state money in trying to establish similar
programs. The initial focus was on meth labs, where explosions, fires
and constant exposure to large batches of toxic chemicals were among
the dangers. But some counties have broadened their focus beyond
manufacturers to chronic meth users.</TE>
<TE>   857 Children Taken</TE>
<TE>   Since the Butte County task force formally set up operations, 857
children have been taken from 401 homes and meth labs. Webber-Brown
estimates that fewer than 20% are reunited with their parents,
compared with more than 50% of children who return to families
statewide in child welfare cases.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say high rates of family dissolution in meth cases are
found in other counties and are justified by widespread sexual and
physical abuse in meth homes.</TE>
<TE>   Today there is even a statewide group, the California DEC
Alliance, to lobby and provide information to improve law
enforcement's work with drug-affected children.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego prosecutor Tom Manning, chairman of the group, says
another important component of the work can be quick medical
treatment. Children can ingest meth because the drugs can infuse
everything in a home from cereal and meat to water and the air.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the progress, Webber-Brown still runs into law
enforcement officials who view her efforts as too soft.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always emotional at the end of my presentations, because I
show slides of the children we have saved," she says. "And they are
real people to me, people who have been horribly abused.</TE>
<TE>   "So I am showing this picture of Janet, who has had her hair torn
out, and an officer in Solano County stands up and says, 'I think you
have done this job too long. You should not get so involved that you
know these children by name.'</TE>
<TE>   "I gathered myself together and I said: 'That's why I'm up here
teaching people like you. ... Maybe you have been doing your job too
long, and maybe you should retire.'</TE>
<TE>   "The whole room stood and applauded."</TE>
<TE>   Progress in Small Steps</TE>
<TE>   Year after year, it all boils down to a series of tiny tragedies
and small triumphs for Webber-Brown.</TE>
<TE>   She is talking now about some of the sad times, the times that
left her in tears or silent screams of rage.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most potent memories is of an 11-year-old girl in Chico
who had taken on a maternal role: feeding her little brothers and the
dog, cleaning up, with little help from any adult.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting at the kitchen table talking to her.... asked her
if she ever had baby sitters and she said the 19-year-old boy next
door was coming over," Webber-Brown recalled. "Then she just looked
at me and said, 'I have a secret. My neighbor has been molesting me,
and I think he is starting to molest my little brother.'</TE>
<TE>   "I just lost it," Webber-Brown says. "This little girl was afraid
to tell anybody what was happening because she was afraid she would
be taken away and there would be nobody to watch over her brothers."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she has learned to rejoice in small victories.</TE>
<TE>   With the last of the day's raids over, she watches the two
children being taken away from their duplex in Oroville, past the
fence with the Nazi swastika and the White Power emblem and a swatch
of sun-baked dirt where a front yard should have been.</TE>
<TE>   But when she talks about why she keeps doing this, she focuses on
simple things.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good right now," she says. "Tonight those kids will have
something to eat, and they will get a bath. And tomorrow they will
have breakfast. All the things the rest of us take for granted."</TE>

<HD>Justin Meyer, 63; Founder of Napa Valley's Silver Oak
Cellars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vintner Justin Meyer, one of the founders of the high-quality Napa
Valley wine industry and the creator of one of the first wines to
attract a devoted following, has died. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Meyer died Tuesday while vacationing with his family near Lake
Tahoe.</LD>
<LD>   The family would not specify the cause of death.</LD>
<TE>   With his friend and partner Ray Duncan, a Colorado oilman, Meyer
founded Silver Oak Cellars in 1972. At that time, Napa Valley had
been relatively quiet for decades, except for a handful of
large-volume wine producers. Meyer was one of a new generation of
passionate wine lovers who brought new life to the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The winery's Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon quickly became one of
the most recognized California labels. Its popularity has never
flagged; last year it was the most popular Cabernet in U.S.
restaurants, according to an annual poll in Wine &amp; Spirits magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Silver Oak was one of California's first boutique wineries, a
producer of small quantities of hand-crafted wines sold at high
prices, comparatively glamorous after the jug wines of large
producers. Silver Oak wines, along with those from Heitz Cellars,
Chateau Montelena, Joseph Phelps, Clos du Val and Stag's Leap Wine
Cellars, helped create a new image for Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Silver Oak Cabernet is styled to be popular: ripe, luscious and
ultra-smooth, with a distinctive tang of American oak. The annual
release of the latest vintage is a major event in the wine world.
Hundreds of people converge on the winery, where they wait in line
all night to buy the allotted two or three bottles each. The '98
Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon "Alexander Valley" sells for $60; the
'97 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon "Napa Valley" is $100.</TE>
<TE>   Winemaking was an accidental career for Meyer, who was born in
Bakersfield and had planned to be a teacher. Immediately after high
school in 1957 he joined the Christian Brothers, a Catholic teaching
order, and became a teacher at the Christian Brothers High School in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1964, his life was guided in a new direction. He was made
an assistant to Brother Timothy, the legendary winemaker at the large
Christian Brothers winery in Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I'd give it a try, but I don't know why they chose me," he
said in a 1999 interview. "I still don't know. In 1964, a glass of
Chablis was stretching it for me. I much preferred a beer."</TE>
<TE>   That changed quickly. Meyer developed a passion for wine, and in
1972 he left the Christian Brothers, got married, and teamed with
Duncan to start a winery. They made their first wines in an Oakville
dairy barn.</TE>
<TE>   The pair established a second Silver Oak winery and vineyard in
Alexander Valley in 1991, and last year the two Silver Oak facilities
together produced about 50,000 cases of Napa Valley and Alexander
Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, the partners bought the bankrupt Franciscan Winery in St.
Helena and turned it around, then sold it for a profit four years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer retired in 2001, citing health problems, and sold his half
of Silver Oak to Duncan for a reported $120 million. He remained
active in the company as a consultant and grape grower.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had virtually zero employee turnover in this company,
because of how people felt about Justin," said Silver Oak's marketing
director, Bob Little. "He was a distinct leader. Everybody looked up
to him."</TE>
<TE>   Meyer was working with one of his sons, Matthew, on starting a
winery in Mendocino County. Meyer is also survived by his wife,
Bonny; another son, Chad; and a daughter, Holly.</TE>

<HD>Former Mayor Admits Income Tax Evasion</HD>
<DH>Crime: Under terms of a plea agreement, federal prosecutors
will urge zero to six months in custody for the onetime Carson
official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Carson Mayor Michael Mitoma has agreed to plead guilty to
failing to pay $3,846 in federal income tax on his official salary in
1995 and 1996, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for his plea to two misdemeanors in the tax case,
prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence for Mitoma ranging from
zero to six months in custody.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a crime of oversight," said his lawyer, Paul Potter. "He
filed for extensions both times, but he never got around to following
through. Once you step off the track, sometimes it's hard to get back
on."</LD>
<TE>   But in a signed plea agreement, Mitoma acknowledged that his
failure to pay the taxes was the result of willful evasion rather
than an oversight or mistake.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican businessman who arranges joint ventures between Asian
and U.S. companies, Mitoma figured in the 1996 Democratic
presidential campaign fund-raising scandal.</TE>
<TE>   That year, he negotiated a $250,000 donation to the Democratic
National Committee from a South Korean client who wanted to dine with
President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Mitoma's client, John K.H. Lee, flew from Seoul to Washington for
the meeting. But he wound up getting nothing more than a handshake
and a photo opportunity with the president during a fund-raising gala
at a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats were later forced to return the money. Foreign
citizens who are not permanent residents are barred from contributing
to U.S. election campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The deal announced Friday calls for Mitoma to make restitution to
the U.S. Treasury for the unpaid taxes.</TE>
<TE>   According to the plea agreement, the restitution amount could also
include losses arising from charges that are not being prosecuted by
the government.</TE>
<TE>   The plea agreement did not elaborate, but Potter said there may be
a third year in which Mitoma did not pay the full amount of taxes
owed.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Cowan, who is handling the case for
the prosecutor's public corruption and government fraud section,
declined to elaborate on the plea agreement. But, he said, "our
investigation focused on violations of U.S. tax laws."</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for Mitoma to enter his plea, Cowan said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitoma served seven years as mayor, a part-time job that paid
about $16,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   He was defeated in a 1997 reelection effort and staged an
unsuccessful comeback attempt last year.</TE>

learn leadership from project.</DH>

<LD>The smell of fresh paint mixed with the afternoon heat as Morika
Stewart, 14, placed the final touches of bright green on a figure
representing her silhouette. As she skillfully dabbed paint around
images of her family and friends that filled the center of her
picture, Morika, a student at Orange County High School of the Arts,
explained the significance of her piece.</LD>
<LD>   "I chose to tell my family's story and to represent that the youth
of Orange County have opinions and thoughts," she said as she stepped
back to get a better view of the whole canvas. "We do have a voice
and different ideas."</LD>
<LD>   Morika and 21 other students from Orange and Los Angeles counties
celebrated the end of a first-of-its-kind arts project Friday by
unveiling a mural they designed and created at the Santa Ana Grand
Central Arts Center.</LD>
<TE>   The unveiling rounded out a weeklong program called Summer Art
Camp for Social Awareness.</TE>
<TE>   The program, sponsored by the Orange County Human Relations
Commission and funded by sports agent Leigh Steinberg, brought
together nearly two dozen teenagers from divergent cultural and
economic backgrounds. The goal, organizers said, was to teach group
and leadership skills by tapping into the students' artistic talent.</TE>
<TE>   The mural, entitled "Under the Peel"--painted on canvas and
created with a mix of digital imaging and acrylic paints--displays
the growth of Orange County and features local civil rights figures
who have contributed to its diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so excited and so proud of the children," said Barbara
Laurence-Hill, the first African American teacher in Orange County
and one of the speakers at Friday's presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "Those young minds are so bright and so optimistic, and it shows
in the work they have done."</TE>
<TE>   Hill, whose face is included in the mural, said that watching the
multicultural group working on the project gave her a sense of hope
for the growing diversity in Orange County--a contrast from the time
she began her career in Santa Ana 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My first teaching experience was very traumatic.... It was a
long, hard road," Hill said, recalling racial and gender
discrimination she encountered during her years working for the Santa
Ana Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   But Hill said she refused to let death threats, several break-ins
at her Santa Ana home and tampering with her own children's school
records drive her away from her profession and ideals.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to stay because of my strong belief in justice," she
said. "I wanted to preserve the freedom to pursue what I believe is
right ... and to do it with the dignity with which I taught and
carried myself all those years."</TE>
<TE>   Students in the arts program heard Hill's story and those of other
Orange County civil rights activists, including Ralph and Natalie
Kennedy, who championed the issue of fair housing in the county.</TE>
<TE>   A picture of Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez, the couple who brought
the firstschool desegregation case in the U.S., also appears in the
mural. Each activist's face is digitally imaged against the backdrop
of the Santa Ana Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a part of history, like the mountains that always look
down upon us," said Cary Nelson, 16, of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The students' mural also includes such Orange County hallmarks as
agricultural fields, housing developments, freeways and beaches.</TE>
<TE>   As they received their certificates for completing the course
before family, friends, mentors and city officials, students
explained why they chose to create the artwork they did and the
symbolism behind it.</TE>
<TE>   For Edgar Benitez, 15, of Santa Ana the medium was graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not bad, and it's not only what people think," he said.
"It's also another form of art."</TE>
<TE>   Students felt that their participation in the mural, which will be
displayed throughout Orange County, has provided them with a voice
and a lesson in history.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to show what's under ... what's not being said
about Orange County," Cary said.</TE>

<HD>John Wayne Airport Performance Improves</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing to improve since Sept. 11, passenger volume at John Wayne
Airport reached 744,875 in July, a 2.5% increase in travel compared
with the same month last year, airport officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said that although the number of passengers went up, the
number of commercial flight operations--takeoffs and
landings--dropped to 7,359 last month, about 6% fewer than in July
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Flight operations for commuter air carriers, however, rose to
1,027, about 14% higher than in July 2001. The numbers reflect the
addition of air taxi services--AmericaWest Express and American
Eagle.</LD>
<TE>   Air cargo tonnage also increased, from 1,372 to 1,866.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely a good sign," said Ann McCarley, an airport
spokeswoman. "The numbers have been increasing every month since
April. As far as passenger loads are concerned, the airport is doing
well."</TE>

<DH>Outreach: Age spread among seniors now means that programs

<AU>KRISTEN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>MOBILE, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Hope Jackson starts her Wednesdays swinging, stretching and strolling
around the fellowship hall at Cottage Hill Baptist Church.</LD>
<LD>   Then she climbs a few flights of stairs to join her fellow
sopranos in the senior choir. But before the tennis-shoed 87-year-old
flexes her way through an exercise class and sings scales during
choral warm-ups, she and her friends bow their heads in prayer. They
seek God's blessings for those in need and thank the Almighty for the
gifts they have received.</LD>
<LD>   That divine communication, she said, makes all the difference.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a wonderful, inspirational thing," Jackson said. "I
hope the Lord will just keep me going."</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Lord--along with advances in health care--seems to
be keeping millions of Americans going longer than ever. More than 34
million people in the United States are 65 years old or older. By
2030, that population will grow to 70 million.</TE>
<TE>   The booming senior population translates into big challenges for
Ronnie McCarson, minister to adults 55 and older at Mobile's Cottage
Hill Baptist Church, and for other seniors ministries across the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   McCarson is trying to beef up the congregation's ministry to older
residents. In addition to providing a safe place where seniors can
exercise, visit and play games, McCarson would like to offer adults
classes in everything from computers to quilting.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the seniors of this area to know that there's a place
they can come to," said McCarson, pointing out the absence of any
nearby senior center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for the community," McCarson said. "If somebody is
unchurched, we'd love to have them come here."</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the congregation housed a
government-funded Senior Adult Independent Living Center but, in
1996, it elected to pull out of the program. Members wanted to use
their resources differently, including creation of a Meals-on-Wheels
program, and to avoid some of the restrictions that accompany
government-funded programs, McCarson said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Cottage Hill and people from the area's Methodist,
Episcopal, Presbyterian and Jewish communities visit the church every
weekday to pick up meals to deliver to about 80 people. "If they
can't pay the $3, we take care of the cost," McCarson said. "Nobody's
going to go without."</TE>
<TE>   Don Morgan, 58, a member of Cottage Hill Baptist Church, picked up
11 meals for delivery one recent weekday. Two years ago, he said, a
call went out for volunteers; he and his wife responded. Since then,
they have delivered meals to a handful of adults once a week.</TE>
<TE>   Demographically speaking, Morgan is exactly the adult McCarson
hopes to reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty-year-olds don't want to hang out with the 80-year-olds,"
McCarson said. "I think you're going to have a multilevel senior
adult ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Arn, author of "Catch the Age Wave: A Handbook for
Effective Ministry with Senior Adults," agrees that there is value in
splitting up the grown-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Arn said, when a church has only one senior adult
ministry, people may stay away.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the mistaken assumptions that a lot of church leaders are
operating under is one senior adult group or ministry in the church
is adequate," he said. "Obviously, it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Some have dubbed those between the ages of 50 and 69 "middle
adults," and recognize the group as a cohort completely separate from
those 70 to 84--"older adults"--and the "elderly," who are 85 years
old and older.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more, particularly as people live longer and retire
sooner, even the word 'senior' or 'senior adult' is politically
incorrect," Arn said. "Most people think of themselves as somewhere
between 10 and 20 years younger than they actually are. All of us
make choices based on our self-image."</TE>
<TE>   Arn, who is president of Church Growth Inc., in Monrovia, Calif.,
said one of the greatest dangers for any group--one including older
adults or anyone else--is an inward focus.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tendency in many churches that have a senior adult
group or ministry to see that group primarily as one--well, we
sometimes call it a 'Happy Times Travel Club,' " he said. "Almost
invariably, groups die out through attrition and never have any
significant impact on the growth or life ... of the church."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "When seniors do start realizing that they can have
a positive influence in changing lives, it gives them a whole new
sense of dignity and value."</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Churches throughout the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania have been
ordered to read a letter written by the bishop to explain the
suspension of a conservative rector who opposes the ordination of
women and homosexuals.</LD>
<LD>   The five-page letter, which Bishop Charles E. Bennison Jr. ordered
read in the diocese's 162 parishes last Sunday, said the Rev. David
Moyer was suspended because of his defiance of church canons.</LD>
<LD>   "Because he and I differ in our approaches to the place of women
and homosexual persons in the church, as well as on other theological
and pastoral questions, some have erroneously depicted my inhibition
[suspension] of [Moyer] as prejudicial with regard to those of a
conservative ideology," Bennison said. "Nothing could be further from
the truth."</LD>
<TE>   Moyer is a national leader of conservative Episcopalians and was
named bishop of Forward in Faith, a 19,000-member national
conservative movement that opposes the ordination of gay and female
priests, which the group calls incompatible with biblical teachings.</TE>
<TE>   Bennison has called Forward in Faith's naming of its own bishops
"clearly schismatic." Moyer also has been criticized for refusing for
years to present candidates for confirmation to the bishop as
required by canon law.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer also had refused to allow Bennison and his two predecessors
to visit the Church of the Good Shepherd, Bennison said in his
letter.</TE>
<TE>   The letter said Moyer, who was barred in March from acting as
pastor, will be defrocked on Sept. 4 if he fails to come into line
with church canons.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bennison nor diocesan spokeswoman Meg Cave returned calls.
Moyer's attorney, John H. Lewis Jr., said the priest was considering
a defamation lawsuit because of the letter.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes far beyond liberal and conservative. A true liberal
tolerates diversity, and this is nothing more than an attempt to
stamp out the opposition," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Moyer did not bar Bennison from his church but instead
asked him to affirm church doctrines including "the teachings of
Scripture as to human sexuality" before visiting.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis also said his client has been denied a church trial to
address the allegations, as provided under canon law.</TE>

<LD>   On seven gently sloping acres in midtown Ventura, Frisbee players
bound after the floating disk. Dogs romp as their owners chat in the
sea breeze. Strollers take in a stunning view of the ocean, just a
half-mile away.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, more than 2,200 of Ventura's earlier citizens lie six
feet under, mostly in graves that are no longer marked.</LD>
<TE>   Officially, the spot is called Memorial Park. However, locals use
a more plain-spoken name, paying heed to what the emerald swath was
and, in a way, still is: Cemetery Park.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Flanagan, a spokesman for the state agency regulating
burials, said he never had heard of a cemetery given over to
recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new one on me," said Flanagan, an official with the
Department of Consumer Affairs, which runs the state's Cemetery and
Funeral Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   It also was new to Deanna Lucio, who moved to an apartment across
the street last year.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon, Lucio was lounging on a blanket, blowing
soap bubbles with her 16-month-old daughter, Marina. She was unfazed
by the spot's history.</TE>
<TE>   "We love it here," she said. "On weekends we sometimes set up a
grill. Marina loves to go over and pick up the pine cones. It's just
a nice, quiet place for us to hang out."</TE>
<TE>   Across the park, Erica Garcia was equally nonchalant. On her daily
walk with her little dog Lucky she gave the high sign to other dog
owners. She said the park's history has never rattled her.</TE>
<TE>   "When you live here so long, you just get used to it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are no playgrounds or ball fields, no restrooms or picnic
tables at Cemetery Park. Stately pine trees offer shade. The only
things that hint of the park's former use are several dozen simple
memorial plaques dotting the vast lawn. They were installed by the
city at the request of families whose loved ones are interred beneath
them.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, couples marry in Cemetery Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We just ask them to be cautious and respectful," said Mike
Montoya, Ventura's parks manager.</TE>
<TE>   If the community's reaction to the park seems laid back now, it
was practically glowing when the transformation took place in the
mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a different time," said Richard Senate, a local historian
and lifelong Ventura resident. "The city was growing and this was
seen as progress. Only one person objected. One!"</TE>
<TE>   By then, the cemetery had long since fallen on hard times.</TE>
<TE>   It was established as St. Mary's Cemetery in 1862, four years
before Ventura was incorporated. Over the decades, it was divided
into sections for Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Chinese.
Eventually deeded to the city, it was the final resting place for
wealthy town fathers as well as the nameless poor.</TE>
<TE>   The area's first congressman, Gen. William Vandever, was buried
here. Serving from 1887 to 1891, he was unsuccessful in his efforts
to split California into two states. However, he scored big with his
bill creating Yosemite and Sequoia national parks.</TE>
<TE>   James Sumner also wound up here. He rode with the U.S. Cavalry and
won a Medal of Honor for "gallantry in action" against the Apaches in
1870. He ended up working at an Oxnard saloon and dying in the county
poorhouse.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1940s, Ventura had grown around its old graveyard and
another cemetery had been set up outside of town. In 1944, further
burials were banned.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, weeds overran the place and vandals toppled
tombstones. On Halloween, pranksters would work stones loose and dump
them in neighborhood yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the city's free hotel for bums and winos," said Ed Lupton,
the parks superintendent when the city came up with its bold plan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, workers dug up the cemetery's more than 600 tombstones
and arranged them alphabetically in a nearby canyon. Officials wrote
to as many families as they could find, telling them they could pick
up their loved ones' rotting wood crosses and elaborate marble
monuments.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than a dozen were claimed. After seven years, the stones
were used to shore up a riverbank levee at a municipal golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen families chose to have their relatives' bodies exhumed
and reburied elsewhere. The rest stayed in place. Most of them are
identified on a map kept by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We converted a blighted, abandoned cemetery and 40 years later
it's still a beautiful memorial," said Lupton, now 84. "I drive by
and it gives me a very, very warm feeling to know that I played a
role. I think of it as a green carpet covering those wonderful souls
of Ventura's history."</TE>
<TE>   But cemeteries should remain cemeteries forever, say activists who
fight to preserve them.</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with it? Everything!" said Sue Silver, a volunteer
in Northern California for a national group called Saving Graves.
"How fitting is it for the first citizens of Ventura to be walked
upon, urinated upon, and to have dogs poop on them?"</TE>
<TE>   Silver, who has battled plans to build roads and telephone
switching stations on top of graveyards, contends that the city may
have broken a state law by devoting a cemetery to any other use.</TE>
<TE>   Senate, the city historian, disagreed, pointing out that the
property is still "a memorial park."</TE>
<TE>   "It had been deeded to Ventura and they could do what they jolly
well pleased with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever the case, the park has become a unique landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Malone, a retired oil field equipment salesman, said he used
to make up stories for his children about an escaped killer living in
Cemetery Park, eager for his nightly victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We laugh about it now," he said as his toy poodle Gigi peered up
at him after an amble through the park. "I figured it might keep them
out of trouble."</TE>

<HD>20 Accused of Swapping Child Porn</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors say suspects in U.S. and Europe,
including three in California, traded Internet photos of their own
children. More arrests are expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors in the U.S. and Europe announced Friday that they have
arrested 20 people, including three in California, suspected of being
part of a child pornography ring that involves parents swapping
photos on the Internet of their children being sexually molested.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the evil underbelly of child pornography that we hoped
didn't exist," said San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Dort, a
member of the local Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.</LD>
<LD>   In 80% of the pornographic images, the children were being
molested by their own parents, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   While there have been arrests in recent years involving
large-scale rings that sell child pornography, the swapping of
pictures for personal enjoyment is new, Dort and other investigators
said.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon also presents new challenges to law enforcement
because, unlike the commercial rings, the parents are not prone to
taking chances and use sophisticated encryption techniques to trade
pictures with others.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-eight children in this country and eight in Europe--ranging
in age from 2 to 14 years--are believed to have been molested while
their parents and others were making videos and taking still
photographs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One video included the sound of the child crying.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those receiving the pornography had requested that
specific sex acts be performed, said U.S. Atty. John K. Vincent in
Fresno, where the first U.S. case was uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, parents arranged for their children to have sex
with other adults, according to the indictments.</TE>
<TE>   "These crimes are beyond the pale," said U.S. Customs Service
Commissioner Robert C. Bonner at a Washington news conference. "They
are despicable and repugnant."</TE>
<TE>   Nine U.S. citizens are charged: two in San Diego County, one in
Fresno, and one each in Idaho, Texas, Florida, Washington, Kansas and
South Carolina. The 10th U.S. suspect, in Reno, committed suicide
after being arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 European arrests were made in Denmark, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, England and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators expect to make more arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to rescue children who are out there being molested,"
said Mike Unzueta, acting special agent in charge of the San Diego
office of the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   Although law enforcement officials believe they have greatly
decreased the availability of over-the-counter child pornography in
recent years, the amount of child pornography on the Internet has
increased because of the possibility of anonymity and the difficulty
in tracing buyers and sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, when the Customs Service established the Cyber
Smuggling Center, it has received more than 82,000 tips of Internet
"kiddie porn" trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   One such tip led to Danish, U.S. and Interpol forces cracking the
swapping ring that called itself The Club.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Danish National Police received information about
photographs that "Save the Children," a watchdog group, had found on
the Internet purportedly depicting a man sexually abusing a young
girl.</TE>
<TE>   Danish investigators arrested the man and his wife after learning
the child was their 9-year-old daughter. The wife is the only woman
among those charged.</TE>
<TE>   Danish police examined the man's computer and determined that
images on its hard drive had been sent via Internet from other
countries, including the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "Operation Hamlet" because of the Danish connection, the
investigation led to the arrest in Fresno County of Lloyd Alan
Emmerson, 45, a chiropractor with an office in Clovis. He has pleaded
not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, charges were filed against Paul Whitmore, 43, a
licensed marriage and family counselor, and Brooke Rowland, 41, a
salesman for a neon sign company.</TE>
<TE>   Both have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges and are set for
trial in November.</TE>
<TE>   They remain in jail on bail set at $2 million each because of the
possibility they might flee, prosecutor Dort said.</TE>
<TE>   The two are accused of molesting 12 children.</TE>
<TE>   A defendant in Killeen, Texas, was convicted in July and sentenced
to 20 years in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   In numerous cases, children have been taken into protective
custody by child welfare officials or given to relatives, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   While possession of child pornography--in most cases--is a
misdemeanor, defendants in "Operation Hamlet" have been charged with
felonies because the videos and pictures allegedly showed them
committing sexual acts with children who were easily identifiable.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, some could face 60 years in prison, Bonner said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this isn't unusual, then so help us God," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must protect the children of all nations and starve the
pedophiles of the sordid images that induce them to act."</TE>

<HD>School Initiative Leads in Funding</HD>
<DH>Politics: Schwarzenegger plan for before- and after-school
programs has collected $3.6 million--$1 million from the actor
himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger's initiative to fund after-school and
early morning programs leads the money race for all statewide
November ballot measures, having received $3.6 million so far, with
the actor kicking in $1 million, mid-year campaign finance reports
show.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, Proposition 49, is widely viewed as a way for
Schwarzenegger to establish his policy credentials and to provide a
prelude to his eventually seeking public office.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative would earmark as much as $550 million a year for
after- and before-school programs for elementary and junior high
school students.</LD>
<TE>   A. Jerold Perenchio, chairman of the Spanish-language Univision
network, also donated $1 million to the measure, according to
campaign finance reports filed with the secretary of state. The
measure, which is backed by the California Teachers Assn., has no
organized opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Californians will vote on seven statewide propositions Nov. 5,
including four placed on the ballot by Gov. Gray Davis and the
Legislature. None has stirred widespread controversy. But, as often
happens with California's direct democracy, wealthy individuals and
initiative promoters are turning to voters in attempts to implement
their visions.</TE>
<TE>   Social activist and entrepreneur Robert McKay has poured $1.13
million into his initiative, Proposition 52, which would permit
people to register to vote on election day. The measure would
eliminate the registration deadline of 15 days before an election.</TE>
<TE>   A group opposing the measure, Citizens and Law Enforcement Against
Voter Fraud, has registered with the secretary of state, but has not
reported any campaign activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning and Conservation League, which has promoted several
ballot measures in the past, is pushing Proposition 51 to spend tax
money on a variety of transportation and environmental projects.
Backers have raised $2.18 million this year, and had $159,000 in the
bank, according to a mid-year filing. Opponents, including the League
of Women Voters, have not raised any money yet.</TE>
<TE>   The other ballot measures are:</TE>
<TE>   * Proposition 46, a bond issue to provide $2.1 billion to build
and refurbish low-income housing and expand shelters for the
homeless, has raised $70,000, with the California Building Assn.
giving half that sum. The measure has no organized opposition.</TE>
<TE>   * Proposition 47, a $13-billion public school and college
construction bond issue, raised $945,000 through June 30. Various
builders and public employee and teachers unions are backing the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   * Proposition 50, which would authorize $3.44 billion in general
obligation bonds to build various water-related programs, has raised
$1.54 million, much of it from developers and conservation groups.</TE>
<TE>   * Proposition 48, to consolidate courts, reported no money raised.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Russian Orthodox Church Prospers in Bible Belt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY REEVES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BROOKSIDE, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Benedict Tallant seems like a typical Alabama preacher with
his GMC pickup truck and slow drawl, yet the three-armed cross and
onion-shaped copper dome on his little brick church stand out in the
Bible Belt.</LD>
<LD>   Tallant--Father Benedict to parishioners--is pastor of St.
Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, the oldest patriarchal Russian
congregation in the South.</LD>
<LD>   Just as Roman Catholic churches report to the pope in Rome, tiny
St. Nicholas is under the auspices of Alexy II, head of the church in
Russia.</LD>
<TE>   "Our patriarch is in Moscow," Tallant said.</TE>
<TE>   That's a long way from Brookside, a town of about 1,400 people
some 20 miles north of Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   The church was organized in 1894 for Slavic immigrants who came to
Alabama to work in coal mines. The mines played out years ago, but a
half-dozen of the congregations remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Most families had up to 10 kids," said Helen Slatsky, at 80 the
oldest active member at St. Nicholas, which has about 70 members and
averages 30 people for its Sunday service.</TE>
<TE>   Slatsky's parents emigrated from Slovakia in the early 1900s. Her
life today is a mix of the Old World and the New: Two icons hang on a
wall above her TV, while a miniature University of Alabama football
helmet decorates a tabletop.</TE>
<TE>   While the church cemetery is filled with tombstones bearing family
names--including Bobyarchick, Krofchick and Yarchak--the current
church roll includes people named Buzbee, Davis and Beck.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a McCracken--a good Russian name," joked the Rev.
Tallant.</TE>
<TE>   Tallant, who grew up in nearby Walker County, attended both
Baptist and Methodist churches before converting to the Russian
Orthodox church. Ordained in 1962 after completing a home-study
course, he has been at St. Nicholas ever since.</TE>
<TE>   While St. Nicholas maintains many traditions dating back to its
earliest days as an immigrant congregation, the church--like many
other Russian churches abroad--has adapted as its first generation
died away, to be replaced by Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Icons adorned with English words hang near the Royal Doors, which
lead to the enclosed altar area. The liturgy is in English with a
touch of church Slavonic, an Old World ancestor of modern Russian.</TE>
<TE>   The church still has a few Russian-speaking members, but most
speak only English.</TE>
<TE>   St. Nicholas looks much the same today as in its earliest days.
Built in 1916 after one church was destroyed by a tornado and a
second by fire, the temple sits on land donated decades ago by U.S.
Steel, which employed many of the immigrant miners.</TE>
<TE>   The 86-year-old church originally was all wood, with a
tongue-and-groove ceiling and painted walls. Members paneled the
interior in dark wood after Tallant arrived, and brown bricks were
added to the exterior.</TE>
<TE>   St. Nicholas belongs to the smallest of the three Russian heritage
denominations in the United States, called the Patriarchal Parishes
of the Russian Orthodox Church in the United States of America. It

Russia has 177 and the Orthodox Church in America has 721.</TE>
<TE>   There are a just handful of Russian heritage churches in Alabama.
Consequently, St. Nicholas has experienced problems through the years
because of unfamiliarity with its heritage and practices. Teenagers
who didn't recognize the Orthodox cross have called members devil
worshippers, Tallant said, and one young man referred to St. Nicholas
as the "communist church" because of its Russian roots and the old

<LD>Federal officials will allow a California Indian tribe to vote today
on changing its constitution despite congressional concerns that the
election could be rigged.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Interior Secretary Neal McCaleb, who oversees the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, told a West Virginia congressman that he would not
intervene in a long-running dispute that has divided families in the
Ione Band of Miwok Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) also sought an investigation of whether
BIA employees who are members of the dominant faction have exercised
undue influence on the process.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, California Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Tracy) pushed for a
delay in the election until questions are resolved about the tribe's
membership rolls, including whether any people registered to vote are
members of other tribes.</TE>
<TE>   But McCaleb said federal officials would wait until after the
election before determining whether it was valid.</TE>

<HD>142 to Run on Hollywood, Valley Ballots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From a rookie state assemblyman to a billboard icon, an army of
advocates for the breakup of Los Angeles took form on Friday, as 121
candidates met the filing deadline to run for office in a proposed
San Fernando Valley city, and 21 filed in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Among 12 candidates for Valley mayor, first-term Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge), who is funding his race in part with
contributions from his Assembly campaign, has perhaps the highest
profile, although well-known Valley activist Mel Wilson is also in
the contest.</LD>
<LD>   In Hollywood, the last-minute entry of the single-named
self-promotion whiz Angelyne in the election for five city council
seats prompted sniggers that her ubiquitous billboards would give her
an edge over unknown candidates. Hollywood's mayor would be chosen
from the city council.</LD>
<TE>   Secessionists said the lack of veteran politicians on the Nov. 5
ballot is a good thing, because they prefer passionate citizens to
career politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "You have people here who aren't jaded, who aren't cynical, who
want to improve their community and will bring an intensity to the
campaign, who will bring fresh ideas," said Richard Katz, co-chairman
of the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But some political experts said the shortage of high-profile
candidates with large constituencies and strong fund-raising ability
will likely blunt the effectiveness of the secession drive.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an initial period of optimism when [secessionists]
anticipated a large number of highly qualified candidates who would
spend a large amount of money," said Thomas Hogen-Esch, an assistant
professor of political science at Cal State Northridge. "By all
accounts, that hasn't happened. The lack of quality, big-name
candidates will hurt the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Relative Newcomers</TE>
<TE>   Even the most serious candidates lack the name recognition that
secession supporters had hoped for: Richman is new to the Assembly,
and Gene La Pietra, who spearheaded the Hollywood secession effort
and is running for a Hollywood council seat, lost a previous bid for
West Hollywood City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not household names," said Kam Kuwata, a political
advisor for the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders had originally predicted 150 candidates in the
Valley alone, including 10 with experience in elective office. But
they were pleased with Friday's count because a slow start to the
filing process had made it look as if the response would be smaller
than it turned out to be.</TE>
<TE>   "This is huge," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   The field may narrow in the coming days as the county
registrar-recorder validates the signatures on the candidates'
nominating petitions.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are on the same ballot as the Valley and Hollywood
secession measures. If secession loses, the offices will not exist, a
factor that might have dissuaded better-known people from entering
the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Only one Valley candidate other than Richman has elective
legislative experience at the city or state level: former
Assemblywoman Paula Boland, who is running for city council.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the race are a retired judge, a legislative aide and a few
chamber of commerce presidents. Most of the rest are business people
or neighborhood activists who have never run for office.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, C. Edward Dilkes, who is both city attorney and
interim city manager in the San Gabriel Valley city of Bradbury, is
among those who filed papers to run. Another is Jeff Zarrinnam, who
owns and runs the Ramada Inn in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a physician and the founder of one of the state's largest
managed care medical groups, has been in the Legislature for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   He said Friday that, if elected, he would cut the business tax in
a new Valley city to half the Los Angeles level, hire more police
officers and improve city services.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said he had raised about $75,000 for his campaign so far,
including a $25,000 contribution from his Assembly campaign. He is
seeking reelection to the Assembly in November; if secession passes
and he wins the mayor's post, he will resign from the Legislature, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Competition in Valley</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Richman, Wilson has been active in Valley politics for
years. He is also a longtime associate of many of the business
leaders who are backing the secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He served four years as an appointee of former Mayor Richard
Riordan to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, and four
years on the city Fire Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he plans to spend as much as $500,000 in the campaign.
Richman declined to say how much he plans to spend.</TE>
<TE>   Other mayoral candidates include union activist and school bus
driver Benito Benny Bernal of Mission Hills, insurance adjuster David
Raymond Hernandez Jr. of Valley Village, and telecommunications
consultant Scott Sobhani of Valley Glen.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who is also the Republican candidate for Congress
opposed to Howard Berman in the 28th District, said he would work for
a better transit system for the Valley, including a light rail line
that would connect with the subway system at North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Virtual City Hall</TE>
<TE>   Marc Strassman, an Internet consultant from Valley Village who is
also running for Valley mayor, said he would like to see every
household in the Valley wired to city hall, so that residents could
vote "daily or hourly" on issues before the city.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Valley candidates are members of the Valley VOTE Board of
Directors: mayoral candidate Bernal; 3rd District candidate Walter
Prince; 6th District candidate Irwin Silon; 8th District candidates
Johnny Walker, Garrett Biggs and Joyce Pearson; 12th District
candidate Carlos Ferreyra; and 13th District candidate Richard
Leyner.</TE>
<TE>   Boland and Northridge Chamber of Commerce director Walter Prince
are among the 14 candidates competing in the Valley's 3rd Council
District.</TE>
<TE>   Contenders for other council seats include retired Superior Court
Judge Marvin D. Rowen, Robert Lamishaw, an urban planner who is
former president of the Mid-Valley Chamber of Commerce, and Scott
Svonkin, the chief of staff to Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood).</TE>

<HD>L.A. District Finds Extra $228 Million on the Books</HD>
<DH>Education: Supt. Romer credits deep midyear cost cutting
for the savings, while other officials express surprise at the
unexpected windfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE and DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District discovered this week that it
has a budget balance of $578 million left over from last fiscal year,
far higher than the $350 million it had originally estimated in
March.</LD>
<LD>   But district officials, who scrambled to cut $110 million out of
the budget in the middle of last fiscal year because of dire
projections, could not agree about how they inadvertently saved $228
million. The district has a $5.8-billion general fund.</LD>
<LD>   District Supt. Roy Romer said during a phone interview from
Colorado that more money than expected was saved through the deep
cost cutting in the middle of the year. Board of Education President
Caprice Young said that the initial estimate of a $350-million
cushion may have included errors because of poor accounting.</LD>
<TE>   And Joe Zeronian, the district's chief financial officer, said he
didn't have any idea why there was such a discrepancy.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't analyzed it yet, and we don't know why these things
have happened," he said, adding that projections in previous years
had been far more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   District officials were torn between relief that they had such a
large cushion and dismay that their estimates were so off-base. Some
of the money will be applied to this fiscal year's budget, which was
slashed by an additional $430 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a terrible situation that we find ourselves in,"
said board member Jose Huizar. "This signifies that we have to do a
much better job in our accounting, and I think it's unfair when we
harm our students with cuts throughout the year and then say, 'Oh we
do have the money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Board member David Tokofsky said the extra funds will increase
suspicion among union members, who are in the middle of tense
contract negotiations with the district.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers union president John Perez could not be reached for
comment. Former UTLA president Day Higuchi said the carry-over proves
the union contention that there is money for pay raises. "Despite all
of the agonizing and the talk about how to make cuts ... there is
still some slush in the system and no one should talk about going the
next five years without a salary increase."</TE>
<TE>   Huizar, Young and Tokofsky agreed that a $70-million cut that
increased class sizes in fourth through 12th grades was the most
regrettable action. That move cannot be reversed because year-round
schools started classes in July; teachers have already been assigned
and transportation routes determined.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had known in cutting that back in April that we would have
a ... surplus in August, it's likely that we would not have increased
class sizes," Young said. "I know I would not have."</TE>
<TE>   The school board made its cuts because of state funding cutbacks
and the increased costs of special education, workers' compensation
and legal services.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts forced schools to reduce the number of teacher aides,
librarians and school police. Schools also had to cut transportation
costs, accounting and internal audits among other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the process, budget officials spoke of the predicament
in dire terms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously working through a very difficult time," Romer
said earlier this year. "The only way we're going to survive is to
redouble our efforts."</TE>
<TE>   In past years, the district has been harshly criticized,
especially by the teachers' union, for routinely budgeting more than
it spends. After a newly elected school board dismissed former Supt.
Ruben Zacarias, his interim successor brought in Zeronian to clean up
the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains difficult for the district to closely track
spending because of antiquated computer systems that cannot, for
example, pinpoint the number of employees working for the district at
any time.</TE>

<HD>Lt. Gen. Tran Do, 78; Leading Political Dissident in
Vietnam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retired Lt. Gen. Tran Do, the leading dissident in Communist Vietnam,
died Friday in a hospital in Hanoi. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Do died of complications from acute diabetes, which he had been
fighting for some time, a hospital doctor said.</LD>
<LD>   Do joined the Communist Party in the 1940s. A decorated veteran of
the war against the South Vietnamese government and the United
States, he was head of the ruling Communist Party's ideology and
culture department.</LD>
<TE>   But he was expelled from the party in January 1999 for advocating
that it give up its monopoly on power. He had since been under
informal surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, public security officials briefly detained him in Ho
Chi Minh City, where he was visiting his son. They confiscated his
three-part memoirs containing his thoughts on the country's future.
Do repeatedly sent letters to authorities, as well as to the Vietnam
Writers Union, protesting the confiscation of his manuscripts and
demanding their return.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Do's criticism reflected disappointment over the gap
between the country's reality and the goals of the communist
revolution and the war of independence against French colonialism,
which he had helped fight.</TE>
<TE>   "Our present life, it seems, is less and less like what we dreamed
of building, and more and more like what we had spent time
overthrowing," Do wrote in the second part of his memoirs, circulated
outside Vietnam on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we have a way out?" he wrote. "I believe we do. One, it is not
to depend on any ideology or dogma. Two, one must have widespread
discussion with and among the people; no one can think on behalf of
the entire nation. Three, the rulers must be truly of the people, by
the people and for the people."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Ministry of Culture and Information ordered police
and cultural inspectors to confiscate and destroy books written by
several prominent dissidents, including Do. It said they had been
printed in violation of the Publishing Law, which requires that books
be approved by the government before they are published.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County Christian School officials have agreed to city demands
that they apply for building and use permits to let them move forward
with renovations to the former Washington elementary school campus in
Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   The Christian school wants to renovate the dilapidated building
and had hoped to move its 75 students from cramped quarters at Grace
Church into portable classrooms on the school site.</LD>
<LD>   But neighbors of the school complained and city officials in April
issued an order to stop the work. A city planner said it could take
two to three months before a decision on granting the permits is
issued.</LD>

<LD>The United States advanced to the semifinals of the inaugural World
University Baseball Championships by defeating the Czech Republic,
14-1, Friday at Messina, Italy, in a game shortened to seven innings
by the international 10-run rule.</LD>
<LD>   Team USA (4-1) will play Japan (4-1), a 6-1 winner over Korea in a
quarterfinal, in one semifinal today, and Cuba (5-0), which
eliminated China, 3-0, will take on Chinese Taipei (3-2), which
defeated the host country, Italy, 14-3. Winners advance to the
gold-medal game on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame's Grant Johnson pitched 5 1/3 innings, limiting the
Czechs to only one run on three hits. He was relieved by Cal State
Fullerton's Wes Littleton, who worked the final 1 2/3 innings, giving
up one hit, walking two and striking out two.</LD>
<TE>   Richie Weeks, a second baseman from Southern University, led the
team with four hits in four at-bats, including a solo home run and a
triple, four runs scored and three runs batted in. Left fielder Shane
Costa, from Fullerton, had one hit and scored a run in five at-bats.</TE>

<AU>NEAL LEAVITT</AU>
<BD>Neal Leavitt runs a marketing communications firm in
Fallbrook. E-mail: neal@leavcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We just lost our best friend. He was a devoted family companion who
was always there to greet us with a wag, a lick or a woof. Our
beloved Yorkshire terrier, Winston, succumbed very suddenly to a
liver tumor.</LD>
<LD>   During the emergency surgery, Winston lost too much blood and,
despite transfusions, didn't have enough strength left to pull
through. It was just his time.</LD>
<LD>   Winston was 12, and one of our first vets called him the "Hulk
Hogan" of Yorkies because he was huge for his breed--a whopping 17
pounds.</LD>
<TE>   He was small of stature yet totally fearless and never backed down
from a challenge. A few years ago he crossed paths with a huge
Rottweiler on a walk. He jumped under the Rottweiler, gave him a
quick nip on the throat and sent the dog whimpering down the street.
The Rottweiler's owner and I just stood there and laughed, as it was
such an incongruous scene.</TE>
<TE>   Winston was a tough little scrapper. A car sideswiped him during
the first few weeks we had him, but he was only briefly knocked out
and soon recovered. Twice he jumped off the roof of our house chasing
after our cat, each time bouncing off a large fern with no apparent
side effects other than wounded pride.</TE>
<TE>   He loved to run on the golf course adjacent to the house and
frequently would snatch someone's golf ball on the fairway, much to
the chagrin of many a golfer, whom I would then join in trying to
chase the dog down. Fortunately, most of the golfers were good sports
about it.</TE>
<TE>   Winston's passing struck a nerve with family, friends and
colleagues as the love for a pet is universal. Calls and e-mails came
in nationwide and from overseas as many remembered what a great
little guy he was.</TE>
<TE>   Too often people feel--sometimes they are made to feel by
others--that their reactions to a pet's death are abnormal or
exaggerated. Balderdash. Pain and grief are perfectly normal, and
these feelings shouldn't be locked up.</TE>
<TE>   The years with Winston were full of unconditional love and
acceptance, fun and joy. Our pets are individuals with their own
personalities, quirks, likes and dislikes. They are not replaceable
pieces, so don't rush out to get a new pet. It takes time to mourn
and heal, and you'll make too many comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   We elected to have Winston cremated and scattered his ashes out
among the avocado groves we own near our home in Fallbrook.</TE>
<TE>   Help for the grieving is available. The Web site for the Assn. for
Pet Loss and Bereavement, www.aplb.org, offers chat rooms,
newsletters and a list of qualified counselors. Another site,
www.petloss.net , provides a welter of online resources. A good
hotline is available at (509) 335-5704 or www.vetmed.wsu.edu.</TE>
<TE>   In 1928, playwright Eugene O'Neill wrote a last will and testament
"penned" by Blemie, the family Dalmatian, to comfort his wife after
the dog's death. In the closing paragraph, Blemie offered these last
words of farewell: "Whenever you visit my grave, say to yourselves
with regret but also with happiness in your hearts at the remembrance
of my long and happy life with you: 'Herein lies one who loved us and
whom we loved.' No matter how deep my sleep, I shall hear you, and
not all the power of death can keep my spirit from wagging a grateful
tail."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure Winston and Blemie are looking down right now, wagging
their tails, chasing lizards and just hangin' out.</TE>

<HD>Privatize Roads to Ease Clogging</HD>
<DH>Such highways would be cheaper, more efficient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM B. SUMMERS</AU>
<BD>Adam B. Summers is the producer of "The Capitalist
Defender," a talk-radio program in San Diego.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles has maintained its ranking as the most traffic-congested
urban area in the nation. This dubious honor was bestowed on the city
for the 15th consecutive year by the Texas Transportation Institute,
which found that Los Angeles-area drivers spent an average of 136
additional hours a year on the roads because of commuter congestion.</LD>
<LD>   All the planning by all the government agencies has done nothing
to solve the problem, and the problem never will be solved as long as
the government tries to manage it. What is needed is a private-sector
solution.</LD>
<LD>   The problem of traffic congestion is what economists call a
tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Basically, this means that because
everybody gets to use something free, the resource gets overused.</LD>
<TE>   Even assuming that the government could provide efficient
highways, the tax system is unfair. Although tax dollars are pooled
and doled out by the state Legislature and the federal government to
general transportation funds, some people use highways more than
others. Heavy highway users are taxed about as much as light users.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline taxes present an improvement over general fund taxes
because they are proportional to one's use of the roads, but they are
still inefficient. Their collection is subject to the same wasteful
bureaucratic structure as that of other taxes, and more money is
wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Privatizing highways, on the other hand, would accurately reveal
the value of highway travel to each individual, allowing for an
efficient exchange of property rights (your money for the highway
owner's permission to use his road). Everyone would pay a fair share
for use of the roads.</TE>
<TE>   When congestion increased because of holiday or commuter traffic,
prices would increase to keep the optimal number of cars on the road
and traffic moving smoothly. This would ensure that those who need to
use the roads most, or must get to their destinations most quickly,
would be the ones using the highways.</TE>
<TE>   If a company charged too much, people would take alternate routes,
seek other options, such as public transportation or decide that
their trips were not worth it and save money by traveling at off-peak
hours. The crucial truth is that private owners have a genuine
interest (i.e., the profit motive) in serving their customers and
providing the best quality of service; government agencies do not.</TE>
<TE>   This capitalist approach calls for each individual to make
decisions on price, time and method of travel and coordinates them
all simultaneously in a way that no central government planner could
ever hope to.</TE>
<TE>   Carpool lanes merely make traffic worse in other lanes. By truly
taking the costs of travel into account through a privatized system,
people would be able to more accurately make related decisions about
housing and job locations, among other things. Again, feats no urban
planner could reasonably seek to emulate.</TE>
<TE>   Private highways would present a cheaper, more efficient
alternative to government management. They would provide the fairness
of allowing each individual to make his own decisions as to the value
of his travel and its alternatives, and to get what he paid for. The
traffic problem deserves innovative solutions and innovative minds to
implement them. Such can be found only in the private sector.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two developments in Northern California offer new hope that the
notion of "smart growth" is belatedly taking hold in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Deal No. 1, between the city of Sacramento and Sacramento County,
would allow development of 10,000 acres of county farmland east of
Sacramento International Airport while another 10,000 acres
surrounding the airport and along the Sacramento River would remain
in the county and be preserved as open space. The developed area
would be annexed to the city, and the open space would remain under
county control.</LD>
<LD>   If consummated, the tentative deal would end years of city-county
bickering over the future of the undeveloped area, about a third the
size of San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   A critical point is that the city would share with the county the
sales taxes it collects from businesses in the developed area.
Development fees on homes for 60,000 people would be used to buy the
land to be saved as open space.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is notable because Sacramento County has a
reputation for poor planning and sprawl. But Supervisor Roger
Dickinson, who helped negotiate the pact, said, "We didn't want to
become an urban blob."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the governments work out the details, they might consider
the good planning example of a development called Rivermark on 157
acres that had been part of the old Agnews State Hospital in Santa
Clara, Calif., at the south end of San Francisco Bay. Planners call
it "new urbanism," a suburb with houses on smaller lots within
walking distance of schools, shopping areas, parks and public
transportation. It's across the street from a new Sun Microsystems
campus. All this is the antithesis of the auto-reliant California
suburban pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Rivermark is similar to the model created by planner-developer
James Rouse in Columbia, Md., in the 1960s and copied with varying
degrees of success, including at Los Angeles' Playa Vista
development. Rob Steuteville, the editor of New Urban News, says
California has been pretty good at redevelopment in the cities but
not so adept at making the suburbs better.</TE>
<TE>   The state has been notoriously absent in the area of land-use
planning and in allowing revenue-sharing among local governments. Two
bills before the Legislature would make progress in this respect.</TE>
<TE>   AB 680, by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), would
test the idea of sales tax revenue-sharing in a five-county region
around Sacramento. SB 1521, by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
would require the state to establish model planning practices and
policies that local government could follow but would not have to.
The Steinberg bill was stalled this week, but the idea should not be
allowed to die.</TE>
<TE>   Both measures are extremely modest steps in the right direction.</TE>

<HD>Turn Down Volume on Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iran's reformers are fighting a difficult seesaw battle to loosen the
grip of conservative clerics who hold the real power in the country.
The best, if most difficult, course for the United States is to
quietly wish the reformers well, not to proclaim public support that
makes their foes label them lackeys of Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, President Bush issued a statement denouncing Iranian
hard-liners who arrested political opponents and brought hardship to
their citizens. He also said reformers had no better ally than
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Those remarks predictably prompted the hard-liners to accuse those
wanting more liberalization of being pawns of the United States.
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who has been at odds with
conservative mullahs during his reign, felt compelled to criticize
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Today's Iran is not the nation of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and his revolutionaries. Most Iranians have been born since Khomeini
ousted the shah in 1979. The nation is more democratic than most in
the Middle East, holding meaningful elections for parliament and
local legislators. But the clerics control the military and security
agencies, ensuring that reformers don't go too far. Just before
Bush's statement, the largest student protest in three years
generated clashes with security forces in Tehran. Iranian media
reported that 140 people were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri, the Friday prayer leader in the
Iranian city of Esfahan, resigned recently with a withering attack on
"bribery, cheating ... the incompetence of authorities and the
failure of the political structure." His complaints resonated with
Iranians alarmed by a miserable economy and wanting more
liberalization.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to criticize about Iran, which backs Palestinian
terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. But cheering
reformers, and inadvertently pushing them toward the conservatives,
won't stop the nation from supporting Israel's enemies.</TE>
<TE>   It's better to urge Iran to work with other nations, as it did in
providing assistance to Afghanistan, and to warn that Washington will
not lift sanctions so long as Tehran supports terror.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also should keep pressure on Russia not to expand its
nuclear cooperation with Iran. Moscow has been helping complete a
reactor in the Iranian city of Bushehr and recently announced, then
seemed to back away from, plans to build five more reactors in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The clerics' grip on Iran has visible cracks. Not all opponents of
the clerics are jailed or muzzled. Young men and women meet and talk
more freely than in Khomeini's day.</TE>
<TE>   The best course for outsiders is to dial down the volume on
complaints about the mullahs' rule and hold their fire for times when
Iran becomes a threat to its neighbors.</TE>

<LD>Re "Publicity Over Firm's Fraud Verdict Forces Simon to Tend to His
Image," Aug. 5: If Richard Riordan, or any of his people, want to
start a new Moderate Republican Party, I am just one of what must
surely be a large number of disaffected moderates, both Democrat and
Republican, who would happily join. While I can't quite bring myself
to register as a Democrat, I no longer admit to being a registered
Republican. The nomination of Bill Simon is just too embarrassing. If
he's any kind of symbol, it's no wonder the country is in trouble
under the Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, in this day and age of investigations, someone ought to
try to find out who hijacked the old Republican Party. Has it really
been taken captive by a bunch of governmentally handicapped, wealthy
old (crooked?) businessmen? Or was it perhaps infiltrated by some
smart Democrats for the sole purpose of sabotaging it?</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Aspenson</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My primary vote for Simon was actually a vote against Riordan,
whom I blame for turning the Van Nuys Airport into a bustling
corporate jetport and media heliport, something for his rich friends
done at the considerable expense of us common folk. Perhaps other
people whose peace and quiet have been constantly ruptured by these
noisy aircraft wielded their independent vote in a similar fashion.
Don't count me as voting for Simon.</TE>

<LD>Re "Weapons, Laptops Lost at Justice Dept.," Aug. 6: At least 400
laptop computers and 775 weapons "lost" by the Justice Department.
These are the people who are guarding the gates to protect us from
the enemy. And millions of dollars stolen from government by using
credit cards. First it was the civilian government employees and now
it is the military that is doing its thing with the plastic card.</LD>
<LD>   I read and reread your article and did not find one word that
stated exactly how the Justice Department was going to catch the
felons. I want to see names. I want to see them convicted and sent to
high-security federal prisons, not country clubs like the one at
Lompoc. I want to see recovery of items and funds lost.</LD>
<LD>   I can't believe that the Justice Department cannot keep thieves
from taking computers and guns out its front door. Seems that the
gate is open, and maybe the gates to our nation are vulnerable as
well.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State, U.S. Feud Over Teachers," Aug. 6: For anyone to think that
California is going to be able to staff all its schools with "highly
qualified" teachers by the government deadline is pure fantasy. At a
time when all school districts are feeling the pinch of the economic
downturn, when our own L.A. Unified School District has been
considering health benefit cuts for its employees, when class sizes
are increasing in all secondary grades, when there is talk of pay
cuts (not pay raises) and when state prison guards are better paid
and compensated than teachers, could anyone explain to me exactly
where you expect to find all these "highly qualified" teachers?</LD>
<LD>   I do believe it's time for our politicians to take one big reality
check.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Iannucci</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California has no reason to dilute the definition of "highly
qualified" teachers. There are more than enough college juniors and
seniors in the pipeline who could earn their graduate certification
for the 2006-07 school year.</TE>
<TE>   All it takes is for starting teacher salaries to be raised to a
level comparable to what a person with essentially a graduate degree
plus on-the-job training could expect in business.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are plenty of people in business who would earn
their graduate teaching credential and enter teaching if only they
didn't have to give up a large percentage of their already-earned
Social Security benefits upon becoming a teacher. It's shameful that
our state leaders would even suggest watering down teacher
qualifications more than they already have.</TE>
<TE>   Children are the ultimate victims.</TE>
<TE>   John Rossmann</TE>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a credentialed teacher serving inner-city children on the
battlefront on a daily basis, I read this article with great
interest. School districts pay large salaries and create cushy
nonclassroom jobs for many "highly experienced" teachers (we call
these promotions). Why not take these veterans and put them back in
the classroom for half a year each? (We call this job sharing.)</TE>
<TE>   They could be placed at the lowest-ranking schools, where their
expertise would be of service to low-income children and to other
less experienced teachers. But wait--then these teachers would
actually have to teach.</TE>
<TE>   Alisa Griffis</TE>
<TE>   Blue Jay</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How are low-performing schools in California supposed to hire
credentialed teachers if there aren't any? The idea of hiring only
"highly qualified" teachers sounds great, but what is a school
principal or district supposed to do if no qualified teachers apply?
Drag them in off the streets?</TE>

<LD>Re "New Study Validates Benefits of Mammograms," Aug. 1:</LD>
<LD>   When I read the statement that "doubts raised by critics have left
many women concerned about the need for mammograms and their
potential benefits," I had to write about my own experience.</LD>
<LD>   Just three days before your article appeared, I had undergone a
lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on my left breast, the result of
a tiny, new, white speck that an astute radiologist had seen a few
weeks earlier during my annual mammogram. There were no telltale
lumps in my breast or other signs of a problem.</LD>
<TE>   However, tissue removed during a later needle biopsy showed cancer
cells present in the area of the speck, so I was scheduled for
outpatient surgery at a local hospital. After the surgery, my surgeon
told me that the cancerous lesion had been removed and the biopsy of
the lymph node showed no spread of cancer cells.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the skills of my attending doctors and technicians,
very early detection of the cancer from this year's mammogram was key
to these fortunate results. So much for those critics of annual
mammograms.</TE>

<LD>I disagree with "It's Time for L.A. to Grow Up," by Gloria Ohland
(Opinion, Aug. 4). I love living in Thousand Oaks, far from urban
congestion, and I certainly do not want to give up my privacy and
time to brush shoulders with a bunch of strangers on a train. I'd
rather spend more time and money driving on the congested freeways,
because it is private and comfortable and almost always faster than
taking Metrolink or Metro Rail.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for suburbanites, the transportation powers and
decision makers work in downtown L.A. at Caltrans and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and their perspectives and
planning are distorted by their environment.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Randak</LD>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ohland's opinion piece offers interesting food for thought about
urban design in an automobile-dependent metropolitan area. Her
message is similar to that of the Urban Land Institute advisory panel
that visited Hollywood in March 2001, underwritten in part by my
nonprofit planning company, the American City Coalition. Among
recommendations in the panel's report, "A Strategy for Hollywood's
Comeback," is to "leverage the power of mass transit," for the subway
system is a powerful resource for the community.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood and other communities can advance their revitalization
efforts through transit-oriented design and public transportation
incentives. In terms of development strategies, the panel report
suggests the creation of a transit overlay district to maximize
development potential around the subway stations; doing so also would
stimulate use of the system.</TE>
<TE>   The ULI Hollywood report suggests a list of tools that aid in the
implementation of transit-oriented development: (1) A market-based
site and phasing plan; (2) land assembly sufficient to make a project
economically viable; (3) infrastructure investment; (4) shared
parking; (5) expedited permits and reviews; (6) direct financial
participation on the part of the city or the appropriate public
authority, including the issuance of tax-exempt bonds, low-interest
loans, loan guarantees and/or equity participation. Though directed
to Hollywood revitalization, these points have salience to other
neighborhoods mentioned in Ohland's article as L.A. attempts to grow
up.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is to be commended for taking baby steps in the direction
suggested by Ohland and the ULI Hollywood report. I suggest the MTA
needs to be even more aggressive on the question of density to begin
walking upright on the transit-oriented development issue. Given the
housing and traffic congestion crises in Los Angeles and Ohland's
sense that well-designed projects and increased density can make
neighborhoods more attractive, I encourage the MTA to consider more
density than it seems to be comfortable with.</TE>

<TE>   In 1980 and 1990, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission
sold local sales tax propositions to the electorate by promising that
a new rail system would decongest Los Angeles roads. Ohland is just
repeating this old lie. In truth, fewer than 5% of Los Angeles work
trips occur on transit, and the great majority of these trips occur
on buses. Rail's share of travel in Los Angeles is tiny, and neither
the Gold Line nor transit-oriented development will make this drop in
the bucket appreciably larger. L.A. transit ridership was close to
500 million annual boardings in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 15 years of population growth and $7.5 billion in
rail expenditures, L.A. transit ridership has been reduced to a level
near 400 million annual boardings. Expensive rail systems serve few,
reduce bus service and make congestion worse, not better.</TE>

is ideal, since residents wouldn't have to own cars.... " Did Ohland
fall out of a tree? Does she ride a bike in the fast lane? She surely
can't live in Los Angeles. Does anyone believe this stuff?</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Ohland, set an example. Sell your car and a year later tell us
how great it was.</TE>

<LD>It's nice to see that Steven L. Spiegel (Opinion, Aug. 4) has picked
up the ball that the Bush administration dropped months ago regarding
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The need for "an American-led,
multinational delegation on the ground" to resolve issues there seems
all too obvious, given that we donate billions of dollars to Israel
each year and should at least show concern about a state that has
spiraled out of control. The media should have been asking President
Bush, "What are you planning to do about the situation there?" not
"What do you think about the latest explosion?"</LD>
<LD>   Is the State Department a puppet of the Oval Office? Can the State
Department put together a team to go to Israel? Can we get somebody
in charge who won't let the situation unravel and become another
Holocaust? God, I hope so.</LD>
<LD>   Erin Scarlett</LD>
<TE>   Cathedral City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It appears that in Jewish history there will be two Holocausts.
The first will have occurred when the Nazis killed the Jews in large
numbers. The second, occurring now, is when Palestinian terrorists
kill the Jews in small numbers. If the U.S. were truly fighting
terrorism, we would be more supportive of the Israelis and insist
that they bomb the Palestinians with all their military might, just
as we are proudly bombing the terrorists in Afghanistan with all of
our military might.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to see and hear Bush show the world that America is
truly with those peace-loving nations, like Israel, that are fighting
terrorism. Otherwise the president sounds like a hypocrite for
wanting to invade Iraq for terrorism that hasn't yet happened while
not being more supportive of the Israelis who are fighting terrorism
that happens every day.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Richards (letter, Aug. 4) states that the U.N. gave away
"someone else's land to foreign refugees (Europe's Jews) against the
unanimous wishes of the indigenous Arab population." There was also a
fairly large Jewish indigenous population, one must remember. When
Jews began returning to Palestine in large numbers in 1882 there were
fewer than 250,000 Arabs living there, and the majority were fairly
recent arrivals. There were also many thousands of Jews who had been
living there since biblical times. No independent Arab or Palestinian
state existed in Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Arabs did not view themselves as having a separate
identity from Syria. When the Muslim-Christian Assn. met in Jerusalem
in February 1919 to choose Palestinian representatives for the Paris
Peace Conference, the following resolution was adopted: "We consider
Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from
it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious,
linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds."</TE>
<TE>   Muslim claims to the area were preceded by Jewish claims by at
least 1,500 years. In adjudicating the partition, the U.N. and its
member states took these claims into consideration and gave some of
the land to Jews for a Jewish state and some to Arabs for a
Palestinian state. The Arabs declined to establish a Palestinian
state. The Arabs did not and continue to not accept this partition
and have fought it since 1948. What irks Arabs is that while they
refuse to accept that Jews have any claims whatsoever, other nations
validate and accept the Jewish claims. From 1948 until 1967, when
Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in a war of self-defense,
the Palestinians did not demand self-determination or statehood.</TE>
<TE>   Emil Schafer</TE>
<TE>   Riverside</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richards has it exactly right when he says of the U.S. role in
bringing peace to the Middle East, "The Arabs feel we will not be
fair and the Israelis fear that we will." Not enough attention is
paid to how Israel has for decades manipulated U.S. foreign policy to
benefit Israeli interests at the expense of American interests.</TE>
<TE>   Only in the wake of 9/11 is there a more honest and open
discussion of what U.S. objectives should be in the Middle East, and
blind support of Israel is not one of them. Americans are dying
because Israel refuses to make peace with the Palestinians; it is
that simple. It is my hope that the American people will not lose
their resolve when the time comes for the U.S. to impose a peace upon
Israelis, who will never seek it out for themselves.</TE>

<LD>Re "Weighing a Just War, or Settling an Old Score?" Commentary, Aug.
6: Robert Scheer would now lead us all to a phantasmagoric world
where President Bush is responsible for all evil except the
assassination of William McKinley and where Saddam Hussein is a
believable statesman. Considering his almost pathetic zeal to find a
country that is not led by Bush, I recommend that Scheer just leave
town for a few years, except that it sadly appears he has already
taken a left turn into hell.</LD>

<TE>   It sounds simplistic to go ahead with a massive military operation
against Iraq and, in essence, back Hussein into a corner. This gives
him the impetus to come out fighting with all he's got. Where's the
evidence and where are the allies to approve of this policy decision?
Our powers that be, especially Vice President Dick Cheney and
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the main players in the '91
Gulf War, need to step back and let the Congress fully and openly
debate the subject. Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft
just voiced his opposition.</TE>

win reelection as a wartime president? His father's administration

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Simple Pill Is Easier to Swallow," Commentary, Aug. 4: I have
no argument with Michael Kinsley's contention that "poor people"
should have prescription drug coverage. However, he ignores two
points: Payment of 95% of all out-of-pocket prescription drug costs
of more than $4,000 annually could instead be considered to be an
individual monthly premium of $333.33 and a couple's monthly premium
of $666.67--an insurance premium that only the few of us with high
drug costs (and sufficient income) would be willing to pay. And it is
possible for a husband and wife who are both receiving Social
Security disability benefits (not SSI) to have high prescription drug
costs but also have a combined income above 150% of the poverty line.</LD>
<LD>   I propose that low-income seniors and married couples where both
husband and wife are receiving Social Security disability income be
covered by a Medicare-administered prescription drug plan. This
proposal would target those most in need of prescription drug
coverage and would be the most efficient to administer.</LD>

<LD>As an active-duty military member who arrived in L.A. recently, I was
just given a shocking indoctrination into your city's parking policy.
My infraction was parking at a designated bus stop, indicated by a
sign with an M in a circle. At the time I didn't realize what that
meant, but now understand it to symbolize a "Metro" bus stop. I
received a $265 ticket.</LD>
<LD>   I am willing to pay for my faux pas and learn from the experience.
However, the threat of a parking fine is meant to be a deterrent, and
for the average American, a $50 parking fine would be quite
sufficient. For me, the $265 penalty is equal to a car payment, not a
parking fine. What I received is extortion sanctioned by a
revenue-greedy city.</LD>

<LD>"War of Words Reopens Democratic Party Rift" (Aug. 6), exploring the
Gore-Lieberman split on the strategic value of a populist stance in
2000 or now, is interesting. But after 18 months of President Bush
floundering, and a special-interests agenda, what is more important
now is our need for political leaders to rise above worrying about
the marketability of a message and speak out for what is wise and
proper for us and the world, no matter what the polls might say.</LD>
<LD>   Caring about a populist agenda used to mean doing something for
the have-nots left behind by the haves. If catering to a populist
mass now means word-smithing a message that will attract voters
hopelessly uninformed about candidates and issues--who make choices
channel-surfing style--America will become a hollow shell of its
original promise.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's simple-mindedness is unfortunate enough, but an even larger
question is how we recover from the recklessness of electing such an
unqualified candidate as the "leader of the free world" in the first
place.</LD>
<TE>   We are told by pollsters that Bush's popularity is still in the
70% range due to continuing admiration for the way he responded to
the terror attacks of Sept. 11. This nonthinking is amazing, since
virtually anyone in the Oval Office would have authorized some kind
of action to go after the 9/11 killers.</TE>
<TE>   As each cowboys-and-Indians ploy of the administration is
revealed, seemingly every week, what exactly is it we believe Bush
has personally accomplished with his war? Precisely why do we display
our "proud to be an American" stickers right now?</TE>
<TE>   While 70% of the country somehow manages not to laugh or cry about
our current Washington leadership, we flip-flop and stumble on issue
after issue of vital importance to a better society and better world.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow political candidates must emerge who will draw on genuine
experience, intelligence and caring to voice visions and policies
that are right--not merely poll-conscious.</TE>

<TE>   Ronald Brownstein can dance around all he likes on what
demographic groups did or did not vote for Al Gore in the last
presidential election. But the bottom line is that Gore won the 2000
election and would be sitting in the Oval Office right now were it
not for the illegal judicial coup committed by the Supreme Court,
which installed this current unelected president.</TE>

<LD>Maybe listening to Laker games with Chick Hearn at the microphone
wasn't quite a religious experience, but there sure were times it
reminded you of a church.</LD>
<LD>   He throws up a prayer-- it's not answered.</LD>
<LD>   Chick and religion crossed paths again Friday. In the midst of all
the celebrations of his life, there was a bit of formal business. It
was time, as the Funeral Mass program said, "to commend the deceased
to God's tender mercy and compassion."</LD>
<TE>   His family, friends, admirers and legions of the players whose
accomplishments he ingrained in so many minds gathered at St. Martin
of Tours Church in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Chick was the very essence of religion, if you consider the
origins of the word. Its roots include the French relier: to connect,
or the Latin religo: to tie, or to fasten.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Chick did to the people in this city, in an
unprecedented way.</TE>
<TE>   Chick connected everybody to the Lakers and, in the process, to
one another. He assembled the elite and he brought the masses
together.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest names in any field you could name came through the
doors at St. Martin's. Politics (Gov. Gray Davis and Mayor James
Hahn), religion (Cardinal Roger M. Mahony) entertainment (Jack
Nicholson), medicine (Dr. Frank Jobe), sportscasting (Vin Scully)
and, of course, athletics (they'll get their paragraphs later). Put
it this way: any time the first name on the check-in list is
Abdul-Jabbar, Kareem, you know it's going to be a star-studded event.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson chose an appropriate Bible verse.</TE>
<TE>   "Seest thou a man diligent in his business?" he said, quoting from
Proverbs 22:29. "He shall stand before kings, he shall not stand
before mean men."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two years of working at the same job, including 3,338
consecutive games, qualifies as diligent.</TE>
<TE>   I think one of the reasons Chick's loss was felt so deeply
throughout the city is that he was a part of childhood for people age
50 and below, and you'll feel a strong attachment for anything that
brings you back to your youth. There were different names and decades
for different people, but the common denominator was Chick.</TE>
<TE>   Three generations of childhood heroes were there Friday. Elgin
Baylor and Jerry West from the early days in L.A. Kareem, Magic, Norm
Nixon, James Worthy, Michael Cooper and Jamaal Wilkes from the
Showtime era. Current Lakers Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox, Derek Fisher,
Brian Shaw, Samaki Walker and Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   And the Laker family. Coaches (including Bill Sharman, Pat Riley
and Phil Jackson). Trainers, secretaries, equipment managers.</TE>
<TE>   Chick brought them all together.</TE>
<TE>   You could have had an all-UCLA section of John Wooden, Bill
Walton, Walt Hazzard and Keith Erickson.</TE>
<TE>   The themes Mahony stressed were faith, commitment and community.
He quoted Luke 10: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your
mind; and your neighbor as yourself."</TE>
<TE>   In the passage, when a man asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
Jesus told the tale of a man who was robbed and beaten by thieves and
left on the road. Two men passed him by, but a third saw him,
bandaged him and poured oil and wine on him, took him to the inn and
cared for him.</TE>
<TE>   Who was the neighbor? The answer was clear. So was the message.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn was a neighbor to all. When Magic announced he had
HIV, he recalled Friday, Chick reached out and put his right hand on
his face and asked how he was doing.</TE>
<TE>   A simple gesture that meant so much--in that time of ignorance
about AIDS, he reached out to touch someone carrying the most feared
virus on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   He reached out to so many sick people throughout the years,
complying with requests to say hello on the air to people's ailing
relatives. He stopped to say hi.</TE>
<TE>   And he reached out to so many Laker fans he met; sometimes merely
making eye contact was enough.</TE>
<TE>   Each person who stepped up to share his or her memories only
bolstered Mahony's themes. Fox, fighting through tears, talked about
how the strength of Chick's wife Marge enabled Chick to keep going
for all of us, so now it was our turn to be there for Marge.</TE>
<TE>   West described Chick as "an icon to the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Think about that: The NBA logo called Chick an icon.</TE>
<TE>   But the best words of all came from John Werhas, an anonymous man
to most of the people watching the service on TV, who had the task of
following Hall of Famers Johnson and West to the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick Hearn finished with the same passion he had when he began,"
said Werhas, a family friend and former Dodger who played basketball
at USC when Chick called the Trojans' games in the late 1950s. "He
didn't leave anything unfinished."</TE>
<TE>   The tissues came out when Chick's granddaughter, Shannon Newman,
and great-granddaughter Kayla came to the podium.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout the day it had to be a 10-to-1 ratio of smiles to
tears. How could there not be good memories when the subject was
Chick Hearn? How could you not smile when Cardinal Mahony--the
Archbishop of Los Angeles--wrapped up his sermon by saying: "This
one's in the refrigerator."</TE>
<TE>   "The service was very beautiful," Shannon Newman said. "It's been
a very uplifting day."</TE>
<TE>   Over at Staples Center, how could you not smile and shake your
head in wonder at the thousands of people who came by to pay their
respects to Hearn?</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's TV monitor, his headset, microphones and hand-written
notes were set up on the desk. The line stretched past columns of
seats, into the concourse, out of the building, through the Star
Plaza to Figueroa and halfway down the block toward Pico. Staples
Center officials listed the final tally on the day at 18,997--the
figure of a Laker sellout.</TE>
<TE>   The line was respectfully halted when the family stopped through.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to come down and look at it once more," Marge said.</TE>
<TE>   One day, another member of the family might occupy it. On her way
to the booth, 7-year-old Kayla passed a picture of Hearn peering
through a refrigerator and observed, "The Jell-O isn't jiggling."</TE>
<TE>   At the booth, she picked up a microphone and started to interview
Marge, then Chick's color commentator, Stu Lantz.</TE>
<TE>   Then she handled herself quite well as the subject of a live TV
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I like being on TV," she said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   It must run in the family. So does strength, because they all held
up well Friday.</TE>
<TE>   We were at Staples Center, some 13 miles from the church, but
Marge had one more religion-tinged message, a reflection on all the
happy times with Chick that outweigh the sadness of this week:</TE>
<TE>   "Count your blessings."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Rogers was a little too perfect to suit the Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers flirted with perfection again, retiring the first 21
hitters, and Rafael Palmeiro homered in the ninth inning to give the
Texas Rangers a 3-2 victory over the suspicious Indians on Friday
night at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   "I know he was scuffing the ball," insisted Milton Bradley, who
got the first hit off Rogers in the eighth inning. "There were five
or six balls that all were scuffed in the same spot. He had a sharp
fingernail or something."</LD>
<TE>   The game was delayed when Cleveland Manager Joel Skinner asked
plate umpire Andy Fletcher to check Rogers for anything illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers (12-6), who threw one of baseball's 14 modern-era perfect
games in 1994 against the Angels, was bidding to become the first
pitcher with two. But he was adamant he was not cheating.</TE>
<TE>   "Check me all you want, go ahead," the left-hander said. "They
kicked my tail quite a few times over the years and never said a word
then."</TE>
<TE>   When told the Indians collected 15 scuffed baseballs that went out
of play, Rogers replied: "I saw some that were scuffed too. A lot of
things scuff the ball. The dirt, the wall. I used those balls too.
I'm not stupid. But I didn't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers was six outs from history before walking Jim Thome on a 3-2
count to open the eighth. Bradley followed with a double to left,
ruining the left-hander's bid for the sixth no-hitter in Ranger
history.</TE>
<TE>   One out later, the shutout was gone too, as Ricky Gutierrez lined
a two-run double off the left-field wall, tying it 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers gave up two runs and two hits over eight innings, striking
out four in his 144th career victory and 100th in a Ranger uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, New York 2--Mark Ellis hit a broken-bat RBI single with
two out in the 16th inning and the Athletics, saved by two more
defensive gems from center fielder Terrence Long, beat the Yankees at
New York in the longest game in Oakland history.</TE>
<TE>   Long started a perfectly executed relay in the eighth inning to
prevent pinch-runner Enrique Wilson from scoring the go-ahead run,
and the A's eventually won in a game that took exactly six hours.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving from Kansas City to Oakland after the 1967 season,
the A's have played two games that lasted 5 hours 31 minutes, the
last coming on April 8, 1982, against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Boston 4--Doug Mientkiewicz and Corey Koskie drove in
two runs each at Boston as the Twins ended a season-high four-game
losing streak. Cristian Guzman went three for four and scored a run
for the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Nomar Garciaparra went three for four with a solo homer and two
RBIs. Boston has lost three of its first four games on a six-game
home stand.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Seattle 2--Paul Konerko hit a three-run homer and
Magglio Ordonez drove in three runs with a solo shot and a double to
lead the White Sox at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Buehrle (15-8) had a shutout bid until Jeff Cirillo's RBI
double in the eighth and gave up one run and six hits in 7 1/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Tampa Bay 4--Michael Tucker drove in Joe Randa with
a 12th-inning double, leading the Royals at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Baltimore 0--Rookie Mike Maroth (4-4) gave up six hits
in 8 1/3 innings for the victory at Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Bottom Continues Its Feeding on the Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>When the Angels compiled their wish list before last month's trading
deadline, it went something like this:</LD>
<LD>   Bench help? Want some. Bullpen help? Want some. Another starting
pitcher? Don't need one.</LD>
<LD>   Now? The Angels still say they don't need one, but Ramon Ortiz
showed few signs of escaping his monthlong funk Friday. Ortiz lost
again, and so did the Angels, in a sloppy and disheartening 5-4
defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays before 18,728 at SkyDome.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels lost their third consecutive game on a trip in which
they wanted to beat up on the bottom feeders in the American League.
After Troy Glaus was called out on strikes for the final out, Glaus
uncharacteristically argued long and loud with home plate umpire Doug
Eddings.</TE>
<TE>   "That officially gave us no more chance to win the game," Glaus
said. "That was the frustration."</TE>
<TE>   That was the final act on an evening in which the Angels bore
little resemblance to a championship-caliber club. Orlando Palmeiro
forgot the number of outs while running the bases. Ortiz dropped a
ball while covering first base. Scott Schoeneweis fielded a bunt and
nearly threw the ball into right field. Adam Kennedy dropped the ball
while trying to tag a runner. The Angels grounded into two double
plays and went two for 12 with runners in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play a real crisp ballgame, and we paid a price for
it," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lead the American League in one-run victories, but they
lost by one run Wednesday and Thursday in Chicago and Friday here.</TE>
<TE>   Since Benji Gil plopped a cigar in his mouth and joked that he was
"trying to get into smoking shape for when we win the pennant," the
Angels have lost seven of 12 games and fallen from a
percentage-points lead in the AL West to a 3 1/2-game deficit.
Attention baseball gods: Gil was joking.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing so well for quite a while. This is just a
little lull," outfielder Darin Erstad said. "But we can't afford to
have it continue. We need to go out and play a good game tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still confident, but we need to right the ship in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   To lose to the Yankees is one thing. To lose to a rebuilding
Toronto team, one that fielded a lineup Friday with four hitters and
a starting pitcher who opened the season in the minor leagues, is
quite another.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave up a season-high 10 hits in only five innings. He was
the only Angel starter to pitch at least six innings in every start
before the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   But, in his six starts since the All-Star break, he has pitched
six innings only twice. He has given up 48 hits over 27 innings in
that span, with a 1-3 record and 8.19 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, man," Ortiz said. "I don't know what happened. I
felt good. I threw a lot of very good pitches, and they hit them."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black attributed Ortiz's troubles
to a delivery flaw, one that was addressed in a between-starts
workout. Scioscia said Ortiz took "baby steps forward" in righting
himself Friday. He threw more strikes--he struck out seven and walked
one--but the Blue Jays sensed plenty of first-pitch fastballs were
coming and attacked accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said Ortiz will make his next start Wednesday. The Angels
then have two of the next five days off, and Scioscia did not rule
out skipping Ortiz in the rotation at that time to allow him extra
work with Black.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia has said he would consider adjusting the rotation in the
final weeks of the season, skipping less productive pitchers and
favoring matchups in key games. For now, he is hoping for better from
Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "This is obviously the toughest stretch he's had this season,"
Scioscia said. "Let's see how his numbers are at the end of the
season. There's nothing that gives us the idea he's not going to come
out of this."</TE>

<HD>Facing Rookie Hendrickson Is No Slam Dunk</HD>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Darin Erstad didn't have much of a scouting report on the new Toronto
pitcher, other than knowing that he could dunk.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew more about him as a basketball player than a baseball
player," Erstad said.</LD>
<LD>   He's Mark Hendrickson, who retired Erstad during his one shutout
inning Friday. Hendrickson, 28, an NBA forward turned left-handed
reliever, was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round
of the 1996 draft and played for four NBA teams before deciding to
turn baseball into a full-time job two years ago. When the Toronto
Blue Jays promoted him this week, he became the tallest player in
team history (6-foot-9) and the 10th man to play in the majors and
the NBA, a list that includes Danny Ainge, Chuck Connors and Dave
DeBusschere.</LD>
<TE>   Hendrickson, an All-Pac-10 honoree at Washington State, has fond
memories of one 1993 game--a 67-56 victory over Ed O'Bannon, Tyus
Edney and the UCLA Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "That was nice," he said. "I was a freshman, they were running
plays for me and I was scared because I didn't know what was going
on."</TE>
<TE>   That was the game after which former UCLA Coach Jim Harrick
famously said: "These are 18- to 22-year-old kids running up and down
the court with my paycheck in their mouths."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a Baseball America poll of American League managers and
coaches, Mike Scioscia was selected the third-best manager in the
league, behind playoff-proven Joe Torre of the Yankees and Lou
Piniella of the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously flattering, but there's 1,000 things more
important than that," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   For best fastball, Troy Percival ranked second to Oakland's Billy
Koch.</TE>
<TE>   For best curve, Aaron Sele ranked third behind Oakland's Barry
Zito and the Yankees' Mike Mussina. For best slider, Ramon Ortiz
ranked third behind the Yankees' Jeff Weaver and Seattle's Jeff
Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   For best hit-and-run batter, David Eckstein ranked third behind
the Yankees' Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel. For best
defensive catcher, Bengie Molina ranked second behind Texas' Ivan
Rodriguez. Troy Glaus ranked second for best infield arm, behind
Texas' Alex Rodriguez, and third for best defensive third baseman,
behind Oakland's Eric Chavez and Minnesota's Corey Koskie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have been invited to send players to a Puerto Rican
winter league team owned by Boston Red Sox infielder Carlos Baerga
and managed by former major league infielder Carmelo Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The general manager, former Dodger outfielder Candy Maldonado,
told Angel officials such players as rehabilitating pitchers Steve
Green and Derrick Turnbow would be welcome.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Players Are Close to Setting Strike Date</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball players are likely to set a strike date for later this month
or early September when their executive board meets Monday in
Chicago, two lawyers familiar with the union's deliberations said.</LD>
<LD>   "If we don't make a deal by Monday, then we will probably be
forced to act, but it's not inevitable," Arizona player
representative Craig Counsell said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think sometimes unless you set a deadline, things don't get
done," Florida's Mike Lowell said. "The irony is that setting a
strike date might avoid a strike."</LD>
<TE>   Union head Donald Fehr said it was too early to determine what
action would be taken by the board, which includes two
representatives of each team plus two players representing each
league.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on what happens over the weekend," Fehr said. "We will
go through all the options with the players, and the players will
decide what they need to do."</TE>
<TE>   While it's possible the players might pick a range of dates for a
strike, they probably will pick only one date, the two lawyers said,
speaking on condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   On July 28, 1994, the executive board set a strike date for Aug.
12. The walkout lasted 232 days, ending only after a federal judge
issued an injunction restoring the work rules of the expired
contract.</TE>
<TE>   This time, players have seemed reluctant to set a deadline that
could trigger the sport's ninth work stoppage since 1972. However,
they would rather set a date than take the chance of being locked out
following the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "We've pushed this back as far as we could as far as setting a
date," Arizona pitcher Mike Myers said. "We could have earlier in the
summer and we chose not to. Now we've decided that Monday is going to
be the day."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators from both sides have repeatedly expressed optimism in
the talks, but the sides have avoided discussing the most difficult
economic issues, preferring to make progress on lesser topics.</TE>
<TE>   "I remain cautiously optimistic about our ability to reach an
agreement in the near future," Rob Manfred, the owner's top labor
lawyer said. Asked when, he replied: "I don't want to talk about
specific dates."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran infielder Delino DeShields was put on waivers by the
Chicago Cubs for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago purchased the contract of right-handed reliever Will
Cunnane from triple-A Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   DeShields, a former Dodger in his 13th big league season, was the
Cubs' opening day starter at second base. In 67 games this year, he
batted .192 with three homers, 10 RBIs and 10 steals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Jose Vizcaino and the Houston Astros agreed to a $2
million, one-year contract extension for 2003, a raise of $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino, 34, began Friday with a .290 average, one homer and 17
RBIs. He hit .277 last season with one homer and 14 RBIs, his first
season with the Astros after playing for the New York Yankees as they
won the World Series in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Aaron Cook, one of the Colorado Rockies' top
prospects, was recalled from triple-A Colorado Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 23, takes the roster spot left open by reliever Rick White,
who was designated for assignment on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Cook was 4-4 with a 3.78 earned-run average in 10 starts at
Colorado Springs.</TE>

<HD>Sport's Legends in the Same Booth Now</HD>
<DH>Beach volleyball: Once bitterly divided over the game's
direction, Kiraly and Smith say they've erased line in sand for good
of the sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They slip on the headphones and get ready to work the microphones,
looking for all the world like another comradely broadcasting team.
But Karch Kiraly and Sinjin Smith haven't been this close--or this
friendly--in almost 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Then, they were tearing up the beach volleyball world as playing
partners. Now they've been brought together--at least once a week,
anyway, over Southland radio waves--by Leonard Armato, the player
agent who bought the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals last year and
is doing whatever it takes to promote his franchise, even if it means
persuading former-partners-turned-enemies to make nice. So far, Smith
and Kiraly side by side has worked. For an hour a week. For next to
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to get rich on the radio show," Smith said. "But
anything I can do to help build the sport, I'll do."</LD>
<TE>   As the AVP's Michelob Light Manhattan Beach Open begins its main
draw today, icons Smith and Kiraly still have the best perspectives
and strongest voices in beach volleyball. Smith, 45, retired last
year but remains an influential figurehead. Kiraly, 41, is the
sport's all-time leader with 143 tournament titles and is still an
effective player, having won the Santa Barbara Open in June with
Brent Doble.</TE>
<TE>   Legends on the beach, they started playing together in tournaments
way before prize money was offered and were the key charter members
when the AVP was formed in 1984. They saw the tour rise and fall, and
now are trying to ensure its rebound.</TE>
<TE>   They have compiled a wealth of stories, and they offer predictions
of the future of the AVP as it begins the fifth of seven events on
this year's tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back when Smith and Kiraly started playing as a team in the late
1970s, there was no AVP, merely a loosely organized string of
Southern California tournaments publicized by word of mouth. There
were no player rankings, no statistics, no records kept.</TE>
<TE>   And no cash prizes. Ice chests and beach chairs were given to the
winners.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were beverages in the ice chest, it was a big bonus,"
Smith said. "If you got a new volleyball, you were stoked. Nobody was
making any money back then."</TE>
<TE>   Summer days were endless for the beach boys, who would play on the
sand from sunrise to sunset, arriving early in the morning, staying
all day, trying to avert a loss that would knock them off the main
court. Then there were the actual tournaments. After hitting the sand
during the day, players would hit the bars and parties along the
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody went from the beach to drink and dance and have fun,"
Smith said. "Some of the top players would end up going out on
Saturdays and would show up Sunday half-drunk. They'd sweat it out
and play the best when they had to."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kiraly: "There was a lot less responsibility. Almost none of
the guys were married, none of them had kids. It was a lot of wild,
immature guys who had fun playing beach volleyball and all the things
that went along with it."</TE>
<TE>   Back when Kiraly and Smith were friends, and winning, it was fun
for them too. Out of college and playing for no pay, they couldn't
afford hotel rooms, so they crashed in an unusual place.</TE>
<TE>   "Sinjin was car-sitting for a buddy of ours who had a VW van,"
Kiraly said. "It was convenient because we didn't have to scrounge
around to find a place to sleep.... Of course, the van never started
up unless we jump-started it. We had to park it downhill, with the
emergency brake on, in order to jump-start it."</TE>
<TE>   The fans shared the beach volleyball lifestyle, camping out for
days so as not to miss out on prime seats for Manhattan and Hermosa.
By Sunday, fans were stacked 15 to 20 rows deep around main court,
the nearest ones less than two feet from the sidelines, oohing and
aahing every block and kill.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the special things," Kiraly said. "They'd
literally be inches from the court."</TE>
<TE>   If the AVP put beach volleyball on the map, it also changed
things.</TE>
<TE>   Travel schedules became an issue. In 1984, the first AVP season,
there were 18 tournaments, 14 in California. But three years later,
there were 26 tournaments, only 11 in California. Flying time was
replacing some of the previous playing/practice time.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsement deals further reduced time in the sun as players spent
more time pitching beachwear, sun block and volleyballs.</TE>
<TE>   "The sport becoming professional took us off the beach," Smith
said. "Guys weren't playing all day long, all the time. You saw guys
setting up two-hour practice slots instead."</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Kiraly, former teammates at UCLA, split in 1984. Kiraly
went the indoor route and won Olympic gold medals in 1984 and 1988.
Smith stayed on the beach, winning a record 113 tournaments with
Randy Stoklos.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, however, feuded with the AVP players-only management and
ultimately chose to play almost solely on the newer international
tour after the 1993 season. Kiraly had returned to the AVP by that
time, and he and new partner Kent Steffes became that tour's top duo.</TE>
<TE>   Smith forged a new career on the international tour and helped
beach volleyball become an Olympic sport in 1996. However, the
Federation Internationale de Volleyball, which ran the international
tour, set the ground rules for Olympic qualifying, ignoring protests
by AVP players, turning Smith and Kiraly into bitter enemies. When
they met on the sand in the '96 Atlanta Games, Kiraly partnered with
Steffes, Smith with Carl Henkel, they played a match that will
forever be the standard for measuring quality beach volleyball,
Kiraly and Steffes winning in overtime in the quarterfinals, 17-15.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly-Steffes then went on to beat Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh,
another AVP duo, for the gold medal but that was the AVP's high
point. Saddled with debt, the result of poor management decisions and
overly lucrative player payouts, the AVP filed for bankruptcy in
November 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It killed me to see what happened to the AVP in the mid-to-late
'90s," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith, who'd had a longtime friendship with Armato, was
brought back into the AVP fold last season and retired after
finishing ninth with George Roumain at Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He and Kiraly are now ... friends?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a testament to who we both are," Smith said. "No
matter what's gone on in the past, we can both stand up and promote
the sport, not only individually but side by side. The sport is that
important that you can put everything aside to help benefit it."</TE>
<TE>   The new AVP has shown some growth this season. Attendance has
increased at the first four tournaments, and NBC will televise the
next two, at Manhattan Beach this weekend and next weekend at
Chicago, renewing the network's relationship with beach volleyball
for the first time since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it will be at a high-fever pitch at Manhattan Beach and
Chicago, which is something we haven't had in many years," Kiraly
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, Smith thinks the AVP's popularity will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "Break down our sport, piece by piece ... there's no reason why
this sport can't become a major sport in the world," he said. "Look
at the Olympics. Look at the attention, the crowd, the enthusiasm
that it got at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee [Armato] did not get involved in the sport to bring
it back where it was. He wants to get it bigger than it was.... I
have a good sense of the sport, its components and how it can be sold
to the public. It may take 10 years, 15 years, maybe 20, but we will
get there."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For 14 nerve-racking pitches, the 41,897 fans in Pacific Bell Park
held their collective breath before exhaling tepid disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds was on the brink of history Friday night, trying for
the third day in a row to become the fourth member of the 600-home
run club, joining Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714) and his godfather
Willie Mays (660).</LD>
<LD>   In his first two at-bats against Pittsburgh Pirate starter Kip
Wells, the San Francisco Giant left fielder singled up the middle and
grounded out to second.</LD>
<TE>   But in the sixth inning, with camera flashbulbs illuminating the
intimate ballpark, Bonds not only entered the exclusive club, he
kicked the door down and marveled at his new sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   On the 15th pitch the right-handed Wells threw to Bonds on the
night, Bonds blasted a 2-and-1 offering and sent a towering shot 421
feet into the stands just left of center field, setting off a wild
scrum for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment Bonds swung at 9:25 p.m., he knew the ball was
gone, backing out of the box and leaning back to admire the majesty
of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to the ball's landing spot and circled the bases as
fireworks burst around the bayside stadium, a glowing and smoking
pyrotechnics display that read "BONDS 600" rose from beyond the
center field wall and the crowd chanted his name.</TE>
<TE>   That Bonds grounded out with two runners on and two out in the
eighth inning of the Giants' 4-3 loss to Pittsburgh took little, if
any, bloom off the rose of his earlier accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really understand how I got here so fast," Bonds, 38,
said of his rapid ascent to baseball's power-hitting pantheon. "It
just seems like my timing is kind of bad with Sept. 11 last year
going through 73 [single-season homers] and strike issues and stuff
this year with 600. I haven't had the best timing when it comes to
those moments, but at the same time, I'm very happy and proud of it."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit a record 73 home runs last season, three years after
Mark McGwire hit 70 to smash Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who began the 2001 season with 494 career home runs, was
17th on the all-time list. Combine last year's record-smashing
performance with the 33 times he has gone deep this year, to pass
Harmon Killebrew, McGwire and Frank Robinson, and Bonds has
leapfrogged 13 places on the career chart.</TE>
<TE>   And at an age when most players begin to slow down, Bonds is
accelerating. Since hitting his 500th home run last April, Bonds has
needed only 710 at-bats to get his 600th homer. Ruth had been the
previous quickest, needing 1,121 at-bats to go from 500 to 600.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who came to San Francisco as a free agent from the Pirates
on Dec. 8, 1992, re-signed with the Giants in January, a five-year,
$90-million deal that should see him challenge Aaron's 26-year-old
mark in the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Consider: Bonds, a four-time National League most valuable player,
needs 156 home runs to pass Aaron ... and 156 home runs ago for Bonds
came on Sept. 21, 1999, less than three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonds eschews such talk.</TE>
<TE>   "That will never happen," he said. "Every year it's harder, it
gets tougher on me. My number of games will probably go down a little
bit as the years go on and after four more years, I'm out of here.
That's it for me."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds became the second-fastest to reach 600 home runs, in both
games played and at-bats needed. He reached the feat in 2,395 games
(Ruth did it in 2,044) and hit No. 600 in his 8,212th at-bat (Ruth
did it in his 6,921st at-bat).</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Homer by Grudzielanek in eighth inning gives them
come-from-behind win over Phillies, 7-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One stunning swing of Mark Grudzielanek's bat in the bottom of the
eighth inning, and all was forgiven Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   As Grudzielanek's three-run home run sailed over the center-field
wall, giving the Dodgers an emotional 7-6 come-from-behind victory
over the Philadelphia Phillies, so too went the dejection of
shortstop Alex Cora, who made a critical eighth-inning error, the
shock of reliever Paul Shuey, who gave up an eighth-inning grand slam
to Pat Burrell, and the questions surrounding Manager Jim Tracy's
decision to pull starter Omar Daal after seven effective,
pitch-efficient innings.</LD>
<LD>   Grudzielanek, who is batting .354 since the All-Star break,
electrified a Dodger Stadium crowd of 40,688 when he smashed an 0-2
Mike Timlin fastball for his game-winning home run with two out in
the eighth to give the Dodgers their third consecutive victory and
fifth win in seven games.</LD>
<TE>   "There are so many things to think about, I just relaxed,"
Grudzielanek said. "I approached it differently--just see it and hit
it. Take everything out of my mind and let my hands react to it. It
was total reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek received a standing ovation and came out of the
dugout for a curtain call, only moments after Burrell had silenced
the same crowd with his two-out grand slam off Shuey in the top of
the eighth, which gave the Phillies a 6-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul Lo Duca, mired in a two-for-30 slump, singled to left off
Rheal Cormier with two out in the bottom of the eighth, and
pinch-hitter Eric Karros singled to right off Timlin. Grudzielanek
followed with his sixth homer of the season, and closer Eric Gagne
threw a one-two-three ninth for his 38th save.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys don't quit," Tracy said. "This is a huge game for us
after what happened in the top of the eighth. This may be a game we
look back on and say, this was a special game to win.... You make a
mistake that can cost you a game and spiral you downward, and then
come back to win. That can catapult a team into thinking it's not
going to lose for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Daal limited the Phillies to two runs and seven hits in seven
innings, not allowing a runner to reach second base from the third
through seventh innings. He had thrown only 73 pitches and looked
fresh when Tracy pulled the left-hander for a pinch-hitter in the
bottom of the seventh with the Dodgers leading, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill started the eighth and allowed a leadoff single to
Tomas Perez. Pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee struck out, and Phillies'
Manager Larry Bowa sent left-handed Jeremy Giambi up to hit for Doug
Glanville.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy summoned left-hander Jesse Orosco, and Bowa countered with
right-handed Jason Michaels, who flied to center. In came Shuey, who
got Placido Polanco to hit a slow roller to shortstop, but Cora
charged and bobbled the ball for an error.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey, who gave up three runs in the eighth inning of a 7-5 loss
to the Phillies, got ahead of Bobby Abreu, 0 and 2, but walked him.
The right-hander went 0 and 2 to Burrell and thought he struck him
out with a fastball near the outside corner that home plate umpire
Paul Emmel called a ball.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell then golfed a 2-2 low-and-away curveball to deep left
field, where Marquis Grissom, who homered in the first and third
innings, leaped over the short wall but came up about a foot short.
Burrell's sixth grand slam of his career gave the Phillies four
unearned runs and a 6-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When Burrell hit that ball, my heart sunk lower than anyone in
the stadium," said Shuey, who has struggled with a 7.50 earned run
average in eight appearances since being acquired from Cleveland on
July 28. "Then [Grudzielanek] takes you from being.... It's still a
bad outing, but you have to take the positives from it. Grud was the
hero, and I got swept to the side."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey thought he located the pitch well and said it was the first
time in his eight-year career he could recall giving up a home run on
a curveball.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had taken a 1-0 lead in the first when Grissom homered
off Philadelphia starter Brett Myers. Burrell's leadoff homer and
Tomas Perez's RBI double in the top of the second put the Phillies
ahead, 2-1, but Grissom struck again in the third, belting a 2-2
Myers pitch for a home run.</TE>

<HD>Jordan's Back Hurts; Brown Almost Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While pitcher Kevin Brown moved one big step closer to returning from
back surgery Friday night, there was concern that the Dodgers might
lose left fielder Brian Jordan to a back injury.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who sat out Friday night's game against the Phillies and
is doubtful for tonight, injured the left side of his lower back
while avoiding a pitch Monday in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The back stiffened while the Dodgers' charter plane sat on a
runway for 4 1/2 hours in Philadelphia before a five-hour flight home
Sunday night, but Jordan still played Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
night. He aggravated the injury Thursday when he made a diving catch
of Jason Kendall's fly ball in the fourth inning.</LD>
<TE>   "I need a day off," Jordan said. "The doctor thinks it's just a
strain--we'll see. I'm concerned because I sat out for three-quarters
of the 1997 season [with a back injury]. I don't want to go that
route."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had a herniated disk in 1997--the same injury that
sidelined Brown for two months this season--but he opted for
rehabilitation instead of surgery and played in only 47 games for the
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if this injury felt similar to the one in 1997, Jordan, who
has battled a sore left knee all season, said: "I don't know.... I'm
trying to say no, just to be on the positive side. They don't think
it's a disk problem. They think it's muscular."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is batting .271 with 13 homers and 50 runs batted in, but
he hasn't homered since July 6 and has only six RBIs since the
All-Star break. He will likely undergo a precautionary MRI test if
his condition doesn't improve in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Though he knocked in two runs Thursday night, his first
multiple-RBI game since July 2, Jordan was not in peak physical
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared to turn it loose and swing hard," Jordan said. "I
don't want to be in a position where I'm worried about swinging the
bat hard. Then I made that diving catch, and that didn't help. But if
I'm gonna play, I'm gonna lay it on the line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown, making his second and probably final minor league
rehabilitation start before being activated next week, gave up one
earned run and five hits in six innings for triple-A Las Vegas at
Edmonton on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Brown struck out four and walked one during an 86-pitch outing in
which he threw 56 strikes and retired the first 11 batters. General
Manager Dan Evans, who attended the game, said Brown's fastball was
clocked between 87-90 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he had his best stuff, but he battled," Evans said.
"He competed real well and had no pain or problems afterward."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said the Dodgers won't make a decision on whether Brown
needs another rehab start until Sunday or Monday. "He's having no
problems now, but I want to wait and see how he feels [today] and
Sunday," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   When Brown returns, Omar Daal or Kazuhisa Ishii will go to the
bullpen. Daal's bullpen success this season--he went 4-0 with an 0.88
earned-run average before replacing Brown in the rotation in early
June--makes him the most likely candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii hasn't pitched in relief since 1994 in Japan, and his
control problems--he leads the National League with 91 walks--are a
major deterrent to him being used in relief. But Ishii has been
rocked for 17 earned runs in 12 2/3 innings of his last three starts,
and the Dodgers' patience with him is wearing thin.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things you have to ask--can you bring him in
with runners on base? What is his warmup time? What's his comfort
level out of the bullpen?" Manager Jim Tracy said of Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do what's best for the Dodgers, not what's best for any
individual."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Hot-hitting Adrian Beltre remained in the third spot
Friday night, even with right-hander Brett Myers pitching for
Philadelphia, and Tracy said he could envision Beltre staying there
"as long as he has quality at-bats time after time." With Shawn Green
heating up at the plate, Tracy likes the idea of batting them third
and fourth. "I've seen [San Francisco shortstop] Rich Aurilia get
some awfully good pitches to hit with [Barry] Bonds behind him in the
order," Tracy said. "Or you can take your choice, pitch to Beltre or
Green." Duckworth, the Phillie right-hander, struck out the first six
Dodgers he faced on Monday but got his third consecutive no-decision
in Philadelphia's 7-5 win. He ranks eighth in the NL with 131
strikeouts. Nomo is 5-1 with a 2.88 ERA in his last 10 starts.</TE>

<HD>Rookies Quickly Achieving Goals</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Galaxy's Ruiz and Revolution's Twellman are 1-2 in
MLS goal scoring and figure to battle for MVP award. Teams meet
tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They have played only 38 Major League Soccer games between them, yet
two rookies are already the talk of the league.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Ruiz of the Galaxy and Taylor Twellman of the New England
Revolution got to know each other only last week as fellow MLS
All-Stars in their exhibition match against the U.S. national team.
But they are developing a nice little personal rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   They are battling for league scoring honors and will meet on the
same field tonight at the Rose Bowl when the Galaxy plays host to the
Revolution. Ruiz has become a fan favorite with his league-leading 16
goals, but Twellman, with one fewer goal, has two more points, an
MLS-best 34.</LD>
<TE>   Their success in their initial seasons has stirred talk of which
will be named the league's most valuable player. Ruiz, 22, may have
an edge, having accounted for 59% of his team's scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that the Galaxy has had a league MVP before, but
this might be the time," Coach Sigi Schmid said. "Not only the goals
he's gotten but the percentage of goals he's gotten for this team."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, a Guatemalan who signed with MLS as a Galaxy discovery pick
Feb. 5, appreciates the MVP talk. He said he'd wanted to make an
impact but didn't think it would happen this quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising but it also reflects hard work," Ruiz said
through a translator. "Nothing comes easy. I knew that I came to this
league with the idea to work very hard. I'm glad that this is
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Twellman, also 22, has been just as big a story for New England.
After spending two years at the University of Maryland, he signed
with the German club TSV 1860 Munich but spent most of his two years
on the reserve squad. He declined a two-year option with the club and
joined MLS as the second overall pick in this year's SuperDraft.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman and Steve Ralston have become a potent combination.
Ralston leads the league with 15 assists, seven on goals by Twellman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little different than the forwards I've played with,"
Ralston said. "Roy Lassiter and Mamadou [Diallo] are breakaway-type
players and Taylor is a great finisher. He attacks everything in the
box and he's great on crosses. He's done everything for us."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid says the 5-foot-9 Ruiz and 5-11 Twellman have slight
differences tactically.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is, they both thrive on scoring goals," Schmid
said. "For them, it's like lunch. It's something they want every
day."</TE>
<TE>   Each player respects the other's abilities. In the teams' first
meeting May 23, Ruiz and Twellman scored in the Revolution's 3-2
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz has already put the word out on his high-scoring counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already talked to [defender] Alexi Lalas," he said with a
laugh. "I told him, 'I don't want any surprises. You've got to take
care of this guy.' "</TE>

<KH>GOLF ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Woods Appears at His Best Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even coming off his best round of the year, Tiger Woods isn't ready
to count the Buick Open as his 33rd victory on the PGA Tour and
fourth this year.</LD>
<LD>   "You just have to continue to make birdies," he said. "You can't
go out there and sit around and shoot a couple of 70s out there and
know that the tournament is over."</LD>
<LD>   Woods, playing in his first tournament since his chance for a
Grand Slam ended, shot a nine-under 63 Friday and pulled away from
the field with a four-stroke lead after two rounds in the Buick Open
at Grand Blanc, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   It was his best round since last year's Byron Nelson Classic and
his frequent smiles on the course at Warwick Hills showed he enjoyed
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an awful lot of fun being out there and hitting the ball
this way," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   At 10 under are Scott Verplank, who shot a 65, and J.J. Henry, who
was five under for the second consecutive day. Verplank's first win
as a professional was the Buick Open in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has won 15 of 19 tournaments he has led or been the
co-leader of after 36 holes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who began the day two strokes behind Kent Jones, had five
birdies on the front nine and two birdies and an eagle on the back.</TE>
<TE>   He has gone 51 holes without a bogey, dating to the third hole of
the final round of the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   The last major, the PGA Championship, is next week at Hazeltine in
Minnesota. Woods appears ready for it, although he insists he's not
using the Buick Open as a warmup.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I am not practicing for next week," Woods said. "I do all
that on the range. If I am going to go out there and shape shots for
next week, I do that on the range. When I am out there playing, I am
trying to win."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who has won seven of the last 12 major tournaments
including this year's Masters and U.S. Open, has a chance to add to
his impressive resume next week.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods wins the PGA Championship, he would be the first player
to win three majors in one year twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Buick Open is one of three tournaments Woods has played in at
least three times without winning. The others are the Nissan Open and
Phoenix Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Mason shot a course-record eight-under-par 64 to take a
two-stroke lead over Hale Irwin after the first round of the Senior
PGA Tour's 3M Championship at Blaine, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, the Georgia club pro who played in a group with course
designer Arnold Palmer and Miller Barber, birdied seven of the last
12 holes to break the mark of 66 set last year by three players in
the first senior event on the TPC of the Twin Cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep pinching myself when I see all the stars I've seen play on
TV and now I'm right there with them," Mason said.</TE>
<TE>   The round was the lowest of Mason's 12-event senior career,
topping the 65 he shot in May in the opening round of his
breakthrough victory in the NFL Golf Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, who lost in a playoff to Hubert Green last week in the Long
Island Classic, had a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Green was another stroke back at 67, and senior rookie Fuzzy
Zoeller, Allen Doyle, Sammy Rachels, Rocky Thompson and Leonard
Thompson followed at 68.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball Hall of Famer Johnny Bench had the worst round with an
81.</TE>

<HD>Webb Hot; Sorenstam Cuts Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TURNBERRY, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Karrie Webb made two eagles to improve her chances of a third Women's
British Open title, and four-time major champion Annika Sorenstam
won't be around to challenge her.</LD>
<LD>   Webb shot a one-under-par 71 Friday and is one stroke behind
co-leaders Candie Kung and Carin Koch, who are tied at eight-under
136.</LD>
<LD>   Americans Beth Bauer and Tina Barrett, and Spain's Paula Marti
were tied for third with Webb at seven-under 135.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam followed an opening 73 with a 77, finishing with a
36-hole total of six-over 150, missing the cut for the first time in
75 events. The cut was one over.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, who won six tournaments this year, including the
Nabisco Championship, had made the cut in 74 consecutive tournaments,
dating to the U.S. Women's Open in June 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I had two unplayables and a triple in two days and, if you have
that, you can't really score here," Sorenstam said. "It's a bummer
because I came here feeling good about my game and I had prepared
exactly the way I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Kung, a former USC standout, missed a four-foot par putt on the
last hole, losing sole possession of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to win tournaments, you have got to make all of
those," Kung said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Juli Inkster shot a 78 and missed the cut with
a nine-over 153.</TE>

<HD>From Turf to the Dirt, De Seroux Is Covered</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer's Azeri and Astra, winners of seven
graded stakes in 2002, are coming back for more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laura De Seroux is directing her version of "The A Team" these days.
Those interested in watching new episodes should tune in at Del Mar
on Sunday and at Arlington Park next Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, Mr. T fans, but this isn't about a revival of a hokey
television show.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, De Seroux is calling the shots for Azeri and Astra, her
dynamic duo. The trainer, who once served as an exercise rider for
the late Charlie Whittingham, will send out Azeri, the country's top
female dirt runner, in Sunday's $300,000 Clement L. Hirsch Handicap
at Del Mar.</LD>
<TE>   Six days later, Astra, generally considered the nation's best
female turf runner, will try for yet another stakes victory in the
$500,000 Beverly D. in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson, Azeri and Astra
have been near perfect in 2002. Each has lost only once while
combining to win seven graded stakes.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old daughter of Jade Hunter, Azeri has moved to the head
of her division with four consecutive Grade I victories at three
tracks. After finishing Santa Anita with a victory in the Santa
Margarita, she went east and won the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn Park in
Hot Springs, Ark., then returned to California and won the Milady and
Vanity at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   She has won from the lead or coming from off the pace, and if she
stays sound, should be tough in the Breeders' Cup Distaff on Oct. 26
at Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible the 1 1/16-mile Hirsch, a Grade II known as the
Chula Vista Handicap from 1937-99, will be Azeri's next-to-last race
before the Breeders' Cup. She will carry top weight of 126 pounds
Sunday, meaning she'll be conceding 10-13 pounds to her five
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time trainer Mel Stute won Del Mar's Sorrento Stakes, it
was 1986. Brave Raj beat Breech and Footy, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The filly returned later in the meet to win the Del Mar Debutante,
then, less than three months later, Brave Raj, who was owned by the
late Dolly Green, scored her biggest victory, winning the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Stute, who turned 75 on Thursday, would like to repeat the hat
trick this year with Buffythecenterfold.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten in two starts, the 2-year-old Capote filly will try for
her second stakes victory in the Sorrento, a Grade II at 6 1/2
furlongs. The ill-fated Tempera won the race last year before going
on to success in the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park. Tempera became
ill last spring at Churchill Downs and had to be euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Frank Stronach bought a majority interest in
Buffythecenterfold from owner Allen Brian and it is unclear whether
the filly will remain with Stute beyond today's race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, Preakness and
clinched horse-of-the-year honors with his third victory over Easy
Goer later in the year in the Breeders' Cup Classic, is fighting for
his life.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old, a leading sire in Japan, is battling laminitis in
his left foreleg. His condition has reportedly worsened in recent
days.</TE>
<TE>   According to Teruya Yoshida, who owns Shadai Stallion Station,
where Sunday Silence resides, a decision could be made within a week
on whether to euthanize the horse.</TE>
<TE>   "[It would happen] if he gets to the point where he appears to be
in terrible pain or can't stand," Yoshida was quoted as saying. "It
would be a formal decision involving several people."</TE>
<TE>   Trained and owned in part by Whittingham, Sunday Silence won the
Santa Anita Derby before handling Easy Goer in the Derby and in a
thrilling Preakness. Easy Goer spoiled his bid for a Triple Crown
with a convincing victory on his home track in the Belmont Stakes,
then Sunday Silence capped his year with a victory in the Breeders'
Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   If Sunday Silence has to be euthanized, it will be another blow to
the Japanese breeding industry. Shadai also lost successful sires End
Sweep and El Condor Pasa last month.</TE>

<LD>Horse racing could have a new all-time earnings leader today.</LD>
<LD>   Jockey Pat Day could surpass Chris McCarron with a victory in
either the $500,000 Sword Dancer Handicap aboard With Anticipation or
the $600,000 West Virginia Derby at Mountaineer Park aboard Pass
Rush.</LD>
<LD>   McCarron, who retired after riding Came Home to victory in the
Affirmed Handicap on June 23, finished with $264,351,679 in career
earnings and Day trailed by less than $115,000 entering Friday's
races at Saratoga.</LD>
<TE>   With Anticipation, a 7-year-old gelded son of Relaunch out of the
California-bred mare Fran's Valentine, is the one to beat in the
Sword Dancer, a Grade I at 1 1/2 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Augustin Stable and trained by Jonathan Sheppard, With
Anticipation is the defending champion. Ridden by Day, the
Pennsylvania-bred led throughout at 6-1 and beat King Cugat by
three-quarters of a length last Aug. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 11th of 13 career victories for With Anticipation, who
gamely held off Denon and eventual Eddie Read Handicap winner Sarafan
to take the United Nations Handicap at Monmouth Park in his most
recent race on July 6.</TE>
<TE>   Denon, who is trained by Bobby Frankel, is also in the Sword
Dancer lineup. Other top contenders include Volponi, English import
Hawkeye, 1998 Sword Dancer winner Cetewayo and Startac, who is trying
to end a six-race losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   While the Sword Dancer could go a number of different ways, the
$125,000 Straight Deal at Laurel looks like a one-horse race.</TE>
<TE>   Xtra Heat, who suffered a rare defeat when beaten by Gold Mover in
the Princess Rooney at Calder on July 13, should win for the 22nd
time in 29 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The West Virginia Derby attracted, besides Pass
Rush, local shippers Captain Squire and Calkins Road along with Lone
Star Derby winner Wiseman's Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Cornelio Velasquez. The jockey is running away with the
title at Calder, winning with about 26% of his mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Guadalupe Macias and Carlos Montalvo. The jockeys are a
combined five of 158 at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Adalgisa on top with
Painted Lady and Kelli's Ransom in the two hole and all in the third
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 1/30. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $5.60/$181.20. Total money bet: $238.</TE>

<LD>Memo to Jim Tracy:</LD>
<LD>   1. You can't use or warm up the same relief pitchers every day and
then lament your bullpen is tired. That's under your control, though
it wouldn't hurt for pitchers to have an efficient inning instead of
those 30-pitch jobs we've been seeing.</LD>
<LD>   2. In Philadelphia, Hideo Nomo had retired the last eight batters
and hadn't given up a hit since the third inning. But you removed him
after seven and it took the bullpen less than an inning to lose the
game.</LD>
<TE>   3. Am I the only one to notice that every time Giovanni Carrara
comes in with the game on the line it spells defeat for the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   Richard Turner</TE>
<TE>   Fontana</TE>
<TE>   If there were performance clauses in baseball, and not just
incentives, Eric Karros and Kevin Brown would owe the Dodgers money.</TE>
<TE>   They should give Karros a fungo and let him hit infield practice.
He does it so well for other clubs, he should at least do it for the
one he's employed by.</TE>
<TE>   Karros is about as graceful as the Scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz"
and Vice President Cheney is a picture of perfect health compared to
Brown. Brown will be back on the DL the first time he squares around
to bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Melton</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers should learn from previous seasons of unsuccessfully
attempting to insert Kevin Brown into the rotation during a
late-season wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Two alternate solutions: (1) Bring him out of the bullpen for two
weeks; (2) Expand to a six-man rotation.</TE>

<TE>   Jim Tracy may have to be conked on his thick skull with a baseball
bat to make him realize how stupid it is to save Eric Gagne to lock
the barn in the ninth if the horses are escaping in the eighth. Sure,
Gagne is valuable as a closer, but in an earlier crisis he can be
absolutely indispensable.</TE>

<TE>   I've been a Dodger fan for more than 40 years, and I thoroughly
enjoyed the first half of this season. But it's time for the manager
and his veteran staff to be creative with the offense. It's time for
fundamental baseball. Maybe it's time for the staff to watch a few
tapes of the 1963-65 Dodger teams.</TE>

<TE>   Story Came Along in the Nick of Time</TE>
<TE>   Re: "Name Dropping," [Aug. 8] the story on sports nicknames:
First, a little history lesson: Owner Charlie Finley thought of the
nickname "Catfish" for pitcher Jim Hunter in the 1960s, when Finley's
Athletics were still in Kansas City, not in the 1970s, after they
moved to Oakland (in 1968).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of which, the story brought back to me the day I attended
an Oakland baseball game in the early 1970s. Sitting next to me was
an exuberant A's fan, who was marveling about the flamboyant
nicknames given to members of the A's pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We have Catfish Hunter," he gushed. "Blue Moon Odom, Mudcat
Grant, Diego Segui ... "</TE>

<TE>   Players Agree to Test? Read the Fine Print</TE>
<TE>   As baseball management and players continue to reprise their roles
of "Dumb and Dumber," it is the fans who are being played for the
fools as the union allegedly agrees to steroid testing.</TE>
<TE>   The players' union did not agree this week to random testing for
steroids. They agreed to test to see if there is a problem with
steroids. The plan calls for testing in 2003 and if 5% of the tests
come back positive, there will be a follow-up survey in 2004. That
means no firm action until at least 2005. And the proposal has no
terms for penalties when players are found to be "on the juice."</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to the players. Once again, thanks to the power of
your union, you are being allowed a few more years of being on a
substance that is illegal to the rest of us in this country.</TE>

<TE>   The Last Word on Chick</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect, at least one good thing has come with Chick
Hearn's passing. It has allowed the public to bear witness to the
fact that T.J. Simers, like the Tin Man, does indeed possess a heart.</TE>
<TE>   While reading Page Two on Wednesday, one could almost hear the
drip of tears on Simers' keyboard as he wrote his touching ode. Chick
is probably looking down from above right now, smiling, headset in
place, knowing that his final act on earth caused the mustard to come
off the biggest hot dog of all.</TE>

<LD>The race immediately following tonight's main event, the $125,000
Vessels Maturity, isn't a bad contest in its own right.</LD>
<LD>   Just Down The Lane and A Secret Account, who have combined for 25
wins, will take on Runahalf and Texas Classy, among others, in the
350-yard race for $100,000 claimers.</LD>
<LD>   Just Down The Lane, a 5-year-old Lanes Leinster gelding owned by
Mark Smith and trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, was second to Classic
First when that one set a track record for 220 yards in the
Firecracker Handicap on July 4. Before that, he had won three of four
to begin 2002, including the Irvine Handicap on March 15.</LD>
<TE>   A Secret Account, who is owned and trained by Rodney Hart, is
trying to regain his 2001 form. He won six of 15 last year but is
winless in six starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and trained by Juan Aleman, Runahalf will be trying to start
a new win streak in the evening's penultimate race. He had taken four
in a row before finishing third as the 3-2 favorite in the
Firecracker.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Delusively. 2. Alota Traffic. 3. Shescape. 4. Brisco
Lamb. 5. Issues Falstaff. 6. The Royal Music. 7. La Yahualiea. 8.
Stings. 9. A Ransom. 10. Just Down The Lane. 11. First Royal
Princess.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Delusively, Perry Nelson and Bys Bug in the first,
Breaking Up, Azure Royal Treasure and Alota Traffic in the second,
single Shescape in the third and Brisco Lamb and Costly Chic in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Storm Run is a first-timer in the sixth for a
trainer, Harry Nelson, who has had a solid meet. JD Pesky switches to
jockey Eddie Garcia in the 11th.</TE>

<HD>A Ransom Demands Attention</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Gelding will try to become first three-time
winner of Vessels Maturity tonight at Los Alamitos.</DH>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In addition to qualifying for the $500,000 Champion of Champions on
Dec. 14, A Ransom can make some history with a win in tonight's
$125,000 Vessels Maturity at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   A victory by the 6-year-old gelding would make him the first
three-time winner of the Maturity, a Grade I contested at 400 yards.
He is one of only three to have won the race twice, joining Jazzing
Hi, who won in 1990 and '91, and Avison (1994-95).</LD>
<LD>   A Ransom, a California-bred son of First Down Dash who is owned by
John and Kathie Bobenrieth and trained by Connie Hall, would also
move closer to becoming quarter horse racing's 34th millionaire with
a victory. The $75,000 payday would push his earnings to $992,056 if
he wins for the 20th time in 31 starts.</LD>
<TE>   A one-length winner over Corona Kool in the 2001 Maturity, A
Ransom concluded last year with a stakes score at Sunland and has won
his first two starts of the meet at Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Spencer Childers Handicap on June 22, beating
Whosleavingwho by half a length as the 1-2 favorite, then qualified
for the Maturity with a head victory in his trial July 26. His final
time of 19.81 seconds tied Whosleavingwho as the fastest qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   Besides A Ransom, the Maturity field also includes four other
horses who have had little trouble finding the winner's circle during
their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Whosleavingwho, the champion 3-year-old gelding of 2001, won his
trial by a nose. It was his 11th victory in 22 races for owners Jim
Geller and Kim Kessinger and trainer Paul Jones. The Texas-bred won
eight of 12 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Dashing Knud, who won the Los Alamitos Million in 2000, has taken
12 of 21 starts and was only half a length behind A Ransom in the
Maturity trial. The gelding has won twice in five starts as a
4-year-old and he is the race's lone millionaire. He has earned
$1,034,059.</TE>
<TE>   Classic First has won 10 of 20 and is the Los Alamitos
record-holder for 220 yards.</TE>

<HD>He Wanted a Seat, Goux Gave Him the Chair</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 2, USC will open the college football season against Auburn
without the toughest Trojan of them all, former captain and assistant
coach Marv Goux, who died last month of cancer at 69.</LD>
<LD>   From 1957-82, Goux was an assistant to coaches Don Clark, John
McKay and John Robinson. During his tenure, the Trojans won five
national championships and played in 11 Rose Bowls, winning eight.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his motivational speeches to players and fans, Goux was
passionate about the annual USC-Notre Dame game. As a freshman wide
receiver for the Trojans in 1982, I made the mistake of sitting in
one of the chairs reserved for Goux's defensive linemen at halftime
of a game against the Irish and, as a result, felt the wrath of Goux.
It was an honor to be chewed out by Goux in his last game as a USC
coach.</LD>
<TE>   "On Friday nights, he would get up before a crowd of people and we
all would be riveted by his words," said Ken Del Conte, who played on
USC's 1962 national championship team. "He made you want to go out on
the field and sacrifice everything for the team. You didn't know
whether to cry, yell or wet your pants ... or all three."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for kickoff return yards in
a season?</TE>
<TE>   Trade spin: Randy Hill of Foxsports.com on the NBA off-season:
"The [Philadelphia] Sixers traded center Dikembe Mutombo--[Allen]
Iverson's Georgetown crony--to the New Jersey Nets for Keith Van Horn
and Todd MacCulloch and 15 minutes after the trade was announced,
witnesses say they saw Philly Coach Larry Brown standing outside
First Union Center ... naked."</TE>
<TE>   Hothead: Former Seattle Mariner Kevin Mitchell, managing the
minor-league Sonoma County Crushers, has been suspended for three
games for bumping an umpire who had called strike three on Mitchell's
cousin, outfielder Keith Mitchell. It marks Kevin Mitchell's third
suspension from the Independent League--including the entire 2000
season for punching a rival owner.</TE>
<TE>   But possibly aces: From the Caught on the Fly column in the
Sporting News: "Finally, a Phils phan's ultimate throwaway hand:
Scott Rolen and J.D. Drew--a pair of Cards, no hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1996, Cigar's bid for a 17th
consecutive victory ended when longshot Dare And Go passed the super
horse in the stretch and pulled away to win the Pacific Classic at
Del Mar. Cigar, who finished three lengths behind Dare And Go, failed
to break a tie with Citation for the record winning streak by a North
American-based horse in the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: MarTay Jenkins, who had 2,186 yards for the Arizona
Cardinals in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tampa Bay Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden doesn't mind
being compared to the Chucky doll from the "Child's Play" movies
because he understands where his scowling demeanor comes from.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people know my name is Jon anymore," Gruden told
the St. Petersburg Times. "I'd really like everything to go so
smoothly that you never have that side of you. I'm sure if one of you
has a bad day, or gets caught in traffic or shanks your three-iron, I
guarantee you if they put the camera on you, you'd look very similar
to Chucky. You should see my mom. I probably got it from her."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lleyton Hewitt outlasted Andre Agassi, 7-5, 6-3, Friday night in a
battle of baseline bombers to advance to the semifinals of the
$2.95-million Cincinnati Masters Series at Mason, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, and Agassi, a former
No. 1, provided some brilliant and some spotty tennis in the match
that lasted 1 hour 41 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "He made some errors early, and I knew that would change," Agassi
said. "I expected him to not go down without a fight."</LD>
<TE>   Agassi committed 30 unforced errors and failed to hold serve five
times; Hewitt committed 29 unforced errors and failed to hold twice,
both times in the first set.</TE>
<TE>   "I was struggling early in the week and knew I had to step it up
tonight," Hewitt said. "I feel comfortable, and I think I've gotten
better and better as the week has gone along."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt will play Fernando Gonzalez, who eliminated 12th-seeded
Andy Roddick, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6).</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, eighth-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Wayne Arthurs,
6-4, 7-6 (2), and No. 16 Carlos Moya beat Rainer Schuettler, 7-6 (3),
6-1, to set up the other semifinal.</TE>

<TE>   Michael Waltrip qualified second in a Chevrolet at 122.635. The
Pontiac of Tony Stewart was third at 122.485. Earlier this week,
NASCAR put Stewart on probation for the rest of the season for an
altercation with a photographer last Sunday at the Brickyard 400.</TE>
<TE>   A late red flag helped Patrick Carpentier win the provisional pole
for Sunday's CART Mid-Ohio Grand Prix in Lexington.</TE>
<TE>   Carpentier posted a fast lap of 121.253 mph with about 90 seconds
to go in the one-hour qualifying session when Tony Kanaan and Toro
Takagi both spun out. Kanaan was able to continue, but Takagi lost
power, bringing out both the red flag signaling a temporary stoppage
and the checkered flag ending the session.</TE>
<TE>   Points leader Mike Bliss won the pole for the NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series' Federated Auto Parts 200 at Nashville Superspeedway in
Gladeville, Tenn. Bliss, five points ahead of Terry Cook and 29 in
front of Jason Leffler after 14 of 22 events, drove his Chevrolet to
a track-record speed of 157.322 mph on the 1.333-mile concrete oval.</TE>

<TE>   Alabama junior starting fullback Donnie Lowe, who has had three

redshirt season.</TE>

<HD>Carter Directs Cowboys Past Raiders, 20-6</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quincy Carter directed the Dallas Cowboys to scores on their first
three possessions Friday night, spoiling the exhibition coaching
debut of Bill Callahan with a 20-6 victory over the Oakland Raiders
at Irving, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, who started eight games in an injury-plagued rookie season
last year, had a promising start in new offensive coordinator Bruce
Coslet's West Coast-style offense. He played the first half,
completing 10 of 13 passes for 96 yards and one touchdown, and
running twice for 24 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Callahan, who was promoted from offensive coordinator when Jon
Gruden went to Tampa Bay, saw the Raiders turn in a sloppy
performance that featured no touchdowns and 17 penalties for 170
yards.</LD>
<TE>   Rich Gannon led a long scoring drive on Oakland's opening
possession, completing a 39-yard pass to Jerry Porter to set up
Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal with 3:46 left in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan removed most of his starters after that series, and from
that point on, the Raiders struggled behind second-year quarterback
Marques Tuiasosopo.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 12, Detroit 6--Will Demps intercepted a pass by Joey
Harrington and returned it 18 yards for a touchdown with 1:55 left,
giving the Ravens a victory at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions gave up eight sacks and managed only two field goals by
Jason Hanson, one of which was set up by a 51-yard interception
return by Brian Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Raven quarterback Chris Redman completed 10 of 20 passes for 93
yards with an interception, and backup Jeff Blake completed eight of
15 for 75 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 23, Jacksonville 13--Michael Vick led two scoring drives
and first-round draft pick T.J. Duckett got off to promising start
for the Falcons at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was seven for 12 for 58 yards and guided the Falcons to two
field goals in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Duckett, a 254-pound running back, ran 10 times for 55 yards,
including a 25-yard gain that featured a ferocious stiff arm.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 24, Buffalo 17--In a little more than one quarter, Drew
Bledsoe went nine for 11 for 136 yards, threw two touchdown passes
and had one pass intercepted for the Bills at Orchard Park, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals won the game in the second half with the second- and
third-stringers on the field. Akili Smith hit Sean Brewer with a
strike in traffic for the go-ahead, eight-yard touchdown with 2:42
left in the third quarter.</TE>

<HD>Durazo's Two Homers Save Arizona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erubiel Durazo homered twice, including a two-out drive in the ninth
inning that led the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Florida Marlins,
2-1, Friday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Durazo, who had homered in the fourth off Brad Penny, connected in
the ninth against Braden Looper (0-4), a ball that hit against a wall
behind the swimming pool in right center.</LD>
<LD>   It was the oft-injured slugger's 13th homer in 131 at-bats this
season and gave the World Series champions their 14th victory in 18
games.</LD>
<TE>   Miguel Batista gave up two hits in eight innings but Derrek Lee
hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth off Byung-Hyun Kim
(6-2), who blew a save for the fifth time in 33 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Kim hit Andy Fox with a pitch and walked Mike Lowell. Kevin Millar
then flied out to left as Luis Gonzalez threw to third to catch Fox
trying to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell took second on the throw and scored on Lee's sinking liner
to right field. David Dellucci, whose diving catch ended a Marlin
threat in the eighth, dived again, but the ball popped out of his
glove.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Penny struck out a season-high 10, giving up four hits and
walking one.</TE>
<TE>   After Durazo's first homer, Penny retired 11 of the next 12
batters before he was lifted for pinch-hitter Tim Raines in the
eighth. Batista walked Raines with two outs, and Dellucci charged in
to catch the liner by Luis Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   Florida didn't get a runner past first base until the sixth
inning, when Penny singled for the Marlins' second hit.</TE>
<TE>   He was forced at second on a grounder by Castillo, who then stole
his major league-leading 39th base with two outs. Lowell hit an
inning-ending grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Houston 5--Gary Sheffield homered off Nelson Cruz (1-6)
leading off the 13th inning at Houston and shortstop Rafael Furcal
threw out Craig Biggio at the plate to end the game, lifting the
Braves.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves have won nine of 11. They own the best record in the
majors at 76-39 and lead the NL East by 18 games--the largest margin
in any division.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Billy Wagner blew a three-run lead in the ninth for
Houston, which still remained two games behind first-place St. Louis
in the NL Central. The Astros lost for only the fourth time in 14
games.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Spooneybarger (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for his
first major league victory. John Smoltz got his 41st save in 45
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   New York 2, St. Louis 1--Al Leiter gave up one run in seven
innings, winning for the first time in four starts, and Mo Vaughn
homered as the Mets silenced the slumping Cardinals at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The NL Central-leading Cardinals have lost eight of nine and
scored one run in five of the last six games. The exception was a 5-3
victory over Montreal on Thursday that ended their season-worst
seven-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis has been outscored 50-20 during its slump.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter (10-8) gave up 14 runs in 16 innings his three previous
starts, going 0-1, but entered with an NL-leading 2.03 earned-run
average in night games. He gave up five hits, with two strikeouts and
three walks.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 11, Milwaukee 4--Jose Macias drove in a career-high five
runs, and Bartolo Colon won for the fifth time in six decisions with
the Expos in a victory at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero tied Ken Griffey Jr. as the second-youngest
player to reach 200 homers when he hit his 30th of the season, a line
drive to left-center off Mike DeJean leading off the ninth. Guerrero,
like Griffey, reached 200 when he was 26 years 182 days. That trails
only Alex Rodriguez, who reached it at 25 years 290 days.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Chicago 0--Denny Neagle pitched three-hit ball over
seven innings, and the Rockies won at Denver for their fourth
consecutive victory. The game was the fastest of season at Coors
Field, taking only 2 hours 19 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Homers Are Load on Boone's Mind</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He hits three in four innings for Reds in 12-10
victory over Padres, but quest for four proves daunting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>After three at-bats, Aaron Boone had three homers and way too many
thoughts of history flooding his mind.</LD>
<LD>   Boone hit three homers off Brett Tomko, including two during
Cincinnati's nine-run first inning, then came up short in his uneasy
quest for four Friday night as the Reds held on for a 12-10 victory
over the San Diego Padres.</LD>
<LD>   After Boone got the three homers so fast, his teammates started
telling him stories about other players who have tried for four. Four
in one game? Boone never imagined he'd have three.</LD>
<TE>   "I hit four once in tee-ball," he said. "I used to whale them to
right field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know what to say. It was just kind of weird. After I
hit the third homer, I was a fish out of water and a little
uncomfortable out there the rest of the game."</TE>
<TE>   He struck out and had an infield single, completing the best
overall game of his career. His four hits and five runs batted in
tied his career highs and helped him win back some family bragging
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he can tell his mom that he hit more homers [in a game] than
his dad," said his father, Manager Bob Boone.</TE>
<TE>   He also had kept up with his brother, Bret, who hit two homers in
an inning for Seattle on May 2. Bret Boone has a pair of three-homer
games.</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to do his brother one better, Boone lost his touch.
He struck out swinging in the sixth against Kevin Walker and had an
infield single in the eighth off Jeremy Fikac.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to go for it," he said. "You want to take a shot at
history a little bit. It was pretty weird. I'm glad it's over."</TE>
<TE>   So was Tomko (5-8), who was responsible for the biggest first
inning ever against the Padres. Jason LaRue also had a two-run homer
in the first as the Reds put together their biggest inning in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how to explain that first inning," Tomko said. "You
don't see that very often. I told [Barry] Larkin when he got to
second base to take the tee off the plate. It was one of those
innings where if something's going to go wrong, it will go wrong."</TE>
<TE>   It almost wasn't enough for knuckleballer Jared Fernandez, who
couldn't control his darting pitch. The Padres cut the lead to 9-5 in
the third, and Ryan Klesko came to bat with the bases loaded
representing the tying run. He grounded out, ending the Padres'
chance to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   They made the Reds squirm in the ninth, when pinch-hitter Mark
Kotsay hit a two-run homer and closer Danny Graves started warming in
the Reds' bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Rijo (5-3) pitched two innings and gave up Tom Lampkin's solo
homer that cut it to 10-5.</TE>

<HD>Kenyan Team Wins Billfish Tournament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>He stepped off the boat, amid great applause, with a cramp in a
shoulder and another in a leg. But he wore a smile as wide as the
horizon.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, wearing a more worried look, was among the first to
congratulate a man who had just spent 4 1/2 hours fighting a marlin
he called "the toughest-fighting fish I had ever landed."</LD>
<LD>   She gave the man a hug and a kiss.</LD>
<TE>   Sam Spinello is 67, going on about 50. Having successfully won an
epic battle Friday off the scenic Kona coast, in the waning hours of
the fourth and final day of the 43rd Hawaiian International Billfish
Tournament, Spinello disembarked as far and away the event's most
popular angler.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Pacific blue marlin was hoisted onto the scale at
Kailua Pier, it was Spinello who wore a worried look. The marlin,
though it possessed the strength of a creature twice its size,
weighed in at a surprisingly meager 269 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Since it did not meet the minimum weight of 300 pounds, it was
disqualified and Spinello, who with Mark Pfeiffer represented the
Malibu Marlin Club, finished with zero points for his effort. The
fish would have had to beat a 482.5-pounder brought in only hours
earlier by a team from Kenya to have earned enough points to win one
of the oldest and most prestigious tournaments in the world.</TE>
<TE>   That it failed to qualify was proof that you can't judge a fish by
its fight; but then you can't judge the courage of an angler by his
age.</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Fire Dept. kept us going," said Spinello, who was
fishing aboard the Ho'okele with Capt. Guy Terwilliger. "Those guys
didn't quit and neither did we."</TE>
<TE>   The Malibu team--one of four Southern California teams competing
in the event--dedicated its effort to the New York firefighters,
having befriended one of them on the flight to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Spinello and Pfeiffer, if nothing else, provided high drama to an
affair that had for three days played out dreadfully slow, with only
12 blue marlin tagged and set free, earning only release points.</TE>
<TE>   On the final day, conditions improved and the star of the show--a
marlin exceeding 300 pounds--finally decided to show. It materialized
in a blur off the stern of the Lady Dee, devouring a large trolling
lure and taking off in a series of mad leaps and sizzling runs.</TE>
<TE>   "The reel just started screaming--it took probably 500 yards and
was jumping quite a bit," said angler Glenn Reece of the Malindi Sea
Fishing Club of Kenya. "I just sat back in the fighting chair and
kept my fingers crossed."</TE>
<TE>   The fish, which was subdued in only 42 minutes, was estimated by
the crew to weigh slightly over 300 pounds, so it was brought in.
Even the Reeces--with Glenn was his father, Bob, and son,
Robert--looked surprised to see the 482.5-pound reading.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that their lead was tenuous, they went back out to try to
catch another.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out they didn't need to as Spinello's was the only fish
that would surpass the qualifying 300 pounds. The Kenya team earned
the 482 points for the weight of the fish, plus bonus points for the
largest fish of the day and largest of the tournament. Its 682 1/2
points easily won the event.</TE>
<TE>   There was a bright spot for the Southern California entries, from
a standings aspect. Marylin Stephens of the King Harbor Marlin Club
in Redondo Beach caught both of her team's marlin, smaller fish that
were tagged and released. For that she was awarded the top Wahine
angler and her team was honored for a fifth-place finish.</TE>

<HD>Scolari Resigns as Brazil Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty days after leading his team to victory in the World Cup, Luiz
Felipe Scolari resigned Friday as coach of Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   He said he was doing so for two reasons: his desire to coach in
Europe and a longing to devote more time to his family, which had
urged him to step aside from one of the most demanding posts in
international soccer.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like to work in Europe; it is one of my targets,"
Scolari, 53, said in Rio de Janeiro. "I want to say that any club
that hires me will become winners. And if they are already winners,
then they will win even more."</LD>
<TE>   During his 14 months in charge, the sometimes acerbic Scolari
turned a Brazilian team that was floundering and in danger of not
qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in history into a
world champion, Brazil winning its record fifth title.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian soccer federation
urged Scolari to stay on, but his final game in charge will be an
Aug. 21 friendly against Paraguay in Fortaleza, Brazil, for which he
has called up his entire World Cup-winning team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was gratifying that [Teixeira] wanted me to stay, but I have a
lot of private things to resolve and I would like to dedicate more
time to my family.... This is a difficult and sad moment, but it's
finished," Scolari said.</TE>
<TE>   Arena to Return</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, who coached the United States to the quarterfinals of
the 2002 World Cup, will remain as national coach.</TE>
<TE>   Arena is in contract negotiations with U.S. Soccer, whose
president, Robert Contiguglia, said Friday he hoped to have
everything settled "as quickly as possible, hopefully within the next
30 days."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Contiguglia--who has been president of U.S. Soccer for
the past four years--will be president for the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   Contiguglia, 60, was reelected by unanimous acclaim at the
federation's annual general meeting in San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Get Back Up Against Starzz</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: The night after demoralizing loss to
Comets, L.A. shoots 50.8% and rallies to beat Utah, 85-77.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>After being left for dead Thursday by Houston, the Sparks discovered
they still have a pulse.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles huffed and puffed and chased after the Utah Starzz for
nearly two hours Friday. But they made their last stand on defense
their best, holding the Starzz scoreless for the final 3:20 to pull
off an 85-77 victory before 12,578 at the Delta Center.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing 77-75 after a free throw by Starzz guard Marie Ferdinand,
who led Utah with 19 points, the Sparks closed within a point with
DeLisha Milton's free throw. When Milton missed her second free
throw, Marlies Askamp snared the rebound and threw the ball out to
Mwadi Mabika, who put the Sparks ahead for good with a 15-footer.</LD>
<TE>   Mabika finished with 18 points and nine rebounds, and Lisa Leslie
led the Sparks with 19 points and seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The victory pulled Los Angeles (23-7) into a tie with Houston for
first place in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   But with its win Thursday night, Houston holds the tiebreaker
advantage over the Sparks, so L.A. must lead the Comets by one game
in the Western standings in order to gain the home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks, who shot 50.8% (32 of 63) and had a 34-33 rebounding
edge, will worry about that later. The victory was enough to remove
some of the stain of Thursday, when they shot a franchise-low 25.7%
against the Comets.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed some heart tonight," Coach Michael Cooper said. "This
was a game we could have easily lost in the first half. But we stuck
together and kept working on some things we wanted to do defensively.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed a desire to win, and that's what our games are about.
Tonight, when the game was there to be won, we took it. And that's
what we have to do. The championship is not going to be given, like
last year. We have to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, who attended the funeral of Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn
Friday morning before flying to Utah, shook up his starting lineup,
using Askamp ahead of regular Milton.</TE>
<TE>   The lightly used Askamp responded with 12 points and five rebounds
in 18 minutes. Milton, who was one for 13 against Houston, had 11
points in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday it was not only losing, but the way we lost," Askamp
said. "You could see a difference in the team effort overall. We were
a lot more disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   Said Milton: "I was surprised [at not starting] but I'm also a
team player. And getting the win comes first."</TE>
<TE>   The Starzz, in an effort to see how drained the Sparks were from
their Thursday game and Friday morning flight, came out running.
Their attack came in waves. Center Margo Dydek (11 points, six
blocks) lobbed soft jumpers from inside the key.</TE>
<TE>   LaTonya Johnson dropped in three three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Williams (13 points) and Adrienne Goodson (15 points) shot
effectively outside and inside.</TE>
<TE>   By the 4:45 mark of the first half, the Starzz had made 14 of 25
shots and were ahead, 35-23.</TE>
<TE>   But Dydek and Johnson each got in foul trouble and had to sit.
Milton made consecutive three-pointers during a Sparks' 11-3 run.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the Sparks had closed to within 43-39 and in the
second half seemed to have better poise in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Starzz Coach Candi Harvey wondered how much better her team has to
play to defeat the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play better defense," Harvey said. "We've given up
100, 90 and 85 points to the Sparks. And the magic number with them
is between 70 and 75. They're a great defensive team that dares you
to try to outscore them."</TE>

<LD>   It was the spring of 1980 and I was a rookie beat writer for the
Santa Ana Register, covering my first pro team.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Ostler, then the beat writer for The Times, and I had booked
a morning tour of the underground buildings, figuring we'd see enough
of the Lakers  that evening against the SuperSonics.</LD>
<TE>   Word of our venture, unfortunately, reached the ears of
broadcaster Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   When someone called to us in the hotel lobby as we were leaving,
Chick interceded.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh leave them alone," he said with mock disgust. "They are
tourists."</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made in the last few days of Chick's work ethic.
Even last season, his 42nd with the Lakers, he was still the first
one in the arena for every game, hours before the tipoff, gleaning a
few  extra tidbits from a team he knew as well as he knew his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Chick's preparation was intense. On the road, he would attend
every practice, every shoot-around, every team function. There was no
time for tours.</TE>
<TE>   But there was always time for camaraderie. Chick may have kidded
others about failing to live up to his high standards, but he never
failed to be supportive of their efforts, as long as they were
genuine. A rookie reporter couldn't have found a better role model.</TE>
<TE>   Because I was the new kid on the road, Chick singled me out as the
straight man for many of his zingers.</TE>
<TE>   It was sort of like being targeted by Don Rickles. You felt
special, and from that first season on, a special relationship grew.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, on a team bus in Denver, Chick was growing annoyed
as I carried on a long conversation in a seat behind him. Finally, we
pulled up at an intersection, where a worker was pounding away at the
asphalt with a jackhammer.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Springer," Chick yelled out loud enough for everyone to
hear. "Do you want to make some extra money?"</TE>
<TE>   I dutifully answered as any straight man would, "Yes, Chick."</TE>
<TE>   "Well then," he replied, "get out there, put your chin on the
sidewalk and start talking."</TE>
<TE>   Another time, when the Lakers still flew commercial flights, Chick
was seated next to a woman who had a camera in her lap. I was seated
across the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, lady," said Chick, "want to make a quick 20 bucks?"</TE>
<TE>   The woman replied, "What do I have to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to me, Chick said, "Get me a picture of him with his
mouth closed."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only me, though. Chick's sharp wit and exquisite timing
were turned on everyone from waitresses and doormen to bus drivers
and pilots. He signed off at the end of every Laker broadcast, but
his act never stopped.</TE>
<TE>   And nobody ever seemed to get mad. All understood they were
stooges in ringmaster Chick's traveling circus.</TE>
<TE>   One morning in Indianapolis, I found Chick in the hotel coffee
shop, finishing an omelet.</TE>
<TE>   "That looks good," I said as I sat down. "I think I'll get one."</TE>
<TE>   A waitress came over to take my order.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have what I had," Chick told her, "but he'd like his eggs
warm."</TE>
<TE>   The waitress, not noticing the twinkle in Chick's eyes, was
horrified.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Mr. Hearn," she said, "I'm sorry. Is there something else I
can get you?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, you already ruined my day," he said. "See what you can do for
him."</TE>
<TE>   The waitress was insistent.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be something I can get you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "All right," he said, "bring me a stomach pump."</TE>
<TE>   Then, his timing impeccable as always, Chick abandoned the gag and
broke into a big smile, letting the waitress in on the fun.</TE>
<TE>   Chick was just as quick on the air.</TE>
<TE>   One night on the road, he instructed his director to come out of a
timeout by zooming in on the writers who were all seated courtside.
Something got lost in the request, however, and the cameraman focused
instead on several waiters who were serving in the luxury boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Chick never hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "No, the guys I'm talking about serve up a lot of baloney," he
told his viewers, "but they aren't waiters."</TE>
<TE>   Even innocent bystanders weren't safe.</TE>
<TE>   One night in Philadelphia, Chick got into an elevator with several
reporters. The door opened at the second floor and a man in a
Superman costume entered. The elevator stopped again at the third
floor and Superman got out.</TE>
<TE>   As the door closed, Chick said, "You'd think he could have jumped
that high."</TE>
<TE>   Chick was a meticulous traveler and woe to any member of the Laker
party who slipped up. It was my turn in Boston, where I had put my
wallet down on a nightstand in my hotel. Before going to bed, I made
a phone call and then inadvertently put the phone down on top of the
wallet.</TE>
<TE>   When I awoke for one of those dreaded 6 a.m. buses, I was too
bleary-eyed to notice the wallet was gone until the bus was pulling
away from the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   A frantic call was made and the wallet was delivered to me in time
at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   No harm, no foul?</TE>
<TE>   Not with Chick around.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't comment about the incident until we had reached the next
city and were in another bus heading to yet another hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Riles," Chick said loudly to Pat Riley, then the Laker
coach, who was seated a few rows ahead. "Next time we go to Boston, I
got a great new hotel we ought to stay at."</TE>
<TE>   "Really? Which one?" asked Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh never mind," Chick said, "I forgot. They have wall phones
there. Springer would have no place to leave his wallet."</TE>
<TE>   Chick's voice is gone now. Laker games will never be the same. And
neither will Laker trips. Chick's magical tour is over. The next
generation of sportswriters is on its own.</TE>

<HD>Williams and Capriati Get Sand Kicked in Faces</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Top two seeded players upset by Rubin, Sugiyama in
quarterfinals at Manhattan Beach. Top-ranked Williams' 21-match win
streak ends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Capriati stood on the steps leading to the stadium court at
the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, watching something
quite rare unfold on Friday afternoon. Serena Williams, inexplicably,
was going to lose a match. Then Capriati followed in Williams' steps.</LD>
<LD>   In a little more than an hour, the JPMorgan Chase Open lost its
top-seeded player, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon
champion--Williams--and the second-seeded Australian Open title
holder, Capriati, both in the quarterfinals. Together, Chanda Rubin
and Ai Sugiyama of Japan took out the 2002 Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin has defeated a No. 1-ranked player before but this meant
more considering Williams' dominance of women's tennis. The
12th-seeded Rubin defeated Williams, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, in 2 hours 8
minutes, rallying from a 4-1 third-set deficit. It ended Williams'
21-match winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   Sugiyama's upset was not as dramatic but more decisive. The
27-year-old beat Capriati, 6-3, 6-3, in 56 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In today's semifinals, Rubin will face No. 4 Jelena Dokic of
Yugoslavia, and Sugiyama will play No. 3 Lindsay Davenport, who
defeated Eleni Daniilidou of Greece, 7-6 (2), 6-2. Dokic defeated
Rita Grande of Italy, 6-4, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Though her last victory against Capriati was in 1998, Sugiyama was
not intimidated. In fact, the Rubin result gave her motivation. She,
too, stood on the steps and wanted to follow Rubin's lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think so. She does it. OK, now my turn. I can also do it,"
Sugiyama said.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, 26, said her tough third-round match Thursday night
affected her. But Sugiyama's doubles match did not finish until
nearly 11:30 Thursday night. Those who watched Capriati practice
before her match had a feeling she was ripe for an upset, based on
her crankiness and ragged play.</TE>
<TE>   "She just keeps going at you. I was a little bit flat, wasn't
moving as well as I've been," said Capriati, who hasn't gotten past
the quarterfinals of any tournament since taking the first set
against Williams in the French Open semifinals. "I was missing a lot
of easy shots I haven't been missing."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, on the other hand, made her usual array of spectacular
shots, sprinkled with some wild unforced errors, particularly on the
forehand side. The loss didn't seem to concern her.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a setback," said Williams, who lost here last year in
the quarterfinals after holding six match points against Monica
Seles. "I'm still No. 1. I still plan on getting that Open [title].
So it doesn't really matter to me. I would have liked to have won the
match, but I don't think of this as a setback at all."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 20, had a few rough moments during the 21-match winning
streak that took her from Rome to Paris to Wimbledon to Manhattan
Beach. If she faltered early, Williams always would finish strongly.
It was almost as though she was offended by losing a set. Granted,
this happened just three times in the 21 matches.</TE>
<TE>   So when Rubin won the first set, it seemed natural to brace for
the imminent onslaught. And it came, Williams taking the second set
and a 4-1 lead in the third. But Rubin was different from the others.
She didn't go away and was not intimidated by the sound and fury of
Williams' grunts and groundstrokes. Rubin, 26, calmly kept at it,
quietly chipping away at the lead, playing almost in silence. She is
a case study in persistence, having had two knee surgeries, the most
recent, in January, keeping her out of action until the clay-court
season.</TE>
<TE>   The soundtrack was Williams' alone. Her screams of "Come on!"
ranged from fiercely competitive to angry to hopeful. The last time
she had lost a match was in May against Justine Henin of Belgium in
the final at Berlin on clay in three sets.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it appeared as though Rubin might pull off the win in
straight sets. She led, 4-2, in the second set and had points to take
a 5-3 lead but dropped her serve, losing a 40-0 lead. Williams won
the second by taking 11 of the last 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Did Rubin feel it had been a lost opportunity?</TE>
<TE>   "That's an understatement, up 40-0 and looking at returning and
then having the chance to serve for the match," Rubin said. "She
started playing much better and started hitting the shots, crazy
shots with pace, and I made it tough for myself. I was kicking myself
for a while in that third set. It was just a question of getting back
to the game plan and fighting through the end of the match."</TE>
<TE>   But Rubin has been through these matches before. She beat Martina
Hingis, then ranked No. 1, at Indian Wells in 1999 and played the
longest women's match at the 1996 Australian Open, winning, 16-14, in
the third set against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in a quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday she broke Williams at 30 in the 11th game of the third
set when Williams hit a forehand into the net. In the last game,
Rubin hit a superb lob winner to go up, 30-15, and Williams showed a
rare flash of irritation, bouncing her racket. Two points later,
Rubin secured the biggest victory of her career when Williams netted
a backhand.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel my practices were up to par," said Williams, 38-4
this year. "I couldn't get the rhythm in practice, so I think it just
kind of transfers subconsciously to your match."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin laughed when asked about the accomplishment of beating a
Williams sister. "It's a tough undertaking for sure," she said.
"Every Grand Slam, I think that's really the stage you want to beat
them on. This is a great step for me, winning that match and playing
well enough to win the match."</TE>

<HD>Rubin Gets Over the Hump on the Comeback Trail</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Victory over top-ranked Williams validates
26-year-old pro's hard work to rejoin tour after knee surgeries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chanda Rubin was good enough three years ago to defeat the world's
No. 1-ranked player, Martina Hingis, at Indian Wells, but that
probably seemed like a lifetime ago as she lay in a hospital bed in
Vail, Colo., in January.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin, once considered the heir apparent to Zina Garrison as the
next great African American women's tennis player but later eclipsed
by the Williams sisters, had just had surgery on her left knee for
the second time in 13 months.</LD>
<LD>   Victories over top-ranked players, such as the 6-2, 4-6, 7-5
defeat she hung on Wimbledon and French Open champion Serena Williams
on Friday in the quarterfinals of the JPMorgan Chase Open in
Manhattan Beach, seemed a distant memory.</LD>
<TE>   Such thoughts didn't cross her mind, but neither did retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I did think, 'This can't be happening again. I've done all this
work and here I am back at the same place again,' " said Rubin, a pro
for 11 years but still only 26. "It was very disappointing and sort
of a low point, but I never felt I was just going to pack it in and
not do this anymore. I still felt that I had some good years left and
I hadn't maximized my abilities."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, her focus and determination returned. Through 10 weeks
of rehabilitation, almost identical to the physical and mental
torture she had put herself through only a year earlier, Rubin
started to believe again.</TE>
<TE>   One week after losing to Nathalie Vierin of Italy in the first
round of qualifying at the Italian Open in May, she reached the final
in Madrid before losing to Monica Seles. At the French Open, she lost
to Venus Williams in the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   In June, she won a Wimbledon warm-up event at Eastbourne, England,
before losing to Serena Williams in the round of 16 at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Her comeback was progressing nicely, if not spectacularly, her
ranking rising to No. 21. But few would have guessed she'd hand
Serena Williams her first loss since May, ending a 21-match winning
streak that had vaulted Williams to No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could have figured on this," said Rubin's coach, Benny
Sims. "I'm so proud. I don't know anybody who could have worked
harder to rehabilitate."</TE>
<TE>   After losing to Vierin in Rome, Rubin was put through a sort of
one-week boot camp by Sims, enduring two-a-day practices against male
opponents, plus conditioning drills, at a club in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Her knee, which never fully healed as she struggled last year
after arthroscopic surgery in January 2001, responded well, and her
confidence soared.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really put a limit on it," she said of her comeback. "I
knew at a certain point, if I was playing well, that anything was
possible. I just have to give myself a chance out there."</TE>
<TE>   She did more than that against the frustrated and faltering
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Williams said afterward, "She had to play great tennis to
beat me. Anyone who beats me has to play great, so obviously I think
she played really, really well today. She did great.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a tough game. She attacks a lot of balls, she'll try to
keep you running and she's really cut back on her errors."</TE>
<TE>   And, for the first time in nearly two years, she's all in one
piece.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I feel good," Rubin said. "I feel like I can just
build on my fitness ... but the knee feels good and I'm able to do
everything I need to do on it."</TE>
<TE>   She called this her biggest victory, eclipsing the upset of
Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is three years later and I've been through a little more
adversity," she said, "so it's definitely more satisfying. I feel
like I'm playing better than I was then, and I've felt that for a
while, so to finally actually prove it is very satisfying."</TE>
