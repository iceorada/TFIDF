<HD>Caution: Moral Snares Ahead</HD>
<DH>We've sent GIs to the Philippines before--with disastrous
results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW J. BACEVICH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The GIs arriving in the southern Philippines to offer aid in the
fight against the Islamic terrorist group Abu Sayyaf are by no means
the first U.S. troops to take up station in places such as Mindanao,
Basilan and Jolo. As they do so, Americans would do well to recall
when the U.S. last set out to crush Muslim separatists in that exotic
clime.</LD>
<LD>   In 1903, having put down an insurrection by Filipino nationalists
hoping that the overthrow of Spanish rule might lead to independence,
President Theodore Roosevelt moved quickly to complete the
pacification of the United States' new Pacific colony. He ordered his
favorite proconsul, Gen. Leonard Wood, to bring to heel separatists
inhabiting what U.S. authorities called Moro province, home to
250,000 Filipino Muslims who had long opposed domination by whoever
happened to be ruling in Manila. Poorly equipped and organized, the
Moros did not constitute much of an opponent in any conventional
sense. American soldiers figured to make short work of such a
backward foe and bring order and civilization to Moroland.</LD>
<TE>   Events did not unfold as planned. Instead, an ugly, inconclusive
guerrilla campaign ensued. By the time it petered out years later,
thousands of Muslims and more than a few Americans had died. The U.S.
Army stood accused of massacring noncombatants in cold blood. And
Moro resistance to outsiders remained stubbornly intact--as it has to
the present day.</TE>
<TE>   In Moroland, the U.S. got more than it reckoned for. Primitive
conditions, a vast inhospitable jungle and, above all, the Moro
warrior's perverse willingness to die offset the overwhelming U.S.
edge in technology and firepower. Assaults on enemy cottas--primitive
fortresses--inevitably produced tactical success, along with heavy
Moro losses. But they did not yield decisive victory.</TE>
<TE>   As the war dragged on, U.S. inhibitions fell by the wayside.
Frustrated by the Moros' refusal to embrace Western ways, Wood
abandoned any pretense of uplifting the natives. Gradually, U.S.
forces drifted toward what came to resemble a strategy of
extermination. The low point occurred in March 1906 on Jolo at the
extinct volcano of Bud Dajo. Several hundred Moros had gathered atop
the volcano, spooking U.S. commanders into thinking that an uprising
was afoot. To preempt any such plot, several battalions of American
regulars surrounded the summit, vigorously shelled it and then
assaulted. Virtually the entire Moro encampment was wiped out, about
600 in all. Many of those killed were women and children.</TE>
<TE>   The "battle" of Bud Dajo differed little from any number of
previous encounters except in one respect: This time the press got
wind of it.</TE>
<TE>   The result was an embarrassing scandal. An unapologetic Wood
blamed the Moros: They armed women; they used children as human
shields.</TE>
<TE>   "Work of this kind," he reported privately to Roosevelt, "has its
disagreeable side, which is the unavoidable killing of women and
children. But it must be done, and disagreeable as it is, there is no
avoiding it."</TE>
<TE>   The disagreeable work that is the American soldier's lot at the
beginning of the 21st century is by no means identical to what it was
a hundred years ago. But as the ever-widening circle of U.S. military
commitments suggests, it remains the business of empire: establishing
order, maintaining stability and enforcing norms of behavior, the
logic of which may be more self-evident to ourselves than to others.</TE>
<TE>   Americans today take it for granted that the technology and
firepower that have worked elsewhere with seemingly antiseptic
effectiveness will prove universally applicable. They also imagine
that they can wield their military might with a clear conscience.
When the odd stray bomb kills noncombatants, that too is
"unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   With the war on terror entering the second of what may be many
phases, the conditions that U.S. troops will encounter in the
once-familiar confines of the old Moro province are likely to test
those optimistic assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   History seldom teaches lessons of the sort that apply directly
from one era to the next. Yet history may on occasion sound a
cautionary note.</TE>
<TE>   Flushed with success at having vanquished the Taliban, the Bush
administration may be susceptible to the same failings that befell
Roosevelt and Wood--hubris chief among them. We should be wary of
expectations that what worked in Afghanistan will translate into easy
victory elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   More important, we should be wary of the moral snares that lie
ahead.</TE>

<HD>Enron Got Its Money's Worth</HD>
<DH>Look no further than the national energy plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the major falsehoods being bandied about by apologists for the
Bush administration is that while Enron may have bankrolled much of
the president's political career it got nothing for those bucks once
George W. occupied the White House.</LD>
<LD>   That is nonsense.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's energy program, developed by Vice President
Dick Cheney in secret meetings--six of them with Enron
officials--could have been written by lobbyists for the now failed
company.</LD>
<TE>   At the behest of Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the minority
staff of the House Committee on Government Reform has prepared a
devastating analysis of 17 major concessions made to Enron that gave
Kenneth L. Lay, Bush's intimate friend and Enron chief executive,
just about everything he wanted. The report concluded that "it is
unlikely that any other corporation in America stood to gain as much
from the White House plan as Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Those Bush administration concessions to Enron included finishing
the job of deregulating the electricity market begun by Bush's
father. The senior Bush's actions had paved the way for the company's
meteoric growth.</TE>
<TE>   George W.'s energy plan also made it even easier for Enron to sell
energy derivatives in the commodity market and pursue other financial
shenanigans that had been a major source of profit. The unregulated
selling of energy derivatives, an Enron specialty, was celebrated in
the Bush energy plan as "sophisticated and customizable." We now know
that practice was so sophisticated that it was the major source of
Enron's paper profits.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, given that Republicans are presumed to favor leaving power
with the states, the Bush energy plan emphasized increased federal
power over utility pipelines that forced local utilities to carry
Enron's product. This was an expansion of the "open access" powers
granted in the 1992 Energy Policy Act, passed in the first Bush
administration. That law undermined the power of local authorities
and regional utility companies for the benefit of Enron. In 1999,
Enron had defined "open access" as the company's "single-most
important initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, George W. delivered. Fortunately this subversion
of the political process had a short life because Enron went belly up
before Bush could save the company from itself.</TE>
<TE>   But the question remains why Bush, as governor and president,
wanted to foist the example of such a despicable corporate player
upon the American people as a model for business behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Surely the Enron alums who occupy key positions in the
administration knew that the president's model corporation had
avoided paying federal income taxes for four out of the past five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Enron even claimed $382 million in government refunds. How dare
this president collect taxes from ordinary Americans after touting a
company that created 881 offshore dodges to avoid taxes. Few
taxpayers can open subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands pretending to
do business, but Enron had more than 700 there.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS and Treasury Department under the Clinton administration
had attacked the use of such tax dodges and attempted to eliminate
them. Bush, however, sought to reward a company that, far more than
any of its competitors, took advantage of offshore loopholes. Dynegy,
Enron's lead competitor, had no offshore tax havens, suggesting that
it is possible to do business honestly.</TE>
<TE>   But how would Bush know of his pet company's chicanery, his
apologists howl--particularly the talk radio right-wingers who spent
eight years skewering Bill Clinton over the most minor
transgressions? Bush should have known because his top economic
advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was paid $50,000 in 2000 for
consulting work for Enron, went straight from that gig to being head
of the White House's National Economic Council. In the latter
capacity, Lindsey wrote a rosy report on Enron's emerging problems
and presented it to the president shortly before the company's
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Were he and the other Enron alum who hold high positions in the
administration lying to the president, or did Bush not want to hear
any bad news about his once-favorite company? Either way it smells.</TE>

<HD>Strip Terrorists of Their Legal Cover</HD>
<DH>Better ID systems would make it easier to pinpoint these
individuals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN STEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lax visa issuance and tracking system let the Sept. 11 terrorists
get into the U.S., but it was a lax domestic documentation system
that allowed them to take flying lessons, rent apartments and safe
houses and blend into the United States' vast and diverse population.</LD>
<LD>   One of the first orders of important business for Congress in 2002
will be to approve the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform
Act, a bipartisan bill that would greatly improve our ability to
identify potential terrorists before they reach our country.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would require more extensive background checks on visa
applicants from terrorist-sponsoring countries, the use of
machine-readable travel documents and visas and better reporting
procedures for people granted permission to reside temporarily in the
United States.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even with those reforms, more is needed. It must be easier for
officials to flag those who manage to slip through the visa net.
Terrorists do not necessarily come only from certain countries or fit
a particular ethnic profile.</TE>
<TE>   The two most important pieces of identification that allow
Americans to live, work, obtain credit, rent apartments, attend
school, get on airplanes and do virtually everything else were easily
acquired by the 19 terrorists as well as millions of other people who
are in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Every one of the terrorists involved in the attacks had a valid
Social Security number issued by the federal government and a valid
driver's license issued by a state government. With these documents,
people intent on inflicting the most grievous harm and murdering the
greatest number of people were able to become inconspicuous needles
in an enormous haystack.</TE>
<TE>   There are some obvious and basic document reforms needed to remedy
this hole in our security. To begin with, any adult applicant for a
Social Security number should be required to undergo a thorough
background check to verify that he or she is in the United States
legally. If the individual has been admitted temporarily, the Social
Security document should be different from permanent ones and should
expire at the same time as the person's visa. The Social Security
document itself should be made more secure and include features that
allow it to be as easily verified as a credit card.</TE>
<TE>   All states should have to require a valid Social Security number
before issuing a driver's license. Like Social Security numbers,
driver's licenses for people on temporary visas should expire with
the visas, or sooner. A common motor vehicle database would ensure
that multiple driver's licenses were not issued to the same Social
Security number. Driving is a privilege, not a right, so all states
should have minimum uniform security standards to guard against
identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   With any secure and reliable form of identification, citizens
should be entitled to live, work and move about the United States
easily and with a full expectation of privacy. With secure travel
documents and visas, legitimate visitors to our country could do
those things that visitors are entitled to do, but would find it
difficult to do things like get jobs, rent apartments or take flying
lessons.</TE>
<TE>   We must have a system to distinguish between lawful members of our
society, legitimate visitors and those who are here illegally. With
the establishment of secure identity documents, those who are here
illegally or on non-immigrant visas will find that the camouflage of
our vast and diverse country has disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   We cannot stop every potential terrorists from getting into the
country, but we certainly can do our best to take away their cover.</TE>

<HD>Make Third Strikes Matter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Its supporters say that California's three-strikes-and-you're-out law
has caused crime to drop and put the state's worst criminals behind
bars for good. However, a growing number of Californians also worry
that filling state prison cells with petty thieves and small-time
drug addicts serving life sentences is unduly harsh and eats up
taxpayer funds.</LD>
<LD>   Since three strikes became law in 1994, at least half a dozen
bills have been introduced to amend the statute to eliminate
mandatory life sentences for every two-bit criminal who commits a
third-strike crime, even if the previous crimes were committed 20
years before, even if the third strike involves possessing marijuana
or passing a bad check. Each measure has died. Last week, a group of
lawmakers unveiled a new proposal. This time, legislators should vote
"yes."</LD>
<TE>   At least 35 states and the federal government impose stiffer
sentences on repeat criminals. Most reserve the harshest punishment,
life in prison, for those who've committed a serious or violent crime
like rape or assault. California's law does not. Conviction for any
third felony brings a life sentence. Even misdemeanors like stealing
a couple of videotapes or a slice of pizza can be filed as felonies
if the defendant has a record. More than 7,000 California inmates are
now serving life terms for third-strike offenses. Of those, more than
2,600 were convicted of crimes considered not serious or not violent.</TE>
<TE>   Many prosecutors defend the harsh punishments by arguing that
these felons are far from being upstanding citizens and that many of
them probably got away with other crimes. But American judges and
juries are charged with deliberating only on the crimes before them.
It is also true, especially in Los Angeles and other major cities,
that judges and prosecutors are using their discretion to avoid
pizza-theft third strikes. Outside the cities it is often a different
story, however, making for more disparities and inequities.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed measure, by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles), would limit the stiffest penalties to criminals whose
third-strike offense was a serious or violent crime, as is the law in
several other states. At the same time, a group called Citizens
Against Violent Crime announced they will begin gathering signatures
to qualify for the November ballot an initiative similar to
Goldberg's AB 1790.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls indicate that a majority of Californians not only
approve of these proposed changes but thought the 1994 law already
distinguished between serious or violent crimes and petty offenses.
This measure is not about being soft on crime. It's about being
smart.</TE>

<HD>Studiously Studying Studies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're reading this editorial while inching along the Hollywood
Freeway this morning, you might be creeping up on Sunset about now.
Due to possible excitement, put your car in neutral before reading
further. Ready? They've started construction on a new study to fix
the Hollywood Freeway. Finally, another study.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers say this new study, a $4.5-million doozy by a
consortium of government agencies, is better than all past studies
about the 101 because it seeks public input and addresses not just
pieces but fully 40 miles of the overburdened Hollywood and Ventura
roadways between Thousand Oaks and downtown. The goal of the "U.S.
101 Freeway Improvement Study," they say, is to improve safety and
reduce congestion. How about a study to reduce studies?</LD>
<LD>   The latest study starts this evening with an Encino community
meeting. If you turn around now, you might just make it. But because
the 101's creeping, crawling traffic has become so frustrating for
thousands of drivers each weekday, they're going to fast-track the
study. This "major multimodal corridor study" should take only about
three years "approximately" to compile many recommendations to go
into future studies.</LD>
<TE>   Factoring in time for lawsuits, environmental studies,
countersuits, funding problems, bidding challenges, cost overruns and
construction delays, you figure that maybe in nine or 10 more years
the Hollywood Freeway, one of California's most heavily traveled,
could be getting another brand-new study. This major artery is that
important.</TE>
<TE>   Way back when, city leaders considered several names for these
newfangled thoroughfares without intersections. One was parkway, as
in the Cahuenga Parkway, the Hollywood Freeway's first 3,700-foot
section, built in 136 days in 1940 to handle the growing number of
"autoists." Other names were expressway, speedway and freeway.
Prescient planners wisely opted to focus on the lack of tolls.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Hollywood Freeway has been extended, widened and
improved so that many more vehicles can move much more slowly, even
on weekends. If all the well-meaning studies conducted over the
decades slid off a flatbed, they'd cause a major SigAlert. Now if
city officials are serious about giving Valley voters more reasons to
reject secession, here's an idea: Do something besides studying to
ease driving between there and downtown.</TE>
<TE>   History books note that as late as the early 1900s travelers could
spend the better part of an entire day getting through the San
Fernando Valley on the Butterfield stage. It's comforting to know now
that thanks to the arrival of a few million new residents and a
chronic focus on studies, not much has changed along historic Route
101. Even at $112,500 per mile, this latest study won't threaten the
status quo. Maybe drivers can be surveyed while they're parked on the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   OK, step on it. You can probably move up another car length by
now.</TE>

<HD>If It's 'Hot,' It's Not Just Trash</HD>

<LD>Californians can't put their old paint cans or used motor oil out for
the trash collectors because municipal landfills consider these items
to be hazardous waste and are barred by law from accepting them. So
how is it that since November state regulations have allowed the
operators of mothballed nuclear power plants to send mildly
radioactive dirt, concrete and parts of abandoned buildings to city
dumps?</LD>
<LD>   At least half a dozen power plants and laboratory sites will be
taken out of service in the coming years. Once they are cleaned up
and the radioactivity drops to legally safe levels, the sites can be
used for new purposes, possibly including housing or parks.</LD>
<LD>   But how safe is safe? Federal rules adopted in 1997 set the
cleanup standard for decommissioned facilities as 25 millirems
annually--a measure of the intensity of the radiation emitted by
dirt, buildings and other materials on a site. That's roughly equal
to getting 21/2 chest X-rays every year. Once a site is cleaned up
and radioactivity drops to 25 millirems, it can be declared safe for
other uses.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the California health department adopted that same
standard late last year. Their action cleared the way for hauling
debris and dirt from cleaned sites to city dumps, just as though it
were household trash. No need to notify the neighbors or take special
precautions while transporting this material, as is required for
radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   But this stuff is not just household trash. State officials tried,
over several years, to license and construct a repository
specifically for low-level radioactive waste at Ward Valley in the
Mojave Desert. That facility, intended to receive hotter material
from still-operating nuclear plants, was to emit less than 1/10th the
25-millirem standard the state will allow at decommissioned
sites--and in their debris.</TE>
<TE>   The state ultimately abandoned the Ward Valley project because of
concerns about the dump's safety, specifically that radioactivity
could migrate into underground water supplies, and California
continues to ship low-level waste to special facilities in Utah and
South Carolina. Why not keep using them?</TE>
<TE>   Most city landfills lack the monitoring equipment to make sure
that radioactivity in incoming loads is within the legal limit.
Municipal landfills also have many fewer design safety features than
Ward Valley would have had to prevent radiation from leaching
off-site.</TE>
<TE>   The governor and Legislature need to step in. Gov. Gray Davis
should bar shipments of radioactive material to municipal landfills,
even if it meets current federal and state standards as "clean." A
group of legislators plans to hold hearings next month to reexamine
those standards and safety at landfills. California's 175 municipal
dumps should not become de facto radioactive waste sites.</TE>

<LD>Re "Donations Could Taint Probe on Capitol Hill," Jan. 18: Perhaps
the politicians, instead of puffing up like indignant bullfrogs over
the "outrage" of victimized employees and retirees, should place all
of their Enron political contributions in a fund to assist those
victims.</LD>
<LD>   This would clear the way for a reasonable public review of the
problem without accusations of conflict of interest. Also, they might
be more inclined to freeze the assets of the perpetrators, "pending
investigation," if they didn't feel so spotlighted by their own
ethically questionable, even if perfectly legal, gains.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Enron: A Scandal So Good That It Hurts," by John Balzar,
Commentary, Jan. 18: The culpability for the Enron-related crimes
also rests with a majority of average U.S. citizens, who admire (or
did) people like Ken Lay as American heroes of commerce. Maybe after
the U.S. press wakes up and exhibits more courage (a column like this
is a start), so too will enough U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Before we can begin to demand more accountability from
politicians, we have to take a hard look at the rot that has taken
hold in our culture. Then, after we begin electing accountable
politicians, they will in turn enforce more accountability and
transparency in U.S. business culture. At least for a while, until
the pendulum swings back (again) to our current free-for-all business
ethics.</TE>

<TE>   Balzar seems to imply that greed and avarice are phenomena of the
21st century (and of the Bush administration in particular). He
appears to be suffering from an extreme form of historical myopia. He
apparently has forgotten the market crash of 1929, the robber barons
of the Progressive era and any number of financial and moral scandals
that have been a part of this country's history from its inception.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not to imply that American history alone is typified
by these events. It is a characteristic of the history of human
events in general. I am by no means endorsing this behavior or
excusing it. I agree with Balzar that the current moral and ethical
climate in our country is a sad state of affairs. I only take issue
with his implication that we have somehow fallen from some mythical
state of grace and that this fall is somehow tied to the current
Republican Bush administration.</TE>

<TE>   If ever there were a justification for campaign finance reform,
this is it. To quote Balzar, "Maybe, finally, at long bloody last,
things will get bad enough to make them right."</TE>

17: George Will has produced a list of excuses for Enron that rivals
the tobacco industry's effort at debunking science. His article
represents a compendium of talking points to be used by Republican

the pop astrology as posed in daily columns. Even J.P. Morgan had his
own personal astrologer, Evangeline Adams. Maybe that is why he was
so wealthy.</LD>
<LD>   Why the scientific types are always batting astrology I cannot
figure out--when organized religion has more ridiculous myths, such
as the virgin birth, that billions are taught to believe. In
addition, certain religious "righters" try to block the more liberal
thinkers from access to abortion and research using fetal tissue
simply because they have medieval ideas. Why pick on astrology, which
is relatively harmless?</LD>

<LD>In "Bid Farewell to 'Mr. Palestine' " (Commentary, Jan. 16) Said
Aburish provides a very peculiar revisionist version of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat. He claims that "the Palestinians
were thrown into Arafat's arms" by the actions of Israel and some
Arab countries and that Arafat "knew that the people of the West Bank
and Gaza loathed the behavior of his Beirut-bred fun-loving, corrupt
entourage." Thus it is partly Israel's fault that the Palestinian
Arabs have Arafat as their leader.</LD>
<LD>   He blames Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for the failure of
the Oslo agreement and for even initiating the war that Arafat really
started 15 months ago, saying, "Arafat should have known that Sharon
would use force against Palestinian civilians rather than cede the
smallest point of the agreement."</LD>
<LD>   Aburish says "Arafat never deviated from his efforts to create a
Palestinian identity."</LD>
<TE>   When Arafat, as head of the PLO terrorist organization, started
his terrorist actions against Jews in the state of Israel in 1964,
all of the West Bank, including Gaza and Jerusalem, were in Arab
hands. The goal of the PLO was to destroy Israel. The demand to
establish a Palestinian entity is a relatively recent tactical
maneuver to build up the means to achieve the original PLO goal.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Palestinian Kills Six at Celebration," Jan. 18: What would
Americans do about foreign terrorists who not only repeatedly
attacked our civilians but primarily targeted our children?</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian plan of terror is sickeningly clear: at the
Dolphinarium in Tel Aviv, teenage girls slaughtered; at Sbarro
restaurant in Jerusalem, young families with small children and
babies murdered; at Tekoa, two young boys abducted and beaten to
death; at the Ben Yehuda Mall, Jerusalem, no victim older than 21;
and now, the latest Palestinian "martyr" sprays gunfire at a bat
mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   These youngsters do not represent the "collateral damage" of a
military conflict. They were specific targets chosen to maximize the
terror and despair created in the Israeli civilian population.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any sound more thunderous than the anguished sobs of a
mother for her slain child? The explosions, the wail of the sirens,
pale in comparison. As more and more Israeli mothers join the lament,
even the constant whine of Palestinian victimhood fades to an
annoying buzz.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Saudis Feel Unfairly Tarred With a Terrorist Brush," Jan. 17:
It's not the many home-grown terrorists, or the royal family that
continues to defend and finance terrorists, or even the contempt in
which they hold those who are different than they that has caused the
world to "diss" Saudi Arabia. It is, of course, the Zionist entity,
its control of the U.S. Congress and the Jews' control of the money
and the press that have caused Americans to "unfairly tar Saudi
Arabia with a terrorist brush."</TE>
<TE>   It's time for America to face the truth about Saudi Arabia and
many of its Muslim neighbors: If Israel were to cease to exist today,
Islam would continue to hate America, Christians and Jews; Islam "is
peace" only when its devotees practice peace and stop their verbal
and monetary support for terrorists and terrorist ideals.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sept. 11 Fund's Fine Print Angers Many Relatives," Jan. 17: The
federal fund for Sept. 11 was created to assist families in
recovering from the tragedy, not to create a new class of
millionaires. I don't believe that taxpayers and donors intended for
these families to get millions on top of insurance settlements and
lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, lawyers will take offense that families cannot sue if
they take money dispensed from the fund, because they cannot extract
their pound of flesh from the families, government or airlines. We
hold life insurance for this very situation. This has degenerated
into a greed-filled free-for-all.</LD>
<LD>   Do we really want to bankrupt our airlines for something that was
and is extremely difficult to guard against? People are already
complaining of rights infringement while we try to protect against
this reoccurring.</LD>

dollars would have brought her back or made the hurt less. Most

<HD>That Long Highway Is Far From Lonesome</HD>
<DH>Getting to Las Vegas is no longer a breeze, but work on
Interstate 15 could reduce the travel time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Angelenos craving a quick weekend getaway, Las Vegas was always a
safe bet. With just 272 miles of often desolate freeway separating
the two cities, fortune hunters with full gas tanks and pockets
burning with cash could head out of town on a Friday evening and be
cruising the Strip well before midnight.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, after a decade of jackpot-size growth in the
Inland Empire, Victor Valley and Sin City, that devil-may-care road
trip is becoming more of a gamble. A jaunt on Interstate 15 that used
to take 4 1/2 hours can easily clock in at closer to six or even
eight hours during holiday weekends and other peak travel times.</LD>
<LD>   That trend alarms tourism officials in Las Vegas, where Southern
Californians comprise about 30% of the city's 36 million visitors.
The vast majority of them travel by car on one four-lane artery,
Interstate 15. (The San Francisco Bay Area, Las Vegas' second-biggest
tourism market, accounts for just 5%.)</LD>
<TE>   "Our concern is that people may do it once or twice and then
decide they don't want to do it again because it's too much of a
hassle," said Rob Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention
and Visitors Authority.</TE>
<TE>   He called crowding on Interstate 15 "perhaps the single most
important infrastructure issue facing the Nevada resort industry."</TE>
<TE>   The increased congestion hasn't dampened the affinity of Southern
Californians for Las Vegas, which consistently ranks as one of the
top weekend destinations in surveys by the Automobile Club of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 2000, Interstate 15 traffic near the
California-Nevada border swelled from 22,000 vehicles a day to 35,000
vehicles a day, a 59% increase, according to Caltrans statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism experts expect those numbers to continue to grow in 2002
because of the public's reluctance to fly since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   During October and November, northbound traffic on Fridays at the
Nevada state line rose 16% and 11%, respectively, compared with the
previous year, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation.
In other words, an additional 14,645 and 12,955 cars, trucks, vans
and SUVs were sharing the same two lanes. It doesn't take a traffic
engineer to figure out what the results were.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming back from Las Vegas on a Sunday or the Monday after a long
weekend, it's almost a 100% guarantee you will get a lot of
congestion on that I-15 corridor," said Marie Montgomery, a AAA
spokeswoman. "People know about that, and they either prepare for it
and try to leave at a different time, or they put up with it."</TE>
<TE>   But Las Vegas tourism officials aren't taking Southern
California's tourist traffic for granted. In 2000, the Convention and
Visitors Authority hired a private traffic consultant at $5,000 a
month to lobby federal, state and local government officials in both
states for Interstate 15 construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Nevada broke ground on a $45.5-million freeway
widening project that, by its completion next year, will add an
additional southbound lane from Las Vegas to the state line in Primm.
A second project to add a third northbound lane from Primm to Las
Vegas is scheduled to begin in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Officials focused on easing southbound traffic first because those
leaving-Las Vegas crowds are usually the worst. Californians tend to
stagger their arrival times from Thursdays through Saturdays and to
flood out of the city en masse on Sunday afternoons or the last day
of holiday weekends, said Bob Mckenzie, a spokesman for the Nevada
Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last Thanksgiving weekend, for instance, 35,089 vehicles
entered Nevada by way of Interstate 15 that Friday, but 48,447 left
the state via the same route that Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "People who live with the traffic in California, what they see as
a traffic jam isn't necessarily the same thing we see as a traffic
jam," Mckenzie said. "You have a higher tolerance for traffic than we
do."</TE>
<TE>   Upgrades are planned for the California side of Interstate 15 as
well. Caltrans is scheduled to begin work this spring on a
$178-million project to add an additional traffic lane in each
direction on the 29-mile stretch from Victorville to Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   That area has become particularly susceptible to weekend
bottlenecks, said Holly Kress, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case in Nevada, the work will be done on the southbound
side of Interstate 15 first, with construction of the northbound lane
expected to begin early next year.</TE>
<TE>   As an indication of the freeway's significance, Nevada is
contributing $10 million of its own federal highway funds to Caltrans
for the widening project.</TE>
<TE>   In the mostly open desert from Barstow to the Nevada state line,
Caltrans' widening work will be more modest. An 18-mile-long truck
lane is already under construction, to run south from the Halloran
summit to Baker and another truck lane will be added on a 3.6-mile
segment outside Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   Truck lanes improve traffic flow by getting slow-moving vehicles
out of the way on hills. They are "not the ultimate fix," Kress said,
but the best Caltrans can do on a limited budget.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, the road crews could slow the adjacent lanes of
traffic. Although two lanes will remain open in each direction, speed
limits are reduced. To limit delays, Caltrans is keeping its workers
off the route from Friday afternoons to Monday mornings.</TE>
<TE>   Alternative modes of transportation are also being reviewed.
Amtrak is preparing to revive passenger rail service, which was
suspended in 1997 because of low ridership, between Los Angeles and
Salt Lake City, via Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak officials hope the addition of high-speed trains and a
22-mile lane for passing freights will shave two hours from the trip,
which previously took seven hours.</TE>
<TE>   The project has been delayed for more than a year by environmental
concerns, including the impact on desert tortoises, said Vernae
Graham, an Amtrak spokeswoman. Construction should take less than a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, transportation officials say Southern Californians can
cut their travel times to and from Las Vegas by avoiding peak driving
periods--Friday evenings and Saturday mornings for traffic entering
Las Vegas and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays and Monday holidays.</TE>
<TE>   The new capacity being added to Interstate 15 will quickly be
absorbed, particularly with the population growth in the Inland
Empire and southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "Widening I-15 the way it is now will not solve all of our
problems," said Powers of the Convention and Visitors Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic experts say that with continued growth forecast for the
entire region, it's hard to imagine a road improvement that will make
the Las Vegas road trip what it used to be. The under-five-hour ride
may be more endangered than the desert tortoise.</TE>

<LD>Andie MacDowell banged on a drum. Benjamin Bratt was locked out, and
men in Armani suits were collapsing into one another's arms all over
the place. In other words, on Sunday night, Hollywood was back to
normal.</LD>
<LD>   At the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Golden Globes guests had a choice of
half a dozen after-parties, held everywhere from the basement to the
roof. Guests and gawkers cheered and shot photos of the celebrities
as they traveled between the parties inside the hotel. The
destination of the evening? The Tiki party hosted by the winningest
folks: DreamWorks Pictures, USA Films and Universal Studios.</LD>
<LD>   As we entered the giant candlelit tent attached to Trader Vic's
restaurant, director Ron Howard, Jeffrey Katzenberg and producer
Brian Grazer, whose film "A Beautiful Mind" won four Globes, were
wrapped in a group hug.</LD>
<TE>   Nearby, director Robert Altman, who won a best director Globe for
"Gosford Park," toasted his win with two of the film's co-stars,
Maggie Smith and Emily Watson. The director told us he was caught off
guard. "I had nothing prepared," he said. "What strikes a nerve with
the public, you never know. You just have to go with your instincts."</TE>
<TE>   In May, the director is scheduled to start shooting his next film,
but he didn't want to give away the plot. "If I could tell you what
it was about, I wouldn't have to make the film."</TE>
<TE>   Watson told us, "We were all saying, 'It doesn't matter, it
doesn't matter.' But, in the end, it really did matter." Working with
Altman, Watson said, was "very liberating. He just chucks you in
there and makes things up as you go along."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, Keith Richards, whose presence was a mystery,
danced the night away. And at the back of the room, Globe best actor,
drama, winner Russell Crowe was surrounded by bodyguards. A blond in
a strappy black dress was cuddled up next to him as he chatted with
his co-star, Globe winner Jennifer Connelly.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, the party's other rock star, Bryan Adams, did have a
reason to be there--he's writing music for an upcoming DreamWorks
film. Adams had a great view and snapped pictures of well-wishers
congratulating Crowe, including the lone Rolling Stone, as well as
Hugh Hefner, who had brought his seven girlfriends. Adams joked about
how he met his girlfriend of 10 years, a Danish model. "I put an add
in B.T. [a Danish tabloid], saying, 'Rock star seeks beautiful
model.'"</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, at the Miramax party, Kevin Spacey sat on the edge of
a pale blue couch and paid more attention to his cell phone than to
his date. When reporters approached him, Spacey made a beeline for
the door, saying over his shoulder, "I'm not doing that tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Sting, who won a best song Globe for "Until ... " from "Kate &amp;
Leopold," was more accommodating. The British singer and sometime
actor assured us his days on the silver screen are over. "Nah," he
shook his head. "I'm a singer--that's my vocation."</TE>
<TE>   When Harvey Weinstein entered, Sting ran over and threw his arms
around the Miramax boss. "Well done," Weinstein boomed, returning the
singer's affection. "After 9-11, we're just here to celebrate,"
Weinstein told us. "And everyone was in a good frame of mind."</TE>
<TE>   We didn't want to spoil the mood and left the subjects of Talk,
Tina and synergy alone.</TE>
<TE>   In a corner, Michael Caine proved that even on an awards night,
actors can talk about something besides themselves: "As we're here
celebrating, Osama is in a cave somewhere, trying to find enough
power to run his dialysis machine," the British actor observed with
some satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   At the safari-themed HBO party upstairs, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson
held court. Hanks couldn't stop smiling, happily showing off his
award for "Band of Brothers." "We worked so ... hard," Hanks said.
"It's nice to get a little present at the end of it." He wasn't off
the clock, yet: A stream of women asked to have their picture taken
with him, and, like a gentleman, the actor obliged.</TE>
<TE>   Later, back at the DreamWorks party, three handlers with headsets
were sharing a cigarette when word came through that Bratt was stuck
outside. Since he didn't have a ticket, doormen weren't letting him
in. One of the security people had to fetch Bratt and escort him
through the door. She did, and Bratt showed up, moments later, with a
beautiful brunette woman on his arm. He just missed our favorite
moment of the evening: MacDowell's impromptu drum performance. "I
played music in high school," she told us later. "I love the bongos."</TE>

<LD>Three little pigs carried off one of children literature's highest
honors Monday, but none of the pigs was named Olivia. David Wiesner's
"The Three Pigs," an unconventional retelling of the familiar story,
won the Randolph Caldecott Medal for best picture book.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Sue Park's middle-grade novel "A Single Shard," about a 12th
century Korean orphan, received the John Newbery Medal for the most
distinguished contribution to American literature for children.</LD>
<LD>   The American Library Assn. also named three Caldecott Honor Books:
"Martin's Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." with
illustrations by Bryan Collier and text by Doreen Rappaport; "The
Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins," illustrated by Brian Selznick and
written by Barbara Kerley; and "The Stray Dog," illustrated and
written by Marc Simont.</LD>
<TE>   But Ian Falconer's popular "Olivia Saves the Circus," about an
energetic piglet, and a sequel to "Olivia," a Caldecott Honor Book
last year, went home empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing Village Tale</TE>
<TE>   Polly Horvath's quirky middle-grade tale of a girl from a small
fishing village, "Everything on a Waffle," was named a Newbery Honor
Book along with Marilyn Nelson's "Carver: A Life in Poems," a
biography of George Washington Carver for young adults.</TE>
<TE>   "David Wiesner was stunned when we called to tell him he had won,"
said librarian Ann Cook of Altamonte Springs, Fla., who served as a
judge on the 15-member committee that selected this year's Caldecott
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members talked by speaker phone with the winners Monday
morning before the awards were announced.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the highlight," Cook said of her judging experience,
which had members meeting past midnight to discuss the many
candidates. "Bryan Collier was speechless, literally. You could hear
him trying to gather himself."</TE>
<TE>   Simont, a 1957 Caldecott medalist who is in his 80s and
illustrated his first book in 1939, laughed when he first heard the
news about "The Stray Dog." He told the committee it had made his
day.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he started to cry," Cook said. "And Brian Selznick said he
couldn't wait to tell his parents. That was so sweet. Then he started
to cry."</TE>
<TE>   A 'Rewarding Process'</TE>
<TE>   Although Cook can't reveal  details of the committee's weekend
deliberations, she called it "a long, draining but rewarding
process." She praised Wiesner for "thinking out of the box" and for
his talent and vision.</TE>
<TE>   Wiesner won the Caldecott 10 years ago for the picture book
"Tuesday," and his "Sector 7" was a Caldecott Honor Book in 2000, as
was "Free Fall" in 1989. His "The Three Pigs" begins on a familiar
note, but then the wolf huffs and puffs the pigs off the page into a
new world as Wiesner plays with the structure and conventions of
traditional storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   "Pigs burst through the pages' boundaries and soar into new
dimensions," said Caldecott committee chairwoman Kate McClelland in
an official statement. "Witty dialogue and physical humor make this a
selection that will have children squealing with delight."</TE>
<TE>   The Newbery awards committee recognized Park, a first-generation
Korean American and author of "Seesaw Girl" and "The Kite Fighters,"
for "her powerful and precise writing as she explores universal
themes about loyalty and art."</TE>
<TE>   In Park's "A Single Shard," a 10-year-old who lives under a bridge
with his disabled guardian is fascinated by a nearby community of
potters and overcomes great odds to pursue his dream of becoming a
potter.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Pate is a book critic for the Orlando Sun Sentinel, a

<LD>HENRY FORD AND THE JEWS</LD>
<LD>   The Mass Production of Hate</LD>
<LD>   By Neil Baldwin</LD>
<TE>   PublicAffairs</TE>
<TE>   432 pages, $27.50</TE>
<TE>   Neil Baldwin, author of the well-researched, eminently readable
"Henry Ford and the Jews," remembers being surprised when Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" was to be broadcast on network
television for the first time, sponsored in its commercial-free
entirety by the Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing attempt seemed incongruous: Hadn't Henry Ford earned
a worldwide reputation as a virulent anti-Semite, publishing his own
newspaper to spread his poisonous rhetoric, receiving from Hitler the
highest medal given by Germany to distinguished foreigners as late as
1938?</TE>
<TE>   A communications director at Ford, when asked about the odd
pairing, said the company's decision to sponsor the program had
nothing to do with Henry Ford's reputation. "I think quite a few are
not even aware of his background," the spokesman replied.</TE>
<TE>   For Baldwin, "the mind-bending concept that 'Schindler's List' was
being packaged as a gift from the Ford Motor Co. to the American
television viewing public" alerted the author that "here resided an
inadequately told story in American history."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, building the narrative piece by piece, Baldwin excels in
setting the record straight about the icon of American ingenuity and
manufacturing excellence and his vitriolic hatred of Jews. He deals
equitably with the facts, presenting a balanced account, including
the brave response of the Jewish American community in the face of
Ford's aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with Ford's childhood days, Baldwin examines the
influences on Ford and his contemporaries, establishing how
anti-Semitism became part of the American psyche. From what Baldwin
could determine, Ford "did not know any Jews until middle age. His
impressions and prejudices ... were drawn from widespread stereotypes
common to this tightly circumscribed world of post-bellum midwestern
America."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as Baldwin points out, it's one thing to be exposed to biased
images and quite another to harbor, assimilate, believe and give
public vent to them. Sometime between 1910 and 1918, Ford
metamorphosed from ignorant idealist to embittered anti-Semite,
finding a target to blame for his boredom, disillusionment and
middle-aged unhappiness. "He grabbed onto the Jews and never let go."
Within Ford's increasingly xenophobic worldview, his ignorance and
isolation from Jews bred a heinous form of paranoia and hate.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the start of World War I, just as his motor company was
flourishing and he was awash in money and power, that Ford's vague
rantings against Jews grew to monstrous proportions.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1920s, Ford was publishing "The Protocols of the Learned
Elders of Zion," "The International Jew" and a series of 91 weekly
noxious essays on "The Jewish Question" in his privately published
(and utterly profitless) newspaper, "The Dearborn Independent,"
blaming all that ailed America on Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Deftly, Baldwin gives readers a sense of Ford's thinking and
motivations without ever wading into the tenuous waters of
psychological speculation. Using Ford's statements and writings, as
well as oral history transcripts and unpublished family memoirs,
Baldwin presents Ford's mind--clearly genius in terms of auto
manufacturing--to be pitiably naive, ill-educated and unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   During Ford's libel trial against the Chicago Tribune in 1919, for
example, Ford's statements under oath make it painfully clear that
the auto magnate was "ignorant of most basic textbook facts,"
including the fundamental principles of government, the dates of the
Revolutionary War and the identity of Benedict Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in 1927, when confronted by the damage wrought by the
"Dearborn" essays, and considering the potential negative impact on
auto sales as the company prepared to launch the new Model A, Ford
apologized--in a way.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Louis Marshall, an attorney active in New York Jewish
affairs whom Ford had never met, to draft an apology on his behalf.
Ford signed the apology and dispersed it to the press without reading
its content, and clearly without changing his mind on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Apology or no, the fallout of Ford's attacks were far-reaching.
Ten years before Hitler became chancellor of Germany, he praised Ford
for the "great service" his articles had provided America; Hitler's
private office boasted a large portrait of Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Recent research has shown that during World War II, half of the
work force at Ford-Werke, the German arm of Ford Motor Co., were
slave-labor foreign captives working under Gestapo supervision.</TE>
<TE>   To the corporation's credit, Ford Motor Co. embarked on
correctives even before its founder died, seeking to put an end to
the dark legacy. But the legacy is a legitimate part of American
history and deserves to be weighed as such.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin's book seeks not to smash the history book portrait of
Henry Ford as the great American manufacturing icon, but to shade
that image with honesty. Though the narrative wanders a bit now and
again, these digressions seldom detract. Rather, Baldwin's engaging
inquiry adds a realistic, if ugly, patina to our image of Henry Ford.</TE>

<HD>A Painful Visit to the Past</HD>
<DH>In her new novel, Judith Freeman explores a brutal episode
involving the Mormon Church, from which she drifted away years ago.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Red Water," Judith Freeman's latest novel, is nothing less than the
story of a haunting--families, meadows, an entire religious community
haunted by a massacre. Questions about faith, fundamentalism,
passion, perseverance, humility and justice sneak up out of the
southwestern landscape and from the smallest movements of the
characters.</LD>
<LD>   In 1857, a wagon train of migrants from Arkansas crossed Utah.
Gentiles, as they were called by the Mormons whose territory they
were crossing. They were carrying more than 1,000 head of cattle to
market in Northern California, as well as horses, clothes, gold,
jewelry and many supplies. The Mormons were not a happy people at the
time, almost at war with the government: Joseph Smith, the prophet,
or head, of the Mormon Church, had been murdered in 1844 after
announcing his candidacy for president, and an apostle of the church,
Parley P. Pratt, had been murdered in Arkansas. At the same time, the
Mormon community had been steadily expanding its territory from
Missouri into Idaho and Utah.</LD>
<TE>   John D. Lee, a prominent and wealthy Mormon, had been charged by
the church to create a settlement in southern Utah and to develop a
relationship with the Indians there. Because of his influence with
the local tribes, he was able to order the Indians to attack the
wagon train first. The Gentiles retreated. A few days later, Lee rode
into their camp waving a white flag. He ordered the women and
children to leave the wagons first, and then the men. He assured them
that the men would be escorted to safety by a Mormon man. Instead,
they were shot or clubbed to death. More than 120 people, a majority
of them women and children, died. The murders were blamed on the
Indians, and the massacre was later dismissed as the work of a
renegade group of Mormons. John Lee was executed in 1877 for his
role, but the church never took responsibility. While the story is
barely acknowledged in Mormon history, it remains a source of shame
and division within the church that persists to this day, especially
for the descendants of the participants.</TE>
<TE>   She Married at 17,</TE>
<TE>   Divorced at 21</TE>
<TE>   Freeman was born in 1946 in Ogden, Utah, and was raised in the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is
officially known. She married at 17, had a son at 19, and divorced at
21. As a single mother, educating herself by reading Thomas Hardy and
Virginia Woolf, among others, she drifted from the church, from which
she remains estranged. Still, most of her writing is about the
Mormons. "I never kid myself about the fact that my background always
informs the way I look at the world," she wrote in a recent essay,
"and how I write about it."</TE>
<TE>   "Red Water" follows her three previous novels, "The Chinchilla
Farm" (1989), "Set For Life" (1991), "A Desert of Pure Feeling"
(1996), as well as "Family Attractions," a collection of short
stories (1988). But "Red Water" differs greatly from Freeman's other
work in that it is set in the past and based on historical events.
The voices she uses--three of Lee's 19 wives, Emma, Anna and
Rachel--are of real women. Freeman relies on their diaries, as well
as John Lee's, on research and her own imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, whose novel will be released this month, looks a lot like
the musician Laurie Anderson; she has that same impish smile, short
hair, round face and eyes. She has a deep, sudden laugh but still
seems serious. Thoughts are weighed carefully, but she appears
comfortable not knowing all the answers. Like any good writer with a
national reputation, she does not want to be pigeonholed as Mormon or
western but wonders why so many people come to the West, write books
as if they understand the region and then get national acclaim.
Freeman was handed the truth as a child, tore it up as a young adult
and is making her own version right now.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Water" challenged whatever faith she had left in her
religious upbringing; yet she says she got a few answers and a lot of
peace from the writing of it. This is evident in her demeanor and her
calm, quiet voice as, dressed all in black, she sits down for a
Japanese meal in downtown Los Angeles. She talks in a voice that is
full of emotion and yet measured, speaking with a combination of
reverence, relief and amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Water" did not come easily. In 1996, Freeman came across a
book by Juanita Brooks, a Mormon and a self-taught historian, called
"The Mountain Meadow Massacre," written in the 1950s. "I knew,
growing up, that the Mormons had done something terrible,
unspeakable, involving such treachery that it could not be talked
about. I knew vaguely that it was blamed on the Indians," Freeman
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone gave me a diary of one of John Lee's wives, Anna Lee,
called 'My Life With the Saintly Devil,' an account she had clearly
written to make money. Juanita Brooks had also written a short
monograph about Emma, whose journals, since she came from England in
1855 when she was 19, cover the entire colonization. Rachel, another
of Lee's wives, also left a journal. In many ways she was the hardest
voice to capture because she was so devout. Her diary consists of
bland entries, for example, minutes taken of meetings at Fort Harmony
where Lee and his wives lived, but things leak through--the number of
Indian children brought into the Fort, how many of them died, how
much ammunition they kept and how many sides of beef. I think, using
these diaries, that I was able to get pretty close to what their
lives were actually like in that brutal environment. It was just a
question of how to tell the larger story."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman divided the book into four sections: The Execution
(inspired in part by William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying"), Emma, Anna
and Rachel. In this way, we see many sides of John Lee. Emma has the
greatest physical passion for Lee. She has a reputation, in the novel
and real life, for having the quickest temper, for putting up her
fists at the slightest provocation. Anna, who left Lee before he was
killed, had her heart set on a life of many adventures and did not
relish the idea of being saddled with babies before she was 20.
Rachel, who was with Lee during the massacre, was one of three
sisters whom Lee married. He also married their mother. This
framework demanded that the characters speak for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to remember," Freeman says, how persecuted the Mormons
were in the 19th century. The governor of Illinois had issued an
extermination order against them, and in the 1830s and '40s they were
[often] tarred and feathered, their prophet was murdered, and they
were forced into the wilderness. They hoped to build their own
kingdom in Salt Lake City." They were fearful and angry, she said,
and in killing the Arkansan travelers, they were practicing a
doctrine called blood atonement, which said it is better to relieve a
man of life and speed his way to heaven. "It was religious fervor
that brought 16-year-old boys to kill women and children."</TE>
<TE>   Something happened to Freeman while writing "Red Water." She found
a new sympathy for these individuals, particularly the women. She
found in herself a kind of forgiveness and, more important, an
understanding of their vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling With</TE>
<TE>   Utah History in Italy</TE>
<TE>   While she was working on the novel, Freeman's husband,
photographer Anthony Hernandez, was given a Prix de Rome to study in
Italy for a year. The couple lived in a 16th century villa. From this
perch, Freeman struggled to remember Utah. "It made some sense, the
context of Christianity, a history of war and terror in the name of
religion. It seemed that history played itself out again and again
with different characters but the same fervor." The pasta was
excellent, but the section she wrote that year never saw the light of
day.</TE>
<TE>   For another section, Freeman spent a winter and spring alone in
Idaho, where the couple, who live most of the year in MacArthur Park
in Los Angeles, keep a home and Judith keeps her horse. "I took
myself up on some kind of edge," she says, "until I felt I was
teetering. It was just me, my dog, Scout, my yellow horse and the
pristine landscape." That section was also a contemporary section, a
kind of "cry from the heart," about our world on a crazy edge. "Why
isn't anyone screaming?" she wondered, as she wrote about violence in
Rwanda and the unequal distribution of wealth in the world. The book
was then called "Red Water, Red Bones." But the section didn't fit.
"I was really crying out, 'What is this book about?'" It wasn't until
she abandoned the section that she was able to complete the book, six
months later. It was also the first novel she wrote longhand, which
she says facilitated a more direct flow of thoughts onto paper.</TE>
<TE>   One of eight children, Freeman says she is grateful that her shoe
salesman father, the only Democrat in town, was one of the more
liberal Mormons in their community. Her great-grandfather William
Flake was a friend of Brigham Young and was jailed in Yuma, Ariz.,
for refusing to give up one of his wives when polygamy was outlawed
in the 1890s. A photo of him in stripes was "proudly displayed" in
the house in which Freeman grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Much of "Red Water" is a study of "Living the Principle," as the
Mormons called it. It is a study of jealousy and how they overcame or
didn't overcome it, a study of communal living. "To all those who
would denounce our Holy Principle," Emma writes at one point, "I
would say this: A child thrives under the care of multiple mothers.
And a mother thrives, too, when aided by her sisters."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's first marriage, at 17, was to man six years older. They
were married in a Mormon temple. "It was all so normal," she says.
"My two best friends married at 15 and 16. When I got married, I
thought it would be some kind of out, like, this is how you have
adventures. But within a month I was pregnant. My mother said to me,
'There's not a thing you can do about it.'" She moved to Minnesota,
where her then-husband was a counselor on the campus of Macalester
College. It was there that she discovered books. She joined a writing
class, wrote a short story and won a prize.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 20 years, she wrote about her own "meager"
experience, "exotic yet quintessentially American and ordinary." In
several novels, Freeman reveals secret Mormon rituals, in "Red
Water," a marriage ceremony is described in detail. Freeman shudders,
remembering that she once made the sign of a slash across her throat
swearing she would never reveal church secrets, and a sign of
disembowelment across her own stomach if she should betray it. For
years after leaving the church she had stomachaches, until an article
in the New York Times revealed the church had changed the ritual,
deleting the throat slashing and disemboweling. Her stomachaches went
away.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up Mormon involved an intense brainwashing," Freeman
says. "The religion encompassed every single aspect of life; it
engulfed life, dominated politics and our education. I struggled for
a long time to come to terms with my background. Writing this book
gave me an enormous affection for the past, for the absolute
uniqueness of that culture and its moral complexity, their sly humor,
and for nature and the American ranch culture. There are no cozy
judgments to be made."</TE>

<LD>Kelp Cookies</LD>
<LD>   We have all seen kelp growing in the waters off our coast or
strands of kelp washed up onto the beach. Kelp is the fastest-growing
plant in the world. It provides a home to hundreds of animals living
in the kelp-forest ecosystem. Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera)
contains a substance called algin that makes it flexible enough to
withstand ocean currents. Algin is used to thicken, gel and stabilize
products such as ice cream, lipstick, paint, orange juice and
toothpaste. It can also make cookies gooey and delicious. Ask an
adult for help as you follow the directions for making Kelp Cookies.
Powdered kelp is available at natural food stores.</LD>

<HD>A Neck-and-Neck Race for Best Accessory Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accessories, those small gestures of glitter or sentiment, often help
actors illuminate their personalities without having to say a word.</LD>
<LD>   Though their elegant designer attire made the big first impression
as stars stepped along the red carpet for the Golden Globe Awards on
Sunday, a closer look showed that many were eager to distinguish and
even reveal themselves with accents chosen not just for their
trendiness.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Harring, of "Mullholland Drive," subtly invoked the mystery
of the movie with her contrast of a strict menswear-inspired
pinstriped suit, an oversized red flower in her hair and a large
diamond pendant strategically placed on her bare and plunging
neckline. Those small details brought a feminine polish to the look
that was missing from Sissy Spacek's pant ensemble.</LD>
<TE>   In what could be an end to the cliched blaze of big diamond
suites, many on the red carpet selected subtle diamond accents or a
less pricey statement necklace, often in colorful semiprecious gems.</TE>
<TE>   The effect made stars--and their jewelry--seem more approachable.
Jane Kaczmarek's bold amethyst necklace by Pagliei &amp; Comly with a
recycled chandelier crystal pendant was "totally opposite the
dress,'' said Daniel James Cantu, who made the gown he called "a nod
to '30s Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Women stars seemed less fragile when they wore chunky gems to
counterbalance their stiletto-heel shoes and delicate dresses.
Indeed, with a big amethyst bead and cross necklace by Alexander
Designs, Garcelle Beauvais Nilon was powerfully feminine in her
delicate lavender Eduardo Lucero dress.</TE>
<TE>   Lorna Luft's brooch and bracelet brought to mind old
Hollywood--850-carat aquamarines that once belonged to Mae West and a
rainbow-shaped bag that recalled her mother's famous "Wizard of Oz"
song.</TE>
<TE>   The accents didn't have to be valuable gems to be effective. The
most memorable was a simple piece of paper. Kevin Spacey bravely
revealed a tender side to his personality as he repeatedly explained
that the photo he had tucked across his tie was that of director Ted
Demme, who died suddenly days earlier. No one really cared to know
who made his suit after seeing the actor choke with emotion as he
repeated his departed friend's name.</TE>

<HD>Factoring Dads Into the Welfare Equation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Funding of reforms that cut welfare rolls by half ends this fall--and
the usual players, from politicians to social workers, have already
begun lining up to push their ideas into a new, improved version of
the 1996 federal mandate.</LD>
<LD>   Some say its work-for-welfare focus pushed thousands of women
toward admirable self-sufficiency. Others worry that its restrictions
and penalties will leave families stranded in our collapsing economy.</LD>
<LD>   Now, an economist is weighing in, with a suggestion seldom heard
in the welfare reform cacophony: You want to cut the rolls of single
moms on the dole? Stop focusing on their welfare checks and look at
the puny paychecks their babies' daddies bring home.</LD>
<TE>   The notion that welfare payments encourage single women to have
kids "is a familiar idea, something that people on the streets have
talked about for decades," says economist Robert Moffitt, a professor
at Johns Hopkins University.</TE>
<TE>   The presumption drives much of the public contempt for the
stereotypical welfare mom, though I've always considered it absurd to
think a woman would have another child just to collect the 50 bucks
or so the kid would add to her monthly allowance.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt has spent 10 years studying the issue, using welfare
records in California and New York to track what happens to family
size as welfare payments go up or down. He's found virtually no
correlation between trends in benefit levels and the rate of unwed
births.</TE>
<TE>   But he has discovered an interesting wrinkle: The rate of births
among low-income, single women increases as the earnings and
employment levels of their male counterparts decline.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, welfare might not promote childbearing, but it
gives women an alternative to marrying the fathers of their kids--men
whose limited earning potential makes marriage less attractive than
the economic stability a monthly welfare check provides.</TE>
<TE>   "You talk to women on welfare, and they want to be married,"
Moffitt says from his office in Baltimore. "They tend to hold very
traditional views ... that the man should be the breadwinner, should
support his wife and children."</TE>
<TE>   That's a charming though outdated ideal. The reality is it gets
harder every day for men with limited skills to earn enough to
provide for a wife and kids.</TE>
<TE>   The income of less educated men has dropped drastically over the
last 20 years as well-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared and wages
shrunk in fields like transportation and construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The new economy puts a premium on education, computer skills,
having a strong competitive position," Moffitt says. Men who lack a
college education or specific job skills "have been left behind
economically.''</TE>
<TE>   "Their unemployment is high, their work patterns are intermittent,
their jobs are unstable," he says. "Some have turned to drugs or
crime. From the point of view of women in their neighborhoods, such
men are no longer attractive marriage partners."</TE>
<TE>   Because the men tend to be traditionalists, too, their failure
wounds them as well. "They feel shame. They don't have much pride in
their status in society," Moffitt says. "Many of them are working
long hours for wages that don't provide enough to be able to support
a family, to provide for a child. They're discouraged, cynical."</TE>
<TE>   Not just deadbeat dads, but emotionally dead, too.</TE>
<TE>   Social policy experts say the issue of single motherhood is likely
to emerge as a potent one in the upcoming debate over welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   Provisions to penalize welfare recipients who keep having children
didn't make it into the federal welfare plan last time around, but 20
states have already moved to adopt so-called family caps that
discourage out-of-wedlock births.</TE>
<TE>   In the six years since the reforms took effect, the marriage rate
has risen. But is that because couples were scared straight by the
reality of dwindling benefits or because they were encouraged by the
booming economy? Or have they been influenced by a growing social
conservatism that frowns on unwed motherhood?</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt has been awarded a $1.3-million grant by the National
Institutes of Health to fund 10 more years of study, tracking
families, statistics and trends.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes enough attention is paid to men in the upcoming round of
welfare reform. "Most men in low-income neighborhoods receive no
support from the government--no job training, no education subsidies,
no welfare. If we're manipulating the system to encourage marriage,
we have to factor them into the equation."</TE>
<TE>   It may not be enough to usher welfare mothers into the work force.
If we want their families to succeed, we may have to give their men a
hand as well.</TE>

<HD>More Cool Quarters</HD>
<DH>Part 2 Starting in 1999, new quarters began appearing--five
per year--to honor all 50 states. But there have been other cool
quarters commemorating important events in history.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1893 Isabella Quarter</LD>
<LD>   The Isabella quarter, made in 1893, was the first commemorative
quarter. It celebrated the Columbian World's Fair in Chicago and the
400th anniversary of the discovery of America. The coin featured
Queen Isabella of Spain and was sold for $1 as a souvenir. Queen
Isabella helped finance Christopher Columbus' first voyage to America
in 1492.</LD>
<LD>   George Washington</LD>
<TE>   Quarters</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans are used to seeing George Washington on one side of
a quarter and an American eagle on the other. These coins were
designed by a sculptor from New York named John Flanagan. Circulated
in 1932, they were intended to be commemorative coins celebrating the
first president's birth. But they became so popular with the public
that they were made almost every year until 1998.</TE>
<TE>   1776-1976 Washington</TE>
<TE>   Bicentennial Quarter</TE>
<TE>   The United States celebrated its 200th birthday in 1976. In honor
of this event, the U.S. Treasury held a contest, open to the public,
to see who could come up with the best design for a quarter. The
winner, a man named Jack L. Ahr, won a prize of $5,000 after
submitting a picture of a colonial drummer and a victory torch
encircled by 13 stars. These stars represent the original colonies
that came together to form what became the United States. Because a
great many bicentennial quarters were made, they can still be found,
on occasion, in our pocket change.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: The 2001 state quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Maura Walsh wrote about the first series of state quarters in the
Kids' Reading Room from Nov. 27-Dec. 1, 2000. This story will be on

<HD>All Talked Out Already?</HD>
<DH>People don't seem to be saying much about Sept. 11, but
that doesn't mean it's not on their minds, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Oppenlander can't pinpoint the date, but sometime this winter
the Sept. 11 terror attacks slipped from the tip of his tongue to the
back of his mind.</LD>
<LD>   In those first few days of reeling emotions and incredulity,
Oppenlander--like many others--could talk about little else.
Conversation, he said, helped ease the emotional pain inflicted by
the staggering death toll and forged a tangible reality out of
two-dimensional horrors he saw on his television screen.</LD>
<LD>   Then war began in Afghanistan and the stumbling economy got worse.
Closer to home there were holidays to celebrate and school functions
to attend and, on a recent morning, Little League tryouts under a
crystal-clear sky at an Irvine ballpark.</LD>
<TE>   "I think people's thoughts moved immediately to the war, and now
that that's winding down, they're getting on with things,"
Oppenlander, 37, said as his son Nicholas, 7, and a dozen other boys
took turns batting. "People stopped hearing about it and had other
things to focus on. It just doesn't come up in normal conversation
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Four months after the Sept. 11 attacks, the pungent agony wrought
by the crumbling towers has faded for Oppenlander and others, even as
work crews continue to dig through the rubble and, occasionally,
recover body parts. Flags still flutter from cars on the freeway, and
"God Bless America" signs crop up in unexpected places, but many
people say they're just talked out.</TE>
<TE>   One researcher thinks we still have things to say. It's just that
more and more people don't want to hear them.</TE>
<TE>   "People stop talking because they get the feeling from others that
others do not want to listen," said Roxane Cohen Silver, a UC Irvine
professor of psychology and social behavior who is leading a
multiyear national study tracking the emotions of 1,300 people in the
aftermath of the attacks. In the first report from that study, a
survey taken around Thanksgiving found about 17% of people "were
reporting what's called symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,"
a rate she said is high.</TE>
<TE>   The next survey will be taken in spring, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they aren't talking about it, it's not necessarily because
they are not distressed," she said. The silence can come from direct
rejection--"Somebody would say, 'I don't want to hear about it'"--or
through nonverbal signs, such as shrugs or appearing to be distracted
as the person talks.</TE>
<TE>   But in the ensuing silence, grief festers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we get is a conspiracy of silence as everybody thinks that
nobody wants to talk about it," said Silver, who studied the
aftermath of the Columbine school shooting and other traumatic
events, including the 1993 wildfires in Laguna Beach and Malibu. "The
more others constrain your talking, the worse you get over time. We
see an increase in distress over time."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Carroll, 62, lives alone in Anaheim and says the main reason
she doesn't talk about the attacks anymore is there's no one at home
to talk to.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is a creature of habit, and on a recent sun-dappled
morning she stopped during her daily walk to chat with Gene McKibbin,
77, as he tended to some of the 135 rose bushes growing in his yard
off North West Street. They didn't talk about the terror attacks. But
for Carroll, the images are always with her, just waiting for a
trigger to come rushing back--images of the airliners bursting into
the twin towers, and then the buildings collapsing, and of a huge gap
in the Pentagon wall and a blackened Pennsylvania farm field.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while I'll be talking with someone, and I'll
refer to the towers. I'll just say Sept. 11, and they know right
away," Carroll said. "Then they get quiet for a few seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schudson, a sociology and communications professor at UC
San Diego, said the images last flashed back for him earlier this
month when 15-year-old Charles J. Bishop stole an airplane and flew
it into a Tampa skyscraper, an event that Schudson described as an
"echo" of the initial attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It takes such reminders, he said, to bring events back into
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "Public consciousness is ephemeral, and something doesn't stay
constantly in mind unless there's some ongoing reason for it to do
so," Schudson said. "But the sheer suddenness and size of the
violence has left a really deep scar, even if people aren't talking
about it on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   The most common reminder, he speculated, comes from a trip to the
airport. "I doubt that anyone who goes to an airport can do so
without in some fashion thinking about Sept. 11," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For many people, the start of the new year has helped place the
attacks in something of a historical locker and "marks the end of a
period of formal mourning," even as we still wrestle with grief, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Mourning] has to stop sometime, and no time feels exactly right
because the dead are dead and we do mourn them," Schudson said. "I
imagine that the new year was one of the moments where we felt maybe
that we could stop talking about it and thinking about it every day
and feel a little less guilty about that."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Thompson, who teaches ceramic art at Chaffey College in
Rancho Cucamonga, said the attacks resurface regularly through her
students' art.</TE>
<TE>   One recent assignment was to make teapots commemorating an event
of the students' choosing. One student designed a piece that
portrayed a firefighter and the rubble of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe people have stopped talking about it, but they
haven't forgotten it," Thompson said as she took a break from moving
the contents of her private studio near Fullerton Airport to her
hillside backyard in north Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said she thinks of the attacks daily and sees the same
searing image of a plane "going right through a building." But
outside the classroom, the subject rarely comes up in chats with
friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   In the classroom, though, the attacks linger just below the
surface, welling up in students' conversations primarily because of
the close relationship between art and emotion, she believes.</TE>
<TE>   But with time has come distance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've become removed from it," Thompson said, sitting in
the open back of her SUV next to a small stack of bricks and boxes of
ceramic supplies. "It's become something other than it was. It's
become an anthem."</TE>
<TE>   But it has also become a benchmark. Moments earlier, Thompson saw
a brief television news report about a shooting at a Virginia law
school in which three people were killed--normally the kind of event
that would generate live coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't even a picture," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For some, moving on is a conscious decision.</TE>
<TE>   "That's survival," said Marie Shebanek, 62, as she sat in front of
a computer at the Newport Beach Public Library. "We can't be glued to
the TV all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Shebanek doesn't separate the attacks from the ensuing war and
economic news. She sees them as a continuum. To talk of Marines sent
to Afghanistan who are killed in a plane crash is to talk of the
attacks themselves, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of the total picture," Shebanek said, bristling at
a question about whether the initial attacks are receding into
history. "We've been talked out. We know all the information. Now
we're just waiting to see."</TE>

<LD>For the last few months, Universal Pictures has been juggling a live
grenade, hoping it won't go off. In the public eye, the studio's Ron
Howard-directed film, "A Beautiful Mind," has been viewed as one of
the favorites for this year's best picture Oscar. But behind the
scenes, the studio has carefully been managing a campaign to prevent
the movie from becoming a target of media attacks for the broad
liberties it takes recounting the personal life of Nobel
Prize-winning mathematician John Forbes Nash.</LD>
<LD>   When a studio sells a movie during the crowded Oscar season, it's
always looking for the money quote that eloquently establishes its
film as the must-see movie of the moment. So when Universal Pictures
Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger opened up his copy of Newsweek earlier
this month, he could barely control his excitement.</LD>
<LD>   Weeks earlier, the magazine's film critic, David Ansen, had
dismissed "A Beautiful Mind" as having turned "a fascinating life
into formula." But, lo and behold, here was Newsweek political
columnist George Will practically gushing over the movie's portrayal
of Nash's wrenching struggle with schizophrenia.</LD>
<TE>   "We all read the column Monday morning and went, 'My God, this guy
gets it. This is exactly what we've wanted to convey to everybody,'"
Shmuger recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Better still, the praise came from someone whose intellectual
credentials and name-brand recognition would not only appeal to Oscar
voters but could also bolster the film's credibility in the eyes of
potential media detractors.</TE>
<TE>   By that Friday, the studio had dropped its more conventional
plaudits from ABC Radio and "Good Morning America" and made Will the
centerpiece of a new set of nationwide print ads for the film.</TE>
<TE>   "A breathtaking movie about a beautiful mystery," the Will blurb
read. "It imagines the almost unimaginable: how the intersection of a
woman's love, a cluster of caring individuals and one man's will
contributed to something extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's not exactly what Will said. With the columnist's
permission, Universal altered Will's original concluding phrase,
which originally read: "... a sick man's will contributed to
something extremely rare--remission from a disease that is almost
always irreversibly degenerative."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Universal dropped any reference to Nash's illness is
hardly a shocker; studios tidy up critic quotes all the time.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth noting because the trailers and TV spots created by
Universal and the film's producer, Imagine Entertainment, have all
along avoided any mention of Nash's mental illness. Universal and
Imagine believe it would be a hard sell for moviegoers and would
spoil the conceit of the film, which relies on audiences not
questioning Nash's view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The studio has instead stressed the emotional bond between Nash
and his wife Alicia, played in the film by Russell Crowe and Jennifer
Connelly.</TE>
<TE>   When it became clear that women strongly responded to the film's
portrayal of the couple's relationship, the studio revamped its print
ads, replacing a pensive image of Crowe with an intimate shot of
Crowe and Connelly, their hands intertwined as she whispers in his
ear and caresses his cheek.</TE>
<TE>   The careful marketing has paid off. "A Beautiful Mind" has emerged
as the adult movie hit of the holiday season. In only three weeks of
wide release, the film has already taken in about $74 million at the
box office, won four Golden Globe Awards and earned a pole position
in this year's wide-open Oscar derby.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still anxious, but things are looking good," says Imagine's
Brian Grazer, who has done his own audience research, sitting in the
front row of theaters, looking back at audiences to see if they were
crying or not. "This has been really different from the way we've
marketed a movie like 'Grinch' or 'Nutty Professor.' There's no
Coca-Cola or Happy Meals tie-ins, no easy merchandising hooks to help
the film. This is a movie where you go for the emotion."</TE>
<TE>   As recently as early December, the outlook for "A Beautiful Mind"
wasn't so promising. Early press screenings got mixed reactions, an
indicator that reviews wouldn't be uniformly good. Most worrisome of
all, the film was inspired by (and took its title from) Sylvia
Nasar's National Book Critics Circle Award-winning 1998 biography of
Nash, putting it squarely in the troublesome biopic genre.</TE>
<TE>   Biopics have not only done poorly at the box office, but they also
have frequently been undermined by divisive media debates over the
issue of accuracy and authenticity. Universal knew all too well how
easily these public squabbles could capsize a film. The studio's top
1999 Oscar candidate, "The Hurricane," had been irrevocably damaged
by a lengthy media-fueled brawl over its portrayal of Rubin
"Hurricane" Carter as a man wrongly imprisoned for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Universal had been careful to position "Beautiful Mind" as a movie
"inspired by" events in the life of Nash. Last spring, the studio
invited the New York Times to visit the film set in Princeton, N.J.
The subsequent story gave filmmakers a chance to distance the movie
from Nash's life story. "It is certainly not factual and doesn't
pretend to be," screenwriter Akiva Goldsman explained in the story.
"Most of the things that happen in the movie didn't happen in John's
life."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, by Christmas week, controversy was brewing. New York
Times critic A.O. Scott criticized the film as an "almost entirely
counterfeit story," detailing the messy aspects of Nash's life that
had been left out of the film. These included Nash's having fathered
a child with a previous lover, his apparent sexual bonds with men and
his divorce and years of separation from Alicia Nash, who is
portrayed as the steadfast love of his life in the film. (The couple
remarried last June.)</TE>
<TE>   The day after Christmas, USA Today published an article headlined:
"It's Beautiful but Not Factual." The piece quoted Crowe as saying,
"The most interesting parts of [Nash's] life are not going to be part
of our movie" and said mental health experts were worried that the
film's "fanciful depiction of Nash's mental illness could have severe
social consequences." Other pieces recounting the film's omissions
appeared first in the Drudge Report and later in Variety and the Web
site of prominent essayist Andrew Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that "The Hurricane" controversy spiraled out of control
because its filmmakers waited too long to respond to media jabs,
Universal's marketing staff discussed potential problem areas with
the "Beautiful Mind" filmmakers before the film went into production.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure we knew ahead of time what would be an
issue and how we would respond," says Universal publicity chief Terry
Curtin. Curtin had Nash biographer Nasar ready to support the film in
various press articles, including one in the Los Angeles Times. When
Variety called, Curtin supplied statements defending the picture from
Alicia Nash's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   When Curtin heard Miramax was trying to get reporters to follow up
on the Drudge Report story, she phoned a Miramax publicist, who said
the report was untrue. A Miramax spokeswoman said, "We were delighted
that Universal was diligent with the facts instead of being swayed by
innuendo."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster the film's credibility, Universal also held early
screenings for mental heath experts, including Constance Lieber,
president of the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression, who wrote an op-ed piece in USA Today supporting the
film. In recent weeks, Howard and Goldsman have been doing interviews
and speaking after screenings, articulating the creative choices they
made.</TE>
<TE>   When asked at a Directors Guild screening why the film didn't
explore Nash's implied homosexuality, Howard explained: "It wasn't
central to his life. I asked Sylvia Nasar, 'Did you ever talk to one
of his lovers? Did you ever read one of the letters he wrote?' And
she said no, that [her reporting] was all based on what other people
thought. And the more I learned, the more I thought it would be
irresponsible to pursue something that may not have been true at
all."</TE>
<TE>   The studio had Nasar call me to defend the film as well. She
acknowledges that her material is largely from secondary sources--the
73-year-old Nash never agreed to a formal interview--but she argues
that detractors have "jumped to conclusions I didn't make. I wanted
the biography to be as comprehensive as possible, so these
emotionally intense relationships seemed relevant. But I never
conclude whether he was homosexual or bisexual."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers' choices were complicated by the fact that Nash
adamantly denies being gay. If they had portrayed him as having
homosexual liaisons, their own subject might have taken issue with
the film's veracity.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the authenticity debate hasn't caught fire. One reason,
besides Universal's aggressive defensive measures: Moviegoers are
genuinely moved by the film's version of Nash's life story.
Universal's exit polls have been sky-high, with 95% of filmgoers
giving the movie either an "excellent" or "very good" rating.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason is pretty obvious: The issues in Nash's life are
less politically fraught than those in Carter's. The questions about
"Hurricane's" veracity cut deep: Was the movie distorting the
circumstances involving a man who might have been a murderer? As a
man struggling to regain his sanity, Nash is a far more vulnerable
and inherently more sympathetic figure. Moviegoers prefer to believe
the romantic version of his life.</TE>
<TE>   David McCullough's recent best-selling biography "John Adams" has
detractors who say the historian presents an all too glossy portrait
of our second president. Those charges didn't stick either. I don't
hear anyone complaining that "Black Hawk Down" has recast the
military's 1993 debacle in Somalia as a triumph of soldierly
fortitude.</TE>
<TE>   After all this country has been through in the last few months,
we've got a serious craving for heroes. And if anyone deserves to see
his life neatly gift-wrapped with a gauzy happy ending, you'd have to
put John Forbes Nash near the top of the list.</TE>

<HD>'That '80s Show' Banking on Nostalgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1980s were the decade of Devo, Duran Duran, "Dynasty," "Dallas,"
Don Johnson, spiky pink hair, pastels and Sylvester Stallone playing
a singing cowboy in "Rhinestone." It was the decade of Reaganomics
and Oliver Stone's 1987 film "Wall Street," when a manipulative
financier, played by Michael Douglas, stated: "Greed is good."</LD>
<LD>   Still, for anyone who lived through them, who would have ever
thought that the '80s would become the good old days?</LD>
<LD>   That's the premise behind "That '80s Show," a new sitcom
premiering Wednesday. Fox and the creative team behind the network's
hit comedy series "That '70s Show" are banking on the notion that
audiences are ready for nostalgic laughs about Pat Benatar, record
albums and "Miami Vice."</LD>
<TE>   Originally, Fox was talking to "That '70s Show" producers Bonnie
and Terry Turner, Mark Brazill and Linda Wallem about doing a spinoff
of the hit comedy before the idea morphed into taking on another
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "They wound up talking about the '80s and how they felt about it,"
said Gail Berman, president of entertainment for Fox. "There were
some characters they felt they could begin to relate to.... So I
think based on those initial conversations it wasn't like 'Oh hey,
let's just take the name [of the comedy] and franchise it.' It really
began to develop out of character. Then, of course, the use of the
name is something that will bring people into the show and allow it
to get sampled."</TE>
<TE>   Berman doesn't believe the new series will confuse fans of "That
'70s Show," especially because the two programs will play on
different nights. Fox has been heavily promoting the new show during
its NFL playoff coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "That '80s Show," which was created by executive producers Terry
Turner, Brazill and Wallem, follows the lives of a group of
twentysomethings in San Diego. Set in 1984, the show focuses on Corey
(Glenn Howerton) and his sister, Kate (Tinsley Grimes), who live with
their dad, RT (Geoff Pierson), who dresses like a reject from "Miami
Vice," and Corey's best friend Roger (Eddie Shin).</TE>
<TE>   While Roger has embraced the '80s, Corey refuses to get into the
groove. A struggling musician, he works in a record store run by the
sarcastic Margaret (Margaret Smith), a groupie in the 1960s who
revels in talking about her wild and crazy experiences. Chyler Leigh
plays the new girl working at the record store, Tuesday, a cynical
young woman who sports a Mohawk and a razor-sharp attitude. Brittany
Daniel also stars as Corey's ex-girlfriend, Sophia.</TE>
<TE>   As with "That '70s Show," the new sitcom is filled with music and
cultural references from the era. A scene in the premiere episode,
for example, finds Corey, Katie and Roger playing a game in which
they drink shots each time a character gets slapped on "Dynasty."</TE>
<TE>   Berman hopes that the series will appeal to people who remember
the '80s--"that would be me"--as well as teens who are interested in
"a good, fun comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Wallem and Brazill say they put a lot of themselves in Corey's
character. "Mark and myself were in our 20s in the '80s," said
Wallem. "We wanted to be artists.... Mark was a stand-up [comic] and
I was an actress. We were trying to make it in New York. I couldn't
believe how quickly people were joining country clubs and [driving] a
BMW."</TE>
<TE>   Fox also emulated its formula with the earlier series by looking
for fresh faces to cast other than Pierson, who previously starred in
the WB's "Unhappily Ever After."</TE>
<TE>   Although Howerton was just a youngster during the '80s, he
remembers the decade as being "gloriously hideous. They were so gaudy
and tacky and wonderful.... Every country has its culture, and we
have pop culture. And in the '80s, it was out of control."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "That '80s Show" premieres Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Fox.</TE>

<HD>Images of Nature's Landscape Reflect Complex Worlds Within</HD>
<DH>Painter Sharon Ellis uses the language of Symbolism to
create dazzling, many-layered visual essays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES ART CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharon Ellis makes paintings that function as an intense polemic in
favor of empirical, intuitive experience as expressed through a work
of art. In the 10-year survey of Ellis' work that opened Sunday at
the Long Beach Museum of Art, her ecstatic, highly refined,
chromatically brilliant visual essays on time, the seasons and the
visual power of decorative pattern are on view. Obliqueness trumps
didactic instruction, language is subsumed within inchoate modes of
feeling.</LD>
<LD>   If this sounds a lot like Symbolist painting, it's worth
remembering that an unruly Symbolist impulse has typically arisen in
periods like our own, when art is dominated by the limiting, always
conservative doctrines of academic formula. It happened in Europe
late in the 19th century, when Impressionist painting had become rote
and established. It characterized early Modernist art in New York,
with painters as different from one another as Arthur Dove, Marsden
Hartley and Georgia O'Keeffe.</LD>
<TE>   And in ways that have yet to be fully explored, most (if not all)
progressive American artists working in otherwise socially
conventional milieus around the country throughout the 20th century
embraced Symbolist strategies. Ellis is an heir to the
transcendentalist abstract painters of the Southwest, like Raymond
Jonson; to the mystical musings of Mark Tobey and Morris Graves in
the Pacific Northwest; and to such diverse painters as Gordon
Onslow-Ford, Lee Mullican and--especially--Agnes Pelton in
California. She brings a distinctly contemporary sensibility to the
genre.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach show features 28 works, chronologically installed
by curator Martin Betz. The earliest group, which dates from 1991 to
1994, shows the development of her now-distinctive brand of what
could be called Neo-Symbolist painting.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Moons" (1991) is a jet-black canvas, 3 feet square, spotted
with yellow-orange disks of various diameters. Each disk is
surrounded by an electric-blue halo. The canvas squares a circle made
from a tangled web of reddish-brown lines, punctuated at points by
yellow starbursts within blue disks. Closer inspection reveals that
the starbursts are flowers--morning glories in full bloom--while the
tangled web is a coiling vine. Looking at the painting is like
looking at the night sky through flowers that only blossom in intense
daylight.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis' paintings tend to unfold slowly, their paradoxes revealed
in many layers. The intense palette of "Many Moons" yields a visual
snap and crackle, while the starkly patterned composition removes the
imagery from the realm of natural observation.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the view into the cosmos through a garden flips the other
way, becoming almost microscopic in orientation. It's as if you're
peering at a mass of nerve tissue or into the nucleus of a cell. In
"Sunken Garden" (1993), an underwater shower of tiny bubbles doubles
as a cascade of individual cells or ova, brimming with the
possibility of new life.</TE>
<TE>   This suggestive fusion of outward nature, patterned abstraction
and the inner human body gets elaborated--and increasingly
sophisticated--as Ellis' work proceeds. Trails of puffy clouds can
seem intestinal. Silhouetted branches become ganglia. A view through
the underbrush is transformed into the envelope of a womb.</TE>
<TE>   A suggestion of full, looming figures even emerges in the
color-infused spaces between articulated forms in later paintings,
such as "Midday" (1998) and "The Four Seasons" (1999). The show's
second body of work introduces temporal issues into the mix, with
series of cyclical paintings based on times of the day and year.
Finally, her most recent paintings evolve from nature
poetry--Swinburne, Emily Bronte, Hart Crane--another form of worldly
experience internalized.</TE>
<TE>   One drawback of the show is the crowded installation. The
exhibition demonstrates the ways Ellis has played with materials and
formats to achieve her complex ends. But the intensity of these
pictures demands concentration, which is best served by seeing them
in isolation. Space in the Long Beach Museum galleries is tight.</TE>
<TE>   Her paintings tend to be modest in size. The largest, at 4 by 5
feet, is the Wordsworth-inspired "A Vision of Spring in Winter"
(2000), commissioned for an exhibition at the Getty Museum that year;
but it's a bit of an anomaly. Most of the pictures are 40 inches on a
side or smaller.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest are square in format, which creates focused visual
stability. With the 1994 series "The Four Seasons," the format shifts
to horizontal, enhancing the expanse of landscape. Verticality enters
the picture in 1996, as the orientation echoes that of a viewer
standing before the painting, while the imagery within begins to
emphasize the celestial. Subtly, you're made to feel as if you're
raising your eyes skyward, engaging in a secular communion with the
mysterious, ingenious entity that is a work of art.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis achieves her dazzling chromatic effects through the use of
alkyd glazes. Alkyd is a synthetic resin that dries quickly, so that
color can be applied in thin layers. Transparent and translucent, it
allows light to pass through and reflect off the canvas.</TE>
<TE>   The bilateral symmetry of most compositions evokes that of a human
or animal body. Often Ellis employs an overlay of silhouetted trees,
vines or other plant material, which can seem like a map of the
body's central nervous system, or perhaps a high-tech brain scan. The
silhouettes, usually painted black, create flat, lacy patterns that
intensify through contrast the ambiguous space created by the
light-reflective color glazes. The vivid effect is positively
psychedelic.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there's barely a square inch in any of these paintings
that hasn't been labored over in some way. Sometimes it's by
depicting an object, elsewhere through a tonal slide from dark to
light, at other places in a surge or deflation of pictorial rhythm.
Everything is dependent on multiple relationships of form, space and
hue. They virtually embody Baudelaire's commitment to an art of
"intimacy, spirituality, color [and] aspiration toward the infinite,"
remade in a contemporary idiom.</TE>
<TE>   And like a Baudelaire poem, these paintings speak of the
sophisticated pleasures of urbanity, of nature created as cultural
reflection. Ellis might be dreaming about the natural world in this
gorgeous work, but it's a reverie that unfolds within a delirious
context that's inescapably suburban. Who else would celebrate in
paint the sheer loopy magnificence of a "Cathedral of Dandelions"?</TE>

<HD>Warabi-za Strays From Its Folk Roots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Based in northeast Japan, the 12-member Warabi-za ensemble displayed
impressive versatility and a hearty performance style at the Japan
America Theatre on Sunday. Making music on samisen, flute and
especially drums, the company also danced everything from adaptations
of genuine folk material to dubious choreographic depictions of
regional Japanese populations.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a 50-year history of creating works based on traditional
music and dance," read the introduction in the program booklet, and
half a century ago, virtually every other pioneering folk company
also invented what it needed and couldn't find.</LD>
<LD>   Today, however, newly created ersatz folklore is highly
questionable. Indeed repertory such as "Bamba Mai," a comic
showpiece, danced in sneakers to contemporary music and supposedly
"depicting the good humor and vitality of older women," tarnishes the
credibility of a company that cultivates a folkloric identity.</LD>
<TE>   So-called work dances in which a company adds rhythmic gestural
accompaniment to traditional folk songs also takes Warabi-za away
from folklore into the realm of show-dancing--but at least this kind
of piece isn't as overly cute as the comic repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Better still: the powerful taiko onslaughts, in which drums of
several different sizes build a sonic bridge over the sea
("Hachijo-daiko") or accompany harvest festivals ("Oyama Bayashi" and
"Minori-no Uchibayashi").</TE>
<TE>   Dancers who drummed (or drummers who danced) helped make "Shishi
Odori" the most spectacular piece on Sunday's program. Wearing
crimson deer masks with realistic antlers and thatches of hair, the
four performers marched down the aisles onto the stage, each of them
manipulating a pair of thin, flexible poles strapped to their backs
that projected some 5 feet above their heads.</TE>
<TE>   As they drummed in changing line- and circle-formations, they
would frequently bend so that the poles struck or brushed the floor.</TE>
<TE>   At the opposite extreme was the intimate, expressive women's trio
"Sofuren," in which the simplest walking steps and gestures conveyed
hopeless grief and loss. But is this truly folk material or the best
of the company's inventions?</TE>
<TE>   Among the uncredited soloists, Shinichi Hirano had the ability to
make stillness as eloquent as movement in both "Goshin-no mai," which
incorporated sudden karate lunges, and "Okina Mai," a masked
character dance about old age.</TE>
<TE>   Yuko Maruyama brought refinement to the parasol dance "Tsugaru
Aiyabushi" and Chiyo Tsubaki exuded remarkable lightness in the
inevitable fan dance, presented as a feminine contrast to the
masculine taiko attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko Murata contributed an atmospheric, improvised samisen solo
and the artful lighting by Narumi Maruyama often created a perfect
match between the dancers' costumes and the color-washes on the
backdrop.</TE>

<HD>Jennifer Connelly, Learning to Follow Her Instincts</HD>
<DH>Movies*  The Golden Globe winner for "A Beautiful Mind'
says she's taking more care in choosing roles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever demons were chasing "The Catcher in the Rye's" Holden
Caulfield all over Manhattan, one feels certain that if he could only
have caught a warm, sympathetic gaze from Jennifer Connelly, they
would have all melted away quicker than a morning frost.</LD>
<LD>   Connelly, 31, whose dark, crystalline beauty has been compared
with the young Elizabeth Taylor's, has been garnering the best
reviews of her career--and a Golden Globe award for best supporting
actress--for her performance in Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   She brings depth and dimension to the notion of "long-suffering
wife" as Alicia Nash, devoted spouse of schizophrenic genius John
Nash, played by Russell Crowe. Coming off her revelatory, harrowing
performance as a drug addict in 2000's "Requiem for a Dream,"
Connelly's work in "Mind" has propelled her to the front rank of
Hollywood's most promising actresses.</LD>
<TE>   She began modeling at age 10 and acted in her first film, Sergio
Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America" (1984), as a teenager. While
building a resume of credits, including roles in "Labyrinth" (1986),
"The Hot Spot" (1990) and "The Rocketeer" (1991), Connelly attended
the prestigious St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, then Yale and
Stanford universities.</TE>
<TE>   She's still a few credits short of her degree. And it probably
will get tougher to clear away time for her to graduate from
Stanford. For one thing, she's been cast in the role of Betty Ross,
Bruce Banner's--yes, long-suffering--inamorata in Ang Lee's
adaptation of "The Hulk," now slated for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Connelly recently talked about "A Beautiful Mind," life as a
single mom to her 4-year-old son, Kai) and why she still loves New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Question: That scene in "A Beautiful Mind" when your character
breaks down and cries in the bathroom looked as if it was painful to
do in more ways than one. What was it like that day?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We went through a lot of conversations about it. It went
through different versions--where it was staged, what kind of fight
[between John and Alicia] would set it up--and it sort of came
together at the last minute. And it was important that it be
completely raw and unexpected. So in that way, it became difficult to
choreograph, because it had to be just a complete explosion. We did
maybe three takes of it.... My son came to the set that day with my
dad. He had no idea what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was he OK with it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah, eventually. I mean, he's only 4, and that kind of
outburst is unusual for him to see from me. It was hard to explain at
first, but he was fine with it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does he feel, in general, about your job?</TE>
<TE>   A: Somebody asked him the other day, "What does your mom do?" He
says, "She acts in movies." Very matter-of-fact. He's not confused or
in awe of it. And he's a very dramatic person himself, a theatrical,
exuberant personality.</TE>
<TE>   Q: An actor in the making, huh?</TE>
<TE>   A: Actually, he likes to direct.... I can see him as a director
more than an actor. We've already done plays together. Very short
plays. He dictates them to me. Sometimes he casts me, sometimes he
doesn't. And when I'm in the play, he'll sometimes say to me, "No,
mom, you didn't say that right."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been acting since childhood. Did the bug bite you when
you were Kai's age?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. You know, I was never a kid who had designs to be an actor.
I never got out of wanting to be a veterinarian. I was really fond of
Evel Knievel and animals. [Laughs] That was where my head was at. I
was just into climbing trees. So all this other stuff kind of
happened. And even after I started acting, I took it all for granted
after I'd been doing it for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was there ever a time when acting wasn't fun or didn't seem
like the right thing for you?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was harder for me when I was making choices that weren't
necessarily as compatible as they could be for me. Whenever I
followed choices that weren't in line with my instincts, those were
the hardest roles for me, when I was being pushed in a direction I
didn't agree with and I didn't know how to make it better. That to me
is torture. I like it when the work is like an
archeological-emotional dig. It may be uncomfortable, and it may be
surprising. I really love that opportunity to learn more about myself
and what I can do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You live in New York. Are you ever tempted to move to L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, it's winter now, which is always enough temptation. I
think I'm not quite as impervious to the cold as I was when I was
younger. But my family's still here. And it's still a fantastic city.
There's a kind of poetry here that you don't find in any other, and I
think it's a remarkable place to live and work and raise a child.</TE>

<HD>Basic Training for Life in 2002</HD>
<DH>The decision to revive 'Biloxi Blues' seems too calculated,
but the play itself holds up well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's a war going on, it's time for a military comedy.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by Pasadena Playhouse--in the wake of Sept. 11--to
ditch an expensive production of a new play in favor of Neil Simon's
"Biloxi Blues" may appear awfully safe. Especially when an American
flag unfurls during the curtain call, the choice looks overly
calculated.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, "Biloxi Blues" remains a military comedy, and this
production treats it well.</LD>
<TE>   The play challenges military values as much as it honors them. As
part of his basic training, at a camp near Biloxi, Miss., young G.I.
Eugene Jerome (Daniel Sauli) learns that he can't always play it
safe, observing from the sidelines. Sometimes he has to step forward
to preserve his individual identity, even as the Army seems intent on
squashing it.</TE>
<TE>   That the play was set in 1943, when World War II was raging, is
made crystal clear from the outset of Paul Lazarus' staging: a big
sign indicates the year.</TE>
<TE>   When Simon rewrote his script as a screenplay, he moved the year
to 1945, which corresponded more closely to his own experience. This
raised the irony level, for the characters arrived on the scene too
late to use the military training that was drilled into them.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Pasadena production keeps the events in 1943,
befitting the supposedly post-ironic period we've been in since Sept.
11, the war still remains at a distance. The play's rebellious streak
isn't totally subsumed by the need to fight the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   The exemplar of that rebellious streak is the bookish Arnold
Epstein (Evan Neuman), who refuses to capitulate to the whims of
tough Sgt. Toomey (Josh Clark). Neuman, making his professional stage
debut, is a model of spare, focused intensity.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison to some other interpretations of the role, Neuman
downplays the hints that lead Eugene to think Arnold might be gay.
But it's not necessary to make Arnold especially effeminate, for
Simon establishes the overall level of homophobia in the military in
1943 elsewhere in the plot. Of course, this remains an issue even
now--making "Biloxi Blues" surprisingly topical on this subject.</TE>
<TE>   Sauli has the sense of general affability that Eugene requires,
and--as narrator--the ability to raise his eyebrow or adjust his gaze
in the spotlight, so we know exactly what he's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, Simon gave Eugene--instead of Arnold--the final
confrontation with Sgt. Toomey, enabling the character to be seen in
action as well as in reaction. In the play, Eugene doesn't get that
chance, but Sauli's reactions are suggestive of their own inner
dramas. These dramas are more apparent under the spotlights of a
theater than they would have been on the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   The other actors, including Clark's cantankerous Toomey, go
through their somewhat predictable paces with assurance. Lazarus has
marshaled his troops into a smooth acting unit.</TE>
<TE>   The only part of the story that feels too prepackaged is the
subplot involving a local girl (Nicole Nieth), who serves too easily
as Eugene's first love. But this is a problem in the script, not in
Nieth's performance.</TE>
<TE>   It's the only obvious problem in the script, which is one of
Simon's best. He raised issues here that transcend the confines of
the genre in which he was working. In the writing of Eugene, he
seemed to tacitly criticize the glibness that sometimes surfaces in
his own work.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe someday, Simon will interpolate a few of his screenplay
adaptations into the stage play. In the meantime, the play remains
one of those rare crowd-pleasers that questions the importance of
pleasing the crowd.</TE>

<HD>Two Foreign Films Get L.A. Screenings</HD>
<DH>Entries from Italy, Uruguay vie for Oscar attention.</DH>

<LD>Two prizewinning foreign films, both submitted for Academy Award
consideration for best foreign-language film by their respective
countries, open in Los Angeles Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The Son's Room" (La Stanza del Figlio) is the latest film from
acclaimed Italian director Nanni Moretti. In the drama, which won the
Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Moretti plays a
psychoanalyst father in a family torn apart by the accidental death
of a son. Woven with themes of grief and healing, the film is the
darkest yet from Moretti, who is known more for overtly political,
humorous works.</LD>
<LD>   Moretti, who is in town for the opening, has called the film,
which will play exclusively at the Fine Arts, 8556 Wilshire Blvd.,
"one of my most universal films."</LD>
<TE>   "Tricky Life" (En la Puda Vida), the first feature film by Beatriz
Flores Silva of Uruguay, is also that country's first film to be
submitted for Academy Award consideration. The film, which will play
exclusively at the Music Hall, 9036 Wilshire Blvd., has won prizes in
Cuba, Spain and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a nonfiction book, "The Serpent's Egg" by Maria Urruzola,
the film depicts the dreams and troubles of Uruguayan women who
become prostitutes in the Milan-based white slavery market. Mariana
Santangelo, a New York-based Argentine actress, stars as a mother of
two who becomes a national heroine in her struggle to free herself
from the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really incredible for our cinema to have a film [considered
for an Oscar]," said Flores Silva, who studied cinema in Belgium and
is in Southern California to attend showings. "We come from a country
without cinema."</TE>
<TE>   When she returned to Uruguay in 1992, no films had been made for
13 years. Now president of the Assn. of Cinema and Video Producers of
Uruguay and founder of the School of Cinematography of Uruguay, she
said she hopes the film will not only bring attention to the plight
of the prostitutes but also prove that Uruguay can produce movies for
national and international audiences.</TE>

<LD>Don't be intimidated by the notion of a five-part PBS series on the
brain. A science class this isn't. Executive producer David Grubin
understands the strengths and weaknesses of television and has
constructed "The Secret Life of the Brain" in a format and style that
make it readily accessible to anyone interested in knowing more about
this most complex of human organs.</LD>
<LD>   "I've always felt confident that television can communicate
complex ideas as long as they are rooted in the emotional contours of
our lives," Grubin writes in the foreword to the series' companion
book of the same title, by Richard Restak.</LD>
<LD>   Far from being an academic discourse on how the brain develops and
functions, "The Secret Life of the Brain" explores its topic by
breaking the episodes into five stages of life and showing us people
in each of them with brain-related (and heartstring-tugging) problems
that have new chances for being cured thanks to incredible advances
in scientific understanding.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's premiere (9 p.m., KCET), for example, focuses on babies
and uses the case of an infant with a cataract to help explain the
concept of "brain wiring" that takes place in the early months of
life.</TE>
<TE>   Installments in succeeding weeks introduce, among others, a child
with dyslexia, a teenager on drugs, an adult struggling with
depression and a senior citizen with Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on wringing emotion from these stories cuts into time
that could have been spent imparting even more information from
scientists about the brain, but on balance it was probably a wise
choice since it lets us see the practical application of their work.
What they are learning about the brain is not simply fodder for text
books; it is knowledge that impacts all of us.</TE>

<HD>The Ex-Lawyers Club</HD>
<DH>Many attorneys have left the legal profession to write or
produce TV shows, making the case that their training uniquely
prepares them for show biz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG TOMASHOFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never let it be said that lawyers haven't contributed something
entertaining to popular culture. After all, they've inspired a whole
genre of jokes. Who could forget a classic like "How can you tell
when a lawyer is lying?" (His lips are moving.) Or the ever popular
"Why won't sharks attack lawyers?" (Professional courtesy.)</LD>
<LD>   For years, lawyers have been a popular target for film and
television writers, who routinely portrayed attorneys as selfish,
briefcase-toting boors. These days, however, a growing number of
attorneys have decided to switch sides rather than fight the
stereotype. More and more, they are becoming television writers and
show runners.</LD>
<LD>   Although there are no reliable statistics, at least two dozen
former lawyers have abandoned legal careers and successfully made the
transition to cranking out episodes of TV shows. The list is topped
by David E. Kelley, the former Boston attorney who, with shows like
"The Practice," "Ally McBeal" and "Boston Public," is perhaps the
highest-profile example of a lawyer making the leap into TV writing
success.</LD>
<TE>   Still, several others have made a similar move. Carol Mendelsohn
runs CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." Rich Appel is the former
executive producer of "King of the Hill" and is developing for NBC
his own pilot based on his experiences as a federal prosecutor. Barry
Schindel is in charge of NBC's "Law &amp; Order." Jeff Rake was
co-creator of last season's Fox series "The Street." Stephen Engel,
producer of the recently departed NBC sitcom "Inside Schwartz," is
also a former attorney. "Family Law," "First Monday" and "The
Guardian" are just a few of the other series that employ lawyers as
writers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that this is a trend," says Bob Breech, senior
vice president for Kelley's production company. "I think it probably
began with the glamorization of lawyers on 'L.A. Law,' which swelled
the ranks of students in law school. Meanwhile, lawyers saw it and
realized, 'I can do that too.'"</TE>
<TE>   There have been plenty of shows about other professions, such as
doctors, bankers, even journalists. However, it seems that the unique
nature of their jobs makes attorneys not only perfect for a show but
also gives them an advantage when it comes to writing a series.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawyers have a different way of thinking," says Schindel, who
worked as a public defender in the Bronx and as a civil litigator for
a private firm before selling a spec script and leaving the practice
of law in 1996. "With lawyers, you're getting very aggressive and
competitive people, traits you need to survive in television writing.
Fields like medicine and banking aren't based on adversarial
positions. But with the law, the competitive fire is taught to you
from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   According to Mendelsohn, who in the early 1980s left a burgeoning
law career in Washington, D.C., to make it as a writer in Hollywood,
having experience as an attorney also provides a sense of discipline
that can be lacking in television. "Working as a lawyer gave me a
serious work ethic," she says. "I was spending time writing Supreme
Court briefs, and you could lose your job if you literally didn't dot
every I and cross every T.</TE>
<TE>   "You're taught to look at and solve problems quickly. I remember
once being told that notes you get back from producers on how to
improve your script can be brutal, and I said, 'Nothing can be harder
than the law, where you get abused a lot more.' I've never had a TV
experience that comes close to how difficult it was when I was a
lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Jonathan Shapiro, who spent eight years as a federal
prosecutor before landing a job as story editor on "The Practice," "I
learned how to write my own briefs, which teaches you how to write a
particular amount of pages in an assertive, persuasive, entertaining
way on a deadline. Being a trial lawyer, as I was, you essentially go
into combat every day and, after having adversaries punch holes in
your work, you toughen up quick. Which is important if you're going
to make it in television."</TE>
<TE>   Because the very nature of their job requires lawyers to be
waist-deep in the personal dramas of their clients, they often
acquire a keen understanding of what makes for a good, compelling
story. "The law is a marvelous reservoir of conflict," says Breech.
"The full range of human character traits are on display for you."
And not just the dramatic traits, either.</TE>
<TE>   "Just read some trial transcripts," says Appel, who went from
working for the U.S. attorney's office in New York to writing on "The
Simpsons." "They're some of the funniest things you'll ever see.
That's why, by and large, lawyers are some of the smartest, funniest
people I've ever known."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, those transcripts are filled with witness testimony,
much of which is as carefully scripted as an episode of "Law &amp;
Order." "Cross-examining witnesses helps immensely with learning how
to write dialogue," says Schindel. "You have to know where you're
going with your witnesses, so you spend a lot of time talking in your
head the night before: 'If I say X, they will say Y, and where do we
go from there?'"</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers-turned-TV scribes have plenty of common characteristics
that help them make their career transition. However, not all of them
have taken the same path to break into the entertainment business.
Some grew up loving the law and relished getting their days in court.
Even now, a part of them misses the experience of trying real cases.</TE>
<TE>   "On any given day, I could still go to the county courthouse,
watch a case being tried and be totally fascinated," says Shapiro,
who continues to work as a judge in small claims court whenever his
schedule allows.</TE>
<TE>   For every writer who enjoyed being a lawyer, however, there seems
to be twice as many who never intended to make it a career. To them,
law school was a way of stalling decisions about what to do with
their lives, and being a lawyer was essentially the day job to keep
money coming in while they wrote spec scripts.</TE>
<TE>   "Every step of the way, I knew I'd be a writer," says Alfonso
Moreno, a Stanford Law School graduate who worked for three years in
civil litigation before enrolling in UCLA film school. "The reason
you find so many lawyers turning to TV writing is because so many of
them realize how dry the law can be. They are smart enough to
practice, but they just don't ultimately want to be lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Appel: "I wanted to be a comedy writer, but that didn't seem
to be a viable career when I was younger. With law school, I had a
sense that that was doable. It's funny now, because people will ask
me if they should go to law school. I ask them, 'Do you want to be a
lawyer?' You'd be surprised how many people don't have an answer for
that question."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever their feelings about a legal career, these former
attorneys have had in effect in their new profession in terms of
altering the way lawyers are portrayed on the small screen.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, lawyer shows were like "Perry Mason," all about
mysterious murders and surprising last-act courtroom confessions.
When series like "L.A. Law" began to appear, things changed. "Legal
shows are grittier now, more truthful than they ever used to be,"
says Moreno, currently working on CBS' "The Guardian." "I think that
comes from having so many people who have done it write about it."</TE>
<TE>   For lawyers eager to escape their profession, writing for
television offers a creative alternative, as well as one of the few
jobs with a potential income that can top that of a good law career.
"All my lawyer friends are always pitching me ideas," says Schindel.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Michael Chernuchin, who worked for six years as a Manhattan
attorney before working for "Law &amp; Order" and now the Fox drama "24":
"I hear from lawyers nonstop. I think a lot of lawyers are people who
ended up going to law school as a last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Writing can also provide a sense of satisfaction a real-life
courtroom might not.</TE>
<TE>   "I once wrote a three-part death penalty episode for a show, and I
remember thinking, 'Doing this, I might actually make a difference on
this issue for a lot of people,'" says Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky because we can create cases where the judges say
exactly what we want them to say, and the jurors can come back with
the right verdict," Shapiro says. "This is something that definitely
doesn't happen when you're practicing law."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson can understand why
many of her students and colleagues would be interested in moving
over to what she jokingly calls "the dark side."</TE>
<TE>   "The judges never yell at you," she says, insisting that there are
still plenty of lawyers like her who love practicing law too much to
take up television writing. "Television writing is a way for lawyers
to be more in the action because, frankly, a lot of what we do as
lawyers isn't very exciting. In television, they can laugh a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky concurs. "There's always been
a certain number of lawyers and law students working on screenplays,"
he says. "But this is Los Angeles. You have a certain number of
people in every profession writing screenplays."</TE>

<HD>Terry Ehrich, 60; Editor, Publisher Guided the Growth of
Hemmings Motor News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Ehrich, the longtime editor and publisher of Hemmings Motor
News, a leading publication for car enthusiasts, has died. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Ehrich, diagnosed with lung cancer last year, died Thursday at the
Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. The cause of death was a heart
attack, which he had suffered earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Hemmings Motor News bills itself at the largest antique, classic,
vintage and special-interest marketplace in the world. A no-frills
shopper with all the charm and style of a telephone directory, the
Motor News publishes about 700 pages an issue. There is little in the
way of editorial content other than calendars of upcoming events and
legislative alerts, and a monthly list of stolen collector cars.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Motor News is considered a must read by many car
enthusiasts and numbers 260,000 subscribers. A 1999 article on
Hemmings in the publication Nation's Business estimated that the firm
grosses more than $20 million annually from the Motor News and its
sister publications.</TE>
<TE>   The success of Hemmings today is a far cry from its modest
beginnings. The first issue of the Motor News, published in 1954,
consisted of four pages. Just 500 copies were sold at 50 cents
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Born Manfred Ehrich in New York City, Ehrich moved to Vermont with
his family when he was a toddler. After graduating from Harvard in
1964, Ehrich worked in the advertising department at the New York
Review of Books for several years</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Bayard Ewing, then Ehrich's father-in-law,
bought the Hemmings Motor News from Ernest R. Hemmings, an antique
auto parts dealer who had started the publication in Quincy, Ill., in
1954. Ewing put his son-in-law in charge of the publication and moved
it to Vermont. Under Ehrich's leadership, the Motor News showed
steady growth over the years while maintaining Hemmings' original
idea, which was to help collectors and restorers find each other.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Motor News, published 12 times a year, the
company also publishes the Hemmings Collector-Car Almanac, which
features more than 2,900 parts suppliers, appraisers and restorers.
Sister publications include Special Interest Autos, which aims at a
broader audience by providing editorial coverage including articles
on road tests of rare cars. In 2000, the firm launched Hemmings Rods
&amp; Performance, catering to those interested in street rods, custom
cars and muscle cars.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the publication firm was put up for sale when it
became apparent that Ehrich's health would no longer allow him to
continue as editor and publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Active in community affairs in Bennington, Vt., where Hemmings is
located, Ehrich founded the First Day Foundation, which encouraged
employers to grant a day off on the first day of school to encourage
workers to accompany their children to class.</TE>
<TE>   Twice married and divorced, Ehrich is survived by Jackie Christie,
his companion; two daughters; his father; sister; and two brothers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John R. Cohan, 70, an estate planning attorney who wrote a textbook
showing other lawyers how to draft living trusts, died Dec. 29 in Las
Vegas of complications following a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Cohan, who practiced with the Los Angeles-based firm Irell &amp;
Manella from 1955 until his retirement in 1994, wrote several books
and articles on personal financial planning and taxation. Best known
among his colleagues was "Drafting California Irrevocable Trusts and
California Revocable Living Trusts."</LD>
<LD>   A lecturer at USC School of Law and the University of Miami School
of Law, Cohan also chaired USC's annual Tax Institute from 1984 to
1995. In his law practice, Cohan represented several celebrities,
including Kirk Douglas and Diana Ross.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Arnhem, the Netherlands, he escaped with his family to
England after Nazis overtook his country, and later came to the
United States. He was educated at the University of Arizona and
Stanford Law School. In Los Angeles, he served on the city's Advisory
Panel on Ethical Standards for Charities and was active in Big
Brothers/Big Sisters of America and Jewish Big Brothers.</TE>

<LD>Joseph Laitin, 87, a onetime newspaperman who served under five
presidents as a public affairs officer, died Saturday of congestive
heart failure at his home in Bethesda, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Brooklyn, Laitin left high school before graduation to
pursue a career in newspapering. His first job was with the Brooklyn
Eagle. From there, he found work with what was then United Press and
Reuters. With Reuters, he covered the Japanese surrender in 1945 and
the Nuremberg trials of Nazi officials.</LD>
<LD>   Laitin was working as a freelance writer in Hollywood when asked
to join the Kennedy administration in 1963. He stayed on after the
president's assassination, serving as assistant White House press
secretary under Lyndon B. Johnson before transferring to the Bureau
of the Budget.</LD>
<TE>   Laitin worked in a variety of press officer capacities through the
Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations. He left government service in
1981, after Ronald Reagan took office. In the mid-1980s, Laitin
accepted a two-year appointment as ombudsman for the Washington Post.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Responds to Banking Outcry</HD>
<DH>Economy: Government now plans to offer as many pesos for
the dollar as possible to even out devaluation burden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina's new government rushed Monday to soothe public rage over
its decision to drastically cut the dollar value of bank deposits,
but a beleaguered financial system breathed a sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   The government, which this month ended a decade-old peg of one
Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar, plans to turn dollar deposits to
pesos to spread more evenly costs of a devaluation that has put banks
near collapse and moved the country to the verge of revolt.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they might ease the pain for angry depositors--many
with life savings under threat after a recession in its fourth
year--by offering Argentines as many pesos for the buck as possible.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of Argentines have bank savings in dollars, a currency
safe-haven in Latin America, but the government froze these
deposits--some $45 billion--to stop a run on banks, a restriction
that sparked huge street protests and contributed to the downfall of
two governments.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to switch these dollars to pesos at parity, the
official 1.40 peso rate, or another inflation-indexed rate could
determine the survival of both a financial system dominated by
foreign banks and even Peronist President Eduardo Duhalde, the fifth
leader in little more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines fear they could lose up to half the dollar value of
their deposits, depending on how the conversion is done.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my life savings were just taken away from me," said Jose,
a 38-year-old psychologist. "I was going to move away to Italy but
now I can't because my money is trapped here. Argentina is like a
prison."</TE>
<TE>   The deposit move is a sudden about-face for the government, which
this month angered foreign investors by switching most dollar debts
owed to banks into devalued pesos, costing the banks billions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's ratings service said last week that banks were insolvent.
Some large foreign-owned banks had hinted in recent weeks that they
might leave Argentina as the recent devaluation blew a huge hole in
their balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   But the new policy, meaning the banks would have all their debts
as well as assets turned into pesos and therefore evening out the
financial burden of the devaluation, could save them billions of
dollars, depending on the rate.</TE>
<TE>   The deposit switch was a nightmare come true for many Argentines
and could spark numerous lawsuits. A few took to the streets banging
pots and pans in miniature versions of the protests that toppled two
presidents last month.</TE>
<TE>   After three weeks in power, Duhalde has broken his first and
biggest promise--to return intact the roughly 65% of deposits in
Argentina made in dollars--and has been unable to lift an unpopular
account freeze.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde told local media over the weekend that "the money is just
not there."</TE>

<HD>Tax Impasse Could Harm Retirees</HD>
<DH>Laws: State's delay in conforming with federal retirement
savings incentives is putting many in a financial bind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts in Sacramento that would allow Californians to take full
advantage of new federal retirement savings incentives may be too
late to help some of the state's taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   Retiree Beth O'Brien, for one, is facing a $3,000 tax bill on a
distribution from her public employee retirement account if lawmakers
don't change the state's Tax Code this spring. And the Laguna Woods
resident isn't happy about it.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't 'retroact' that," said the former management analyst
for the city of Los Angeles. "Many retirees who receive quarterly or
annual [retirement] distributions probably do not yet realize what
the state's failure to act is about to cost them."</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers are working feverishly to correct the problem, but they
acknowledge that they're getting a late start.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we needed to move quickly, but I don't think we [fully
appreciated] the urgency," said Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine),
who introduced one of three bills aimed at resolving the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of O'Brien and thousands of current and former public
employees, including firefighters, police officers and other state
and local employees, is part of the fallout from the Legislature's
failure to make the state's tax laws conform with the tax bill
Congress passed in May.</TE>
<TE>   That law, which cut federal income tax rates and mandated refund
checks for millions of Americans, also increased the amount workers
can contribute to tax-advantaged savings plans such as individual
retirement accounts and 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   It also improved public employee retirement plans such as 457 and
403(b) plans, which are used by 1.8 million California public
employees and schoolteachers, by making them more flexible.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a catch. The state must adjust its tax laws, or
residents who try to use some of the new tax-saving provisions will
owe additional state income tax on their retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   It was thought lawmakers had plenty of time to change the state's
tax laws. After all, the deadline for many 2002 retirement plan
contributions isn't until April 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But as O'Brien's predicament shows, the effect on many
Californians is more immediate.</TE>
<TE>   In two months, O'Brien will be getting her annual mandatory 457
retirement plan distribution check for $10,000. The 2001 federal tax
law allows her to roll the distribution into another retirement plan,
thereby avoiding an immediate income tax bill. But because state law
hasn't yet been changed to allow these rollovers, she's stuck.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the state passes conformity legislation within 60 days of
that distribution, O'Brien will owe more than $3,000 in state and
federal income taxes and forever lose the chance to put that money in
a tax-deferred retirement account, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lawrence, a 57-year-old computer coordinator for the city of
Santa Ana, has a different issue. He's about to retire and will need
to make an irrevocable decision about his pension. The decision he
wants to make--to buy state retirement credits for the years he spent
in the military with money he has saved in his 457 plan--is possible
under the new federal law, but not in California.</TE>
<TE>   Unless state tax laws are changed, Lawrence faces a tough choice.
He can pay for the retirement credits with after-tax money--a choice
that would cost him roughly 30% in additional taxes--or he can forgo
buying those credits. If he doesn't buy the retirement credits, it
will reduce Lawrence's monthly retirement checks by $350 for the rest
of his life. No amount of retroactivity will help, because state
pensions don't allow changes after retirement--even if the law
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who retire in California could face a similar problem if
they want to use their deferred compensation accounts, called 403(b)
plans, to buy pension credits as federal law allows them to do, said
Jim Mosman, chief executive of the California State Teachers'
Retirement System.</TE>
<TE>   "If you retire and the law is later changed, you are out in the
cold with respect to being able to purchase the [retirement]
benefits," Mosman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Postponing Retirement Seen as Possible Option</TE>
<TE>   The only option for people in this situation is to postpone
retirement, Mosman said. Officials at the California Public
Employees' Retirement System say there's one more option--workers can
"unretire."</TE>
<TE>   Going back to work for a few months after retirement allows them
to return to active service status in the public employees'
retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   Returning stops retirement payments and gives workers another
chance to make retirement elections when they retire again. But this
option applies only if the worker is rehired.</TE>
<TE>   But postponing retirement isn't always possible. Lawrence had sold
his house and made plans to move to the East Coast before he had an
inkling that California's tax law would trip him up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hanging by a thread," Lawrence said. "If legislators wait
around for another six months, I'm going to be out of luck."</TE>
<TE>   As Assemblyman Campbell points out, the severity of the problem
took California officials by surprise. Another state official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that lawmakers were
largely unaware of the effect of moving too slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought retroactivity would cover it," the official said.
"Clearly, there are all sorts of ramifications for different people
and we're trying to minimize any negative impact. But this is
complicated and people here are still trying to figure out the
implications."</TE>
<TE>   In a best-case scenario, passing a conformity law would take a
minimum of 60 days, Campbell predicted. In the worst case, it could
get caught in the budget debate and be tabled until June. The state
is facing a $12.4-billion shortfall, and tax conformity would cost
roughly $44 million in 2002 and more in subsequent years, according
to an analysis by the Franchise Tax Board.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All Workers in State Could Be Affected</TE>
<TE>   Public employees aren't the only ones touched by the tax law
impasse. Just about any worker in California--and in a dozen other
states in similar circumstances--who has a 401(k) or an IRA could be
affected. Some already are.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies won't allow employees to boost retirement plan
contributions above 2001 levels because California law hasn't been
adjusted to the higher federal levels.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual funds and investment companies are allowing California
residents to boost their contributions to self-directed retirement
plans--such as IRAs and Roth IRAs--to the new, higher levels allowed
under federal law. But some who already have made those
contributions--unaware that the increased contributions don't comply
with state law--worry about what will happen if California law isn't
changed or the changes aren't made retroactive.</TE>
<TE>   "People are left in limbo, " said Charlene Hyde, a Santa Monica
speech pathologist. "I already contributed $3,500 to a Roth IRA. Am I
a criminal for having contributed too much? I want to comply with the
law. But it is very difficult to know what to do."</TE>

<HD>Princess Cruises Spurns Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>P&amp;O Princess Cruises balked Monday at a sweetened takeover bid by
Carnival Corp., the world's biggest cruise ship operator, saying the
$5-billion offer was still too low and likely to run into regulatory
obstacles.</LD>
<LD>   Princess insisted it would stay on course with its own plan to
merge with rival Royal Caribbean Cruises.</LD>
<LD>   After Princess turned down its original bid, Miami-based Carnival
followed up Thursday with a revised cash-and-stock offer valued at
12% more. Carnival is eager to break up Princess' planned merger with
Royal Caribbean, which would create a $6-billion business that would
sink Carnival as market leader.</LD>
<TE>   "We made it clear when Carnival made its initial proposal that our
response was based on two simple criteria--value for our shareholders
and deliverability. The revised proposal still falls short on value
and adds nothing on deliverability," Princess Chief Executive Peter
Ratcliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   Princess said it has no intention of meeting with Carnival to
discuss the offer. It has called a shareholders' meeting Feb. 14 to
consider the proposed merger with Royal Caribbean, despite Carnival's
request that the meeting be canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Princess, based in London, ranks third in its share of the cruise
market. A tie-up with Miami-based Royal Caribbean would form a fleet
of 41 ships and 75,000 berths.</TE>
<TE>   Princess would own 50.7% of the new group--or $3 billion of its
total equity value--with Royal Caribbean taking the remaining 49.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Princess shares were down 99 cents at $23.17 on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday. Carnival, which also trades on the NYSE, fell 41
cents at $26.05 Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Their planned union triggered Carnival's initial bid, as all three
companies struggle to cut costs in the wake of slowing business after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Princess said Carnival failed to specify any strategic logic for
the buyout, and it complained that Carnival's offers were laden with
"particularly troubling" regulatory and financial preconditions.</TE>
<TE>   Princess also challenged Carnival's claim that a planned
acquisition would be no more likely to encounter opposition from
anti-competition watchdogs than would a merger of Princess and Royal
Caribbean.</TE>

<HD>Air Fares Hit 12-Year Low in December</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Air fares fell to their lowest level in 12 years last month as
carriers cut prices to lure travelers after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The average one-way fare fell 15% from December 2000 to $117.79,
the lowest since August 1989's $117.78 and the 10th monthly decline
in a row, the Air Transport Assn. said. The group represents major
U.S. carriers, including AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of people who flew in December purchased during the fire
sale that occurred in late September and early October," John
Heimlich, the group's director of economic and market research, said.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. carriers had combined losses of as much as $9 billion last
year, the association estimated, as companies cut travel budgets in
an economic recession and as demand declined after the attacks.
American, Northwest Airlines Corp., Continental Airlines Inc. and US
Airways Group Inc. last week reported a combined $2.17 billion in
fourth-quarter losses.</TE>
<TE>   "The airlines are doing everything they possibly can to get people
flying again, and this is just an outgrowth of that," said Sean Egan,
an analyst with Egan-Jones Ratings Co.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of a coach seat fell 15% to $108.07 in December
compared with the year-earlier month, while the combined average for
first-class and business-class tickets dropped 14% to $197.16, the
association said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think that we're stabilizing a bad situation,"
Heimlich said. The 15% drop in December airfares was the  smallest
percentage decline since August, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time carriers increased fares was February, when ticket
prices rose 0.3% to $149.20, the group said.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani's Consulting Firm Reflects Businesslike Trend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, reveling in public adulation
for leadership of the city after terrorist attacks Sept. 11, is
starting a consulting business, Giuliani Partners, along with key
aides from his two terms as mayor, including the former commissioners
of the police and fire departments.</LD>
<LD>   Consulting firms are a dime a dozen in the U.S. economy, however.
What unique capability does Giuliani Partners offer business clients?
"I think we know as much as anyone about security in the modern
world, how to protect people, how to react to a crisis," Giuliani
says, citing a strength demonstrated in the months since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   But the former mayor, a lawyer and former prosecutor of organized
and white-collar crime, stressed other capabilities in an interview
in Los Angeles the other day.</LD>
<TE>   The aim of Giuliani Partners, which hopes to bring in at least</TE>
<TE>   $20 million a year in revenue, is to show corporations, other
cities and large organizations "how we took a $40-billion city that
was seen as unmanageable and ran it like a business," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a bad idea. Cities began to be "run like businesses" in
the last decade, as a new breed of mayors, including Giuliani,
focused on business efficiencies rather than political patronage to
staff municipal operations and concentrated on attracting new
businesses to their towns.</TE>
<TE>   And the new decade even more than the last will demand that cities
be "run like businesses," so Giuliani could be on to a growth field.</TE>
<TE>   The $40-billion figure he cites for New York is a reference to the
budget and reach of that city's government, which owns 17 hospitals
and the nation's largest school system. By contrast, the city of Los
Angeles' annual budget is about $6 billion--$12 billion if the
harbors, airports and the Department of Water &amp; Power are included.
New York employs 250,000 compared with about 46,000 for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran the city by using constant statistical analysis of each
city agency to increase accountability," Giuliani says. "For example,
in the Police Department we measured crime statistics every day in 77
precincts of New York City, looking for areas where crime was going
up and then assigning resources to bring crime down," the former
mayor says.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani won public approval in his first term as mayor by
reducing crime in New York, using a technique called "broken windows"
by its developer, criminologist James Q. Wilson. Crime prevention
begins with zero tolerance for broken windows, goes the theory,
because a neighborhood that tolerates broken windows, graffiti and
other minor crimes soon is forced to tolerate drug dealing, robbery
and more serious crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Broken windows is the philosophy, the computer statistical
program is the management system that executes that philosophy,"
Giuliani says.</TE>
<TE>   His administration applied daily statistical reporting to 26 city
agencies, from welfare and hospitals to Off-Track Betting, the legal
horse-betting operation owned by New York city and state that was set
up decades ago to raise funds for education.</TE>
<TE>   When Giuliani took office in 1994, OTB was losing $7 million a
year-- "the only bookmaking operation in New York that lost money,"'
says Giuliani, who grew up in Brooklyn and in the city's Long Island
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "The illegal bookies run their operations like a business, but OTB
was being run as a political patronage activity," Giuliani says.</TE>
<TE>   So his administration closed some of the betting operation's 65
outlets, cut expenses and got the state to approve televised betting
so gamblers, using a special credit card, could play the horses from
home.</TE>
<TE>   "OTB is making a profit today and the city could sell it to
private industry for $350 million," Giuliani says.</TE>
<TE>   And indeed New York may have to sell OTB. The city is facing a
budget deficit of historic proportions because tax collections from
Wall Street firms are down since the stock market's slide in 2001 and
the devastation of the Financial District on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's successor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the founder of
Bloomberg Communications, is having to make budget cuts that Giuliani
did not make in his final year, including canceling Giuliani's
approvals for city funds to help build new baseball stadiums for the
Yankees and Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani himself was failing to run New York "like a business." He
acknowledges that the city faces long-term debt problems to "build
schools and rebuild bridges," but avoids discussing the city's
looming budget deficit, saying only that city finances are sound.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Giuliani is moving on to his consulting business and a
future in which he hopes for new political office. The 57-year-old
former mayor, a Republican who campaigned for President Bush in 2000
despite suffering through treatments at that time for prostate
cancer--he is now cancer free--intends to speak out on political
questions nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to remain very active," says Giuliani, who is mentioned
in political circles as a possible candidate for New York governor or
senator or even as a candidate on the Bush 2004 ticket if Vice
President Cheney retires.</TE>
<TE>   After a career dedicated mostly to public service, Giuliani is not
a wealthy man. So to make more money than a typical consulting
practice would earn, Giuliani Partners plans to make investments
"where we can take over or participate in companies and enhance the
value by our expertise and background."</TE>
<TE>   Given their expertise in urban affairs, that could mean companies
providing services to cities on a contract basis or companies
redeveloping America's inner cities--a growth field for the new
decade, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Giuliani has years of experience in white-collar crime.
A graduate of Manhattan College and New York University's law school,
Giuliani served as U.S. attorney in New York City in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "I prosecuted Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken and all the other
Wall Street scandals of that time," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And prevention of white-collar crime also could be a growth
industry for the new decade. Giuliani sees similarities between the
Wall Street scandals of the 1980s and Enron today.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us know the final results of Enron, but a
clear conclusion is that you can never allow your business to become
more complicated than you can keep control of," Giuliani says.</TE>

<HD>Prices Soar for Housing in Southland</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The sector's strength at lower end of market
helps establish new highs in median pricing for L.A., Orange
counties, flying in the face of nation's recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices streaked to record levels last month in Southern
California, underscoring that the region's robust housing market has
been largely shielded from the national recession.</LD>
<LD>   Boosted by larger gains of modest homes, median prices in Los
Angeles County jumped 13.7% to an all-time high of $233,000 last
month from a year earlier, according to a report released Monday by
DataQuick Information Systems Inc. In Orange County, median prices
climbed 14% to a new peak of $332,000 in December, the report showed.</LD>
<LD>   Several analysts, surprised by the late-year showing, said such
lofty gains as those in December are unlikely to be sustained
throughout the year. They cited a combination of factors, including
higher mortgage rates, less aggressive mortgage lending and slower
job growth. Another effect is relatively weak stocks, especially of
high-tech companies that have been a key source of down-payment funds
for luxury homes.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it will be a stronger economy and a solid housing market,
but it won't measure up to the strong conditions Southern California
has enjoyed up to now," said Mark Zandi, an analyst at Economy.com, a
West Chester, Pa., forecasting group. He added that he expects price
growth of between 5% to 7% next year in the region.</TE>
<TE>   James Doti, an economist who is president of Chapman University in
Orange, was far more cautious about the coming year. He told a large
audience of builders last week in Orange County to expect a
"significant drop in housing appreciation this year."</TE>
<TE>   He believes home values will rise by only 1% in Los Angeles County
and by 3% in Orange County because far fewer jobs will be produced
this year in those areas. Luxury home sales, which pull overall
median prices higher because of their larger rates of appreciation,
will be dented in particular, Doti said.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that housing prices will continue to
appreciate," Doti said. "But the bad news is, at a lower rate."</TE>
<TE>   But prices have moved up sharply, in large part because the supply
of housing in both counties remains near record-low levels, according
to the California Assn. of Realtors. At the current selling pace, a
3.7-month supply exists in Los Angeles, down from 4.2 months last
year. Orange County has a 2.5-month inventory, rising slightly from
2.1 months a year earlier. Moreover, the number of days that homes
spend on the market for sale in the region also is near its lowest
point at about 25.5 days in both counties, the realtors' group said.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of the tight market, some analysts expect only a
slight dip in housing prices this year. John Karevoll, the DataQuick
expert who compiled the monthly report, expects home prices to rise
7% to 9% if mortgage rates rise as he anticipates they will. "There's
no indication that there's going to be any turnarounds in the
trends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The month of December capped a robust year for Southern
California, as nearly every type of housing rose in both counties to
a record- or near-high.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers shopped for homes, drawn by mortgage rates that fell to
a 30-year low in early November and still remain at historically low
levels. Peter Gontang and his wife Lisa, for example, were among
those who viewed the latest phase of homes at Ladera Ranch, a
master-planned community in south Orange County. So far, about 2,000
homes, or one-quarter of the project, have sold since opening in late
1999, well ahead of projections.</TE>
<TE>   "The rates are low right now and housing prices are going up
consistently, even with the current economy," said Gontang, 32, who
is planning to start a family and seeks a larger home. "Who knows
whether we'll be able to afford in a year from now what we can
purchase today."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, prices in Los Angeles County rose to a record $224,000,
jumping 12.6% from a year earlier. The county recorded its highest
percentage annual gain since 1989, DataQuick said.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, annual prices also fared well by rising nearly
11.8% last year, finishing up the period at $303,000. It was the
first time that a county in Southern California ended the year above
the $300,000 barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Annual sales in Los Angeles County, boosted largely by new homes,
were 1.2% ahead of year-ago levels at 110,738. In Orange County,
sales dipped 7% to 46,369 as higher prices and low inventory levels
combined to drop overall figures, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lingering recession, the nation's real estate market
is in strong condition. The National Assn. of Realtors, a Washington
trade group, has projected U.S. sales of new and existing homes in
2001 to be at a record level. And the National Assn. of Homebuilders
reported in January that an index of builders with a positive view of
the market has risen to its highest level since November 2000 even
though sales of luxury and prestige homes have slumped in recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, which has a large number of high-end
homes, sales overall slid nearly 2% in Los Angeles, and by 6% in
Orange County. DataQuick reported a flurry of activity during the
last week in December as about 30% of the month's transactions were
closed, an amount comparable to previous years.</TE>

<HD>Group Promotes Its Health Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is perhaps the most influential bloc of health-care purchasers in
the nation, spending $52 billion annually on medical coverage for
nearly one in 10 Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Now, this 14-month-old consortium of Fortune 500 companies and
other private and public organizations is pushing the envelope of
reform with its own national agenda for reducing medical costs.</LD>
<LD>   Known as the Leapfrog Group, the consortium includes the benefits
managers of such household names as AT&amp;T Corp., IBM Corp., Boeing
Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and General Motors Corp.</LD>
<TE>   But the group also includes state and city insurance and
health-care authorities, the Board of Pensions of the Presbyterian
Church and the Southern California Schools Voluntary Employees
Benefits Assn. Together, they provide health coverage for 28 million
retirees and employees and their dependents.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when the nation's managed-care system is unraveling and
Washington has proffered few if any systemic solutions, private- and
public-sector groups such as Leapfrog are moving ahead with what many
say are viable industry reforms, but ones that are on the groups' own
terms and not without controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Leapfrog has launched two Web-based efforts that, to a degree,
measure hospital performance.</TE>
<TE>   The group's plan eventually is to have a system in which consumers
can see detailed information about how well hospitals perform in
terms of patient care and medical outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say this will help employers that subsidize workers'
benefits more effectively control costs, because patients presumably
will pick better-run facilities and thus experience fewer medical
complications.</TE>
<TE>   Critics maintain that it was employers' insistence on excessive
cost controls that caused many of the problems with managed care. Now
that costs can no longer be controlled, they say, employers are
pushing the costs and responsibility for decisions onto employees.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Washington-based Leapfrog is moving ahead. Last week,
the group made public a Web site that gives consumers a review of
performance ratings for nearly 300 participating hospitals in
California, Atlanta, Tennessee, Michigan, Minnesota, the
Seattle/Tacoma area and St. Louis. The hospitals were rated according
to Leapfrog-devised standards.</TE>
<TE>   About 48% of hospitals that were asked to participate in the
Leapfrog survey did so. About half the hospitals are in California.</TE>
<TE>   Leapfrog also has unveiled a private Web site available only to
the workers of five large New York-area employers. It ranks top
hospitals affiliated with the state's largest insurer both by
experience with common surgeries and by mortality rates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals Questioned on Systems, Procedures</TE>
<TE>   Leapfrog's measures are basic at this stage. Among the questions
it is asking hospitals is whether they are equipped with a
computerized system for prescriptions and other physician orders that
could prevent, among other things, dangerous medication errors due to
illegible handwritten doctors' notes.</TE>
<TE>   One question asks whether the facilities' intensive-care units are
staffed only with people specifically trained for that work, which
the group advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Another question focuses on the number of procedures a hospital
performs, following Leapfrog's "practice makes perfect" belief that
hospitals that perform more procedures are better at it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to save lives and reduce preventable medical mistakes
by giving consumers the information they need to make more-informed
medical choices," said Suzanne Delbanco, the group's executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   "The Leapfrog Group has focused its initial effort on giving
consumers information on three proven patient safety practices,"
Delbanco said. "If implemented in the nation's [urban] hospitals,
they could save nearly 60,000 lives ... each year."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer and physician advocates worried about the double-digit
rise in premiums and the erosion of benefits warn that any reforms
being pushed by powerful health-care purchasers will be motivated
primarily by keeping costs low, not improving care.</TE>
<TE>   Though generally supportive, UCLA professor William Pierskalla
said the quality-of-care standards "don't get at the real issues,
such as medical complications rates and readmissions" because the
hospital staff failed to do a procedure right the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of a federal government study in 2001 warned that the
three basic standards pushed by Leapfrog "lack sufficient clinical
underpinnings" and require more study before their effectiveness as a
quality-care measure can be proven.</TE>
<TE>   The report's authors also said further study was needed before it
could be said with assurance that computerized systems for doctors
would make a real difference at all hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   It will cost money to install new equipment and to train staffers
on their use. And staffing intensive-care units with the best people
also will cost more, given the shortage of workers in that profession
and its high burnout rate. Those costs, some suggest, eventually will
be passed on to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily true, said Dr. Arnie Milstein, medical director of
the Pacific Business Group on Health, a consortium of West Coast
health-care purchasers that was one of the founders of Leapfrog.</TE>
<TE>   "The current evidence suggest the contrary," Milstein said.
"Studies of better staffing of ICUs suggest that the costs of stay
and lengths of stay are reduced with more proactive managing of the
patients."</TE>
<TE>   Milstein added that the use of computerized systems "reduces
duplication of medical tests and reduces costs associated with using
the wrong drugs, harmful drug interactions or the wrong doses because
factors such as a patient's kidney function should have been taken
into consideration."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, health-care analysts, academicians, physicians
and other experts generally perceive the efforts by groups such as
Leapfrog as positive at a time when the system is badly frayed.</TE>
<TE>   "Any solid information that gives consumers information and can
drive down premiums is great" and should be supported, said
California Insurance Commissioner Harry Low.</TE>
<TE>   "The health-services industry has been very slow to adopt quality-
and safety-improving changes. There have been numerous studies
documenting the inordinate number of people killed in hospitals
because of mistakes," said Alain Enthoven, a professor at Stanford
University's graduate school of business and a specialist in health
economics and health policy.</TE>
<TE>   "These changes are long overdue. It's a good thing Leapfrog is
doing this. There has to be a system of rewards for achieving those
standards and punishments for not achieving," Enthoven said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jack Lewin, head of the California Medical Assn., agreed,
saying, "The Leapfrog process is in general a positive direction. It
will reduce patient- and health-care errors, particularly involving
medication, and should improve the quality of care."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Consortium Born From Casual Discussions</TE>
<TE>   But who are the people carrying a cudgel that hasn't been picked
up by the health-care industry or by the government?</TE>
<TE>   The Leapfrog idea, said Bruce Taylor, director of benefits
planning for Verizon Communications Inc., began as a "a bunch of us
meeting in airport clubs [in 1998 and 1999], talking about how to
control costs and prevent mistakes. We thought it could be a great
service for employers, shareholders and for the public at large."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the original members decided that the standards had to
be scientifically based, but that "they also had to be something that
our mothers would understand."</TE>
<TE>   The group's influence can be seen in a variety of ways. For
example, medical companies such as Baltimore-based VISICU, which
provides remote-care services for intensive-care units, and
Beaverton, Ore.-based Planar Systems, which makes medical
workstations, are touting their products to hospitals as essential
for helping them meet Leapfrog's standards.</TE>
<TE>   There are caveats. Experts and Leapfrog agree that the volume of
surgical work is not the best indicator of performance, and that more
definitive measures will have to come in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Using the volume of procedures a hospital performs as a surrogate
for defining quality of care will prove to be the most
controversial," CMA's Lewin said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a body of competing information that suggests that
low-volume-care hospitals are providing in many instances the same
outcomes as high volume," he said. "We will need to look at this as
an evolving standard."</TE>
<TE>   Lewin added that Leapfrog's zeal may evaporate if the costs of
these initiatives--and therefore the costs to business and
employees--are higher than expected.</TE>
<TE>   But some companies clearly are counting on the group's influence,
such as Southern California Edison, which came close to insolvency
last year. Edison International's SCE is a member of the Pacific
Business Group on Health, which is a partner with Leapfrog.</TE>
<TE>   "As a purchaser, we want to know what we are buying," said Barbara
Decker, Edison's benefits manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We care first of all about the cost aspect and spending wisely,"
Decker said. "We want our employees to get the most appropriate care
so that they can return to work and be productive."</TE>
<TE>   Others hope the standards and later improvements will catch on
enough to force nonparticipating hospitals to believe they have to
join or face questions from consumers about why they haven't.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be increasing pressure on hospitals to participate in
these kinds of public disclosures," said Dr. Michael Langberg, chief
medical officer at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, which participated in
the survey, "whether they want to or not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Procedures, by the Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Leapfrog Group has devised a set of standards for grading
hospitals and other medical facilities based on the number of
surgical procedures performed.</TE>
<TE>   The group, a consortium of Fortune 500 companies and other major
purchasers of health insurance, believes that by providing such data,
the rate of medical errors will decrease because consumers will
choose hospitals that perform successful surgeries, thus reducing
costs as well.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the surgical procedures Leapfrog reviews and the minimum
number of procedures hospitals should do annually to receive a top
rating.</TE>
<TE>   Procedure and minimum</TE>
<TE>   * Coronary artery bypass: 500</TE>
<TE>   * Coronary angioplasty: 400</TE>
<TE>   * Abdominal aortic aneurysm: 30</TE>

<HD>Microsoft May Delay Products to Fix Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. may delay some products, including its next version
of Windows for server computers, to improve security, Vice President
Cliff Reeves said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   About 7,000 engineers in the Windows operating system,
word-processing and e-mail product groups are in security training,
Reeves said.</LD>
<LD>   That, and the need to fix any security flaws that are found, may
result in delays.</LD>
<TE>   Chairman Bill Gates last week sent an e-mail to employees saying
Microsoft must make security a higher priority than new features.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is trying to take customers from rivals such as Sun
Microsystems Inc. with its Windows server software and must improve
security to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Delays can hurt sales of the server products the company is
relying on to fuel growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly this will cause delays in products, but we would
hardly be credible if we didn't do this," Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you decide to do this, it takes priority over everything
else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Security improvements at Microsoft are designed to make sure
programs don't go on sale with flaws that can let a hacker take over
computers and gain access to files.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, thousands of servers running Microsoft software
were infected with the Code Red worm, and the new Windows XP program
for personal computers was susceptible to hackers.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft hasn't disclosed a release date for the next version of
the Windows server software for running Web sites and corporate
networks.</TE>
<TE>   Windows .Net Server will go on sale in the middle of the year, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, a vice president in the Windows .Net group, said the
software probably will be available by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   Training for Microsoft engineers is expected to be complete by the
end of the month, Reeves said.</TE>

<HD>Roy Disney Foresaw Pooh Rights Dispute</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: A 1967 memo shows that top executives knew
the ownership issue could end up in a legal tangle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top Walt Disney Co. executives knew by the mid-1960s that the company
would encounter problems reaping all of the profits from its broad
strategy for commercializing the Winnie the Pooh characters,
according to newly unsealed court documents.</LD>
<LD>   In a confidential January 1967 company memo, Walt Disney's brother
Roy O. Disney bemoaned the tangled ownership interests in the Winnie
the Pooh characters left by creator and author A.A. Milne, who died
in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   The Disney company acquired rights to Pooh in 1961. Six years
later, Roy Disney--then president of Walt Disney Productions and the
financial whiz of the two Disney brothers--discovered that Milne had
divided the rights to the Pooh characters to a greater extent than
Disney executives had realized.</LD>
<TE>   The memo is among more than 40 volumes of documents chronicling a
11-year legal battle between Disney and Stephen Slesinger Inc., a
family-owned firm that acquired merchandising rights to the Hundred
Acre Wood characters from Milne in 1930. Slesinger's heirs sued
Disney, claiming the Burbank-based entertainment giant has cheated
them out of at least $200 million in royalties since 1983 from
Pooh-related videos, DVDs, computer software and popular Pooh
attractions at theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Documents in the case were unsealed Friday after Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige in December granted a
motion by the Los Angeles Times to open the files.</TE>
<TE>   The newly released records show that ranking Disney executives
were unaware that Slesinger had such extensive rights when Disney
acquired the Pooh properties. Roy Disney's 1967 memo outlined the
jumble of rights and a scenario that some say proved prophetic.</TE>
<TE>   "A.A. Milne has certainly and completely balled up his rights to
Winnie the Pooh in America," Disney wrote in 1967. "If we were to do
anything with Winnie the Pooh, Slesinger is in a beautiful spot to
either hold us up for an outrageous price or sit back and reap the
rewards of our work and investment."</TE>
<TE>   Milne, who lived in England, kept the literary rights to Pooh,
Tigger, Kanga and Roo and the other whimsical characters that
populated his stories. He sold the merchandising rights to Slesinger,
a New York literary agent, in 1930 and agreed to share profit from
that deal with the original book illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard. In
1932, Milne agreed to expand Slesinger's rights to cover radio and,
eventually, television broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to buy Milne's rights, we would still have to answer
to Shepard, and Slesinger would still have the rights to exploit its
characters and stories on radio and television," Disney wrote. "All
of the rights granted to Slesinger are sole and exclusive and
nontransferable."</TE>
<TE>   The most recent contract, signed in 1983 by representatives of
Disney, the Milne Trust and Slesinger's heirs in Florida, streamlined
payments of Pooh royalties and removed geographic boundaries. The
Slesingers are entitled to 1.33 cents of every dollar of Pooh
merchandise sold, based on wholesale prices.</TE>
<TE>   But the contract is silent on payments for videos, computer
software or uses in other media--adding more confusion and contention
to the issue of who owns which rights to the characters that Milne
created in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Disney attorneys now maintain that the Slesinger heirs are due
royalties on a limited line of Pooh products, including apparel and
stuffed animals. The 1983 contract, they say, delineates the rights,
and Disney has resisted attempts by Slesinger's daughter and widow to
amend the contract to include other products or uses.</TE>
<TE>   "The contract does not cover videos, DVDs or when Winnie the Pooh
dances down Main Street at Disneyland," said Disney's lead attorney,
Daniel Petrocelli. "Disney has worked extremely hard and made [the
Pooh] property immensely profitable, and these people just sit back
and collect checks."</TE>
<TE>   Pooh and his furry friends are purported to be Disney's most
lucrative characters, by some accounts raking in more than $4 billion
a year for Disney and its licensees in the mid- to late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud and breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by Slesinger's
widow and daughter in 1991 is expected to go to trial this year. The
legal dispute has sparked worldwide interest because testimony is
expected to reveal how much money the "tubby little cubby" has made
for Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger family attorney Bert Fields said Roy Disney's 1967 memo
puts Disney lawyers "in a tough spot" because Disney executives
acknowledged that the company would have to pay the Slesingers for
"anything" Pooh-related.</TE>
<TE>   Petrocelli, however, said the memo bolsters Disney's case against
the Slesingers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a perfect piece of evidence that confirms that they only
had a little slice of the pie: merchandising and broadcasts on radio
and television," Petrocelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released Friday show that Disney's relationship with the
Slesingers and the Milne Trust soured a few years after the 1983
contract was signed.</TE>
<TE>   Disney lawyers argued with representatives of Milne for more than
a decade over whether the company owed royalties on Pooh software.
Finally, in 1996, Disney reversed its position and paid the Milne
Trust $750,000 to cover royalties on computer software, court records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Disney agreed to buy out the Milne Trust for $350
million. The company agreed to pay the lump sum to resolve lingering
questions over payments and uses in new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney's dispute with the Slesinger family continues. The
Slesingers maintain that they should be paid royalties on videos,
DVDs and computer software and that a ranking Disney executive
assured them that videos and computer uses were included in the 1983
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, court papers show that Disney paid the Slesingers at
least $29,000 in royalties on videos and software for a few years
after the contract went into effect. But those payments stopped about
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Disney attorneys maintain the payments were a mistake, not an
admission that the company owes the Slesinger family additional
royalties.</TE>
<TE>   "Those payments prove nothing more than that an accountant in
Disney's Consumer Products division occasionally made minor errors in
Stephen Slesinger Inc.'s favor," Disney lawyers wrote in the court
papers. "SSI wants the court to ignore the fact that it is trying to
usurp rights it never got from the trust."</TE>
<TE>   Slesinger attorney Fields disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney paid royalties on video until video got really big, and
then Disney said, 'Oh, it was a mistake,'" Fields said. "Disney paid
royalties on computer software until they saw the potential for
computer software. Disney has some real problems here."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McLeodUSA Inc., a western U.S. local phone and Internet-services
company trying to avert bankruptcy, agreed to sell its
directory-publishing unit to Britain-based Yell Group Ltd. for $600
million.</LD>
<LD>   McLeodUSA, about 20%-owned by Forstmann Little &amp; Co., said it
ended a Dec. 3 agreement to sell the unit to the private investment
firm for $535 million. Forstmann had agreed not to charge a breakup
fee if McLeodUSA found a better offer. Yell is Britain's biggest
phone-directory publisher.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Gray, McLeodUSA's chief executive, has been cutting jobs,
selling assets and abandoning plans to build a national U.S. network
to cope with slumping demand for communications services. The company
said last month that it might have to file for bankruptcy if
bondholders wouldn't agree to exchange $2.9 billion in debt for stock
and cash, funded from the sale of the directory unit.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. creditors sued GE Capital Corp. for more than
$1 billion, claiming the financial services unit of General Electric
Co. benefited unfairly from the defunct department store chain's
bankruptcy at their expense.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and announced it was going
out of business 13 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based company first filed for Chapter 11 in July 1997.
It emerged from that reorganization in 1999 after GE Capital, which
had owned 53% of the retailer, agreed to buy the rest for about $1.65
billion, court documents say.</LD>
<TE>   A panel representing Montgomery Ward's unsecured creditors in the
second Chapter 11 case filed the new suit in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Del., accusing GE Capital of profiting by manipulating
the timing of the second bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for GE Capital said the company is offering the
creditors a settlement that would provide at least a 20% recovery of
their losses.</TE>

according to a survey by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The 2.7 months' average search time was the least since the
job-placement firm began keeping records in 1986. For job seekers 50
years of age and older, the average search time was 3 months, down
from 3.6 months in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The quarterly survey of 3,000 discharged managers and executives
found that jobs were easiest to find in health care, education,
government and construction.</LD>
<TE>   The group also found that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks boosted
demand for security workers, law enforcement officers, social workers
and defense-industry workers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Infineon Technologies reported its third straight quarterly loss and
said it will be unprofitable this fiscal year, dousing investor
optimism for a rebound in the semiconductor industry and sending
shares lower.</LD>
<LD>   Computer-memory chip prices on the spot market have tripled since
early November, and Infineon said this month that it was in the
process of raising prices for contract customers. Still, prices have
not exceeded Infineon's full cost of production and the company said
it sees no signs of an "overall market recovery."</LD>
<LD>   Munich-based Infineon, which announced 5,000 job cuts in 2001,
makes chips for mobile phones and computers. Sales dropped as
economies slowed and customers including Dell Computer Corp. and
Nokia saw demand for their products cool.</LD>

<LD>Yeslam Binladin, the half brother of the world's most wanted
terrorist, said it would be insensitive to use the trademark "Bin
Ladin" his company registered in Switzerland for a line of clothing
and jewelry.</LD>
<LD>   Binladin, who lives in Geneva, confirmed he had the Bin Ladin
trademark registered in February, seven months before Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Swiss authorities said last week they were moving on moral grounds
to revoke the trademark out of sensitivity for "emotional and moral
feelings."</LD>
<TE>   The trademark was granted to a Swiss company called Falcon
Sporting Goods, which registered the label for items such as jewelry,
clothes and sportswear. In the U.S., Falcon Sporting Goods filed an
application Aug. 17 to use the Bin Ladin name for glasses.</TE>

<HD>Intel Adds 7 Smaller Chips for Notebooks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp., the biggest semiconductor maker, started selling seven
smaller, faster new microprocessors for notebook personal computers
and cut prices as much as 30% on older models.</LD>
<LD>   The new chips are built using Intel's most advanced fabrication
technique, called 0.13 micron. The processors consume less power than
previous versions and produce less heat, the Santa Clara,
Calif.-based company said.</LD>
<LD>   The processors represent the completion of Intel's transition to
the new chip-making method for all its products aimed at the mobile
PC market. Intel has been pushing to make smaller, faster and less
power-hungry chips to stay ahead of such rivals as Transmeta Corp.
and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Intel reduced prices 15% to 30% for older mobile processors. The
1.2 gigahertz Mobile Pentium III will sell for $508 in batches of
1,000, down 30% from $722, the company said. An 866 megahertz Mobile
Celeron fell 15%, to $91 from $107.</TE>

<DH>Economy: Landlords have been forced to cut rents as
subleasing by tenants has become increasingly prevalent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much to their dismay, office building landlords are facing off
against a fast-growing and unexpected group of rivals: their very own
tenants.</LD>
<LD>   Companies big and small have put millions of square feet of
suddenly surplus offices up for sublease as businesses move fast to
reduce costs in response to a weakened economy.</LD>
<LD>   The unprecedented wave of low-priced sublease space during the
last year has created bargains for tenants but has forced landlords
to reduce rents, dimmed the outlook for newly completed development
and raised concerns about loan defaults and the industry's financial
health.</LD>
<TE>   In only a year's time, the amount of sublease space nationwide
tripled to about 108 million square feet by the third quarter of
2001, according to real estate firm Grubb &amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter results have not been tallied but are projected to
show a continued surge in sublease space.</TE>
<TE>   It probably will be a year at the very least before there will be
any noticeable improvement, said Sam Zell, chairman of Chicago-based
Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest owner of office
space.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the largest collection of sublease space that has ever
been available in the U.S. market," said Zell last week at a Real
Estate Conference Group forecast in Century City. "The U.S. real
estate market has too much inventory today."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the sublease space is concentrated in areas--such as San
Francisco, Boston and the Westside of Los Angeles--where the
once-booming high-technology and dot-com industries have gone into a
tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   But the high-tech firms have been joined by "old-economy,"
blue-chip corporations that have moved more quickly than in previous
recessions to cut their real estate costs.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been quick to downsize and lay off employees," said
Grubb &amp; Ellis' chief researcher, Robert Bach. "When they do that,
they are faster to throw back space on the market and sublease it."</TE>
<TE>   The rise in sublease space in Southern California has not been as
dramatic as in other parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Still, during 2001, the amount of sublease space jumped about 30%
in Los Angeles and 60% in Orange County, according to Insigna/ESG.
Some tenants anxious to unload unwanted offices have undercut their
landlord's asking lease rates by nearly 50% in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Arden Realty, Southern California's largest owner of office space,
said the growing pool of sublease space has had a minimal effect on
its business. However, in areas where there are large blocks of
sublease space available, the firm has trimmed its rents on
comparable space by about 5%, said Robert C. Peddicord, senior vice
president of leasing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not panicking," Peddicord said. "We are not dropping rates
dramatically but we are more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Landlords continue to collect rent on sublease space and usually
pay it no mind since it normally accounts for a small share--often
10% or less--of all space available for rent. However, landlords come
under greater pressure to reduce rents or offer other incentives to
fill their own vacant space as the pool of bargain-priced sublease
space grows in size. In Santa Monica, for example, tenants subleasing
offices accounted for more than 40% of all available space in the
third quarter of last year.</TE>
<TE>   In one of Santa Monica's newest and largest office buildings,
Water Garden II, Internet consulting firm Sapient Corp. put nearly
two-thirds of its space up for sublease at rates nearly half of the
$3.50-a-square-foot it reportedly agreed to pay the owner.</TE>
<TE>   "It is competition for the landlords," said broker David Toomey of
Cresa Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Most tenants prefer to lease space directly from landlords and are
unwilling to deal with the risks and drawbacks of subleasing. For
example, a firm that subleases space could end up on the street if
the company it is subleasing from fails to pay the rent or goes out
of business. Also, some subleases are available for a relatively
short period of time--sometimes only a few months--and are still
subject to the approval of the landlord.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such drawbacks, more companies seem willing to deal with
the risks given the large amount of cheap sublease space and
multitude of options. For example, Century City law firm Alschuler
Grossman Stein &amp; Kahan subleased 85,000 square feet in a Santa Monica
building from Turner Broadcasting last year, according to broker Seth
Dudley at Julien Studley Co. Turner, meanwhile, is said to be looking
at sublease space in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenants are really focusing on [sublease space] and are actually
leasing it in volumes we usually don't see," Dudley said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to low lease rates, bargain-minded firms and
cash-strapped entrepreneurs often move into space that has been
remodeled, furnished and wired for high-speed communications by the
previous tenant.</TE>
<TE>   "That sublease space is an opportunity for some people ... to get
quality space that they never could get before," said Paul Loulis,
chief executive of Sublease.com, which lists subleasable office space
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, Matt Coffin, chief executive of
LowerMyBills.com, moved his 40-employee Internet firm from North
Hollywood to an entire floor in a Westwood high-rise being sublet by
a downsizing dot-com. The sublease was only for one year but it
featured a monthly lease rate of less than $1 a square foot and
allowed the subtenant to keep the furniture. When the lease expired
in December, LowerMyBills.com moved to sublease space in Santa Monica
on a month-to-month basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Very often [firms with sublease space to rent] are desperate to
get anyone in there," Coffin said. "That's very much the case now."</TE>
<TE>   But the availability of so much cut-rate space has spread concerns
among investors and lenders about potential loan defaults and other
financial problems. The reduction in rental income could result in
some property owners having difficulty making loan payments and
failing to meet profit and financial targets established by
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is very nervous about that," said economist Jack Kyser
with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In October, bond-rating agency Fitch announced it would focus more
attention on the effect of sublease space as it reviews securities
backed by mortgages on commercial real estate. "A prospective tenant
coming into the market has twice as many choices. As a result,
leasing space becomes very difficult" for landlords, said Fitch real
estate securities executive Mary O'Rourke.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory of sublease space is expected to continue to grow in
Southern California through much of this year as job growth in key
industries remains flat or falls, said Esmail Adibi, director of the
center for economic research at Chapman University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "The demand for office space is basically going to be absent," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Willamette Industries OKs $6-Billion Takeover Offer by
Rival Weyerhaeuser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Willamette Industries Inc. said Monday that it has agreed to a
sweetened $6-billion takeover offer by rival Weyerhaeuser Co., ending
14 months of jockeying between the two timber giants.</LD>
<LD>   The companies said Weyerhaeuser will pay $55.50 a share in cash,
50 cents a share more than what Weyerhaeuser Chairman Steven Rogel
last month called his final offer.</LD>
<LD>   Willamette said its board is expected to consider the deal before
the end of the month. The company also said it had ended negotiations
with Georgia-Pacific Corp. to buy its troubled building products
division.</LD>
<TE>   Rogel had said any deal with Georgia-Pacific would have ended the
Weyerhaeuser bid.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had warned about potential problems with the purchase of
the Georgia-Pacific division, while Willamette shareholders had been
putting pressure on the board to consider the Weyerhaeuser offer.</TE>
<TE>   With the agreement, Rogel finally succeeded in what had become a
four-year effort to buy Willamette, which he left late in 1997 to
become the first outsider chosen as rival Weyerhaeuser's chairman
since that company was founded a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rogel announced the hostile takeover in November 2000 after
Willamette Chairman William Swindells Jr. and his board of directors
repeatedly rejected a deal with Weyerhaeuser.</TE>
<TE>   The $55.50 a share offer represents an 18% premium to Willamette's
closing price Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Willamette shares rose $1.09 to close at $47.10 in trading Friday,
and Weyerhaeuser shares rose 18 cents to $51.51, both on the New York
Stock Exchange. U.S. markets were closed Monday in observance of
Martin Luther King Day.</TE>

<HD>Apartment Market Strong Despite Downturn</HD>
<DH>A slowing of rent growth in 2001 has not deterred
investors seeking stability, and vacancy rates remain low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Demand for apartments weakened slightly in Southern California in
2001, but experts say the apartment market has suffered less than
other types of commercial real estate and remains a favorite choice
for investors seeking stability in a time of uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   Rent growth slowed last year as demand slackened and landlords in
some high-priced buildings started offering a month's free rent to
entice tenants--a phenomenon unheard of in the heady days before the
recession.</LD>
<LD>   But overall, according to a variety of industry sources, the
outlook remains positive for apartment investors because the need for
living space is still strong, few new units are being built and the
percentage of empty apartments has stayed comparatively low by
historical standards.</LD>
<TE>   The number of sales of apartment buildings in 2001 increased to
1,856 in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties,
up slightly from the year before, according to a report by Marcus &amp;
Millichap, a brokerage specializing in investment properties.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also paid more for apartments in 2001--an average of
about $67,861 per unit in Los Angeles County, up from $64,271 in
2000. In Orange County, the average price per unit climbed by $3,000
to $83,514 and in Riverside and San Bernardino counties it rose by
$7,300 to $50,137.</TE>
<TE>   A sign of the continuing popularity of apartments with investors
is that the number of potential buyers exceeds the number of
properties for sale, said Harvey Green, president and chief executive
of Marcus &amp; Millichap, an Encino-based real estate brokerage. He
explained that many owners prefer to hold on to their apartment
complexes for the continued cash flow, even though they could make a
substantial one-time profit by selling.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective investors see Southern California apartments as a
safer bet than other classes of commercial real estate, said broker
Dean Zander of Hendricks &amp; Partners, because demand has remained
steady, vacancy rates have not soared as they have in some office and
industrial markets, and few new apartments are being built.</TE>
<TE>   "The recession has made apartments look a lot more attractive by
comparison," Zander said. "People are taking their money out of
underperforming investments and putting it into apartments."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recession, Zander said, many investors still believe
they can make money on apartments by managing them more efficiently
or by renovating them and raising rents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a big increase in demand for older apartment
buildings," Zander said. Many buyers believe they can earn a higher
return by acquiring older "Class B" properties, he explained, because
big institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance
companies and REITs have bid up the prices of modern "Class A"
buildings so high that such properties generate a smaller return on
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Among those banking on the buy-and-renovate strategy is
Irvine-based Aslan Realty Group, which was formed in early 2001 by
partners Tom Rakow, John Schafer and Joe Cahill to acquire complexes
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Aslan owns four properties totaling 859 units in which it will
have about $72 million invested when renovations are finished, Rakow
said. The company buys its properties in joint ventures with
institutions and affluent individuals as its partners, he said, and
it expects to invest $50 million to $100 million per year in
Southland apartments for the next four or five years.</TE>
<TE>   Many other investment groups have been buying Southern California
apartment complexes for years and remodeling them in expectation of
raising rents, but the Aslan partners say there still are plenty of
opportunities to profit through renovations and more efficient
management, primarily on older properties.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were buying Class A properties, we might be a little more
concerned about how the economy has affected the rental market,"
Cahill said. "But considering that we're buying the properties we
are, we feel confident of our strategy."</TE>
<TE>   Cahill's remark reflects a consensus among brokers, buyers and
other observers: Higher-priced complexes are bearing the brunt of the
recession's effect on the apartment market.</TE>
<TE>   "There is less demand for $2,000 one-bedroom apartments on the
Westside [of Los Angeles] than there is for $900 one-bedroom
apartments in the [San Fernando] Valley," Zander of Hendricks &amp;
Partners said.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords at some of the most expensive Westside buildings--where
one-bedroom apartments rent for more than $2,000--are offering such
enticements as a month's free rent on a one-year lease.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers who specialize in the Westside markets, such as Hooman
Ghaffari of Grubb &amp; Ellis and Kitty Wallace of Sperry Van Ness, say
such enticements are by no means widespread but they were unheard of
when the economy was booming.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, anything over $2,000 is getting tougher to rent,"
Wallace said. "My clients in Palms and Mar Vista have no problems
whatsoever in renting their units, but the upper-end units are taking
longer to rent."</TE>
<TE>   Before the recession and the dot-com crash hit the Westside,
Wallace said, landlords would have 20 prospective tenants for a
luxury apartment and could count on raising the rent as much as 25%
for a new tenant. Now, far fewer tenants line up, and landlords are
keeping rents flat or even lowering them.</TE>
<TE>   Ghaffari has seen rent decreases of 15% to 20% during the last
five months for new renters in some expensive Westside properties. "I
don't think the 'B' market will see anything like that," Ghaffari
said. "I think there were a lot of people who were stretching to
afford those high-end apartments, and a lot of them are looking for
lower-priced places now."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, rents continued to rise in the moderately priced
neighborhoods that many investors find so attractive. "We raised
rents about 5% last year on our occupied apartments and about 12% to
15% on the units that became vacant," said John Gordon of
Pasadena-based Fertig &amp; Gordon, which manages 900 units in the San
Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Rents range from $500 to $600 for one-bedroom units and $700 to
$900 for the two-bedroom units his company manages, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the economic slowdown, he said, "most of our vacant units
rent within a week."</TE>
<TE>   Even with expectations that the recession will continue for much
of 2002, Green of Marcus &amp; Millichap said investors realize that jobs
eventually will return the population will continue to grow, and
construction of apartments will not keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   He said the slight decline in the number of renters looking for
apartments, which pushed vacancy rates up by less than half a
percentage point throughout Southern California, reflected "classic
recessionary patterns of doubling up, moving home or moving to lower-
rent areas."</TE>
<TE>   That pattern, Green said, will reverse itself when the economy
recovers.</TE>

<HD>Gymboree Thinks Smaller, Gets Bigger</HD>
<DH>Retail: After two years as top executive, Lisa Harper has
the kids' clothes chain moving in the right direction again by
fine-tuning inventory and thinking young.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA DUBROVSKY</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lisa Harper became Gymboree Corp.'s general merchandise manager
in February 2000, she stopped the children's clothing retailer from
trying to make tots look like miniature teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   Kids should look like kids, Harper decided, and muted colors like
olive green went out the window. Trendy pieces like two-tone baseball
shirts and sparkly tank tops went too, replaced by colorful tops,
bottoms and accessories that could be mixed and matched.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't a novel idea. Classic, easy-to-coordinate clothes
defined Gymboree in the early and mid-1990s and caused profit to more
than double during its first five years as a public company. What
worked then, worked again. After Harper's first complete line hit
stores in October 2000, Gymboree had its first sales gain in five
quarters.</LD>
<TE>   After two years of losses, Gymboree expects to earn 12 cents to 14
cents a share in the year ending Feb. 2. Still, the turnaround is far
from over, investors and analysts said. Harper, who was promoted to
chief executive in February, has fixed the fashions. Now, she needs
to increase sales, keep inventory lean and sell more clothing at full
price to prop up profit margins, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for continued margin expansion," said Jeff Matthews,
managing partner of Ram Partners. "That's going to translate into
higher earnings." Ram Partners, a private hedge fund, owns Gymboree
shares.</TE>
<TE>   The shares have almost doubled in the last six months, as the
Burlingame, Calif.-based company boosted sales and profit forecasts.
The stock trades at more than 100 times estimated earnings for this
fiscal year, compared with a multiple of 29% for the Standard &amp;
Poor's Retail Stores Composite Index.</TE>
<TE>   Gymboree's multiple isn't unusual for a company in the early
stages of a comeback, analysts said. Profit is forecast to more than
triple in fiscal 2003 to 47 cents a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call, and that would bring Gymboree's ratio in line
with the index, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has spent the last year studying sales trends at its
581 stores and crunching numbers. In fiscal 2003, the company will
use what it's learned to send each store the right amount for its
size and sales volume, the right styles for its customers and the
right sleeve lengths for its climate, Harper, 42, said.</TE>
<TE>   This "micromerchandising," a first for Gymboree, is expected to
increase sales and lead to fewer price cuts when implemented in the
second half of next year, Harper said. That will mean wider profit
margins, or more money made on each item sold.</TE>
<TE>   Margins began deteriorating in fiscal 1999, when Gymboree opened
more than 120 stores. The stores were various sizes and shapes, in
various types of malls, serving various types of markets, and they
all got the same stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Gross profit narrowed that year to 36% of sales from 44% a year
earlier, and profit fell for the first time since Gymboree's initial
public offering in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't adjust our operational strategies to that new group of
stores," said Harper, who doesn't have children. "We've never really
gotten a return on those stores."</TE>
<TE>   Harper's goal next year is to halve the "too-wide" margin gap
between Gymboree's lowest-volume and highest-volume stores.</TE>
<TE>   Last quarter, she pushed the newest offerings to the front of
stores, and gross profit widened to 36% of sales from 32% as shoppers
bought more full-price clothing.</TE>
<TE>   This quarter, Gymboree increased the coordinated collections it
sells to 16 a year from 12, and trimmed the number of pieces in each.
Delivering smaller lines more often fuels demand and leaves fewer
items to mark down, Harper said. Inventory at the start of fiscal
2003 will be 8% to 12% leaner than a year earlier, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harper earned $313,462 in fiscal 2001 as president and chief
operating officer and got a bonus of $25,020, according to a proxy
filing. Gymboree declined to provide more recent information.</TE>
<TE>   The president revived "Matchmatics," a selling approach Gymboree
used in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In-store displays, trained salespeople and the Gymboree Web site
coach customers in outfit-building. A shopper buying pants and a top
is encouraged to get coordinating socks or a sweater. Customers spent
an average 12% more during each visit last quarter, largely because
of Matchmatics, Gymboree said.</TE>
<TE>   Harper designed clothes for Gymboree from 1992 to 1995 before
being lured to clothing maker Esprit. By the time she returned in
January 1999, the selling concept had been abandoned as management
chased the latest trends.</TE>
<TE>   She may have a hard time persuading consumers to spend more when
many are looking to stretch their budgets in the recession, some
investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "With unemployment rising-- and this is a little higher-ticket, a
little better-quality merchandise-- you can be concerned about the
near term," said portfolio manager Buzz Zaino of Royce &amp; Associates.
Royce, which began buying Gymboree shares in 2000, sold the last of
its stake in November.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Matchmatics catches on, it won't bring back the good old
days, investors said. In the early 1990s, Gymboree competed mostly
with department stores. Now, the $25-billion-a-year U.S. children's
clothing market is crowded with rivals such as Gap Inc.'s BabyGap,
Children's Place Retail Stores Inc., and low-price chains such as
Target Corp. and Kohl's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a lot more stores now doing the same thing that Gymboree
is doing, so that keeps the lid on pricing," said Sean McLeod, who
manages about 120,000 Gymboree shares for the Marshall Small-Cap
Growth Fund.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal 1995, sales were about $875 a square foot, Harper said.
Gymboree is aiming for $500 this fiscal year, up from $425 last year.</TE>
<TE>   And next year?</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere between $500 and $875," Harper said.</TE>

<HD>Pact Lapses, but Agents, Actors Keep Talking</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: 'Master franchise agreement' remains in
effect as the two sides try to reach  an agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 63-year-old agreement governing relations between agents and actors
lapsed Monday, but the two sides agreed to continue abiding by it
while trying to forge a new pact.</LD>
<LD>   The "master franchise agreement" formally ran out at midnight
Sunday when lengthy weekend talks between the Screen Actors Guild and
two groups, the Assn. of Talent Agencies and the National Assn. of
Talent Representatives, failed to produce an agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Agents say the pact is outdated and onerous in today's global
media environment and have been pressing for changes they argue are
needed to survive financially.</LD>
<TE>   Some of those changes include the freedom to attract capital from
outside investors such as advertising agencies, to expand into other
businesses such as Internet firms and to revise commissions to allow
them to collect payments on DVD and video sales.</TE>
<TE>   Actors have been reluctant to change the rules out of fear it may
lead to conflicts of interest and allow producers who hire actors
also to own the agencies that represent talent.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, SAG said it wants to make sure agents are not
compromised in representing clients and will not become employers,
and that all changes benefit artists as well as agents.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what will happen if no agreement is reached.</TE>
<TE>   Agents could set their own rules, although it is unlikely that
would go over well with their clients.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement originally was made to protect actors from
unscrupulous agents. The two sides have been at a stalemate over
changes for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agreement technically expired in October 2000, a
15-month grace period was built in before it lapsed.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Aims for Share of U.S. Cleanup Funds</HD>
<DH>Environment: A federal bill to provide money for
redevelopment of polluted industrial sites spurs hope for the future
of the Avenue district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura officials cheered when Congress recently approved $250
million to speed cleanup and redevelopment of underused or abandoned
industrial sites nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   City officials hope to tap into the funds to redevelop a
three-mile stretch of privately owned oil and chemical manufacturing
sites in the blighted Avenue area on the city's west end.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to providing new money, the legislation bolsters legal
protection for landowners with potentially contaminated parcels. City
officials hope this will convince owners to come forward for site
testing.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important to find out as much about the legislation as
possible and its potential to us," said Bob Tague, Ventura's interim
economic revitalization manager. "We're going to put that information
together and go after as much money as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura officials have long contemplated redevelopment of the
economically depressed Avenue area, which for decades was the site of
oil drilling and exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Officials began pursuing federal "brownfields" funding in the late
1990s. Three years ago, the city secured a $200,000 grant through the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Economic Development
Initiative to study the west side neighborhood and begin targeting
sites for environmental testing.</TE>
<TE>   But property owners were reluctant to participate. They feared
that if regulators found contamination on their land, they could be
forced to pay for cleanup or face litigation, said Susan Daluddung,
community development director.</TE>
<TE>   The city is now working to identify industrial landowners and
determine what contamination might have occurred on their properties.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Case, a real estate broker who lives on the west side, said
the new legislation sounds promising, but property owners still
distrust the government. He said they need more information about
cleanup funding and legal protections.</TE>
<TE>   Landowners would basically be allowing "the government to come in
and say, 'You have contamination here,' and now all [they] have is a
whole can of worms here and massive exposure," Case said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can guarantee that [the government] will clean it up or
provide some kind of underwriting, then I think you've got something
going," Case added, "but you're not going to find anyone just
volunteering for this."</TE>
<TE>   Case thinks there is a demand for mixed-use development on the
Avenue, noting that Santa Barbara housing prices are so high that
commuters have created a niche market for Avenue housing.</TE>
<TE>   The area the city would like to improve is about 1,200 acres,
about a quarter of which is zoned for industrial use. Those 300 acres
are divided into at least 140 parcels within city limits and owned by
dozens of individuals and corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Councilman Brian Brennan said he doesn't expect
landowners to step forward at once. But if the city can work in
partnership with one or two owners at the outset, he said, others
will be more likely to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's opening Pandora's box and nobody wants to do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the city obtains funding, Brennan said it would be better
for landowners to take advantage of it now. If they wait, "they'll
wish they dealt with it 10 years before, when the funding was
available," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With tough growth-control laws in place, Brennan sees government
assistance to clean up industrial sites as more than a giveaway to
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stopping sprawl was one thing," Brennan said. "Looking at
some of these rundown old properties and understanding why people
were jumping over them to go out to greener pastures was why I got
the city involved."</TE>
<TE>   Besides convincing landowners to participate, the city still has
much work to do before applying for a share of the federal funds. Two
city employees overseeing the brownfields effort early on have left
their jobs, and their replacements have been struggling to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   The city expects stiff competition for federal cleanup funds.
There are 67,000 brownfield sites in California alone.</TE>
<TE>   Some local developers see the brownfields funding as an incentive
to improve the Avenue area.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to participate in working with the city on some of
these industrial sites," said Scott Bulmer, vice president of the
firm that developed Sycamore Village, a new residential project on
the Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Bulmer's project was built on a former orchard, and tests were
negative for contamination, he said. But if he had sought to use a
contaminated parcel on the Avenue, it wouldn't automatically be a
"deal-killer" now, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The brownfields funds would be a useful enticement for me to
clean it up and make good use of it," Bulmer said. "I'd be willing to
go the distance to make a good site viable again.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1800s, it was a beautiful residential area," he said of
the Avenue. "Then they discovered oil, and in came all the stuff that
came with the oil industry. Where else in California do you have all
that industrial stuff a mile from the beach?</TE>
<TE>   "You've got some of these businesses just lingering and hanging on
even though everything they were there for is gone. Now this area is
ready to return to residential. It can be turned back into what it
once was."</TE>

<HD>Schedules Rarely Posted at MTA Bus Shelters</HD>
<DH>Transportation: About 500 of 18,500 stops have maps and
routes. Rider advocates say that keeps the agency from being
accountable for service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every time bus rider Randy Smith sees another giant glossy visage of
Tom Cruise or that goofy kid with orange slices over his eyes, he
feels annoyed.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the 46-year-old janitor holds any grudges against
the latest glamour guys of the silver screen. He just can't stand all
those commercial posters at bus stops, he said, when there's a dearth
of useful information for bus riders.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be nice to have a big map to let us know where we're
going, instead of this big movie ad," the Santa Monica resident said.
He blanched at a Hollywood bus shelter announcing the new Robert
Altman release on one side, and an airbrushed image of Cruise for
"Vanilla Sky" on the other.</LD>
<TE>   "Is there a bus coming soon?" he said. "Is there not another bus
for an hour? This is where bus information should be."</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the largest bus
operator in Los Angeles County, has about 18,500 bus stops. About 500
of them, or 2.7%, post schedules and routes, according to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, more than 1,100 of San Francisco's 5,000 bus stops,
or 22%, display schedules and routes. Around New York City, at least
85.7% of the five boroughs' 14,000 bus stops are so equipped, a city
transit spokeswoman said, and the rest will have the information
posted by June.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the MTA is adding more information displays
at bus stops. Because the agency doesn't own the shelters or benches,
which are controlled by whatever local government owns the land
underneath, it installs "cubes"--oblong metal and plastic boxes with
information on each side--on bus stop poles.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is adding 150 cubes a year to its stops, said Warren
Morse, the agency's deputy executive officer of marketing and
customer relations.</TE>
<TE>   At that rate, it could take 120 years to equip the entire county.
But the MTA has no such aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will install just 400 more information cubes on heavily
used routes and transfer points. Spokesman Rick Jager said there are
no plans at this time to equip the remaining 17,600 stops because
installing and maintaining the displays is labor-intensive and
costly.</TE>
<TE>   Rider advocates have other theories.</TE>
<TE>   Having schedules posted for everyone to see "would put some
responsibility on them as to when the buses would arrive," said
Manuel Criollo, an organizer for the Bus Riders Union. "Buses are
often late. One way they try to hide that is by not posting any
information."</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1996 study by the Transportation Research Board of
the National Research Council, displaying helpful information for
customers at bus stops promotes ridership, takes pressure off drivers
and reduces customer complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of transit managers surveyed believe that on-street
information is an effective and necessary part of a transit system.
But many were also concerned about the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put it out, you have to maintain it, make sure it's
accurate all the time," said Paul Larrousse, director of the National
Transit Institute of Rutgers University.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA information cubes cost at least $120. The agency did not
have figures on maintenance costs.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, the DASH bus system run by the city of Los Angeles
displays route and schedule information on colorful fiberglass signs
that cost about $7 each, with labor costing "not much more than
that," said Phil Aker, supervising transportation planner for the
city's Department of Transportation. About 400 of DASH's 1,600 bus
stops have the signs, and LADOT plans to equip all its stops with
them by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Transit experts say research shows that a lack of posted
information discourages people from taking the bus because they fear
getting lost, wasting time and dealing with the unfamiliar.</TE>
<TE>   "What we find is that the problems are the worst for occasional
riders and those new to the area," said Brian Taylor, director of
UCLA's Institute of Transportation Studies.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staffers say the agency tries hard to provide information to
riders through other means.</TE>
<TE>   Pamphlets of routes and schedules are supposed to be on every
bus--though riders say they're often missing. Folding maps detailing
the region's public transportation system, including every bus line,
Metrolink and Metro Rail, are distributed through Nix Check Cashing
outlets. Would-be riders can dial MTA's toll-free help line,
1-800-COMMUTE, or tap into www.mta.net to plan trips online.</TE>
<TE>   "The information at bus stops is meant for reassurance, not for
trip planning," MTA spokesman Marc Littman said. "The ideal trip
planning is done ahead of time. That's why it's important to check
beforehand, ... to check over the phone, to check with the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, at the Hollywood bus stop, looked puzzled when asked about
bus schedules in cyberspace. He doesn't even have a telephone at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Which transit-dependent person has a computer?" said Bart Reed,
executive director of the Transit Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, what information is displayed makes riders scratch
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Giddiens, a 39-year-old Tujunga man who works for a
telephone survey company, is perplexed by why some bus lines exhibit
more information than others, even those at the same stop. "It just
seems random," Giddiens said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Los Angeles, many Metro Rapid bus stops have digital
displays, touted as cutting-edge technology capable of flashing
real-time updates.</TE>
<TE>   Recently along the two Metro Rapid bus lines on Wilshire and
Ventura boulevards, the $3,500 electronic signs appeared to be in
deep freeze, perpetually displaying the words: "METRO RAPID BUS"
rather than vehicle arrival times.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Gephart, project manager for Metro Rapid, concedes that the
digital sign system has had problems.</TE>
<TE>   The digital signs along the Wilshire line have not been turned on,
he said, and only the Ventura line's work at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   At a Tarzana stop, 20-year-old Vanessa Martinez guffawed at a
frozen digital display, saying it hadn't worked for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Impatient to find out when the next bus might come, the Northridge
student and other riders sometimes run into the street to see if one
is on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you're not supposed to do that," Martinez said, adding she
has seen horizon-scopers nearly get mowed down by oncoming traffic.
"But what else are you supposed to do? It's so frustrating just
standing here."</TE>

<HD>OK Expected in Dana Point on Bluffs Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Headlands project of homes, hotel and parks comes
before the City Council tonight. The state Coastal Commission looks
to be a tougher sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dana Point officials tonight are poised to approve building
multimillion-dollar homes, an inn, shops and parks atop the city's
majestic Headlands. But the $500-million bluff-top project still has
to clear a higher hurdle: winning approval from the California
Coastal Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Other developers with projects in Orange County have made major
concessions required by the state agency. Irvine Co.'s Newport Coast
housing development, Athens Group's Treasure Island resort in Laguna
Beach and the Hellman family's plan for a gated community in Seal
Beach required substantial changes. When the Irvine-based Lusk Co.
proposed 412 homes, an outlet mall and retail center on San
Clemente's Marblehead, one Coastal Commission member last year
admonished a company executive to be "a little less greedy," and the
company withdrew that plan.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's staff is already weighing in on the Headlands
proposal, expressing concern about the potential effects on water
quality and threatened species such as the coastal California
gnatcatcher.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of its proximity to the Dana Point and Niguel Marine Life
Refuges, as well as a number of beaches that frequently rate poorly,
... the Dana Point Headlands is an area of great concern for us,"
Janna Shackeroff of the Coastal Commission's water-quality unit wrote
to the city last year. The development "could potentially pose a
significant threat to coastal water quality," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote that the developer, Headlands Reserve LLC of Dana Point,
needs to outline a way to protect water quality, rather than
compensate for ill effects. She also wrote that analyzing the full
effect will require more specific information about the commercial
development proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "The project design features fail to demonstrate that the
developers and architects had water quality objectives in mind,"
Shackeroff wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Among her suggestions were a centralized carwash area for
residents, using only landscapers trained in conservation practices,
and an agreement with the new community's homeowners association to
maintain and update systems to reduce runoff of polluted water for at
least 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Edward, president of Headlands Reserve LLC, said the
development company has not yet submitted its application to the
commission. When it does so shortly after winning city approval, he
said, the plan will show state-of-the-art technology to combat water
pollution, as well as endangered-species provisions that will exceed
state and federal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Endangered species are a key concern.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Allen, a Coastal Commission biologist, wrote: "There is no
doubt that the project will cause impacts" to sensitive habitats,
noting that five of the eight threatened gnatcatcher territories on
the site would be developed, as would eight of 13 patches of
Blochman's Dudleya, a rare succulent plant with white-and-yellow
flowers that is endemic to the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   Also, one of the last four populations of the endangered Pacific
pocket mouse is on the site, Allen wrote: "The proposed temporary
preserve for the pocket mouse is certainly a very minimum level of
protection, and a more permanent arrangement should be required with
more definite guarantees for this species protection and recovery."
Six of the tiny mammals live on the site.</TE>
<TE>   The 121-acre Headlands, with its stretches of coastal sage scrub,
overlooks the shore where Richard Henry Dana Jr., for whom the city
is named, arrived in 1835.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of the most unique pieces of property on the whole
California coast," Councilman Wayne Rayfield said. "It's the symbol
by which Dana Point is known by."</TE>
<TE>   The city's Planning Commission approved the project in December,
and the City Council is expected to follow suit tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the city settled a 1998 lawsuit filed by the developer,
agreeing to allow 125 ocean-view lots selling for $1.5 million to $3
million each, a 65-room seaside inn similar to Post Ranch Inn in Big
Sur, 40,000 square feet of commercial space and five parks linked by
greenbelts and three miles of trails. The original Headlands proposal
would have placed 375 houses and a 400-room hotel on the land.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the land would remain open, including a 24-acre
conservation park for the pocket mouse and sage scrub for the
gnatcatcher. The conservation park and other open space, including a
sandy beach, a harbor-view park, a strand vista park and a hilltop
park with 360-degree views, would be public and would include a
lighthouse, a veterans memorial and nature and cultural centers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to open up to the public vistas that are rarely
seen because the property is fenced off," Mayor Joe Snyder said last
week. "It's sitting there, and the vast majority of people don't get
an opportunity to witness its glory."</TE>
<TE>   Edward of Headlands Reserve said the development company expects
to win city approval tonight, "and I'm optimistic that it's going to
be a 5-0 vote."</TE>
<TE>   To mediate with the Coastal Commission, the developer has hired
Gary Hunt, the longtime public face of the Irvine Co. Hunt is a
partner in California Strategies, an Irvine-based consulting company
specializing in government affairs and planning, and worked as the
Irvine Co.'s top political strategist before leaving the company last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of the public agencies, including Coastal Commission
staff, the county and the city of Dana Point, realize that Gary has a
reputation of integrity and quality that we think matches nicely with
the project we're proposing," Edward said. "He's part of a strategic
team that's going to ensure that everything we're doing is done at
the absolute best level it can be done."</TE>
<TE>   Development of the Headlands has been one of Orange County's most
contentious land-use battles. It has included two successful and
costly voter referendums in 1994 that rescinded the City Council's
approval of a 400-room hotel, commercial center and 370 homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Headlands owner sued, and the courts upheld the
referendums--but also said that the owner has a right to use the
property and that the city must allow some development or be ready to
compensate the owner for the land.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the council voted on a plan that limited construction to
185 homes on a bluff overlooking the harbor as well as a hotel on the
strand area. But because the city's General Plan allowed for further
development, Edward sued the city. The judge ordered the city to
consider the developer's plan, forcing Edward and the city into
negotiations that resulted in the July settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a divisive, contentious problem since the city was
formed," Councilman Harold K. Kaufman said. "From a political
standpoint it's going to be good to get this project behind us."</TE>

<HD>4 Local Hotels Polishing Image With Upgrades</HD>
<DH>Renovations: Make-overs are being done with the hopes of
attracting more convention business and high-end visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to draw visitors and project a more upscale image, four
of Ventura's larger hotels are undergoing major renovations, upgrades
or changes of affiliation.</LD>
<LD>   The Pierpont Inn and the Four Points Sheraton have begun
remodeling and renovating their properties, while the Holiday Inn
expects to begin a $5-million conversion to a Crowne Plaza in the
fall and the Clarion Hotel will convert to a full-service Marriott
late this year or early in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Hoteliers say they hope the improvements lure visitors to Ventura
instead of competing resort destinations and increase midweek
business.</LD>
<TE>   Since Spencer Garrett bought the Pierpont Inn three years ago, the
property has been re-roofed, repainted and reinforced with dual-pane
windows.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 76 rooms was redone, with renovations to the Sanjon
Road property totaling more than $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that there's ever an end," said Garrett, the
Pierpont's managing partner.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the restaurant to be remodeled to include an
entertainment lounge and for a 1950s beach cottage to be restored.</TE>
<TE>   Early next year, the upstairs portion of the property, which dates
from 1910, will be converted from office space into six guest rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel also hopes to get onto the National Registry of Historic
Places, Garrett said.</TE>
<TE>   "We really are playing upon our historic roots," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investment appears to be paying off, with more guests and
community recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting to see the fruits of all our restoration efforts,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a necessary investment.... We are trying to create a
destination resort."</TE>
<TE>   The conversion of the Holiday Inn will represent a bump up in
hotel quality, said Jim Bennett, the hotel's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   The outside of the oceanfront property will get a new facade, and
the flat roof will become a mansard roof.</TE>
<TE>   The balconies will be reconfigured, and some will be enclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 260 rooms will receive furniture and linen upgrades.
Several bars and eateries will be added, and the penthouse Breakers
restaurant, which will offer an outdoor dining area, will be updated.</TE>
<TE>   Conversion of the building, which has been a Holiday Inn for
nearly 30 years, will take about six months, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Ventura Harbor, the Four Points Sheraton has been tackling
renovation and upgrade projects for several years, said Paula
Saunders, the hotel's director of sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a continual renovation. We have done all of the guest rooms
twice in eight years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander's restaurant will move from the marina wing of the hotel
to the Harborview meeting room and will have an outdoor patio and a
private dining room adjacent to the main lobby.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense that we keep things as close as possible,"
Saunders said. The old restaurant will become meeting space and
suites with whirlpool baths.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant will be moved by the end of April, and the
additional suites should be ready by the end of the summer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The main lobby soon will have a bar for continental breakfasts and
light lunches. Work there should be completed by the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is adding 26 suites, for a total of 177.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed more guest rooms," Saunders said. "We max out a good
deal of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout 2002, the 283-bed Clarion Hotel on Harbor Boulevard
will undergo extensive renovations, Marriott spokesman Matthew
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the renovations are complete, it'll be reflagged as a
Marriott hotel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura has about 30 hotels with a total of 2,000 rooms, said
Kathy Janega-Dykes, executive director of the Ventura Convention &amp;
Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "The improved [hotels] will certainly encourage people to stay
longer and return more frequently to Ventura," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura is a destination that appeals to a variety of different
ages and interest levels," Janega-Dykes said. "What's appealing about
Ventura is the diversity of lodging options here. There's something
for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura can offer less expensive rooms at motels and provide both
lodging for higher-end vacationers and space for convention-goers,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders also hopes the upgrades will encourage more midweek
conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't think that this is just a transient weekend business,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The money that top hotel owners have put into their properties
mirrors what the city has spent to revitalize the downtown area, said
Garrett of the Pierpont.</TE>
<TE>   "The operators in town recognize that Ventura is an increasingly
attractive location for people to come and visit both for leisure and
for business meetings," Garrett said.</TE>
<TE>   "As they make significant improvements, that'll attract more
people, and that'll make us more competitive with places like Santa
Barbara and Ojai."</TE>

<HD>Reliving a 'Special Gift'</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Echoes of Martin Luther King's oratory are
heard in Southland events in his honor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL and MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were parades, of course, and essay contests and award dinners
and even a career fair to honor the life of martyred civil rights
leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</LD>
<LD>   But, more than anything, the annual holiday observed Monday was a
day for oratory, a day to use the power of words to honor the man
whose eloquence and personal courage propelled him to the forefront
of the civil rights movement.</LD>
<LD>   "God gave him a very special gift ... to be able to move people,"
said Father Chuck Andrus at a prayer breakfast at Verbum Dei High
School in Watts.</LD>
<TE>   "He's the measuring stick" for inspirational speeches, the
unattainable standard worth striving toward, Andrus said before
joining other speakers on the podium at the breakfast sponsored by
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese's Office of African-American Ministry
and Evangelization Center.</TE>
<TE>   It stands to reason that speechmaking would be a big element of
any King Day celebration, given that King was known as one of the
most gifted orators of his day, said Peter Marston, a professor of
communication studies at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   The civil rights movement, he said, is grounded in "that great
gospel homiletic tradition"--homiletics meaning the art of preaching.
So the speeches so central to King celebrations are "not an emulation
of the man but a continuation of the tradition," Marston said.</TE>
<TE>   Those drawing on King for inspiration in their speeches included
Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, clergy and young people.</TE>
<TE>   And like King, speaker after speaker Monday called for action.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, the main speaker at the Verbum Dei prayer breakfast, which
drew about 1,000 people, cited King's example in calling on the
community to help the homeless, to steer youths away from gangs and
to ease the way for ex-convicts returning to society.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need," Parks said, "is a renewal of our individual
commitment to solve our problems."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, Father Michael D. Gutierrez reminded the nearly
400 people who filled the First United Methodist Church that "Dr.
King lived his whole life being a person of action." Although
Gutierrez was only 2 when King was assassinated in 1968, the priest
said he considers the late Baptist minister a "patron saint" whose
example guides his calling as an activist for troubled youths and a
crusader in the "living wage" movement.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief but impassioned talk at the communitywide
commemoration, Gutierrez invoked his favorite King speech--not "I
Have a Dream," the most quoted--but King's last talk, given in
Memphis on April 3, 1968, the day before he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to the mountaintop," King declared as he closed that
speech in support of striking sanitation workers. "And I've looked
over. And I've seen the promised land." Prophetically, he went on: "I
may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we,
as a people, will get to the promised land."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez spoke of the importance of joining forces to build a
better community. Inclusiveness, he said, is key.</TE>
<TE>   "There can be 50 thoughts," he said, "and they all must be in the
conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Just before delivering an emotional speech at the Second Baptist
Church in Santa Ana, the Rev. Gary Watkins said that speaking about
King is different from any other sort of address.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling of intimidation, comparing yourself to him,"
Watkins said, adding that he draws speech-writing inspiration by
rereading King's books.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Perry J. Ludy, keynote speaker at ceremonies at
the Oxnard Performing Arts Center, used passages from six King
speeches to highlight the continuing relevance of the civil rights
leader's messages.</TE>
<TE>   "My theory," said the former longtime Oxnard resident and
motivational speaker, "is that physically Dr. King was there in the
1950s and 1960s but that mentally, he was also here in the year 2002
and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   He said King often called for firm moral foundations and the need
for a nonviolent fight for justice with dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Such messages, Ludy said, are imperative today as the nation
grapples with terrorism, war, racism, infidelity and misguided youth.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a symbol of America's struggle for integration," Ludy said,
and "he's here today."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Myler, a director of the Santa Clarita Interfaith Council
and organizer of its ninth annual King celebration, said there is no
pressure to top King's "I Have a Dream" speech, simply because no one
can.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't even want to try," Myler said. "It is historically
inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   And the Rev. Ron Culmer, a priest at St. Martin in the Fields
Episcopal Church in Winnetka, said there is no better way to
celebrate King Day than to savor the famed orator's speeches. He
planned to do just that in writing his sermon for the San Fernando
Valley Interfaith Council's ecumenical celebration Monday night at
Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have a vision of God's peace?" Culmer asked the
congregation. The printed audience response passage came from King's
"I Have a Dream" speech, delivered at the 1963 civil rights march on
Washington. Together, the audience members paraphrased King's words,
reading:</TE>
<TE>   "We have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and
every hill and mountain shall be made straight. The glory of God will
be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. We have a dream
today."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter how many times a person has heard the speech,
Culmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be reminded of it at least every year.... It's moments
of remembrance that help guide us toward his vision."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Jennifer Mena, Kristina Sauerwein and Holly J.
Wolcott contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Officer Had 5 Felony Arrests</HD>
<DH>Police: William Ferguson is under investigation for
allegedly committing a string of robberies. Four incidents reportedly
are on juvenile record.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer under investigation for allegedly
committing a string of home-invasion robberies had five felony
arrests before he was hired by the LAPD in 1996, according to
documents obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Officer William Ferguson was arrested four times as a juvenile and
once as an adult on burglary and theft charges, records show. His
1991 adult arrest resulted in a misdemeanor conviction for attempted
burglary.</LD>
<LD>   What became of his juvenile arrests is not clear because court
records on those matters are not public.Ferguson's attorney, Robert
Rico, had previously acknowledged his client's arrest as an adult but
declined Monday to say whether Ferguson had a juvenile record. ''The
record reflects what the record reflects,'' he said.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD officials declined comment Monday on Ferguson's criminal
history prior to joining the department. Lt. Horace Frank, an LAPD
spokesman, said any felony conviction--even a conviction as a
juvenile--would bar a person from getting hired at the LAPD. However,
neither misdemeanor convictions nor mere arrests would automatically
disqualify a potential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, 30, is under investigation as part of a probe that also
is looking into other officers, including Ruben Palomares, who is in
federal custody on drug charges and is a suspect in a Huntington Park
homicide. Lawyers for Ferguson and Palomares, on behalf of their
clients, have denied that the officers committed crimes together.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson's actions are also under scrutiny in a February 1999
on-duty shooting that figured in a recent $1.7-million civil
settlement and will be discussed by the city's Police Commission in
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The adequacy of city background checks into LAPD candidates is a
long-standing matter of debate, and a policy question that has been
explored by the Police Commission many times over the years. In the
LAPD's analysis of the events known as the Rampart scandal, the
department noted that four officers accused of wrongdoing had been
hired despite past arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson was hired at a time when the LAPD was pressing to expand,
an effort spearheaded by then-Mayor Richard Riordan. Critics at the
time accused the department of hiring candidates too quickly, in some
cases without conducting thorough background checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed someone slipped through the cracks," said
Mitzi Grasso, president of the Police Protective League.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me that there was a breakdown in the screening
process. It's a problem that the department, the league and the city
have been wrestling with for some time."</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Ferguson was arrested four times as a
juvenile between 1986 and 1990. One of those arrests was by LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested twice on suspicion of theft and twice on suspicion
of burglary, once while he was allegedly in possession of burglary
tools, the records show.</TE>
<TE>   The court records obtained by The Times do not contain details
surrounding the arrests or the outcome of the cases. Cases involving
juveniles are not public records.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson was arrested as an adult in January 1991 on suspicion of
burglary, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, he pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of
misdemeanor attempted burglary. He was sentenced to three years'
probation, records show. He joined the Marine Corps in 1992. After a
four-year stint in the service, he joined the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   As a police officer, Ferguson has been the subject of numerous
personnel complaints, and has been investigated on allegations that
he framed suspects, planted evidence and intimidated a witness. He is
currently relieved of duty pending an internal disciplinary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 8, 1999, Ferguson was involved in an on-duty shooting in
which he shot at, and missed, an alleged teenage drug dealer. The
department's handling of that shooting investigation has been the
subject of an internal inquiry by the Police Commission's inspector
general.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's probe was launched after a Times article
disclosed that when the Police Commission concluded that the shooting
was within LAPD policy--a finding that Chief Bernard C. Parks urged
it to make--some key information about the incident had not been
shared with members of the civilian panel.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the commissioners were not told at the time of their
vote that Ferguson's role in the shooting was--and still is--the
subject of an active criminal investigation. Nor were commissioners
told that police officials had searched the officer's locker and
seized a replica weapon that one detective speculated was possessed
by Ferguson "to be used as planted evidence," according to police
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson and his partner, Jeffery Robb, known on the streets of
the Southeast Division as "Batman and Robin," refused to testify
about the shooting in a civil proceeding on the matter, invoking
their constitutional right against self-incrimination. Robb resigned
from the department in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson is also under investigation by authorities attempting to
learn more about his relationship with Officer Palomares, who was
arrested in June after allegedly trying to buy 10 kilograms of
cocaine from an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent.</TE>
<TE>   One of Palomares' co-defendants in the drug case told
investigators that Palomares and Ferguson were involved in a criminal
partnership in which they would commit invasion-style robberies,
stealing narcotics and money from drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The co-defendant, according to people familiar with his
statements, also implicated Palomares in an unsolved 1999 Huntington
Park killing, another crime that remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, LAPD officials confirmed that they have an ongoing
criminal investigation into Palomares, Ferguson and other officers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man died Monday after being shot in the parking lot of a North
Hills strip mall, police said. He was the fourth person to be shot to
death in the area in less than two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Police believe that at least two of the shootings were
gang-related, said Lt. Tim Moss of the LAPD's Devonshire Division.</LD>
<LD>   The latest victim, believed to be in his 20s, was shot four times
about 8 p.m. Sunday in a parking lot in the 15200 block of Parthenia
Street, Moss said. He died early Monday at Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses saw four males run from the scene, police said. Moss
said the victim, whose name was withheld until relatives could be
notified, is a known gang member.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 11, George Pajuelo, a 21-year-old gang member from Van
Nuys, was shot and killed behind a strip mall directly across the
street from Sunday's shooting, Moss said. A bystander was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that same day, the bullet-riddled body of Jacqueline
Osterman, 54, of North Hills was found three blocks away in the 8900
block of Columbus Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   And nearby on Jan. 8, Joel Christopher Walker, 20, of Central Los
Angeles was fatally shot in the 15800 block of Rayen Street.</TE>

<DH>Holiday: Speeches offer tributes to Rosa Parks and
Sojourner Truth at King Day event in Oxnard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kalisha Crone and Vera Vanderkraan both daydream about going to
college and enjoy debating American history. In the spirit of
competition, the two seventh-graders also love a good fight.</LD>
<LD>   It was only fitting, then, that the Oxnard girls were chosen
co-winners of a speech contest in which top prize was a chance to
address hundreds of people who attended the city's Martin Luther King
Jr. Day celebration Monday, one of several held across Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   "These two girls are wonderful. They personified the essence of
our competition and their topics were excellent," said Iva Jeffreys,
a member of the local group that began the city event 16 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   After brief comments by area leaders and a rendition of "Lift
Every Voice and Sing," 13-year-old Kalisha went to the podium and
placed a brown felt hat on her head.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly and eloquently, as she looked out at the cavernous concert
hall, Kalisha retold the story of how Rosa Parks refused to give up
her bus seat to a white man on Dec. 1, 1955.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a long day and I'm tired," Kalisha quoted the now
88-year-old Parks as saying that day in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   She described how Parks was jailed and given a $14 fine, and she
spoke of King's yearlong bus boycott in response to the arrest, along
with his history-making rallies against segregation in schools,
hotels and restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about being equal in all ways," Kalisha said.</TE>
<TE>   One of two winners of the annual African American Speech
Exposition, held by the local chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha
sorority, Kalisha said she was inspired by her mother and motivated
by her two older sisters, who are both in college.</TE>
<TE>   Kalisha's mom, Cheryl, portrayed Parks in presentations during
Black History Month at Junipero Serra School in Ventura in the early
1990s. Then 3, Kalisha would sit on a teacher's lap, enchanted as her
mom spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was sort of embedded in her since then," Cheryl Crone
said.</TE>
<TE>   For 12-year-old Vera, who wants to be a genetic engineer and
enjoys creative writing and poetry, enrolling in the speech contest
was her first response when she didn't win the competition a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my motivation," she said. "I felt like I had made it to
second base that first time, and I really wanted a home run."</TE>
<TE>   Using history books and Internet articles, Vera wrote a
first-person speech about Sojourner Truth, a New York slave from the
early 19th century who traveled the country preaching about women's
rights and the abolition of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when she talked about how her religion and her
son and certain other things in life had failed her," Vera said. "And
what I did was try and draw on things that I felt I had struggled
with, in school and life and such."</TE>
<TE>   Vera followed Kalisha during the celebration and came to the dais
wearing a white robe and head wrap, reminiscent of what Truth might
have worn.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke about Truth's emancipation under the New York State
Antislavery Act of 1827, and her successful struggle to reclaim her
son after he was taken from her.</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of the first black women to win a case against a
white man," she told the audience.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of her presentation, choosing words that echoed King's
philosophies and dreams, Vera said, "When you know something is
wrong, make it right."</TE>

<HD>Future of Land, Reservoirs at Stake in PG&amp;E Battle</HD>
<DH>Utilities: State, others object to plan to transfer
hydroelectric network to subsidiaries, citing a fear of environmental
harm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The most coveted chess piece in the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
bankruptcy is a multibillion-dollar system of hydroelectric
facilities and real estate stretching from Mt. Shasta to Bakersfield
and from the Sierra to the coast.</LD>
<LD>   With 273 dams and reservoirs, 68 powerhouses and almost 140,000
acres of land, this is considered the largest privately held
hydroelectric network in the country.</LD>
<LD>   And now this system that harnesses the power of major rivers also
is a central flash point in the battle over whether PG&amp;E will be able
to preempt state laws to achieve its plan for repaying $13 billion in
debts and restoring its financial viability.</LD>
<TE>   PG&amp;E wants to move these assets, along with its nuclear power
plants, into new California-based subsidiaries of its parent company,
PG&amp;E Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposal has environmentalists and state officials
flocking to court, because it would transfer some of the state's most
sensitive land holdings and important generation facilities without
either state environmental review or the permission of the Public
Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Although some opponents praise PG&amp;E's long stewardship of its vast
holdings, they say the transfer would not be in the public interest
and would open the door to harmful development and logging. And they
allege the plan is a backdoor way to accomplish the transfer of hydro
facilities that PG&amp;E could not achieve through the PUC and the
Legislature in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Federal bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has scheduled a hearing
for Friday on this and other PG&amp;E proposals to preempt state laws and
regulations. The outcome could make or break PG&amp;E's plan for
reorganizing the company and emerging from Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   The hydroelectric system was developed over the last century by
the giant utility, which retreated to Bankruptcy Court last April to
keep thousands of creditors at bay. The system generates about 15% of
the power used by PG&amp;E's Northern and Central California customers,
and makes PG&amp;E one of the state's largest landowners. The facilities
and watershed have been valued at $2.7 billion to $4.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman John Nelson said PG&amp;E wants to move the assets
out of the utility so that it can leverage them to pay its debts
without a rate increase or a state bailout.</TE>
<TE>   He said PUC rules for utilities prevent the company from borrowing
sufficient funds on the assets, so it wants to shift them to federal
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E said in a recent court filing that "there are no plans to
change the management of the lands ... or to dispose of such lands."
And it promised its operations will be "consistent with sound
environmental stewardship policies."</TE>
<TE>   But government agencies and environmentalists are concerned that
PG&amp;E's plan would create a serious regulatory gap, increasing
development pressures and weakening protections for fisheries,
old-growth forests, endangered species and public access.</TE>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E takes the position that they do not have to get PUC approval
to transfer the assets," said Irving Sulmeyer, who is representing
several counties in Bankruptcy Court. "Therefore, there is no one ...
enforcing the California Environmental Quality Act."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office said the PG&amp;E plan would have
"devastating" effects on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC historically has provided PG&amp;E with financial incentives
to manage the hydroelectric facilities and the lands "at stewardship
levels higher than the minimum legal standards," the attorney general
said in a court filing. "This meant trees did not have to be cut
aggressively, land did not need to be developed, and powerhouses did
not have to be run at their maximum capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo County is
licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but rates from power
produced there are set by the state PUC. Rates for PG&amp;E's
hydroelectric power are set by the PUC too.</TE>
<TE>   Under the utility's proposal, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission in Washington would take over rate-setting and other
regulatory functions--an action the PUC says would result in less
protection for California consumers and PG&amp;E's land.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is to say that a timber company won't come to town in a year
and want to buy it," said Brian Hermann, a New York bankruptcy lawyer
hired by the PUC. "What would FERC care about that?"</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E "offers only vague promises of continued environmental
stewardship in lieu of the concrete assurances provided by ongoing
PUC oversight and cost of service regulation," said court documents
filed by Environmental Defense, a 300,000-member nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is concerned that most of the PG&amp;E watershed
lands, including waterfowl habitat, will be placed under a new
subsidiary called Land Holdings LLC and later developed.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Low said the fears are unfounded. "The company
has more than a 100-year history in operating the hydro facilities,"
he said. "And under the plan of reorganization, we will continue to
operate in the same environmentally safe way."</TE>
<TE>   Low said any future development by the new land holding company
could be subject to California Environmental Quality Act reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking for a lifetime exemption," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, state Resources Secretary Mary D. Nichols said, "We lose
comprehensive state review over much larger pieces of land and the
ability to help the company maintain a higher level of stewardship
than will occur once they are thrown into the free market."</TE>
<TE>   During the last few years, PG&amp;E has tried to transfer its
hydroelectric assets. But the company met resistance from the PUC,
environmentalists and others, and those efforts stalled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the company asked the PUC for permission to split its
hydroelectric system into up to 20 "bundles" of lots and to auction
them to the highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   A draft environmental impact report commissioned by the PUC found
in 2000 that the most likely buyers would have a strong financial
incentive to operate the facilities at higher rates, altering stream
flows and harming fisheries. PG&amp;E disputed many of the conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E officials said removing the hydroelectric facilities from PUC
oversight would "harmonize" the utility's generation facilities under
federal regulation and complete the sell-off of power plants that
began under the state's deregulation plan several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The PG&amp;E Corp. subsidiary that controls generation assets would
enter into a 12-year contract with the utility, which officials say
is designed to provide reasonably priced power with no rate increase.</TE>
<TE>   In opposing PG&amp;E's reorganization plan, the PUC has argued that
state law adopted during the energy crisis bars the transfer or sale
of the hydroelectric facilities until 2006, so that power from the
facilities is available to Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, PG&amp;E filed a $4-billion claim against the state,
alleging that the state breached its obligations to allow PG&amp;E to
shift these generation facilities to federal regulation and sell the
power at higher market rates.</TE>

<HD>Rubin Eyeing Developments in Prayer Case</HD>
<DH>Burbank: A legal fight began after the suspect in a bomb
plot heard a Christian invocation preceding a 1999 City Council
meeting.</DH>

<LD>Suspected terrorist Irv Rubin has changed the way they pray in
Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   A significant legal fight is brewing between the foothill
community and Rubin, one of two militant Jewish Defense League
leaders whom a federal grand jury indicted this month on charges of
plotting to bomb a Culver City mosque and a congressman's office.</LD>
<LD>   The legal dispute, unrelated to that case, has to do with prayer
at City Council meetings. It arose during a meeting in November 1999,
when a minister delivered a prayer invoking the name of Jesus Christ.
Rubin filed a lawsuit alleging that the religious reference was
unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, a Los Angeles trial judge ruling in that case ordered
Burbank to stop sectarian prayer--that which reflects a specific
religion's beliefs--before council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the council has begun each meeting with a
nondenominational invocation. In addition, the agenda now warns that
sectarian prayer has been deemed unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank officials are complying with the court's judgment while
they appeal the ruling. But they say they cannot legally censor the
viewpoint of the clergy who volunteer to lead the invocation,
including those who call on Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's a free-speech issue," Mayor Bob Kramer said. "When a
minister or a rabbi comes to a meeting, is it our job to tell them
how to pray?"</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that the case raises important constitutional
questions. Burbank leaders say the issue is free speech. Rubin,
co-plaintiff Roberto Alejandro Gandara--who is Christian--and their
attorney Roger Jon Diamond, however, say that invoking Christ's name
in prayer at a council meeting shows a preference for one religion
over another and violates the Constitution's prohibition against the
establishment of religion.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing date in the 2nd District Court of Appeal has not been
set.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike school prayer cases, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983 cited
tradition in upholding the constitutionality of an opening invocation
at legislative sessions. The case, Marsh vs. Chambers, is the only
one on legislative prayer to come before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The court distinguished between school and legislative prayer,
saying that adult lawmakers are less susceptible to religious
indoctrination or peer pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But Rubin and Burbank officials disagree over whether the Supreme
Court decision addressed the type of prayer allowed, or whether it
had to be nondenominational.</TE>
<TE>   He contends that it bars sectarian prayer. Burbank officials say
it permits all prayer as long as it doesn't proselytize or advance or
disparage a religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Burbank seems to be litigating over its ability to say a
Christian prayer," USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said. "If
there is prayer, I think it's important that it be secular prayer."</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank Human Relations Council agreed, encouraging the City
Council to uphold the local judge's order because nondenominational
prayers allow people of all faiths to say "amen."</TE>
<TE>   Following a tradition that began in 1953, members of the Burbank
Ministerial Assn. have volunteered to deliver prayers at the council
meetings. Before the court ruling, about 20% mentioned Christ in
their prayers, according to testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   It was David King's turn Nov. 23, 1999. The Mormon bishop led a
67-second prayer ending with "in the name of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   "When people pray, they should pray in the manner they're
accustomed to" whether they adhere to a Christian, Jewish, Muslim or
other faith, King said. "It's about tolerance. The sincerity of the
prayer is what's important."</TE>
<TE>   He's still baffled by the uproar over his prayer. "Nobody
complained before," King said. "But look at who's raising the
objection. I don't have to tell you about Irv Rubin."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin attended the council meeting to oppose Burbank Airport
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   After a judge ruled in his favor, Rubin told The Times, "Sectarian
prayer elevates one religion over another."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin did not seek monetary damages, Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, some members of the ministerial association have
declined to lead the invocation, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin has followed the appeals process while confined in the Los
Angeles federal detention center awaiting his arraignment today, his
attorney added.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the prayer case runs the gamut. The atheist Council
for Secular Humanism has asked the appellate court to ban all prayer
at government forums.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that just as non-Christians may feel alienated by
Christian prayer, atheists will seem like outsiders when a generic
prayer is offered.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for 34 California cities that begin their meetings
with prayer said the court-imposed resolution is unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge requires each member of the City Council to parse the
content of a particular prayer" to determine if it is secular, T.
Peter Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh predicts that the trial court
decision will be overturned. He said the test should not be whether
the prayer is sectarian.</TE>
<TE>   It is "a difficult distinction" for lawmakers to apply, Volokh
said, and "courts traditionally are reluctant to get into that."</TE>

<HD>Jailed Jewish Militant Protector or Terrorist?</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Bomb-plot suspect Irv Rubin has been denounced
by many, but some say he's a defender of his people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, Irv Rubin has been getting into people's faces, drowning
out their speeches with shouting, picketing their meetings. A tall,
beefy man with a voice that carries, he frequently uses a bullhorn to
make it carry farther. Often, too, when shouting fails, he shoves and
punches.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin, 56, learned his combative ways early, fighting name-callers
on the streets of Montreal. Later, he found a home in the radical
Jewish Defense League, which he joined a few years after its founding
by a New York rabbi, Meir Kahane, in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1985, Rubin has been national chairman of the JDL, a group
whose message has always been militant. Its motto "Never Again"
refers to the Holocaust. To prevent another one, Kahane and his
followers argued, Jews must be armed and ready to defend themselves
by any means necessary. Hence the group's slogans: "For every Jew a
.22," and "Keep Jews Alive with a .45."</LD>
<TE>   Now, Rubin finds himself behind bars. He and fellow JDL member
Earl Krugel will be arraigned today on charges of plotting to bomb
the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and a field office of Lebanese
American Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista). Both Rubin and Krugel are
expected to plead not guilty. Federal authorities, who have tried to
connect Rubin with violent attacks in the past, accuse him of
conspiring to commit the same sort of terrorist acts for which he has
long blamed--and reviled--others.</TE>
<TE>   He was isolated long before his arrest, denounced by Jewish
leaders all over the country as representing no one.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's lawyers declined requests for him to be interviewed at the
federal detention center, where he's been held in solitary
confinement since his Dec. 11 arrest, and he has been denied bail.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Shelley, who spoke on his behalf, said that Rubin's
belligerent manner helps him reach his objectives--but that her
husband of 21 years, the father of her two sons, is a decent,
innocent man who drops everything to donate blood and risks crashing
his car to rescue stray animals on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have a gruff exterior, but people who know Irv know he's a
lover, not a fighter," she said, adding, "but on the outside, he's a
fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Waging a Fight</TE>
<TE>   on a Shoestring</TE>
<TE>   He does his fighting on a shoestring budget. He lives in a
Monrovia condo for which he pays no rent because it's part of a
family trust. He doesn't work--except occasionally, serving legal
papers. His wife says he sometimes gets paid to give speeches. Mostly
though, he and his family live off checks from his wife's mother.
Their sons, ages 12 and 20, don't have health insurance. His wife
canceled the newspapers he reads to save money after he was arrested.
They're asking for donations to pay Rubin's legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   Membership dues and donations to the JDL pay for Rubin's protests,
his wife said. A neighbor said he regularly sees Rubin drive home in
donated cars, which he then sells.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one way or another, he frequently makes his way around the
country--to show up as the lone opening day protester outside the
Holy Land Experience, a Christian theme park in Orlando, Fla., run by
a Jew bent on converting people to Jesus, or to plant himself outside
the compound of the Aryan Nations in Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   In Orlando and other places, leaders of local Jewish organizations
say his protests simply draw attention to things best ignored or
dealt with more diplomatically.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting words of the JDL set it apart from other Jewish
organizations, as has the JDL's view of itself--as the only group
with the guts to do whatever it takes to protect Jews. At local
Jewish festivals, Rubin and other JDL members often hand out
leaflets, urging Jews to support them and not the mainstream
Anti-Defamation League, a much older group with a similar abbreviated
name.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that he's spent half his career harassing other
Jews," said David Lehrer, who until recently was the longtime western
regional director of the ADL.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1978 news conference, Rubin offered a $500 reward to anyone
who "kills, maims or seriously injures" a member of the American Nazi
Party--an offer which prompted solicitation of murder charges that
were dismissed years later.</TE>
<TE>   On the JDL Web site, he proudly displays video footage of a brawl
he got into with Ku Klux Klansmen on the Jerry Springer show.
Proudly, too, Rubin says he's lost count of his arrests, which number
more than 40.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, federal authorities named Rubin a suspect in the bombing
death of Alex Odeh, regional director of the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, in his office in Santa Ana. Rubin was
never charged and denied involvement. But he publicly celebrated
Odeh's murder, which remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he's pushed buttons.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1999 shooting at the Jewish Community Center in Granada
Hills, thousands came together to speak out against violence. But
Rubin, who interrupted Gov. Gray Davis' speech with shouts, had a
different message--against gun control and in favor of armed
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the Aryan Nations. It was Irv Rubin, screaming like a
maniac. . . . It was disgusting," Lehrer said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kahane, who left the organization in the 1980s and was
assassinated in 1990, the JDL was very vocal and growing. Its main
cause was fighting Soviet mistreatment of Jews. Shelley Rubin
contends that there are still thousands of members in JDL chapters
across the country and around the world. But federal authorities say
the group's strength long ago dwindled to perhaps a few dozen
members.</TE>
<TE>   Without the cause of Soviet Jewry, "there's no there there," added
Lehrer.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, one of many local
leaders who describe Rubin as the fringe of the fringe, said, "There
are more teams in the American League than there are members of the
Jewish Defense League."</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Rubin said the small turnouts at her husband's protests
signify nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's learned you don't need to have a whole mass of people
demonstrating," she said. "If there's a problem, he knows how to draw
attention to that problem. He has refined the method of
demonstrating."</TE>
<TE>   Refined is not the word Yaroslavsky uses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in a situation before where Irv and the Krugel boys
would get into shoving matches with other Jews," he said, referring
to Earl and twin brother Barry Krugel, 59. Yaroslavsky added that he
once decided not to bring up gun control when speaking at Studio
City's Temple Beth Hillel because Rubin was in the audience. So were
a lot of senior citizens, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets into fisticuffs with people nearly twice his age. I've
seen it with my own eyes," said Yaroslavsky, who was in college when
he first met Rubin. "I'd like to think that in his early days, Irv's
heart was in the right place. But I think they all have a certain
fascistic streak to them. If you don't agree with them, you get
punched in the nose. There's no room for dissent, no room for another
point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Diane Jacobs, 80, of Beverly Hills, sees it differently. A
Holocaust survivor who worked in the resistance and whose entire
family was killed by the Nazis, she has known Rubin since the 1970s.
Like him, she has little good to say about Arabs. Someone has to take
a stand, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "His message is stand up. Stand up and don't take any garbage from
anybody. Don't take garbage from the bigots. Stand up for yourself,"
she said. "A lot of Jews, they think they're supposed to turn the
other cheek, to just roll over. Honey, if I had done that back in
Germany, I'd be 6 feet under with the rest of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said she's seen Rubin clean up desecrated synagogues and
Jewish cemeteries. She applauds his style of protest, even the
shouting.</TE>
<TE>   "The law says we have freedom of speech. Nobody said anything
about freedom of hearing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubins are against the Middle East peace process and want the
Palestinians out of Israel, said Shelley Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   "Irv has always said that he would like all the Palestinians to
come here to live and let Israel be Israel. He doesn't have anti-Arab
feelings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I will not try to hide the fact from you that we feel very
threatened by the spread of Islam in this country. We believe that
there's an Islam that they don't want you to know about, and that any
religion that says that Jews are a lowly people who have to be
subjugated and humiliated, we've got a problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone conversation, she later expanded on those thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "We see that the Muslims are trying to take over the country.
That's what they do. They take over a place and then they want to put
their own laws into effect."</TE>
<TE>   JDL Included on</TE>
<TE>   List of Hate Groups</TE>
<TE>   Such rhetoric is the reason that Brian Levin, director of the
Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San
Bernardino, put the JDL logo--a fist and a star--on his list of
hate-group graphics.</TE>
<TE>   That decision prompted Rubin to contact him repeatedly in April
and May of last year, Levin said. At first, Rubin calmly tried to
argue that the JDL wasn't a hate group. When Levin didn't buy that,
Rubin "got extremely combative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to swear off violence, one of the requirements for
removal from the hate list, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a lot of the other extremists I study. He has a very
narrow world view, very rigid," said Levin, a former New York
policeman, who is Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   "People like me, he's already written off. I'm as bad as the rest
of the world. In the end, he called me a lousy Jew, the same kind of
sellout Jew who was responsible for the Holocaust," said Levin, whose
father was a prisoner of war in Hitler's Germany. Shelley Rubin said
her husband, whose working-class family came to Southern California
from Montreal when he was 15, readied himself for his cause as a
child "living in the shadow of the Holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   "Irv was a little boy and someone called him a dirty Jew. He must
have been 6 or 7," she said. "He ran home crying and his mother said,
'Oh no, you go back and you fight.' "</TE>
<TE>   The fighting spirit of the JDL attracted Shelley Rubin when she
was a teenager in the San Gabriel Valley. In a scrapbook she kept,
she pasted stories about the JDL's campaign for Soviet Jews. She
admired Rubin from afar, she said. They met when she joined the JDL
in 1979 and were married a year later.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Shelley Rubin worked briefly as a writer and editor
for the B'nai B'rith Messenger, she said. Now, she works behind the
scenes for the JDL, organizing and writing much of the content on the
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   When the FBI searched Rubin's home Dec. 12, even she was surprised
by Rubin's arsenal, she said. Agents found eight guns in the Rubins'
bedroom. All were licensed and kept in cases, she said--but she'd
only known about one. FBI officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI alleges that Rubin chose the mosque and Issa's office as
bombing targets and that he decided when the bombings would take
place. According to the FBI complaint, Rubin spoke of letting people
know that the JDL was active in a militant way.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about the indictment, which is based on FBI surveillance
tapes of a JDL member-turned-informant, Shelley Rubin sees another
plot--hatched by people who have long wanted to silence her husband.
She angrily speaks about Lehrer for speaking out so quickly against
Rubin after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband has devoted his life to protecting his people, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would rather not do it. He would rather there be no need for
the JDL. But if Irv Rubin's not doing it, who is going to?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He learned the lesson of the Holocaust, that you have to fight
back. That's what he does. But these charges are so wrong, so out of
character."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach Police Department on Monday defended its fatal
shooting of a 57-year-old woman who allegedly had left a market
without paying for groceries, then raised an 8-inch knife at police.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting occurred Saturday morning after officers followed the
woman from the corner of 5th Street and Pine Avenue for "an entire
city block," a department spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers repeatedly ordered the woman to stop and to drop the
knife as they followed her toward the Pine Avenue restaurant
district.</LD>
<TE>   The woman, identified as Marcella Byrd, a resident of a downtown
seniors apartment complex, was shot first with pellet-filled
miniature bean bags, which the department calls "less lethals."</TE>
<TE>   But the bean bags, fired after officers repeatedly demanded that
she drop the knife and called in a supervisor, did not deter Byrd,
who weighed about 300 pounds, said Sgt. Steve Filipini, a department
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Normal folks, the reasonable person, does not display a knife
when law enforcement arrives at the scene," Filipini said. The
projectile bean bags "seemed to have little impact, they just made
her more infuriated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Byrd raised the knife up in a throwing position, "officers,
fearing for their safety, were forced to shoot the woman with their
duty weapons. She was struck several times in the torso," according
to a department statement.</TE>
<TE>   Officers treated her immediately and Long Beach Fire Department
paramedics took her to a local hospital, where she died about 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting is under investigation by the Los Angeles County
coroner's office, the district attorney's office and the Long Beach
Police Department, as is routine with officer-involved shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, who was African American, is the second knife-wielding woman
since June to be shot by Long Beach officers.</TE>
<TE>   On June 20, officers called to a domestic fight at the home of an
agitated Glenda Lee Reymer, 52, fired projectiles at her as she
raised a knife, department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Blunt force to the chest, the coroner said, killed the 100-pound
woman, whose boyfriend said he warned police that she had been
physically and mentally troubled.</TE>
<TE>   At 11 a.m. Saturday, officers were called to Top Value Market on
Pacific Avenue, where Byrd allegedly struggled with the manager. When
he saw her knife, police said, he backed off and officers located her
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Royce Esters, president of the National Assn. for Equal Justice in
America, a Compton-based watchdog group that has sponsored town halls
for federal and local law enforcement agencies, vowed Monday to
request a federal probe into the two police shootings and to seek
more police mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman with a knife couldn't be tackled by 10 officers?" he
said. "Why couldn't someone sit there and talk to her, for 50 hours
if necessary? It's a life."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Much-needed renovations at the four oldest high schools in Oxnard and
Camarillo will begin as early as this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard Union High School District leaders this week approved a
$16.5-million plan to upgrade facilities at Adolfo Camarillo,
Hueneme, Channel Islands and Rio Mesa high schools.</LD>
<LD>   All four campuses will get new restrooms by next fall. Major
improvements to wiring and plumbing systems will begin immediately at
Camarillo High--the district's oldest school--while the same upgrades
at the other schools will be put off for two years.</LD>
<TE>   The modernization projects were approved in 1999, but the state
ran out of money after officials had promised to fund 80% of the
work. New state school bonds are expected to go before voters in
November and in 2004 and 2006.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six years the district has built two new high schools,
both in Oxnard. The $33-million renovated Oxnard High opened in 1995,
and the $53-million Pacifica High opened last fall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials with Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County are seeking
civic organizations, foundations, companies and individuals
interested in sponsoring the construction of houses for needy
families.</LD>
<LD>   The average cost of a Habitat for Humanity house is about $75,000,
and interested parties can make a full donation, or partial donation
of at least $10,000.</LD>
<LD>   So far, the nonprofit group has provided homes for 23 families in
the county and built an entire housing development in Piru. Officials
hope to add nine more homes in the Piru area.</LD>
<TE>   Land donation and volunteers to build the homes have been steady,
but more sponsors are needed if the group is to meet its goal of
constructing at least seven homes annually.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call 485-6065 or e-mail the group at info@

<HD>Santa Maria Valley Feeling Left Out After AAA Snub</HD>
<DH>Tourism: The area and its attractions aren't even mentioned
in new Auto Club publication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SANTA MARIA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Somewhere between the red tile roofs of Santa Barbara and the white
sands of Pismo Beach, a chunk of the Central Coast appears to have
vanished.</LD>
<LD>   The growing city of Santa Maria? Gone. Vandenberg Air Force Base?
Invisible. The Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Preserve? Good question.</LD>
<LD>   According to the newest guidebook from the Automobile Club of
Southern California, the entire Santa Maria Valley, with 120,000
residents, dozens of hotels and restaurants, nationally known
wineries and barbecue, an airport, an Amtrak stop--and, yes, an Auto
Club office--doesn't exist.</LD>
<TE>   This came as a surprise to Karen White, a reporter for the Santa
Maria Times. When a review copy of "California's Central Coast: Where
to Go--From Locals Who Know" landed on her desk this week, White
thumbed through the book and laughed out loud.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Let's see how they cover us,' and discovered we're
not even on the map," White said. "Not Santa Maria, Guadalupe, Los
Alamos or Nipomo. It was too absurd to believe."</TE>
<TE>   The local Chamber of Commerce, many of whose members offer AAA
discounts, called the Auto Club for answers. Auto Club officials
offered explanations and a promise to do better next time.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike AAA's tour books, which are free to members, the Central
Coast guide is one of a series of books sold in California
bookstores. Launched in 1993 as a freebie, it soon became clear that
the guides would have to generate income to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're putting out a book that has to pay for itself, you
wind up having to make some agonizing decisions about what goes in
and what doesn't," said Jeff Spring, a spokesman for the Automobile
Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   AAA hasn't turned a cold shoulder to the Santa Maria Valley. The
region has been featured in half a dozen other AAA publications,
spotlighting the area's vineyards and barbecue spots.</TE>
<TE>   Editors of the Central Coast guide considered the pros and cons of
every entry, Spring said. Their decision to skip the Santa Maria
Valley was influenced, in part, by Auto Club members.</TE>
<TE>   "People with four days to visit the Central Coast ask for details
about Santa Barbara rather than Santa Maria," Spring said. "It's a
decision that was made to stay competitive, and I'm sure that it will
be revisited."</TE>
<TE>   Which is good news to Bob Hatch, president of the Santa Maria
Chamber of Commerce. With tourism bringing about $10 million a year
to the region, being left out of a well-respected guidebook can hurt,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "AAA is a prestigious name and it has to have some effect," Hatch
said. "We'll never know who may have looked at us in that particular
book and decided to visit. According to them, we're not here."</TE>
<TE>   Among the missing sites and sights are the town of Los Alamos,
with its ancient oaks, affordable antique shops and low-key cafes;
Guadalupe, a picture postcard of mid-century bungalows, quaint
downtown and a train station where Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner stops;
and the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Preserve, an 18-mile stretch of
coastal dunes estimated to be 18,000 years old and home to 200
species of birds.</TE>
<TE>   Also absent is the Foxen Canyon wine trail, a country road lined
with world-class vineyards that draw thousands of visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as amazed as anyone that they would leave us out," said
Richard Dore, an owner of Foxen Vineyard. "Considering the size of
the city and the number of famous wineries in this area, it seems a
book claiming to know the region would at least put us on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the local wineries count on drop-in traffic for their
tasting rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "If people don't know there's a city and places to stay while they
explore the area, it has to affect us," Dore said.</TE>
<TE>   Amber Williams, a spokeswoman for Cambria Vineyards, shares Dore's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder what the effect is, to be left out of a
publication like that," Williams said. "It's got to hurt a bit,
financially.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, though, once people stop at some of the places the book
does actually mention, they'll realize there's more to the area than
they knew. Maybe they'll find us anyway."</TE>

<LD>The crash of a private aircraft in Baja California over the weekend
claimed the life of a former aerospace executive who once headed
space shuttle operations for Rockwell International Corp.</LD>
<LD>   La Palma resident Richard E. Thomas, 69, and his flying partner,
Andir Rizk Maroun, 55, were killed Friday when their aircraft crashed
while trying to land in Punta Pescadero, a fishing village near La
Paz, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Mexican
news agency Notimex and friends.</LD>
<LD>   The men, flying in Maroun's home-built Cozy airplane, took off
from Chino on Friday morning and stopped in Loreto, Mexico, before
departing for Punta Pescadero. Friends said the plane, piloted by
Maroun, encountered wind gusts on approach and then slammed into a
wall at the landing strip.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas, who retired in 1996, spent five decades working on the
country's space program, first as an engineer on the Apollo missions
and then as point man for the space shuttle program.</TE>
<TE>   During countdowns at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, it was
Thomas, standing amid staff members in the control room, who gave the
launch go-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was known as a detail-oriented engineer with exceptional
people skills. Colleagues said he was the ideal man to head the
shuttle program.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a chief engineer in building something as complex as an
Apollo vehicle or shuttle you must be able to talk with people in
different technical fields," said colleague and friend Ben Boykin.
"You don't have to be an expert in all the fields, but smart enough
so that they can't snow you."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is survived by his wife, Eva Beth.</TE>

<LD>He was so devoted to Old Glory that he has been dubbed Old Glorious.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas "Ski" Demski, who owned the world's largest flag, according
to the Guinness Book of World Records, and also had the Stars and
Stripes tattooed on his torso, painted on his house and flying from
the 132-foot flagpole in his frontyard, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Demski, a disabled coal miner and construction worker and
recovering alcoholic who supported himself by making Mylar bumper
stickers touting 12-step programs to combat addiction, died Saturday
at his Long Beach duplex.</LD>
<TE>   No specific cause of death was known, but Demski had undergone
multiple bypass surgery; suffered from heart disease, diabetes and
gangrene; and told a Times columnist Dec. 30 that "I'm just waiting
to roll over and die."</TE>
<TE>   Super Flag, as Demski called his largest version of Old Glory,
made specifically to capture the Guinness designation, cost $80,000,
weighs 3,000 pounds and measures 255 feet by 505 feet. It was
inaugurated on June 14--Flag Day--1992 when it was unfurled on the
grounds of the Washington Monument.</TE>
<TE>   The giant national banner also was displayed at Hoover Dam as the
Olympic torch was carried across in 1996. Winds ripped it in three
places during that outing, including one 90-foot gash. The repairs,
made by a Huntington Beach sail and boat cover company in a blimp
hangar at the Tustin Marine base, cost $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat sadly, Demski recently put Super Flag on the market for
$100,000, worried that it had not been flown frequently enough.</TE>
<TE>   But he owned many, many more. Demski followed Super Flag Jr.--a
mere 47 feet by 82 feet--down Pennsylvania Avenue in the nation's
capital a year ago as the only official California entry in the
inaugural parade for President George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-pound banner, which Demski had made in 1981 to salute the
return of American hostages from Iran, was carried aloft on 13 poles
held by 55 Navy ROTC cadets as another cadet pushed Demski's
wheelchair along the 1.8-mile parade route.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described political independent who repeatedly ran for Long
Beach mayor and City Council seats, Demski told The Times at the
inaugural, "Yes, I voted for Bush.... I'm just thrilled to death to
be representing California and with Super Flag Jr.''</TE>
<TE>   Demski and his giant flags gained newfound popularity across the
country after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Regularly borrowed for Super Bowls, college bowl games, other
sports events and veterans parades, the giant flags provided through
Demski's Super Flag company were snapped up to cover the field at
Dodger Stadium for the first home game and the Rose Bowl field for
UCLA's first football game after the disaster. In October, the ailing
Demski traveled to ground zero in New York to fly one of his giant
flags from a construction crane.</TE>
<TE>   Demand grew so much that the Web site www.superflag.com run by
Demski and his close friend, former Coast Guard commander Jim
Alexander, had to be expanded at considerable expense to them. Never
profitable, the enterprise cost plenty transporting the flags for
display.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11 led many Americans to embrace patriotism,
Demski said that in his two decades of owning and unfurling flags
across the country, he never had any flags vandalized.</TE>
<TE>   "The flag, I guess, is one thing everyone understands," he said in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Born and reared in Nanticoke, Pa., where he began working in the
coal mines as a teenager, Demski moved to Southern California in the
1970s. After a back injury disabled him from his construction job, he
found time for patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   Flags became Demski's raison d'etre about 1980 when he was driving
along the San Diego Freeway and saw a giant flag flying outside an
automobile dealership.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, that really looks good," he recalled. "I thought, why
not try that?"</TE>
<TE>   So he drove home and erected the $16,000, 132-foot
flagpole--designated The Pole in honor of his Polish heritage--and
began buying flags.</TE>
<TE>   As his hair whitened, he started playing Santa Claus at Christmas
and many years converted the flagpole into a giant Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   He also staged patriotic celebrations on Memorial Day, the Fourth
of July and other holidays, evolving into one of Long Beach's
best-known characters.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody loved Demski's preoccupation with flags in those
days. The Long Beach City Council tried to impose a height limit,
saying his flagpole was too tall for a residence. Demski countered by
proposing to replace it with a 300-foot pole. They let the existing
one stand.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor took him to court over the noise made by his giant flag
flapping through the night. His supporters rallied, and that
complaint also went glimmering.</TE>
<TE>   Demski did not stop with fabric flags. He painted flags on his
house, on his collection of hearses, trailers, a firetruck, and
inside his house on the walls, floor and light switches.</TE>
<TE>   When a tattoo artist suggested on a talk show that his heart
bypass surgery scar "would make a natural flagpole," Demski had flags
tattooed all over his torso, front and back. Just in case, he had his
doctors' phone numbers--one of them wrong--tattooed alongside the
flags.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to other squabbles, Demski tangled with authorities
about whether the flagpole could be designated a cemetery. When they
hooted "impossible," he sort of did it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic birds became as much of Demski's persona as flags over the
last 20 years--he had some two dozen at his death--and he interred a
couple of them, starting with his first parrot, Mike, in the pole.</TE>
<TE>   On St. Patrick's Day 1990, Demski also sealed into the pole the
ashes of a friend, Air Force Col. Clem Maloney.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder Demski himself planned to wind up in the
pole--specifically in the eagle at the top with the 4-foot
wingspan--no matter what government officials think about it.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, he staged a dress rehearsal for the wake
and funeral now due. He lay in a plexiglass, mirrored casket--the
better to display his round-the-torso tattoos--placed in his garage
while invited guests ate corned beef sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   He asked to be cremated and, once his ashes were ensconced in the
eagle, he directed the casket be donated as a coffee table for the
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Demski certainly believed his plan was all arranged, once telling
The Times that Long Beach Press-Telegram columnist Tom Hennessy had
promised him: "I'll have you in that pole before the city even knows
you're dead."</TE>
<TE>   Hennessy, who wrote one final column about Demski earlier this
month, also wrote his obituary, which appeared in the Long Beach
paper Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He described Demski's long-planned funeral and burial orders, but
made no personal commitment, noting only: "While funeral arrangements
have not yet been announced, they presumably will be along the lines
that Demski had planned." He said the decisions would likely be up to
Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Demski never married, had no children, and has no known survivors.</TE>

<HD>Orange County's Olympic Skater, 17, Everything but Icy</HD>
<DH>Sports: Sasha Cohen is suddenly famous, but she seems to
have both blades on the ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, Sasha Cohen was just another teenage girl taking her
twirls on Orange County ice rinks, her fan base grounded in the small
circle of local skating buffs.</LD>
<LD>   But suddenly, Sasha seems to be everywhere. She's carrying an
Olympic torch through San Diego. She's waving to an adoring crowd at
Staples Center. She's writing an online diary, just two clicks from a
Web site where fans can download Sasha screen savers.</LD>
<LD>   It's a month before the Olympics, and Sasha Cohen--the diminutive
Laguna Niguel figure skater who is considered a top contender for a
gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics--is spinning in her rise to
fame.</LD>
<TE>   "It's exciting," Sasha said during a recent practice. "But it's
not really reality. I'll just enjoy it while it's there."</TE>
<TE>   With fame come demands. The moment the 17-year-old is spotted
signing a fan's boot or notebook at the Aliso Viejo rink where she
trains, other aspiring skaters swarm around her, hoping for a
signature and her trademark seal: a heart.</TE>
<TE>   The avalanche of attention has been fun. She says she tries to be
a role model for younger skaters--working hard and enjoying the
limelight but keeping things in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of fun to be a role model," Sasha said. "It's also
inspiring to me."</TE>
<TE>   Even the youngest of her fans have faith that Sasha will bring
home the gold.</TE>
<TE>   "She's going to the Olympics, and she's going to get the gold
because she's good," said Amanda Gelb, who, at 4, has been skating
half her life. "I like the way she spins and twirls."</TE>
<TE>   Parents at the rink are buzzing too, chatting about Sasha's
"sweet" demeanor, "doll-like" appearance and strength on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz moved beyond Sasha's neighborhood when she dazzled crowds
at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships this month, clinching second
place after a yearlong absence with a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   One Toronto sports reporter said Sasha, at 5-foot-1 and 94 pounds,
"looked like a swan" and described her performance as "displaying the
magic that once belonged to [Michelle] Kwan." Other descriptions:
"boundless nerve," "daring and confident," "unmatched for speed and
spins" yet "nearly small enough to fit in one's hand."</TE>
<TE>   Since the U.S. championships, Sasha's coach, John Nicks, has been
so bombarded with requests for interviews and photo sessions with the
petite but powerful skater that he decided to arrange a special
practice performance. And it wasn't just sports reporters who
attended.</TE>
<TE>   Camera crews from NBC Sports and the Women's Entertainment Channel
program "Winning Women" taped Sasha as she danced on the ice, as
graceful and quick as a hummingbird, while a writer from Vogue
magazine--the bible of the fashion industry--checked out the unitard
Sasha designed herself.</TE>
<TE>   Sasha's mom, Galina Cohen, said her daughter seems largely
unaffected by the publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she's really aware of how far-reaching [her
popularity] is," Cohen said. "But she's always tried to be a good
role model. She's a very hard worker--she doesn't sit around
chatting. She makes the most out of every day."</TE>
<TE>   Sasha's openness to her fans has left an enduring impression.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a really sweet, sweet girl," said Annette Pumphrey, whose
7-year-old daughter, Kendal, takes lessons at the same rink where
Sasha trains.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Mah, 7, who also trains at the rink, can't stop talking
about Sasha. And since the U.S. championships, Lindsey has begged her
mom to take her to the rink at least once a day.</TE>
<TE>   "She has beautiful style," Lindsey said. "She's so graceful in her
skating."</TE>
<TE>   Sasha's fan base includes classmates at Aliso Niguel High School,
where she is a senior. The school is planning a pep rally to send
Sasha off to Salt Lake City. And then there are the formal fan clubs,
Web pages and online chat rooms devoted to all things Sasha.</TE>
<TE>   On a message board at www.figureskatersonline.com, fans chat about
Sasha's desire to be the first woman to land a quadruple salchow jump
in competition.</TE>
<TE>   Fans can't agree on exactly what defines Sasha's appeal. Some cite
her agility--she can spin with blurring speed and twirl on one leg
while extending the other unnaturally above her head.</TE>
<TE>   Others say it is the emotion of the performance. Her routines are
personal, as she chooses the music and, with Nicks, helps choreograph
her routines--a rarity among young skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Nicks, who has coached skaters to nine Olympics, can't pinpoint
his young skater's appeal, resorting to rattling off a list of
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "She designs most of her costumes, and she has a great degree of
input on much of what she does," he said. "She does have a stubborn
streak--she questions a lot of decisions I make, and I don't have a
problem with that, except when I don't have a logical answer. And
she's certainly a wonderful figure skater."</TE>
<TE>   Then he sums her up: "There's just something very special about
Sasha."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terrorism Plans Flower in Sacramento</HD>
<DH>Security: Gov. Davis, lawmakers have plenty of ideas,
though federal funding is a central theme to some.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>If the front line for defense of California against terrorism starts
with Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature, a potentially costly
arsenal of proposed new weapons has been unsheathed.</LD>
<LD>   So far, about one dozen terrorism-related bills have been
introduced, including a Davis budget that leans heavily on the
disputed expectation that the federal government will cover a
substantial chunk of California's anti-terrorism costs.</LD>
<LD>   "The horror of Sept. 11 is seared in our hearts and minds
forever," Davis told the Legislature in his State of the State speech
earlier this month. In calling for protections of the California
homeland, he repeated the date Sept. 11 at least 10 times.</LD>
<TE>   Davis' Wiretap Proposal</TE>
<TE>   Dealt Early Setback</TE>
<TE>   Legislative ideas abound. For starters, one bill would have
California motorists help finance the fight against terrorism and
display their patriotism at the same time by purchasing Sept. 11
memorial license plates at $50 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' proposed budget would vastly intensify California Highway
Patrol efforts to protect people and possible structural targets by
hiring 316 officers, acquiring five helicopters and buying other
enforcement tools at a cost of $89.5 million in federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   Other bills propose that local police, firefighters, hospitals and
other emergency agencies would receive hundreds of millions of
dollars in state aid from proposed bond issues or, in one measure
given little chance of passage, a full-cent increase in the statewide
sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plan formulated by Assembly Republicans, terrorists
convicted of planting biological or other weapons of mass destruction
at bridges or tunnels would face 25 years in prison. In another bill,
special care would be directed to the health needs of children in
case of a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   But for Democrat Davis, who is seeking a second term, the opening
round in the Legislature was a setback. His bill (AB 74) to give
local police and sheriffs the legal authority to conduct "roving"
taps of the e-mail and cell phone conversations of suspected
terrorists was aborted in the Assembly Public Safety Committee last
week.</TE>
<TE>   The author, Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount), stripped
the bill's controversial eavesdropping features when he was
confronted with an opinion from the Legislature's lawyer, who warned
that federal law prohibits states from conducting roaming wiretaps.</TE>
<TE>   Assistants said Davis would try to find another way to get at the
mobile electronic communications of suspected terrorists. But Senate
President pro tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said he does not
expect the Legislature to enact sweeping anti-terrorism laws this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, a liberal, argued that the federal government has mostly
preempted the arena of fighting terrorism, especially criminal acts.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's role is basically emergency response," Burton said,
dismissing as election-year posturing the introduction of Sept. 11
proposals that have little serious chance of becoming law.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is jumping in with stuff that is really irrelevant," he
said. "I think people see it as a good political issue. I'm against
terrorism and I haven't met anybody who is for terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate created a special committee, headed by Republican Sen.
Bruce McPherson of Santa Cruz, to analyze anti-terrorism actions the
U.S. government is taking and to offer proposals that would fill gaps
in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to [produce] something with immediacy attached to
it," McPherson said, noting that training emergency "responders" in
how to handle various kinds of terrorist attacks is a top priority
with officials of the state Office of Emergency Services. As a first
step, McPherson and Burton have introduced a bill (SB 1350) to train
instructors who, in turn, would train others in coping with potential
acts of mass destruction, such as bioterrorism. They said the
training probably could be done within existing budgets.</TE>
<TE>   However, no one knows the eventual price tag of protecting the
state. McPherson and others said the federal government appears to be
the most likely source of financial help.</TE>
<TE>   In his budget, Davis envisions a $1-billion infusion of federal
aid for California, including about $350 million for security-related
issues.</TE>
<TE>   But nonpartisan Legislative Budget Analyst Elizabeth Hill
cautioned against expecting the full amount. She did agree that some
federal aid would be forthcoming, but "it is unlikely to meet
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   One potential source of state income is a bill (AB 1759) by
Assembly Speaker-elect Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) that would create
a patriotic license plate. Sales of the $50 plates would help finance
anti-terrorism activities of state and local law enforcement
departments and provide college scholarships for spouses and
dependent children of Californians killed in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative aides estimate that the plates could bring in $4
million to $5 million a year, with law enforcement receiving 85% and
the rest going to the scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   The California bill is modeled on a Michigan program implemented a
month after the Sept. 11 attacks. That state's red, white and blue
plate includes the U.S. flag and the words "Proud to be an American."</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 plates were sold in the first month they were
available. The total now is more than 15,000, raising almost
$400,000, said Michigan Secretary of State Candice S. Miller, who
proposed the patriotic plate.</TE>
<TE>   Governor's Big Plans</TE>
<TE>   for Federal Funds</TE>
<TE>   Davis' budget envisions one of the biggest expansions of the CHP
ever, most of it paid for by the federal government. The addition of
316 officers would bring the total to about 7,000. The proposal also
would expand the patrol's air force by five helicopters at a cost of
about $3 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the governor wants $2.3 million to purchase
protective clothing for officers in case of a chemical or biological
attack, including nerve gas antidote kits.</TE>
<TE>   D.O. "Spike" Helmick, commissioner of the CHP, said about half of
the new officers would be assigned to inspect trucks for terrorist
materials at highway truck scales. Under the plan, these stations
would be upgraded from part-time truck weighing facilities to
permanent, round-the-clock centers for inspecting big rigs hauling
biological and chemical agents.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest potential mover of those kinds of products is
trucks," Helmick said.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>Terrorism Legislation</TE>
<TE>   At a glance, here is a sampling of terrorism-related legislation
that has been introduced in the Assembly and state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * Bonds: A $500,000 bond issue by Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los
Feliz) that would help pay for new equipment and other residentresidenthomeland
defenseearsears costs of city police, county sheriffs, fire departments,
trauma centers and public health departments. (AB 1815)</TE>
<TE>   * Children: By Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), directs the
California Environmental Protection Agency to help health care
providers, hospitals, schools and others prepare for possible
biological or chemical attack, and orders that children must get
proper medical care in case of attack, subject to receipt of federal
funds. (SB 1260)</TE>
<TE>   * Buildings: Earmarks proceeds from the sale of an unspecified
amount of bonds for the construction, acquisition, retrofitting or
repair of state and local government structures so they could
withstand an attack by terrorists. The bill is by Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City). (SB 1279)</TE>
<TE>   * Benefits: Makes retroactive to Sept. 11 newly increased
unemployment benefits for workers who lost their jobs as a result of
the terrorist attacks. By Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar). (SB 2X)</TE>
<TE>   * Remember: Designates each Sept. 11 as a Day of Remembrance and
Service in memory of people killed in the attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon and in the crash of a hijacked airliner in
Pennsylvania. By Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach). (AJR
127)</TE>
<TE>   * Money: Appeals to President Bush and Congress to provide U.S.
anti-terrorism funds to states and local governments. By
Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis). (AJR 31)</TE>

<HD>Simon Gets Jarvis Group's Nod, Promises to Veto Any Tax
Increase</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP gubernatorial hopeful, a distant third in
early polling, criticizes rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. said Monday he had won the
endorsement of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., and took swipes at
his two rivals for the Republican nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Simon criticized Secretary of State Bill Jones for supporting the
largest tax increase in California history and said former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan "has spoken disparagingly" of
Proposition 13, the 1978 property tax initiative most identified with
the Jarvis group.</LD>
<LD>   Simon also took a stand on future tax hikes. "I will make a pledge
today," he said. "I will veto any tax increase."</LD>
<TE>   Simon, a multimillionaire businessman who is the son of former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, has run a distant third in
early polling for the March 5 primary. He hopes to win over more
Republican voters at tonight's debate in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., said
Simon was an easy choice. "Bill Simon is a thoughtful and articulate
champion of the taxpayers," Coupal said at a Burbank news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh and Tony Russo, consultants for the Jones campaign,
minimized the significance of the endorsement. They suggested that
Simon won it because he agreed to buy a slot on the organization's
slate mailer, a common practice in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Coupal denied that the association has a mailer, even though the
Save Proposition 13 mailer advertises as "the ONLY Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer Assn. [Political Action Committee]-approved" mailer.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign denied any quid pro quo in the endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   The association did not back Riordan even though its former
president, Joel Fox, is policy director of the Riordan campaign.
Referring to an appearance in Oakland, Coupal said, "Mr. Riordan was
asked quite pointedly whether he would repeal Proposition 13 and then
he evaded the question. It was the kind of statement that gave us
very little comfort."</TE>
<TE>   At the event, when asked by a reporter if he would change the
initiative, Riordan replied, "You can't change Proposition 13. You'd
have to be insane to discuss it--like I am now."</TE>
<TE>   Simon criticized Jones for backing Gov. Pete Wilson's 1991 tax
increase--proposed to close the largest budget deficit in state
history--when in the California Assembly. Walsh said Jones was "being
a leader" when he did it.</TE>

<HD>Water Reclamation Project to Filter Drugs, Pathogens</HD>
<DH>Infrastructure: Under Orange County's $600-million plan,
extra levels of treatment will remove unmetabolized pills and potions
flushed down toilets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Orange County embarks on one of the nation's largest water
reclamation projects, local officials are taking steps to ensure that
in turning sewage into drinking water, all pathogens and any residue
of pharmaceutical drugs are eliminated.</LD>
<LD>   The county water district's ambitious $600-million plan will
thoroughly treat millions of gallons of sewage to kill viruses,
bacteria and other disease-causing agents. It also will subject
treated waste water to extra levels of treatment to ensure that the
cocktail of unmetabolized pills and potions flushed down area toilets
are neutralized.</LD>
<LD>   The extra measures for pharmaceutical drugs were included to
protect public health as well as to answer consumer concerns that
have scuttled similar reclamation projects elsewhere in Southern
California, Orange County water officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "Our ground water replenishment system will include
microfiltration, reverse osmosis and [ultraviolet] disinfection, and
that should handle any pharmaceutical compounds," said Ron
Wildermuth, spokesman for the Orange County Water District. "We're
very confident that [these technologies] can take the pharmaceuticals
out."</TE>
<TE>   Recycled water is used across the nation for various purposes,
from making newsprint to watering freeway landscaping to making snow
for ski slopes. In 2000, the State Water Resources Control Board
estimated that 401,910 acre-feet of reclaimed water was used in the
California. Nearly half is used to water crops.</TE>
<TE>   By turning sewage into beverage, Orange County will join a growing
number of communities across California that are trying to reduce
their dependency on pricey--and sometimes uncertain--imported water
by creating their own supply.</TE>
<TE>   In parts of Los Angeles County, the ground water has been
recharged for decades using treated waste water. Still, some recent
plans to turn sewage into drinking water have met considerable
opposition. In 1996, a plan to use treated waste water to replenish a
San Gabriel Valley aquifer had to be halved--and avoid a Miller
Brewing Co. plant--to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of contamination by pharmaceuticals and other chemicals
killed proposed reclamation projects elsewhere, including a
$100-million plan in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 90% of Antibiotics Enter Water Supply</TE>
<TE>   Local officials say their project, which will use highly treated
sewage to recharge the ground water, will use state-of-the-art
techniques that remove birth control pills, cholesterol-lowering
medication, antidepressants and other drugs that have become
mainstays of modern life.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are taking more antibiotics today than ever before. In
1998, physicians wrote 1.9 billion prescriptions, according to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Experts say that 30% to
90% of antibiotics administered to humans and animals are excreted.</TE>
<TE>   Sewage, which now is moderately treated and sent out to sea,
instead will be put through microfiltration, reverse osmosis and
ultraviolet light treatments at a Fountain Valley plant, a process
expected to result in cleaner water than what flows out of most
faucets now.</TE>
<TE>   Reverse osmosis, which forces water through membranes with tiny
pores, is a highly regarded form of treatment. Several scientists
said it can eliminate any trace of pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   That highly treated waste water then will be piped along the Santa
Ana River to holding ponds in Anaheim, where it will percolate into a
large aquifer. About two years later, the water will be pumped out of
the ground, chlorinated and sent to homes and businesses in the
northern and central parts of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no data indicating there's any known human health risk,"
said Greg Woodside, a researcher with the water district.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal opinion is that human exposure isn't really the issue
here," said Christian Daughton, chief of the environmental chemistry
branch at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National
Exposure Research Laboratory in Las Vegas. While the primary impact
is on marine life exposed to such pharmaceuticals in the aquatic
environment, Daughton said, "everything's interrelated. It's hard to
predict what the ramifications could be."</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that drugs already are getting into the
environment--a British study in the 1980s showed that there were more
than 170 drugs, from aspirin to morphine derivatives, flowing down
the River Lea in northwest London. Some scientists theorize that the
drugs may be contributing to declining sperm counts in parts of
Europe. Evidence of the impact on wildlife already is abundant.</TE>
<TE>   Anglers catching hermaphroditic fish led to some of the first
European studies, which found that excreted hormones from
birth-control pills feminized male rainbow trout in the United
Kingdom. A later study showed the same thing had happened to feral
carp in Lake Mead, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Prozac makes shellfish spawn too early, while another type of
antidepressant has the opposite effect, making them spawn too late.</TE>
<TE>   Sea squirts exposed to blood-pressure-lowering medication have
lower sperm counts.</TE>
<TE>   Water and sanitation officials are quick to point out that all
water is actually recycled water. The same water that flowed at the
time of the dinosaurs is sipped today.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County reclamation project just hastens the
transformation from waste water to drinking water. The project stems
from the county's water needs for a growing population as the state's
share of Colorado River water declines. By 2004, the first phase of
the project will create enough drinking water to serve 140,000
families of four for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents already drink treated sewage. The Santa
Ana River, which recharges the large aquifer that provides much of
the drinking water to northern and central ground water, is a mix of
treated sewage from Riverside and San Bernardino counties and dairy
and storm water runoff.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a study that began in 1994, the Orange County Water
District has tested the Santa Ana River water for pharmaceuticals.
Low levels of ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and estradiol were
found near a sewage treatment plant that discharges into the river
upstream. But testing downstream, before the river recharges the
ground water, found no detectable amounts. Stanford University
scientists theorize that the drugs degraded through natural processes
such as exposure to sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Research in Germany and Arizona, and by the Western Basin
Municipal District in Los Angeles County, indicates that reverse
osmosis removes pharmaceuticals down to undetectable levels.</TE>
<TE>   David Schubert, a researcher with the Salk Institute for
Biological Studies in La Jolla, said that although reverse osmosis is
a great treatment process, scientists still need to study whether
long-term exposure to minute levels of pharmaceuticals in the
environment poses a risk.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we depend on recycled water, the higher the exposure,"
Schubert said. "You have to be as careful as you can."</TE>

<LD>   3 Teens Injured When Car Slams Into Tree</LD>
<LD>   An unlicensed 16-year-old boy and two 17-year-old female
passengers were hospitalized Monday after the boy lost control of a
car and hit a tree, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The teens, whose names were not released, are all from Anaheim
Hills. Their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, said
Cpl. Thomas James of the Brea Police Department, which also patrols
Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   James said the boy was speeding south on Hidden Hills Road about
2:30 a.m. when the 1992 Toyota Camry spun out of control.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were filed pending an investigation, James said.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Is Burned Again</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Fiery attitude is not enough; he loses to
Safin, extending Grand Slam drought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The heckling spectator--a bloke, around here--was aired out by Pete
Sampras late in the second set. He exhorted the linesman on the
baseline to do his job. Chair umpire Jorge Dias got some attitude,
too.</LD>
<LD>   Even his opponent, Marat Safin of Russia, received a blast of
Sampras ice in the fourth set. Sampras was preparing to serve and
looked up to see Safin digging into his equipment bag on the sideline
for another racket. Sampras, who in his prime rarely acknowledged the
existence of his opponents, asked him what he was doing. Safin shot
back: "Strings, OK?"</LD>
<LD>   Just when you started to wonder whether Sampras was carrying this
new Mark Cuban thing a little too far, it became clear what he was
doing. The spirit was trying to pull along his weary body, dragged
down by a few too many marathon matches.</LD>
<TE>   That outward fire and some remarkable crowd support got Sampras
off the floor but couldn't get him over the hump Monday night, as
Safin held on to win, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (8).</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-round match at the Australian Open was a rematch of a
U.S. Open semifinal in September, won by Sampras in straight sets.
But after he dropped the first two sets, it was looking more like a
replay of their U.S. Open final in 2000 in which Safin blitzed
Sampras in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   Down a break in the third, No. 8 Sampras responded with some of
his best tennis in months, winning the third-set tiebreaker, 7-5. In
a remarkable fourth-set tiebreaker, he led, 4-2, and had two chances
to push the match into a fifth set. Safin saved the two set points,
and kept his composure after netting a relatively easy forehand
passing shot on his first match point.</TE>
<TE>   On his second match point, Safin won it on an incredible passing
shot down the line off a Sampras volley that probably would have been
a winner against anyone else. And so, a relieved Safin advanced, in 3
hours 33 minutes, finishing with 22 aces to 19 for Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, he will play 30-year-old Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa, who defeated Albert Costa of Spain, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-7
(4), 9-7, in 4 hours 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Taking note of Ferreira, and Tommy Haas of Germany--who beat Roger
Federer of Switzerland in five sets, surviving a match point--the
prospect of going the distance against Sampras greatly concerned
Safin. "I didn't expect I can put the forehand this way, down the
line and with Pete coming into the net," said Safin, seeded ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "And I made it. I was so happy, so many things into my head, 'I'm
winning, I'm finished. It's already 12:30 at night.' If you go to a
fifth set, you never know how it can finish. It would not be nice to
go five sets with Pete.... Pete has such big experience and you can
lose.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose this match, it can turn your tennis all the way
around, from great match to finishing the match horribly and without
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   This was the sort of jump-start Sampras was looking for in what
has become a wide-open men's tournament, devoid of top-seeded
players--Haas, No. 7, is the highest-seeded man left. He has not won
here since 1997, or any tournament since Wimbledon 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I dug myself too deep a hole," a downcast Sampras said. "... I
felt pretty good. I felt my legs were good. Sure, there were some
moments that we were both feeling it, but I felt like I could have
gone on all day, all night."</TE>
<TE>   The positive news is that he nearly got out. On the other hand,
Sampras, 30, has been getting ground down in the late stages of Grand
Slams in best-of-five-set matches.</TE>
<TE>   He has been doing all the right things, hiring a new coach,
respected Tom Gullikson, and training harder.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, for Sampras, there is still the oasis of Wimbledon,
and the tour is not exactly teeming with grass-court threats.</TE>
<TE>   A reinvented Sampras could find that his hard work will pay off in
July at the All England Club, though there are not as many hecklers
there to test his temper.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I was frustrated the way the match was going and I needed to
release it somehow, and the gentleman was talking and tripping away,"
Sampras said. "And I let him know how I felt about it, and just kind
of showed a little personality for you guys out there. You've been
waiting for me to do that for 10 years."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Blues are making other teams take notice as they climb
the Western Conference standings.</LD>
<LD>   Bryce Salvador scored off a pass from Keith Tkachuk with 2:12 left
in overtime Monday and the Blues won a franchise-record ninth
consecutive game with a 4-3 victory over the Bruins at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "It's quite an achievement for us," St. Louis goalie Brent Johnson
said. "Tkachuk has been the key because he is such a force and
controls the play."</LD>
<TE>   St. Louis, which won for the first time this season when trailing
after two periods, swept the home-and-home matchup against the
Bruins, winning both games in overtime and improving to 10-2 in its
last 12 games against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues' Mike Keane tied the score, 3-3, with 3:40 left in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk has figured in on six of St. Louis' last seven goals, as
well as the Blues' last four game-winning goals.</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk tied the score, 2-2, at 2:36 of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Benoit Hogue scored on a backhand at 7:03 of the third period to
give Boston a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Thornton had an assist for the Bruins and raised his total to
52 points.</TE>

<LD>There were no gremlins lurking on the Staples Center rims Monday,
swatting Clipper shots into the hands of the opposition. There were
no phantom calls from the officials that had the Clippers shaking
their heads in disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   And there were few moments of despair for the Clippers en route to
a 102-89 victory over the woebegone Denver Nuggets before a crowd of
16,672.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's on to weightier matters. The Clippers get their third
crack at the Lakers on Wednesday. They are 0-2 against their rivals
from down the hall.</LD>
<TE>   No question, the Clippers must be better Wednesday against the
champions than they were Monday against the dregs. Isn't it always
the case when teams play the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the Clippers happily put away another home victory,
regaining control against the Nuggets after a brief bobble late in
the third quarter. The Clippers built a 20-point lead late in the
first quarter, then watched it all slip away by the closing minutes
of the third.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McInnis' jump shot and Elton Brand's tip-in of a McInnis miss
at the buzzer gave the Clippers the lead back, 75-71, entering the
fourth quarter. Once in the lead again, the Clippers seized control
and improved to 18-7 at Staples. They also returned to the .500 mark
at 21-21.</TE>
<TE>   Brand had a huge game, scoring a season-best 31 points and taking
14 rebounds. Reserves Quentin Richardson, who had 17 points, and
Darius Miles, who had a monster dunk in the fourth quarter over Raef
LaFrentz among his 12 points, gave the team a jolt.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also made 42 of 85 shots (49.4%).</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel had 19 points for the Nuggets, who shot 37 of 91
(40.7%) and fell to 2-16 on the road, losing their 14th in a row away
from home.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think I'm going to complain about a win, you're wrong,"
Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We'll take them any way we can get
them. We finished strong and won the game and that was the important
thing. To me, it was a great win. Obviously, there were some things
we didn't do well. But the bench played great and gave us a huge
lift. Elton Brand was sensational."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry then cast a vote for Brand for the Western Conference
All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a crime if he's not on the team," Gentry said. "I hope
all the coaches in the West are watching him. I know there's a lot of
great forwards in the West, but it will be a shame if he's not voted
to the team."</TE>
<TE>   Brand was grateful for the endorsement but stopped short of
booking a flight to Philadelphia, site of the Feb. 10 game.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely would be a great honor," Brand said. "It's not up
to me. I look at it as I'm still only 22. I've got a lot of time left
in my career."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis did not start for the first time since missing a game Nov.
20, 2000 because of an injury. Earl Boykins started in place of
McInnis, who was benched by Gentry because he missed Monday's morning
shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   "I set my alarm clock for 8:45 p.m. instead of 8:45 a.m.," said
McInnis, who would score 13 points in 30 minutes. "I'm human."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers rocketed away from the Nuggets with Boykins, who
stands 5 feet 5 and weighs 133 pounds, directing them. The game plan
from the opening tip was to drop the ball inside to center Michael
Olowokandi again and again.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the quarter, the Clippers had a 37-21 lead and
Olowokandi had 12 points, six rebounds and four blocked shots. He
would finish with 14 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks. He also
passed Bill Walton for sixth place on the club's all-time list for
blocks with 387</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Michael was great," Gentry said. "We have a tendency to
forget about him sometimes. We have to make sure we keep getting him
the ball in the low post."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also made 16 of 26 shots (61.5%) in the opening
quarter and made the Nuggets miss 15 of 22. The Clippers hustled
after loose balls, made the Nuggets appear every bit as bad as their
12-28 record would indicate and threatened to turn the game into a
runaway.</TE>
<TE>   And then the second quarter began. Denver awoke with a start, and
by halftime, the lead was down to 59-52.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Clippers signed guard Eldridge Recasner to a
second 10-day contract. Recasner is simply an insurance policy
against injury to McInnis or Boykins.</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling, McInnis' backup, has been sidelined since Nov. 14
by a badly sprained right ankle. No date has been set for Dooling's
return, but it will probably coincide with the end of Recasner's
10-day contract.</TE>

<HD>Day for Stevens to Get Even</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Jockey, off to slow start at Santa Anita,
wins three races, including the Santa Ynez and San Marcos stakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A winner only four times in the first 20 days of the Santa Anita
meet, jockey Gary Stevens nearly equaled his output Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Hall of Fame rider won with his three mounts and swept both
stakes, capturing the $150,000 Santa Ynez with 18-1 longshot Dancing,
then winning a thriller on 2-1 second choice Irish Prize in the
$150,000 San Marcos.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, an exciting finish is usually a given when Irish Prize
is involved. The largest margin of victory for the gelding in his
four previous victories was a neck and he cut it even closer in his
initial race of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Well-positioned behind a slow early pace, the 6-year-old son of
Irish River swung to the outside in the stretch to beat 13-1 outsider
Continental Red by a nose in 2:011/5 for the 11/4 miles on turf.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum and trained by Neil Drysdale,
who had collaborated with Stevens to win the seventh race with Sunday
Break, Irish Prize earned his 10th victory in 25 starts in his first
attempt at 10 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had it won at the eighth pole," said Stevens, who has
had 46 mounts so far at Santa Anita. "He gives me just a ton of
confidence. He's got this aura about him. When he gets in the thick
of things, he doesn't lose too many of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty confident coming into the stretch. I had a lot of
horse and he really accelerated at the eighth pole. Even though [the
margin was only a nose], I was pretty confident about the whole
thing."</TE>
<TE>   This was the third win in four starts on the Santa Anita turf for
Irish Prize and the $90,000 check pushed his earnings to $1,212,353.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, 10 yards from the wire I didn't think he was going to
get there," Drysdale said. "This horse really reaches. He has a
tremendous desire to win. Gary said the other day [after the
gelding's win in the nine-furlong San Gabriel Handicap on Dec. 30]
that he relaxes so well now he didn't think the extra distance would
be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Lord Flasheart, the even-money favorite on the strength of his
comeback victory Dec. 30, never really got involved, finishing fifth
in a field reduced to six after Kerrygold and Blue Steller were
scratched earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dancing's victory gave trainer Jenine Sahadi an unexpected second
consecutive win in the Santa Ynez, a Grade II she had won last year
with the since-retired Golden Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   A winner once in three starts on the turf in Ireland last year,
Dancing, a 3-year-old English-bred filly owned by Howard Baker,
rallied from well off the pace to beat 6-1 third choice Respectful by
a half-length.</TE>
<TE>   Racing with Lasix for the first time, Dancing paid $38 and ran the
seven furlongs in 1:23.</TE>
<TE>   Lady George, who was looking for her second stakes victory of the
meet after taking the California Breeders' Champion Stakes on Dec.
28, was third and Ayanna, the 6-5 favorite, finished last in the
field of eight after pressing the early pace.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nothing to do with this," Sahadi said. "I asked [Baker]
what he wanted to do and he said, 'We're running in this race.'</TE>
<TE>   "He sent the horse to me from Europe. When I got her, I was
working from scratch. I worked her three-eighths [of a mile] the
first time because I really didn't know if she had breezed or if she
was fit."</TE>
<TE>   A winner of three of six and never worse than second in five
previous races around one turn, Ayanna was outrun for the early lead
by Rich Musique through 22 and 443/5 fractions and finished nearly 16
lengths behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Squirtle Squirt, who capped his 2001 season with a victory in the
Breeders' Cup Sprint, is scheduled to make his first start of the
year in the $150,000 Palos Verdes Handicap on Sunday at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bobby Frankel for owner David Lanzman, Squirtle Squirt
is among six probables for the six-furlong Palos Verdes, a Grade II.</TE>
<TE>   The field is also expected to include Snow Ridge, , Explicit,
Men's Exclusive, Silky Sweep and Ceeband.</TE>

<DH>Johnson Lucky to Be Alive, but He's No Longer the Brash
Billy the Kid of Sarajevo</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRESHAM, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Bill Johnson can't take his eyes off the fly.</LD>
<LD>   It buzzes up and down the windowpane, a prisoner of time and
space--its options limited. It wants to break free but can't.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson sits at the kitchen table in his mother's home, back
straight, eating a roast beef sandwich. Ever since the March skiing
crash, at precisely noon, a synapse fires and the 1984 Olympian asks
for lunch.</LD>
<TE>   It is one of the mysterious quirks that accompany his brain
trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the window, and the trapped insect that so fascinates him,
is a visage of postcard landscape, lush ferns and tall trees
surrounding this rural route home in the shadow of Mount Hood.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it's that damn fly slamming into glass--buzz then bang, buzz
then bang--that has Johnson transfixed.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," Johnson finally says. "I want you to kill that fly."</TE>
<TE>   Later, out of earshot from her son, D.B. Johnson confides, "This
was not one of his better days."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Johnson would make news when he got back on skis
and took a leisurely run down a slope at Timberline Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   This was one of his better days, a slosh-step forward feat for the
downhill champion who nearly lost his life last spring mounting a
comeback attempt for a berth at the Salt Lake City Winter Games and
instead will carry the Olympic torch for a short stint Wednesday
through the town of Longview, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   This recovery, however, is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   It may never be over.</TE>
<TE>   Physically, at 41, Bill Johnson still looks like a torpedo,
comfortable on this sunlit Sunday in a baseball cap, fleece sweater
and khakis. The 170-pound body sports scientists dubbed as
aerodynamically perfect for ski racing is lean and taut.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, Johnson did not break a bone in the crash. The only
obvious sign of injury is the tracheal scar on his throat. Had the
rescue team not made that incision, Johnson would have choked on his
own blood right there on the snow, in Whitefish, Mont. The force of
the face-first plant at 50 mph during the triple-A race caused his
teeth to clamp clear through his tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Johnson and tongue have been reunited to savor the
mayonnaise on roast beef and make casual, if not disjointed,
conversation. The family does not trust him yet alone over a hot
stove--he has been known to walk away from simmering soup. A list
taped to Johnson's mirror reminds him of daily tasks: Brush teeth,
shave, take pills, make bed.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's progress to date, from steps to skis, last rites to last
night, has been remarkable, yet his comeback is far too short on
memories--blanked out like someone recording over a cassette tape.</TE>
<TE>   He cannot remember what he did last summer, or the one before, or
the death of his father, Wally, six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember that my dad died," Johnson says. "Apparently,
he's dead, but I just don't know it. Everybody says my dad has died,
but to me, it hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   He hugs his two young boys, Nick and Tyler, but cannot make a
cognitive paternal link. They come over for Thanksgiving, yes, he
tousles their hair, yes, he loves them to death, yes, yet there is an
awful disconnect.</TE>
<TE>   "They know who I am but I don't know them," Johnson says. "I
don't. I don't know them at all."</TE>
<TE>   What does he know?</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm Olympic champion," he says. "I know that last year, I
must have wanted to become Olympic champion again."</TE>
<TE>   Some things are better forgotten--like the bitter 1998 separation
and divorce from Gina that people say prompted his longshot (insane?)
comeback attempt.</TE>
<TE>   He might prefer to be spared the gory details of his subdural
hematoma; the beat-death's-clock helicopter ride from Big Mountain
resort. Good thing he was lost in a coma when a brilliant young
neurosurgeon removed a fair chunk of his skull, literally put it in a
freezer for a week and then fitted it back on his head like a jigsaw
puzzle piece.</TE>
<TE>   He is getting better, yes, slowly, steadily, but this is not Bill
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The crash has knocked the punk out of him, the unabashed arrogance
it took to become the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in
downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that? Johnson going to Sarajevo and telling the world he,
not one of the Austrians, was going to win the downhill.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know why everyone else is here," he said. "Everyone
else can fight for second."</TE>
<TE>   It was the sort of braggadocio that typically sours foreigners on
American sportsmen, also the kind of trash talk that can backfire.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, though, knew the instant he turned tips down that
Bjelansnica course in the former Yugoslavia that what he said was no
snow job.</TE>
<TE>   Although Johnson was ready to conquer the world, the world was not
so ready for him. He was dead wrong when he said his gold medal would
be worth "millions."</TE>
<TE>   One magnificent run on his "Red Sleds" could not make everyone
forget what a pain in the rear he could be, an American, born in
Canoga Park, a guy who ripped off a car as a teenager. He was not
Suzy Chapstick.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had done what he did in 1984 today, he'd have the world by
the tail," his mother says. "People are more accepting of the color
part of it, the Dennis Rodmans."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had one blaze-of-glory year, 1984. Before Sarajevo, he won
a downhill at Wengen, Switzerland. After the Olympics, he took races
at Aspen, Colo., and Whistler, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   He never won a major race again, yet he was still going downhill
fast.</TE>
<TE>   He fell victim to the rubber chicken tour, the fights and general
carousing--Bill Johnson being Bill Johnson. There were injuries too.
In 1986, he wrecked his knee in a race at Val Gardena, Italy, and two
ruptured disks in his back left him in excruciating pain.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, he struck a coach with a ski pole and was left off the
Calgary Olympic team because of poor results and retired in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   His life unraveled like a Greek tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he and Gina lost Ryan, the youngest of their three sons,
when the toddler wandered out of sight for not more than a minute and
drowned in a hot tub.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson spent much of the 1990s in a daze, moving from town to
town. He logged time as a figurehead ambassador at the Crested Butte
ski resort in Montana and toiled as an itinerant carpenter. The post
office had trouble keeping up with the 11 address changes.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson lived for periods in a motor home--sometimes alone,
sometimes with the family--king of the mountain becoming king of the
road. Naturally, there was someone to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it was all his fault," Bob Beattie, the former US Olympic ski
coach and current television ski analyst, says of Johnson. "I don't
want to call him arrogant, but he was really cocky and shunned any
kind of help."</TE>
<TE>   Up until his last race, March 22, Johnson was putting up his best
bad-boy front.</TE>
<TE>   Daron Rahlves, the reigning world champion in super-giant slalom,
was one of the last people to see Johnson before he took the lift up.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just hanging out, talking a little bit," Rahlves recalls,
"And he's like, 'Daron, I'm just in this for the chicks and the
dough.' It was hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Johnson was hiding a deeper pain.</TE>
<TE>   His mother says the divorce was devastating and the motivating
force for his comeback, and possibly a rekindling of his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "The divorce was very sad. Gina took the boys and the boys were
his life," D.B. Johnson said. "He flailed around quite a long time.
The fact he thought he could get his boys back was therapy. It gave
him a goal."</TE>
<TE>   Gina, who lives with the boys in Sonoma, declined to discuss
Johnson, or the motivations behind his comeback attempt. But last
spring she told USA Today, "There were a lot of other factors that
caused our breakup. I don't think winning a gold medal would change
our life."</TE>
<TE>   Starting Over</TE>
<TE>   You ask why a 40-year-old man would risk life and limb and memory
to make a comeback in downhill racing?</TE>
<TE>   This is strapping up and going 80 mph down a mountain, risking
death at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Ski racing today hardly resembles the sport Bill Johnson knew. The
women are now going as fast as the men did then.</TE>
<TE>   Everything has changed: the equipment, the technique and the size
of the skiers' quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Most say Johnson had no shot of qualifying for the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves thought Johnson's comeback attempt was a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed so much since he has skied," he says. "It's
gotten a lot more powerful and it's gotten a lot more technical.
People don't realize what it takes to go that fast, to be that smooth
under control, and take those forces."</TE>
<TE>   Because he had not skied competitively in a decade, Johnson by
rule had to begin his comeback from the lowest start positions. He
began some races 99th in a field of 99. Course conditions tend to
deteriorate with each run, so Johnson's chances of winning were
almost astronomical.</TE>
<TE>   What a back-of-the-pack racer tries to do is better his start or
"bib" number with improved performances. Although he remembers
nothing of events leading up to the accident, Johnson is convinced
there was a conspiracy against him led by Bill Marolt, chief
executive of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want me to ski race," Johnson says of Marolt, who was
U.S. Alpine director when Johnson won his gold medal in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, there are no bump-ups in the U.S. Olympic line, Marolt
says."He basically had to start over, that's difficult and I
understand that," Marolt says. Johnson was no different than any
other skier making a comeback and in fact was slowly working his way
up.</TE>
<TE>   The day he crashed, he wore bib No. 34 in a field of 63.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Johnson's age, 40 at the time of his crash, was a
nonfactor in his near-fatal fall. As Johnson barreled down the course
and entered a section known as Corkscrew, he caught the inside edge
of his right ski and was forced face-first into the snow.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I think he could handle it," Rahlves said. "That
could have happened to anybody else. He caught an edge."</TE>
<TE>   Others questioned his fitness level.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the idea of having a comeback at age 40 is fine," Beattie
says. "However, he really wasn't in great shape as I understand it.
He hadn't been on skis that much before he started racing."</TE>
<TE>   Coming Home</TE>
<TE>   D.B. Johnson breaks opens her scrapbook, but these are not Grand
Canyon vacation pictures.</TE>
<TE>   They are detailed, graphic and grisly photos taken of her son
after brain surgery.</TE>
<TE>   If not for the breathing tubes indicating life, these could pass
as autopsy shots.</TE>
<TE>   In the photos, Johnson's head is shaven, swollen like a melon. His
head resembles a relaced catcher's mitt, thick stitches forming a
semicircle on his skull.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures remind D.B. Johnson of what she nearly lost.</TE>
<TE>   This was her Billy, youngest of her four children, the ski
prodigy. She knew it the moment Billy was 7, when the family moved
from the San Fernando Valley to Boise, Idaho, and the youngest son
snapped into his bindings at Bogus Basin.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute he put skis on, he was low to the ground and fast,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   After Boise, the Johnsons moved to the Pacific Northwest, where
Billy honed his skills at the Mt. Hood Meadows Ski Academy.</TE>
<TE>   All these years later, Billy is back home, in the shadow of Mt.
Hood.</TE>
<TE>   It was minor miracle Johnson survived, that the rescue workers
reacted so quickly on the mountain, that the helicopter was available
and took only eight minutes to make the 20-mile trip to Kalispell
Regional Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson underwent four hours of brain surgery and remained in a
coma for three weeks. He was then transferred by plane to a hospital
in Portland, where he spent six weeks, followed by three months at
Bakersfield's Centre for Neuro Skills.</TE>
<TE>   When his insurance ran out in September, Johnson returned to
Gresham, to live with his mother and continue rehabilitation under
the Oregon Health Plan.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal has been a drain. D.B. Johnson runs her own business,
ProSports NW, out of her home. She makes racing bibs, earns good
money, but resources are tight.</TE>
<TE>   She established the Bill Johnson Donation Fund on her son's Web
site but has been disappointed by the lack of contributions.</TE>
<TE>   But she is not discouraged. Johnson will remain with her for as
long as it takes. Doctors say it is unclear how much memory he will
regain, or how long it might take.</TE>
<TE>   "We're faced with the fact he won't get 100% better," she said.
"We're just working with what we have today, hopefully he'll get to
the point he can take care of himself."</TE>
<TE>   There are going to be days, however, when Johnson prefers to chart
the movement of flies on window sills, when he wrestles with his own
predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great champion," Marolt says. "He did something
Americans dream of. He won a gold medal in the Olympics. It's a
phenomenal accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   After Johnson crashed, a friend went to retrieve his truck. You
know what he found?</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's Olympic gold medal, tucked under the front seat, a
reminder that all things are possible.</TE>
<TE>   D.B. Johnson says she knows her son won't ski competitively again,
but he isn't ready to concede. When was he ever?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why my mom says I won't ski," he says. "I think I
will compete again. That's a great goal for me. Because all I got
right now, everything I own right now, is ski racing. It's my life. I
don't know what else to do."</TE>

<HD>Kings, Fans Are at Home</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. enjoys impressive support at the Pond and
responds with a 4-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has more or less become the Kings' vacation home.</LD>
<LD>   They have brought 12,000 or so of their closest friends to the
Arrowhead Pond a couple times this season and always gone home with
souvenir points. Monday was more of the same.</LD>
<LD>   By the time a chippy evening was done, the Kings had a gritty 4-2
victory over the Mighty Ducks in front of 17,079 mostly "Go Kings Go"
fans. The Kings have played twice in Anaheim this season and have
four points to show for it.</LD>
<TE>   Jason Allison scored two goals, snapping a seven-game goal-less
streak. Goalie Felix Potvin could be knocked down--by the Ducks'
Kevin Sawyer--but not out, as he stopped 29 of 31 shots. When Ian
Laperriere tipped home a goal for a 4-2 lead 6 minutes 26 seconds
into the third period, the Kings were on their way to their eighth
victory in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   This was a game in which players on both sides showed off their
stick work ... hooking ... high sticking ... cross-checking. The type
of work that shows up on a desk  in the league office rather than on
highlight reels.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Craig Johnson left the game with a bloody right eye
after getting a high stick from Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski.
The Ducks' Ruslan Salei received a bloody lip after being
cross-checked into the boards.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, 1-10-1 in their last 12 games, came out to a hostile
crowd in their own arena, but led by a goal after a rough first
period.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, that did not stand.</TE>
<TE>   Vishnevski caught Johnson in the eye and was sent off for high
sticking. Allison then bulled his way through two defenders and fired
a no-look backhand shot. Goalie Steve Shields got a piece of the
puck, but it trickled into the net to tie the score 2:51 into the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Emerson gave the Kings the lead, 3-2, when he skated from
behind the net and fired the puck, which went off Salei's skate and
into the net at 15:29 of the period.</TE>
<TE>   "These type of games are getting hard to swallow," Duck Coach
Bryan Murray said. "If you're losing 6-1, you just say you're not
good enough and move on."</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of players who can consistently put the puck into the net,
Murray reshuffled the same old deck, trying to find a combination,
any combination,  that might work.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably absent was right wing Marty McInnis, a healthy scratch
for only the second time in three-plus seasons with the Ducks. The
only other time was when his wife gave birth to the couple's second
child last February.</TE>
<TE>   This time the labor pains belonged to McInnis, who has only two
goals in his last 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   "When things aren't going well, a little shake-up sometimes wakes
guys up," Paul Kariya said. "Sometimes it brings a little fresh
energy to the team."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks got that, but it wasn't exactly positive energy.</TE>
<TE>   Things turned ugly midway through the first period when Potvin
went behind the net to retrieve the puck and was dropped by Sawyer,
who was then jumped by several Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere and Sawyer received fighting majors and Sawyer was also
slapped with a major charging penalty, setting up the Kings with a
full five-minute power play.</TE>
<TE>   Allison got it going, chipping in a cross-ice pass from Steve
Heinz for a 1-0 lead 13:01 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   But before the Kings could capitalize any more, they filled up
their own penalty box. Adam Deadmarsh was sent off for elbowing, the
first of three consecutive King penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Jason York lined up a shot from the blue line and Mike Leclerc,
parked in front of the net, deflected the puck past Potvin to tie the
score, 1-1, at 16:33.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to find a way to get a couple people together that,
hopefully, can do a little more offensively," Murray said. "We've
done a good job defensively. The defensemen who play together seem to
accommodate each other. They understand how we have to play. We got
find somehow or other [a way] to create a little more offense."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow they did, and it even involved German Titov, the Ducks'
free-agent boondoggle from last season. Titov forechecked his way to
forcing a turnover with time running out in the first period. He then
fired a pass to Jeff Friesen, who buried a shot from the slot with
14.5 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Said Friesen: "Tito just made a great pass and I saw the top part
of net and just ripped it."</TE>

<HD>Flinn Is L.A.'s Latest Enforcer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe and Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings, who had been without an enforcer for two games after
sending Kip Brennan to the minors Thursday, added one Monday when
they recalled Ryan Flinn from their American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H.</LD>
<LD>   A roster position opened for the 6-foot-5, 223-pound Flinn when
center Eric Belanger was put on the injured list because of a
sprained left wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Flinn, 21, impressed the Kings during training camp with his
willingness to mix it up with anybody who crossed his path.
Ultimately, though, he was sent to the minors and the Kings opened
the season with veteran tough guy Ken Belanger.</LD>
<TE>   Flinn, a left wing, has split time this season with the Manchester
Monarchs and the Reading Royals of the East Coast Hockey League. In
19 games with the Monarchs, he had one assist and 52 penalty minutes,
and in 20 games with the Royals he scored four points and accumulated
a team-high 130 penalty minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He was signed to an NHL contract Jan. 9, less than a week after
Ken Belanger was put on the injured list after suffering a broken
left wrist in a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been doing the job for us at Manchester," General Manager
Dave Taylor said at the time, "so we felt it was appropriate to get
him on an NHL deal."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray said he'd like to give both Brennan and Flinn
"some exposure" while Ken Belanger is sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger, meanwhile, is listed as week to week after injuring
his wrist in a 2-0 victory over the Nashville Predators on Jan. 15.
He was put on the injured list retroactive to Wednesday, so he'll be
eligible to be activated as soon as Thursday night's game against the
Minnesota Wild at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Monday's game, the Ducks' power play had 246 chances, the
most among NHL teams. Yet, they ranked 29th out of 30 teams on the
power play.</TE>
<TE>   The problems are many, but there is a definite top spot on the
must-have list for Coach Bryan Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to be successful when a quarterback doesn't step up,"
he said. "To me, a quarterback is a guy who grabs the puck and
creates opportunities for other people.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried different people there. We need a guy that plays that
position and is able to pick out the individual and the space that is
open."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks scored a power-play goal in the first period Monday,
when Jason York whipped a shot that Mike Leclerc deflected in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rucchin was walking, or rather limping, on his own Monday
and Bryan Murray hopes the Ducks' top-line center might return to the
team after the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin had an MRI exam on his left ankle last week that "showed
everything is healing up," Murray said. Rucchin is not using crutches
or wearing a walking cast.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin has missed 34 games after suffering a stress fracture in
his left ankle that later needed surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Craig Johnson, who left Saturday's game because of flu,
left Monday after being hit in the right eye by the stick of Duck
defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski.</TE>
<TE>   King officials said the stick caught Johnson on the eye, causing
swelling that made an initial examination inconclusive. He was taken
to Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, where Dr. Howard Lazerson, the
team's eye doctor, was to examine him.</TE>
<TE>   Vishnevski received a penalty for high sticking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The yo-yo season for Timo Parssinen took another drop Monday, as
he was returned to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Parssinen started the season with the Ducks, then was sent down
after three games. He was recalled in late November, played three
games, then was sent down again. He was brought back last week, after
Jeff Friesen suffered a sprained ankle. He played one game and was a
healthy scratch for two.</TE>
<TE>   Parssinen has no goals and one assist with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher returned to the King lineup after missing one
game with a concussion.</TE>

<LD>So Brett Favre holds his own Ram Appreciation Day inside the Dome at
America's Center, tossing out six souvenir footballs to members of
the home team, and slinks out of the playoffs looking less like the
best quarterback of his generation and more like Ty Detmer under
glass? A shame it had to happen that way.</LD>
<LD>   And the Oakland Raiders are eliminated from the playoffs by a rule
more poorly conceived and written than your usual "Arliss" script,
recovering a fumble that looked like a fumble, felt like a fumble and
smelled like a fumble--except the rulebook said no, forget everything
you just saw, that's a forward pass, even though New England
quarterback Tom Brady had no intention of passing the ball forward at
the time he was hit, and even winked about it during the Patriots'
post-victory news conference? A shame it had to happen that way.</LD>
<LD>   And the defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens are bounced
from the tournament in the second round, by a score of 27-10, by
being held to 22 net rushing yards, by the Pittsburgh Steelers?</LD>
<TE>   A shame it had to happen a year too late.</TE>
<TE>   Where were these Steelers when we needed them last January? Oh,
right. Vacationing after a 9-7 third-place finish in the AFC Central,
with Coach Bill Cowher wondering about his future in Pittsburgh,
wondering what to do about quarterback because Kordell Stewart
obviously wasn't the answer, wondering why the Steelers had wasted
the No. 8 pick of the 2000 draft on Plaxico Burress.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Steelers were a year away, as they say, which meant we
had to spend 12 months listening to Brian Billick and Shannon Sharpe
and Tony Siragusa bray about the greatness of a one-dimensional Raven
team that, in its own way, was as charmed as the 2001 Chicago Bears,
who finally saw their myth matched by the severe reality of Donovan
McNabb running free out of the pocket.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Ravens set a record for fewest points given up during a
16-game regular-season schedule, and that was enough to convince too
many people who really knew better that this was the Greatest Defense
In The History of Defense. It wasn't, as those same people now
realize, having regained their senses and re-examined how Baltimore
fattened up its defensive resume in 2000--namely, eight games against
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Jacksonville and pre-resurgence Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens then went on to the Super Bowl by rolling past three
flawed AFC rivals--Denver didn't have Brian Griese, Tennessee didn't
have much more than Eddie George, Oakland didn't have a contingency
plan for Rich Gannon sitting in the shadow of a falling Siragusa. And
the Ravens won that Super Bowl largely because the NFC sent along its
weakest representative in more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't stop the most obnoxious champions in memory--that
reputation is fully deserved--from carrying on as if they were the
Lombardi Packers reborn in the age of multimedia overkill. Yet the
Ravens' championship felt uncomfortably similar to the rule that
determined Brady's fumble against the Raiders to be, quote-unquote,
an "incomplete pass."</TE>
<TE>   It might not be right, but that's the way it is.</TE>
<TE>   According to the numbers on the scoreboard, the 2000 Ravens were
the best team in football. And according to the NFL rulebook, as it
is written, referee Walt Coleman acted correctly when reversing his
original call on Brady's apparent fumble and instead concurred with
the rule that states when a player is "holding the ball to pass it
forward, any intentional movement of his arm starts a forward pass,
even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting
to tuck it back toward his body."</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, is absolutely ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   Has anyone ever seen a player attempt a forward pass by tucking
the ball back toward his body? OK, Minnesota Viking fans who watched
Spergon Wynn in action this season might have, but aside from them?</TE>
<TE>   You read that rule, and you re-read it, and you're afraid to delve
deeper into the NFL rulebook. What other insane ramblings are buried
in the back pages? When Player A lines up in punt formation, whatever
he does next with the ball shall be ruled a punt, even if the player
runs with the ball or passes the ball or autographs the ball or
deflates the ball and uses the leather to fashion handsome wallets
for his offensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps acting to head off such scrutiny, NFL officials have
promised to revisit the rule during the off-season and possibly
rewrite it. Which is the reasonable thing to do, though a little too
late to do the Raiders any good.</TE>
<TE>   That rule turned a Patriot turnover into a Patriot incompletion,
which set up Adam Vinatieri's tying field goal, which set up
Vinatieri's deciding field goal in overtime. It was almost enough to
make you feel sorry for the Raiders, who really believe this
NFL-out-to-get-Al-Davis conspiracy stuff. Until you got a look at
Channel 2's idea of "objective journalism" and listened to its panel
of ex-Raiders Willie Gault and Rod Martin and ex-Raider PR man Steve
Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   A very strange weekend, all in all. Fox's Pat Summerall wrapped up
the Rams' 45-17 rout of Favre and the Green Bay Packers by studying a
camera close-up of Ram Coach Mike Martz and wondering aloud, "This
guy ... Mike Martz ... a genius?"</TE>
<TE>   John Madden said he thought Martz was and went on to add that
Martz's Ram offense just might be the greatest of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Here we go again.</TE>
<TE>   Martz is not a genius. Neither is Billick, which no doubt will
come as a shock to him, nor Jon Gruden nor Andy Reid nor Bill
Belichick. How do we know this? Because geniuses usually use their
time to invent medicines or write great works of literature. Rarely
do they spend their Sundays wearing bad windbreakers and yelling at
320-pound long snappers.</TE>
<TE>   If Martz is so smart, why did it take him a full year to figure
out Kurt Warner + Marshall Faulk - a real defense = no return to the
Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   If Billick is so smart, what was Elvis Grbac doing out there at
Heinz Field, charged with defending the Ravens' Super Bowl
championship against the ball-hawking Pittsburgh defense?</TE>
<TE>   If Gruden is so smart, what was he doing calling timeout before
Vinatieri's decisive field-goal attempt, thinking it might "ice" the
kicker? The only thing iced at the time was the Foxboro Stadium
playing surface. All Gruden's timeout accomplished was giving
Vinatieri's teammates enough time to clear a spot in the snow for a
clean kick placement.</TE>
<TE>   Cowher? Well, it must be noted that he just pulled off the
greatest victory in Pittsburgh Steeler history. Yes, greater than the
Immaculate Reception game of 1972--which was great for Franco Harris
and NFL Films, no doubt, but little beyond those two. And, yes, it
was greater than the Steelers' four Super Bowl victories--which were
great for the city of Pittsburgh, but not quite the big-picture
triumph of Pittsburgh 27, Purple Blight 10.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Cowher's team did the NFL a favor, the sport of football a
favor, the entire country a favor. That still won't qualify him for
genius status. Humanitarian of the year is another story.</TE>

<DH>Soccer: Despite slow and unimaginative play, Americans beat
Cuba on penalty kick by McBride, 1-0, to reach CONCACAF
quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best thing Bruce Arena did on Monday was to stick around after
his United States team had defeated Cuba, 1-0, and watch Mexico and
Guatemala show a Rose Bowl crowd of 31,244 how soccer should be
played.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by the way his team performed, the U.S. coach needs every
lesson he can get.</LD>
<LD>   True, the U.S. victory, on a 22nd-minute penalty-kick goal by
forward Brian McBride, clinched first place for the Americans in
their CONCACAF Gold Cup group and means they will play either El
Salvador or Guatemala in the tournament's quarterfinals on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   But as far as providing fans any hope that the U.S. will do better
in this summer's World Cup than it did in France '98--where it
finished 32nd and last--the game failed to deliver. The U.S.
performance was uninspired and the match was tedious.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Arena, who is defensive even at the best of times, was
unusually guarded in his comments.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the U.S., ranked 24th among the world's soccer nations,
looked so slow and unimaginative against a country ranked 75th, he
pointed out that the team has beaten South Korea (2-1 on Saturday)
and Cuba in the 12-nation tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We've won two games," he said. "[World Cup-bound] Ecuador lost
[2-0 to Haiti in Miami on Sunday]. What rank is Haiti? Why worry
about those things? We've won two games, and that's the mission--to
advance here.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played 17 out of 18 players on our roster, so it was good
evaluation. So to answer your question, I'm not displeased. Could we
play better? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to believe the U.S. could play worse. Fortunately,
the World Cup roster doesn't have to be finalized until May.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking for in this tournament is to narrow down our
pool of players as we get closer to May," Arena said. "It's been
helpful. I'm obviously not going to be critical of any players, but
I'm able to evaluate from these two games where some of our players
stand."</TE>
<TE>   Standing is just what most of them were doing for the game against
Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Movement on and off the ball--especially when compared to the
rousing Mexico-Guatemala encounter that followed--was painfully slow.
Even when the U.S. managed to create scoring chances, it squandered
them by shooting high or wide.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Arena said he saw positives.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a couple of people continue to solidify where they stand
on the team," he said. "I think McBride has had two decent games. He
played well today. I thought [Chris] Armas has played well. I think
[DaMarcus] Beasley and [Landon] Donovan have done quite well. I think
Cobi Jones had a good performance in these two games.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find a better partner up front for McBride. We need to
get a little bit better in our defense. Obviously, [goalkeeper Kasey]
Keller's solid. I thought today [Richie] Williams played very well in
his 30 minutes or so."</TE>
<TE>   Considering how his team struggled to overcome lowly Cuba, Arena
was asked how he expects to handle three-time world champion Italy in
February and three-time world champion Germany in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We might not be playing them with these same players," he
replied. "We anticipate improving our roster considerably for the
matches in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   The goal came after Beasley, the liveliest of the American
players, was charged off the ball by defender Mario Rodriguez.
Referee Jose Pineda of Honduras awarded a penalty kick and McBride
scored with ease.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to remember with the U.S. team right now is that
it's only two weeks into training and it's taking players who have
been off for a month, so they're trying to get them fit and they're
trying to get them ready to play," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said.
"That's a difficult task for Bruce or for any coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has gotten two wins. I don't think it's been artistic. I
think Bruce would agree with that, but still it shows a resilience
that we've been able to win games when maybe we haven't played our
best soccer."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Takes Step Up, Beats Guatemala</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Mexicans advance to quarterfinals as Garces scores
game-winning goal one minute after Guatemalans had tied it.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raising the level of its play, Mexico swept into the quarterfinals of
the sixth CONCACAF Gold Cup on Monday night by defeating Guatemala,
3-1, in front of a boisterous crowd of 31,244 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The fans, evenly split between both nations, were treated to a
fast-paced game and a three-goal first half.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre's team, which will play Croatia,
Ecuador and Italy in the World Cup this summer, took the lead in the
27th minute on a penalty kick by Adolfo Bautista.</LD>
<TE>   Jamaican referee Peter Prendergast awarded the kick after
Guatemalan defender Denis Chen handled the ball on the goal line
following a corner kick. Chen was red-carded, leaving Guatemala a man
short for the last hour.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemala, whose defense appeared suspect from the opening
whistle, responded by going to its strength and carried the play to
Mexico. It managed to tie the score on a superb goal by Juan Carlos
Plata in the 36th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the ball just over the halfway line, Plata set off of an
long run, beating three defenders before firing the ball past
goalkeeper Omar Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by this reversal, Mexico launched an attack and was rewarded
a minute later when Marco Garces launched a shot from 20 yards that
goalkeeper Edgar Estrada slowed but could not stop.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of scoring chances through the rest of the
match, but the only other goal came in injury time at the end of the
game when Carlos Ochoa, a former Azusa Pacific University player who
is being eyed by the Galaxy, scored.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the game was even between the teams," said Guatemala
Coach Julio Cesar Cortes. "We tried to do as much as we could to keep
the same [intensity] of play, but with 10 players we couldn't keep it
up."</TE>
<TE>   The victory enabled Mexico, which defeated El Salvador, 1-0, on
Saturday, to secure first place in its group. It will play either
South Korea or Cuba in the quarterfinals on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid watched Guatemalan striker Carlos Ruiz,
who is being pursued by the Major League Soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who plays for Comunicaciones in the Guatemalan league, said
after the game that he would continue negotiations with MLS after the
Gold Cup and that he was not interested in returning to Greece, where
he also has played.</TE>

<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Ubaldo Scanagatta of the Italian newspaper La Nazione returned to his
day job after a brief star turn at Rod Laver Arena today in the
women's quarterfinals at the Australian Open.</LD>
<LD>   Scanagatta became a coach when Adriana Serra Zanetti was without a
familiar face in the Friends Box for her match against third-seeded
Martina Hingis of Switzerland. Serra Zanetti's coach didn't come here
and her sister, Antonella, had to leave Melbourne for another event.</LD>
<LD>   Serra Zanetti, the first Italian woman to reach the quarterfinals
here, spotted Scanagatta at breakfast and sealed the deal. He settled
into the box and provided moral support during the 73-minute match,
which Hingis won, 6-2, 6-3.</LD>
<TE>   A veteran journalist, Scanagatta made the savvy move of quitting
as coach before he was sacked. "I resigned. But if we win, I resign
from the newspaper," he said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis will play No. 2 Venus Williams or No. 8 Monica Seles in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the men's quarterfinals was completed today: No. 16 Thomas
Johansson defeated Swedish countryman Jonas Bjorkman, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3,
6-4. Johansson reached the semifinals of a Grand Slam for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe said he invited Taylor Dent
to play in next month's first-round match against Slovakia, but Dent
declined, citing a bad back. McEnroe made the offer when Dent was
still in the singles. The youngster from Newport Beach, son of former
Australian Davis Cup player Phil Dent, has been the subject of an
often-humorous tug-of-war between Australia and the U.S., and he is
leaning toward playing for McEnroe.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe also said he will not use an established doubles team
against Slovakia, instead choosing four singles players, a wise move
considering the physical fragility of Pete Sampras and Andy Roddick.
"It's tough because the doubles teams are playing well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi, who withdrew because of an injured right wrist,
visited a specialist in Northern California, who has prescribed
anti-inflammatory medication for the next two weeks, according to
Agassi's management company. Agassi has strained wrist tendons and
there is inflammation in the sheath.</TE>

<HD>No. 6 Oklahoma Gets a Good Price Support</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollis Price scored 24 points, 13 during a stretch in which Oklahoma
scored on 14 consecutive possessions, and the No. 6-ranked Sooners
defeated No. 18 Missouri, 84-71, Monday night at Norman, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma (15-2, 4-1 Big 12 Conference), coming off a loss at
then-No. 4 Kansas that ended a 13-game winning streak, shot 49% and
had a 43-26 rebounding advantage to defeat Missouri for the eighth
consecutive time.</LD>
<LD>   The Tigers (14-5, 4-2) got 26 points from Clarence Gilbert, who
made eight three-point baskets. That didn't offset the Tigers' lack
of an inside game or an off game by Kareem Rush, the second-leading
scorer in the Big 12 with a 19.6 average. He had 13 points but was
only four of 15 from the field.</LD>
<TE>   Price started slowly but the scoring of Quannas White and Daryan
Selvy kept Oklahoma in the mix. Three three-point baskets by Gilbert
in just over four minutes gave the Tigers a 23-19 lead with 6:51 left
in the half.</TE>
<TE>   A follow shot by Aaron McGhee started an Oklahoma run that saw the
Sooners make 10 shots in a row and score on their final 11
possessions before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Price got going during that span, making two three-point baskets
and scoring 10 points during the run, when the Sooners forced four of
Missouri's 18 turnovers and converted each into a basket.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma scored on its first three possessions of the second half,
capped by Price's three-point basket for a 51-35 lead. The Sooners
pushed the lead to 18 points a few minutes later and didn't let
Missouri get closer than 11 afterward.</TE>
<TE>   White scored 14 points, McGhee had 13 and Selvy had 12.</TE>

<TE>   No. 1 Connecticut 80, Notre Dame 53--Sue Bird scored 19 points and

Conference) at Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Williams led a dominating inside game with 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame (10-7, 4-2), the defending national champion, made only
two of 15 shots in the first 12 minutes. The Fighting Irish committed
10 turnovers in the first half, including their first three
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsey Wicks led Notre Dame with 16 points.</TE>

free throws with 12 seconds to play and the Demon Deacons pulled off

<LD>Clipper point guard Jeff McInnis missed the morning shoot-around and
did not start Monday's game against the Denver Nuggets at Staples
Center. Earl Boykins took his spot, making his first start of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   "It angers me," Coach Alvin Gentry said when asked about the
latest in a string of incidents this season. "It disappoints me. It's
all about being a part of a team. I think it's happening too often.
The guys have to make sure, at the midway point of the season, that
these things get eliminated."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Elton Brand, Obinna Ekezie and Corey Maggette were
fined after arguing and fighting in the team's hotel lobby in
Minneapolis in view of guests. The week before, Lamar Odom missed the
team's bus to a game in Charlotte and did not start against the
Hornets.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Odom sat out Monday for the second game in a row because of a
badly sprained right wrist. He has been sidelined for five games
total after suffering the injury Dec. 16 against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   It's uncertain whether he will play Wednesday against the Lakers.
The team's plan is to give the wrist time to heal before beginning
the stretch drive after next month's all-star break.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I came back too fast the first time," said Odom,
averaging 13.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists in 29 games. "I
do want to be healthy and play down the stretch. It's been
frustrating trying to play with one hand. The pain is just too much.
At one point, I was able to deal with it. Right now it hurts too
much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The start of the Clippers' game Feb. 2 at Atlanta has been changed
to 4 PST and their Feb. 3 game at Boston has been changed to noon
PST. The moves were made to avoid a conflict with the Super Bowl on
Feb. 3.</TE>

<LD>Wendell Yoshida gave a thumb's up to Disney's "Double Teamed," a
movie about Heather and Heidi Burge, who played for Yoshida's Palos
Verdes High girls' basketball team in the late 1980s. The movie
debuted Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it had some good motivational parts, especially for
girls, that sports can take you somewhere," Yoshida said. "The
basketball part was funny because it was all made up."</LD>
<LD>   One of the major inaccuracies was the twins' immediate rise. In
real life, they didn't play on varsity as freshmen, though both
eventually reached the WNBA. As juniors in 1988, they led Palos
Verdes to the state finals but lost. Yoshida's teams won state titles
in 1991 and in 1992, claiming the mythical national title with a 33-0
record.</LD>
<TE>   Yoshida said it was odd seeing himself portrayed by actor Joey
Miyashima, "who just happened to be one of my wife's high school
classmates," he said.</TE>
<TE>   How close was the celluloid Yoshida to the real thing? "I wasn't
that nice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshida, who has a 440-178 record and six Southern Section titles
in 22 years, said Monday that this season or next may be his last as
coach at Peninsula. He is applying for one of Peninsula's athletic
director positions, which will open when Palos Verdes reopens in the
fall with freshmen and sophomores. Palos Verdes, Miraleste and
Rolling Hills highs consolidated 12 years ago to form Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting close to the end," Yoshida said. "I think I've given
a lot to this game when women's basketball was just developing, and
now it has exploded."</TE>
<TE>   No problem: Richard Marquis, coach for No. 12 Alhambra Keppel,
remains on leave pending an investigation for undisclosed reasons by
the Alhambra School District.</TE>
<TE>   Keppel, under the guidance of junior varsity coach Tan Ha, had few
problems without Marquis. The Aztecs are 3-0 in his absence,
including wins over rivals Alhambra Schurr, 63-54, and Bell Gardens,
84-58.</TE>

<HD>Gruden's Status Under Review</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Raider coach heading into final year of his
contract with no extension in works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Raiders are out of the playoffs, and after next season,
they may be out of a coach as well.</LD>
<LD>   "It's my opinion, based on conversations I've had with Jon, that
Jon Gruden will not be coach of the Raiders after the 2002 season,"
agent Bob LaMonte told The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Gruden, 37, just finished the fourth season of the five-year deal
he signed as a rookie coach in 1998, and a source familiar with the
situation said neither side is interested in extending the contract.</LD>
<TE>   A scenario gathering steam has the Raiders essentially trading
Gruden to Tampa Bay for draft picks. The Buccaneers, whose hopes of
replacing Tony Dungy with Bill Parcells were dashed over the weekend,
are precluded by tampering rules from initiating such a deal. The
Raiders have to make the first call.</TE>
<TE>   Raider executive Bruce Allen did not return phone messages Monday,
but a day earlier said of Gruden's status: "We plan to address that."</TE>
<TE>   Allen has long been a strong supporter of Gruden's. But the
tension between Gruden and Raider owner Al Davis has been building
for the past two seasons and now they barely speak, according to a
source familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden, who has three sons, said he plans to spend more time with
his family in the coming months, and that could make the Tampa option
even more appealing. His parents live there, and his younger brother,
Jay, is the coach-turned-quarterback of arena football's Orlando
Predators.</TE>
<TE>   LaMonte was reached while boarding a plane to North Carolina,
where another client, New York Giant defensive coordinator John Fox,
is interviewing for the Carolina Panther coaching vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the past year, Gruden turned down the chance to coach
college teams. Ohio State offered him a 10-year, $25-million deal
last year. And, before the George O'Leary fiasco, Notre Dame was very
interested in Gruden, and several sources say the job was his if he
wanted it.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden told reporters Monday he's leaving all negotiating to
LaMonte.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got one year left on my contract; I have nothing to report,"
he said. "There have been no renegotiations. There have been no years
added to my contract. I'm not worried about it. It will all work
itself out."</TE>
<TE>   Gruden appeared to have taken the Raiders to the AFC championship
game for the second consecutive season on Saturday before the team
suffered a 16-13 overtime loss in a New England blizzard, a defeat
marked by a controversial call that cost them the game.  With 1:47
remaining in regulation and the Patriots behind by three, cornerback
Charles Woodson jarred the ball loose from quarterback Tom Brady for
an apparent fumble. Linebacker Greg Biekert recovered, and it looked
as if his team needed to only  run out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Officials decided to review the play, however, and overturned the
call, ruling it an incomplete pass. Four plays later, Adam Vinatieri
kicked a 45-yard field goal to tie. He clinched the victory with
another field goal on the opening drive in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go to my grave believing that was a fumble," Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people inside and outside the Raider organization adhere
to conspiracy theories, that the NFL is out to get the litigious
Davis and his team. The Raiders are quick to point out their two
postseason opponents were flagged a total of one time--the New York
Jets had no penalties, and the Patriots had one. Gruden sought to
distance himself Monday from the paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to go there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The NFL is not about that. I'm not going there at all .... Find a
way to win and there is no conspiracy. There are no theories."</TE>
<TE>   Gruden was--and still is--the league's youngest coach when he took
over a 4-12 team in 1998. After consecutive 8-8 seasons, his team
finished 12-4 and 10-6, winning back-to-back AFC West titles. The
Raiders reached the conference championship game last season, making
their first postseason appearance since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased and proud about a lot of aspects that have happened
the last four years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all sick to death about this season being over. But at the
same time, we're excited about the things that have happened to this
team."</TE>
<TE>   And what if next season is his last with the Raiders?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been called a lame-duck coach," he said. "But I've been
called worse."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As if a season of brutal basketball wasn't bad enough for the New
York Knicks, now they're being humiliated, too.</LD>
<LD>   In their most-lopsided home loss ever, the Knicks fell to the
Charlotte Hornets, 111-68, Monday afternoon for their eighth
consecutive defeat.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an embarrassment," point guard Mark Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the game, which saddled the Knicks with their
longest losing streak in 15 seasons, several players on the bench had
towels covering their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Don Chaney didn't like what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they threw in the towel. I thought they gave up," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Latrell Sprewell was scoreless on 0-for-9 shooting and the Knicks
were held to their lowest point total this season. The only other
time Sprewell failed to score in his career was Nov. 9, 1995, when he
missed seven shots while playing for Golden State against Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're treating the job as seriously as we need to,"
said Allan Houston, who scored 11 points on five-for-15 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "Our starters need to step up and make the right changes and hold
ourselves accountable," he said. "This was the worst we represented
ourselves since I've been here."</TE>
<TE>   New York shot a season-worst 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what it is but bad basketball," Jackson said.
"Top to bottom it's just bad."</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks' previous worst home defeat was a 132-93 rout by
Milwaukee on April 10, 1987. New York had not dropped eight in a row
since Dec. 5-20, 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis scored 24 points, leading six Hornets in double
figures. Davis Wesley and Lee Nailon each scored 16 points. Elden
Campbell had 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Thomas led the Knicks with 16 points."We just couldn't get it
done out there today," Thomas said. "It was the worst game I have
ever been a part of."</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Don't Ask Walker if O'Neal Is Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging from the blood and raw skin under the right eye of Samaki
Walker after practice Monday, the Denver Nuggets could be in trouble
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Walker was the victim of an elbow from Shaquille O'Neal, who
returns from his three-game suspension tonight when the Lakers play
host to the Nuggets at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "He was taking out his frustrations on me," Walker said.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, the incident was an accident and Walker was having a
little fun with the large media contingent at practice to hear from
O'Neal, who still wasn't talking.</TE>
<TE>   So Walker's injury became the news of the day.</TE>
<TE>   During practice, a lob pass went into O'Neal and Walker came up to
defend on O'Neal's blind side.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened next?</TE>
<TE>   "I saw stars," Walker said. "I almost lost consciousness and had
to sit down under the basket. I was pretty dizzy for a second."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who said O'Neal "gave me some love," was smiling as he
described the incident, and Coach Phil Jackson downplayed it.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq just turned at the wrong time," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kobe Bryant: "The cut made it look worse than it really was."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crews from almost every local television station, plus Fox Sports
Net and ESPN, were at the Laker practice facility in El Segundo.
Local newspapers and radio stations also were well represented.</TE>
<TE>   They were there to get comments from O'Neal about his suspension
and the Jan. 12 incident that caused it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, after being beaten on by the Chicago Bulls' Brad Miller
and Charles Oakley all game, retaliated by taking a swing at Miller.
O'Neal, for the most part, has avoided talking to the media since.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was no exception. He walked right past everyone and into
the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because Monday was Martin Luther King Day, Laker players got
together before practice to talk among themselves about the civil
rights leader.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big part of our history, and not just African American
history," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Denver, 7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 28-9, Nuggets 12-28.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Nuggets--3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The last time these teams played, Jan. 2 at Denver, the
Nuggets failed to score in the final 2:31 and the Lakers won by a
point. ... Nick Van Exel is averaging 22.7 points after he averaged a
career-high 17.7 last season.</TE>

<HD>It's Hit, Miss Time at Dallas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>For two quarters, Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Kidd matched each other
shot for shot--miss for miss.</LD>
<LD>   Ten consecutive misses for Nowitzki. Even more for Kidd.</LD>
<LD>   Nowitzki broke out of his slump first, scoring nine consecutive
points during a 17-1 run in the closing minutes, carrying the Dallas
Mavericks past the New Jersey Nets, 113-105, Monday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "They were playing good defense on me," said Nowitzki, who scored
39 points despite going more than 27 minutes between field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to stay aggressive and get my rhythm back."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd never found his.</TE>
<TE>   He missed his first 16 shots and made a three-point basket with 25
seconds to play for his only points.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had eight rebounds and 15 assists, including the 5,000th of
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed a couple of shots in the beginning and I stopped having
confidence for some odd reason," Kidd said. "Even though I didn't
shoot good, we had a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, atop the Eastern Conference despite a worse record
(27-13) than Dallas, the West's fifth-place team, lost for only the
second time in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas improved to 29-12, the franchise's best record at the
midway point.</TE>
<TE>   Juwan Howard scored 22 points for Dallas and Steve Nash had 19.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris led New Jersey with a season-best 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had 13 points and a season-high 15 rebounds for the
Nets, and Kenyon Martin had 21 points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks were without Coach Don Nelson, who left to be with
his wife, Joy, who had surgery Monday for breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson's son, Donnie, replaced him as coach.</TE>

<HD>With No Shot, Bettis Says He'll Be Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerome Bettis said Monday he is certain he'll return from a
seven-week layoff to play in the AFC championship game. He's also
sure about something else.</LD>
<LD>   No more needles.</LD>
<LD>   Bettis, the Pittsburgh Steelers' Pro Bowl running back, said he
realizes it was a mistake to get a painkilling shot just before
Sunday's AFC playoff game against Baltimore. The injection apparently
struck a nerve and caused one of Bettis' legs to go numb, preventing
him from playing.</LD>
<TE>   The Steelers went on to beat the defending Super Bowl champion
Ravens, 27-10, without him, and they would be favored to beat New
England in the AFC championship game even if he doesn't play.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bettis insists he will play, saying, "I could have played
about 5 or 6 o'clock [Sunday] after the shot wore off."</TE>
<TE>   Amos Zereoue ran for 63 yards and two short touchdowns as the
replacement for Bettis, who averages almost 100 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll definitely be the freshest man in the playoffs when he
comes back," offensive tackle Wayne Gandy said. "For a man like him
who is driven, who already is a hard runner, if he gets a chance to
play Sunday, he'll be running 100 miles per hour."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner bruised ribs in the St. Louis Rams' playoff victory
against Green Bay, but he isn't expected to miss any practice time.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterback was hit by Vonnie Holliday after a four-yard
completion to Marshall Faulk in the fourth quarter of the Rams' 45-17
victory Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays taken Monday showed no broken ribs, and the team said
Warner will participate Wednesday when practice resumes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore quarterback Randall Cunningham, who planned to make this
his final season, is considering returning for one more year.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, 38, played in seven games as a backup for Elvis Grbac.
He completed 54 of 89 passes for 573 yards and three touchdowns and
was 2-0 as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The AFC and NFC games Sunday drew an average overnight rating of
20.45, up 4% from the 19.7 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' victory in the late game on Fox drew a 21 rating and 36
share, up from the 20.6/36 for the New York Giants' 20-10 victory
against the Philadelphia Eagles in the same time slot last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers' victory in the early game on CBS drew a 19.9/40.
That's 6% better than for Baltimore's 24-10 victory against Tennessee
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The overnight ratings for Saturday's two playoff games were up 29%
from 2001.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Lemieux Sure Could Write the Rule Book on Scoring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux didn't make it a secret when he retired in
1997 that he was leaving the game partly because the NHL had too much
clutching and grabbing.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he's back playing, Lemieux is again making noise, this
time about the lack of scoring.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a concern for everyone, for the league in general," said
Lemieux, who hopes to play at least another four years if he can
avoid injury. "It's a different game now. Teams are so much better
defensively. There are videotapes every day. There are not too many
breakdowns. The goalies are so much better than they used to be.
Their equipment is so much bigger."</LD>
<TE>   To create more scoring, Lemieux suggests rule changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the neutral-zone infractions are slowing down the game
quite a bit," he said. "It's tough to get going because you always
have a stick on you. Maybe in the neutral zone, you shouldn't be
allowed to put a stick on the guy, like they do in football with the
receivers."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux also would like to see the red line removed and the nets
moved back again.</TE>
<TE>   "It would give you a couple more feet to work with and there would
be less traffic behind the net," he said. "There wouldn't be any room
for four or five guys like we have now. Most of the play would be in
front of the net, which is where the scoring takes place."</TE>
<TE>   They Call Him Lucky</TE>
<TE>   Former King Luc Robitaille passed Bobby Hull to become the most
prolific goal-scoring left wing in NHL history when he scored his
611th goal last week against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Being fortunate with the puck is a reputation that fits Robitaille
well.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a typical scorer--selfish, but that's why they're
scorers," a former King teammate who was not identified told the
Ottawa Sun. "Lucky was, like, 9-2 [nine goals and two assists] and
the guys were really getting on him, calling him Cy Young. They were
just riding him and he didn't like it. He said to us, 'I'll show you
guys. I'm going to get an assist tonight.'</TE>
<TE>   "He comes down on a two-on-one with Bryan Smolinski and he tries
to pass him the puck. The defenseman goes down, and the pass hits his
skate and goes in the net. Luc comes back to the bench and said,
'There, I tried, OK?' The guys on the bench were howling. The guy
would score even when he wasn't trying to."</TE>
<TE>   With 22 goals this season, Robitaille has scored at least 20 in 15
of his 16 seasons. The only season he didn't was in 1997-98 with the
Kings when he played only 57 games and finished with 16 goals,
missing the last 13 games because of a fractured foot.</TE>
<TE>   Football Penalty Box</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia forward Jeremy Roenick may be a star for the
streaking Flyers, but he recently didn't get too much respect from
sideline security at Veterans Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Roenick was supposed to do a sideline interview to promote the NHL
during the Eagles' NFL playoff game against Tampa Bay on Jan. 12, but
he didn't have the proper credential and was forced to leave the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "I go down to do the interview and this head of
security--Butch--decides he's going to be a big man," Roenick said.
"He was on some kind of power trip. He's thinking he's president of
the United States or something. He started wigging out on the
security guys bringing me down."</TE>
<TE>   Although Roenick eventually returned to do the interview after ABC
went through proper channels, his teammates are not about to let him
off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked the story anyway, but it was even better
because I saw it happen," defenseman Chris Therien said. "I was
sitting behind the end zone with my neighbor and I see Jeremy being
taken out by the security guards and he's yelling and screaming about
this guy being on a power trip. It was great. It couldn't happen to a
nicer guy."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   After getting beaten by Philadelphia's Donald Brashear in two
first-period fights Saturday, Toronto's Tie Domi finally gave
Brashear his due. "He has turned his career around a little bit and
he is showing a little more respect," Domi said. "It's a good sign he
didn't do any [showboat moves]. He could have, but he didn't and he
has my respect."</TE>
<TE>   Since picking up Brashear in a trade from Vancouver, the Flyers
had won eight in a row and were 14-2-0 before Monday's 5-2 loss to
Pittsburgh. "Chemistry is vital and you need all different kinds of
players for your team to be good," Philadelphia Coach Bill Barber
said. "Donald has come in and has added a presence to our team, and
he is not just a role player. I don't think there is any question
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Paranoia spread among the league's Olympic players after
Vancouver's Mattias Ohlund reportedly tested positive for a banned
substance. Ohlund's test came eight days after he had corrective
surgery on his right eye and took medication as part of his
treatment. "I have nothing to hide," Ohlund said. "People who know me
know I'd never take anything on purpose. What I took [acetazolamide]
wasn't performance enhancing. In fact, it's the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Although the International Ice Hockey Federation cleared Ohlund on
Monday to play in next month's Salt Lake City Games, there are plenty
of nervous NHL players around. "It was surprising and, at the same
time, a little scary," said Toronto's Mats Sundin, Ohlund's Team
Sweden teammate. "You have to be so careful and aware of any
medication you might take."</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the Week</TE>
<TE>   "If the NHL went to Olympic-size rinks tomorrow, half the
defensemen in the NHL would have to retire."</TE>

<LD>After almost blowing a 16-point third-quarter lead, San Clemente High
hung on to win a girls' basketball game after Fullerton Troy Coach
Kevin Kiernan called a costly timeout in the closing seconds Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Costly because the official scorer ruled he had none left with 2.6
seconds remaining and his team trailing by one point.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsey Pluimer made the two technical free throws and San
Clemente won, 66-62, in front of a capacity crowd at Anaheim Canyon
High at the Martin Luther King Jr. Classic.</LD>
<TE>   After the game, Kiernan said he believed the official scorer made
a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "They said we used too many timeouts. We checked every time," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no denying the star power of Pluimer.</TE>
<TE>   She and San Clemente's other go-to player, Sara Brown, outscored
Fullerton Troy's Alicia Komaki and Amanda Livingston by four
points--the margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Pluimer, a 6-foot-3 sophomore, scored 25, and Brown 17 as San
Clemente--ranked No. 3 in the region by The Times--improved to 16-3
and ended fourth-ranked Troy's 17-game unbeaten streak. Komaki scored
20, Livingston 18 with 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Pluimer had 10 of San Clemente's 35 rebounds, which were 13 more
than Troy.</TE>
<TE>   "This game has always been marked on our calendar," said Pluimer,
who added that it was probably the biggest game she has played--and
that included last year's Southern Section Division I-AA title win
over Irvine. It was the first time in several years that the two
top-ranked teams from Orange County played each other.</TE>
<TE>   Pluimer's play proved pivotal in the third quarter, when San
Clemente built a 48-32 lead.</TE>
<TE>   After Kim Buffum made a three-point shot to open the second half
for a 35-30 lead, Pluimer scored the next eight points, six on
offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>

<TE>   In boys' basketball games:</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 65, San Diego Horizon Christian 56--Mike
Strawberry scored 16 points and Wesley Washington added 15 as the
Monarchs (18-4) rallied past the Panthers (16-4) in the Dream Classic
matchup between the top teams from Orange and San Diego counties at
Azusa Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Verbum Dei 71, Downey Calvary Chapel 63--Verbum Dei's
Richard Chaney scored 25 points to win the Dream Classic battle
against future Utah teammate Tim Drisdom, who had 19 points for
Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney scored six points as the No. 15 Eagles (17-3), who trailed,
54-52, with 5:33 remaining, closed the nonleague game on a 19-9 run.
Ralph Miley had 24 points for the Grizzlies (16-4).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes the littlest things are taken for granted, such as the
freedom to walk on a high school campus without someone always
looking over your shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Townsend is so soft-spoken that hardly anyone notices what it
means to him to be a regular student at Sun Valley Poly High. He
can't wait to greet friends, try cafeteria food, hang out in the
quad, sit in a classroom and learn.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a second chance to do something with my life," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Townsend is a 6-foot-5 senior basketball player in his first year
of a real high school experience. He's averaging 16.2 points and 12.8
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   His life changed when his mother died of cancer in 1997. He
started associating with the wrong kind of friends.</TE>
<TE>   At 14, he got caught vandalizing a home. He was sentenced to four
to six months in a juvenile detention facility.</TE>
<TE>   Then he flunked a drug test, having smoked marijuana while on
probation. His punishment grew.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his high school years were spent at Camp Gonzales and
Kilpatrick in Malibu, Challenger in Lancaster and continuation
schools in Long Beach and Littlerock.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, he was set free, off probation and ready to test
himself in the real world. He had no contact with his father, so he
turned to his grandparents, Don and Diane Greenwaldt of Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I live with you?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He needed someone," Don said.</TE>
<TE>   He enrolled at Poly in August. He was scared. He knew what was at
stake.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was kind of hard because I was nervous," he said.
"What am I going to do? I told myself, 'You can't do anything,'
because it was my last chance."</TE>
<TE>   He got four A's on his first report card. He joined the basketball
team and made friends with his teammates. So far he seems to be a
good citizen at school and at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to do good, and basketball has given him
something to look forward to," Don said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Townsend: "I'm excited because I haven't really had too many
opportunities to do anything. This is my chance, so I figure I have
to make the best of it, try my hardest and make things a little
brighter for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend knew what he did was wrong, but like many teenagers, he
didn't think he'd be caught. He seems to have learned a crucial
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned everything you do has consequences," he said. "You do
the wrong things, you go to jail and waste your life away. Since I'm
not on probation, it's on me. I'm a regular person now. Anything I do
is my fault. It's my responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Poly Coach Brad Katz said Townsend is enjoying his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a kid in a candy store," he said. "He's a good kid
finding his way. I think the No. 1 thing he enjoys is being able to
hang out with the players."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend said he wants to attend college and become a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   "I can help kids not make the same mistakes I did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finally, North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake and Lakewood Artesia
played each other in a boys' basketball game Saturday. During the
1990s, there was always speculation who'd win the matchup. Artesia
was filled with all-star players; Harvard-Westlake had the Collins
twins, Jason and Jarron.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Harvard-Westlake won, 71-60. There was one player on
the court who's going to have no trouble upholding the tradition of
Ed and Charles O'Bannon from Artesia and the Collins twins.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Bryce Taylor of Harvard-Westlake scored 26 points and
had seven rebounds and five assists. He has grown to 6-4 and improved
his skills so much in a year's time that it is scary to think how
good he'll be by his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been feeling confidence in my shot, like every time I shoot
it's going to go in," Taylor said. "Every practice I work hard and
try to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor is one player UCLA and USC had better not let get away to
Stanford, Duke or Arizona in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be another entertaining game on Saturday night, when
Taylor and Harvard-Westlake (18-3) take on Loyola (16-3) and Omar
Wilkes at Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hall, the Marmonte League lineman of the year at Westlake
Village Westlake, has committed to Nevada Las Vegas....</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Marcus McCutcheon of Huntington Beach Edison has
committed to Stanford....</TE>
<TE>   Winston Justice, the Long Beach Poly offensive lineman who last
week said, "I'm a Trojan," indicated Monday he doesn't know what
school he'll attend. He visited UCLA last weekend and has put himself
in the "undecided" category....</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Ramal Porter of Van Nuys Birmingham has committed to San
Diego State....</TE>
<TE>   Brad Wright, who played basketball at Los Angeles Murphy High and
UCLA, has been hired as men's coach at Woodland Hills Pierce
College....</TE>
<TE>   How's this for a remarkable streak: In 27 years of coaching high
school basketball, Greg Hilliard of Harvard-Westlake has never
received a technical foul.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried refereeing once," he said. "I can't do it, so I can't get
on them."</TE>

<HD>Kapono Gets Half Right</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rummaging through the wreckage of UCLA's 96-86 loss to Arizona on
Saturday produced at least one positive thing. And considering the
Bruins scored 58 points in the first half and 28 in the second, it's
not difficult to guess where it was found.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kapono regained his first-half shooting form, scoring 14 of
his game-high 25 points and making four of his seven three-point
baskets. He looked for shots early and made them often, making three
three-pointers in the first five minutes and hitting another--from
NBA range--late in the half.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the first time in 12 games the 6-foot-7 junior had
reached double figures before halftime. Oddly, the only other
instances he did so also came in Bruin losses--he scored 16 in the
first half against Pepperdine and 17 against Ball State.</LD>
<TE>   However, he moved from forward to point guard after the Pepperdine
game Nov. 28 because Cedric Bozeman was injured. Kapono's scoring
dipped, but UCLA went on a winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We were 10-1 through my point-guard tenure," he said. "I'm proud
to say that."</TE>
<TE>   Now Bozeman is back. And if the Arizona game is a fair indication,
Kapono will get more open shots. His all-around game did not suffer,
either--he had eight rebounds, six assists and three steals.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono's scoring average of 18.6 leads the team, and his rebound
and assist averages of 6.0 and 2.7 are career bests.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm back at my natural position and that's good, but I enjoyed
point guard," he said. "I focused on getting my teammates involved
and thinking pass first. It made me a better player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (13-4, 5-2 Pacific 10) has not dropped two in a row since
losing at Arizona and Arizona State two years ago. The Bruins
responded by going on an eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, they bounced back from a 29-point loss to California
by winning six in a row.</TE>

<HD>One Seismic Shift Fits All in Big West</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an uprising of seismic proportions and it turned the Big West
Conference upside down.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine, undefeated and alone in first place, was stunned at
home by Cal State Northridge in overtime. But that paled in
comparison to other developments on Upset Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The conference's three bottom-dwellers--Idaho, Long Beach State
and Cal State Fullerton--all defeated teams ahead of them. The most
shocking result was Fullerton's 65-51 victory over Utah State, which
won the conference tournament and advanced to the second round of the
NCAA tournament last season.</LD>
<TE>   It confirms what coaches have said throughout the season: The Big
West is as balanced as it has been in several years.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (13-5 overall, 6-1 in conference) saw its lead drop to one
game over UC Santa Barbara (11-5, 5-2) and suddenly hot Northridge
(6-10, 5-2). Utah State (13-4, 5-3) dropped to fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's results also renewed hope for teams that have been
disappointments. Long Beach (6-12, 2-5) had dropped four of five and
10 of 12 before defeating Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win 10 of our next 13, we'll be in third or fourth place in
the conference," 49er forward Travis Reed said. "Everyone will forget
about the inconsistent year. They'll just remember that we got to the
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific (11-6, 3-4) lost both games on its trip last week but that
hasn't dimmed the hopes of Coach Bob Thomason.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the toughest stretch of anyone in this conference,"
Thomason said. "We've played five of seven on the road. But we've got
seven home games left."</TE>
<TE>   What it all means is when eight of the 10 Big West teams get
together at the Anaheim Convention Center for the conference
tournament March 7-9, all of them will believe they're one hot
weekend away from getting the conference's automatic NCAA berth. The
only team that doesn't have a shot is newcomer UC Riverside, which is
ineligible for the conference tournament until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Athletic Director Stan Morrison did everything but sell
hot dogs. He shook hands and helped usher people to their seats. It
was unlike anything Riverside had seen as a school-record 3,168
jammed into the Student Recreation Center for last week's game
against Utah State. Hundreds more were turned away from the first
regional basketball telecast at the school.</TE>
<TE>   And the worst possible thing that could have happened did. The
Highlanders laid an egg in a 68-42 loss to Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison hopes the performance didn't turn off the large student
contingent that turned out for the game. Students are admitted free
as part of their self-imposed fee hike to help fund Riverside's move
up to Division I but they had been scarce at home games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been said a million times that the toughest part of any
journey is the first step," Morrison said. "Well, we took that first
step. We got knocked on our butts but we'll get back up. What we hope
is our fans will do the same."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The second half was about to begin, an opportune time for Markus
Carr to open his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   His team, Northridge, was getting pummeled by Irvine, at one point
trailing by 20 and getting badly outrebounded on the way to a
12-point deficit Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   His message was clear as his teammates were about to take the
floor. Earlier that day, Arizona trailed UCLA by 20 points with 13
minutes left, but won, 96-86.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd seen [Arizona] fight back, play tenacious defense and I said,
'Why can't we do that?'" Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors did, holding Irvine to six-of-17 shooting (35.3%) in
the second half to force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Carr took it from there. He scored five of the Matadors' 11
overtime points, including three free throws when he was fouled while
shooting at the top of the arc with 1:35 left.</TE>
<TE>   Carr finished with a career-high 31 points and the Matadors won,
73-72. "I felt like Markus Carr was going to refuse to allow us to
lose this game," Northridge Coach Bobby Braswell said.</TE>

<TE>   The UCLA men's tennis team, already ranked No. 3, did little to
lower expectations last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo Grilli, a mid-year arrival from College of the Desert, won
the singles championship at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic on
Sunday at Nevada Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Grilli's championship preceded a victory by sophomore Tobias
Clemens in the singles final Monday at the Sherwood Collegiate
Classic in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' top doubles team of Marcin Matkowski and Jean-Julien
Rojer, top-ranked nationally after winning two tournaments during the
preseason, was upset by Stanford's David Martin and Scott Lipsky, 9-8
(7), in the final at Las Vegas.</TE>

<LD>Finally, USC has come back to the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   When the Trojans take the floor Thursday night against California,
it will be their first game at the venerable, some say decrepit,
facility in close to six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Senior forward David Bluthenthal likened the barnstorming Trojans
to the Harlem Globetrotters.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been playing everywhere; we don't have a home court," he
said. "Hopefully we'll get a chance to practice in there this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so long that we're going to have to get re-used to the
rims."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans last played at the Sports Arena on Dec. 16 against
Miami of Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, they have played at San Diego, at Loyola Marymount, at
Washington, at Washington State, at the Forum three times, at Arizona
and at Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   USC was forced out of its home and into Inglewood for three games
to open Pacific 10 Conference play as the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships used the Sports Arena as a practice locale.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas faces a similar situation every December when the
National Finals Rodeo takes over the Thomas &amp; Mack Center for three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how it is here," USC senior Sam Clancy said. "It seems
like we're always on the road, so it doesn't bother us too much. We
played at the Forum and got some wins, so the Sports Arena's no
different, really."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have not stepped foot in the Sports Arena since
beating Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "But we drove by it," Bluthenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After getting hammered by Arizona and surviving a scare from
Arizona State, USC dropped five places in the Associated Press poll,
from No. 18 to No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   And despite being in a first-place tie with Oregon, the Trojans
(14-3 overall, 6-1 Pac-10) are the lowest-ranked Pac-10 team for the
second consecutive week, behind No. 10 Arizona, No. 13 UCLA, No. 17
Stanford and No. 19 Oregon.</TE>

then-No. 13 Gonzaga. After playing at Santa Clara on Thursday,
Pepperdine faces this tricky Brad Holland-coached team that took USC
to overtime in December.</LD>
<TE>   * Baseball, San Diego at UC Irvine, 7 p.m. Friday, 6 p.m.
Saturday, 1 p.m. Sunday: Irvine plays its first games since the

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,
worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>\f7    What: "Stories From the Hall of Fame: Pro Football"</LD>
<LD>   Where: The History Channel, tonight, 10.</LD>
<TE>   A football show on the History Channel needs to appeal to an audience
of more than just sports fans. Maybe that explains why NFL Films would
select O.J. Simpson as one of the five Pro Football Hall of Famers it
profiles in this one-hour special. You don't have to be a sports fan to
know who Simpson is.</TE>
<TE>   But putting a segment on Simpson in the middle of a show that profiles
four other Hall of Famers--Y.A. Tittle, Red Grange, Marv Levy and Lynn
Swann, all quality people--can't be justified. NFL Films had 211 Hall of
Fame members to chose from.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion of Simpson detracts from an otherwise fine show. At
least it's questioned whether Simpson still belongs in the Hall of Fame.
Take away the Simpson segment and the show, with Howie Long serving as
host, is typical NFL Films quality.</TE>
<TE>   The show opens with Tittle, who played 17 seasons in the NFL, passed
for more than 33,000 yards and passed for a then-record 36 touchdowns in
1963. But he may be remembered best for the 1964 photograph of him that
is on display at the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Coincidentally, the
photo, showing Tittle battered, beaten and kneeling in the end zone after
throwing an interception, also was featured in a documentary on HBO
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Grange's pro career was hampered because of a knee injury, but he was
the first big-name college player to sign with an NFL team. Levy is
always a fascinating subject, and the segment on Swann is very moving. No
one could have expressed how much being enshrined into the Hall of Fame
means better than Swann did at his induction last year.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Rice and the Oakland Raiders are done for the season, but at
the age of 39 the future Hall of Fame wide receiver offered some thoughts
to Ailene Voisin of the Sacramento Bee.</LD>
<LD>  "Whenever I go out, it's one for the older guys," said Rice, who had 83
receptions for 1,139 yards this season. "I was reading some quotes from
Barry [Bonds], and I'm still living the dream.</LD>
<LD>  "It really says a lot about stereotyping, about getting into your 30s,
that you can't play football anymore. I never really gave in to that. I'm
still fighting, working hard, and I think it's paying off."</LD>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Another view: Former race driver Oscar Koveleski, on the secret of
life: "Die as young as possible at a very old age."</TE>

<TE>  Trivia time: How many current Clippers went to high school in
California?</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Figure filbert: Sports researcher Richard Lukar, founder of the
ESPN-Chilton Sports Poll, is not impressed with the increasing TV ratings
of NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>  "I'm not convinced the audience numbers are there outside of the
Southeast," he told the International Sports Summit.</TE>
<TE>  Lukar did, however, acknowledge that he was wrong in one assessment of
NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>  "I got a Christmas card from them. I didn't think I would."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Remember the Babe: San Francisco Chronicle reader Rob Brennan poses a
question to columnist Tom FitzGerald about the Oakland A's prospects.</TE>
<TE>  "In the wake of the A's failure to re-sign Jason Giambi, I wonder if
A's fans need to prepare ourselves for the Curse of the Giambino."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Expensive hobby: According to Ed Rush, NBA director of officials,
Dallas owner Mark Cuban, who was docked $500,000 for criticizing Rush and
his officials, "is just a fan. It goes with the territory."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  From the Yogi file: Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra, in accepting an
honorary degree from Roger Williams University, told the graduates: "You
have a great future, even if the future isn't what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>  Earlier, when asked how he liked school, Yogi replied, "Closed."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Prison life: Former middleweight boxer Ruben "Hurricane" Carter spent
16 years in prison for what turned out to be a wrongful 1966 conviction
for a triple-murder.</TE>
<TE>  Carter, in Arizona to speak before a Martin Luther King Jr.
celebration, told Norm Frauenheim of the Arizona Republic what it was
like.</TE>
<TE>  "It's easy to be angry, and everybody in the world seems to be so
angry. Well, for 20 years I sat in the very center of anger.</TE>
<TE>  "That's what a prison is. A prison is anger. It's humiliation. It's the
bottom of human existence. I sat there, in that. And I didn't belong
there."</TE>

<TE>  And finally: Columnist Claire Smith of the Philadelphia Inquirer likens
quarterback Donovan McNabb's success to that of Albert Einstein's theory

<TE>  "The true genius of Albert Einstein wasn't appreciated until he
simplified all the energies of the universe in one simple equation: \o7
E=mc2\f7 .</TE>
<TE>  "In the world according to Donovan, E--energy--also equals
mc2--maturity, multiplied by not just a little cool, but major league
cool, cool times cool."</TE>

<LD>I dated this girl in college. I nicknamed her "Snow Beauty,"
because one night it was really coming down and everyone on campus was
outside clowning around when I came across this gorgeous sophomore making
angels in the snow.</LD>
<LD>   I suppose I could have called her "Snow Angel," but who wants to date
an angel when you're in college?</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, she was a No. 1 draft pick--if you know what I mean--and I was
really infatuated with her until she got on my nerves and I had to dump
her.</LD>
<TE>   Now there's a real distinction between infatuation and true love, of
course, and I point that out because even though you'd think by now my
wife has canceled her subscription to The Times, what if you're wrong?</TE>
<TE>   The important thing is I fell in love with my wife, and when she got
on my nerves, I still hung in there. (Just an example of the kind of
sweet nothings I like to whisper in my wife's ear.)</TE>
<TE>   I bring all this up now because I'm kind of at the infatuation/true
love crossroads with the Clippers, who are really beginning to annoy me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I FELL hard for the Clippers a year ago. I was on time for all their
games, found myself writing little notes of encouragement in the
newspaper and listened to everything Alvin Gentry said as though I really
cared. I was so smitten with the Clippers, I didn't even notice the
blemishes--you know Michael Olowokandi at center and Lamar Odom slipping
out to get some fresh air.</TE>
<TE>   That was the way we were....</TE>
<TE>   Now I'd rather stay home on the couch and watch "The Eagle Has Landed"
for a fifth time than go through the disappointment of watching the
Clippers lose on the road. They've teased us, of course, with their
captivating play in Staples Center, but I'm not sure I like where this
relationship is headed.</TE>
<TE>   I hearken back to those final days with Snow Beauty and all those
times we went to the drive-in--coming home frustrated because we had to
watch the movie she wanted to see, and if only once I had gotten the
chance to see what I wanted to see.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I could have agreed to watch chick flicks for the rest of my
life, but Snow Beauty wasn't that pretty. Besides, I believe there has to
be some give on everyone's part to make a successful relationship, which
brings me back to the Clippers, who just aren't giving me enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised it's taken this long for someone to get to that point,"
Gentry said. "I told the guys at practice, 'You're not cute any more.'
That stuff we were doing last year was fun because there weren't very
many expectations, but now it has to be all about winning."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, coming off the favorable part of their schedule, are one
of five teams vying for the final three playoff spots in the West with
half the season having been played. With such a prize within reach, we've
come to the point where the Clippers have to give us something more than
just the usual razzmatazz at home, which I believe means trading Lamar
Odom and acquiring a veteran with leadership skills before the NBA's Feb.
21 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago I would have never considered dumping Odom, but then I
never noticed the way Snow Beauty used to rub her nose with the palm of
her hand as if she was trying to smash it flat into her face. I guess I
was the last one to notice her big nose, but that happens when you're
swept off your feet.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago this was Odom's team, but almost like a whipped puppy, he
has stepped aside and allowed Elton Brand to dominate--the only problem
being that Brand lacks the outward fire to rally the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can [make the playoffs] if everyone decides winning games
is more important than personal agendas," Gentry said, and I asked who
might step up and help make that happen?</TE>
<TE>   "We're still looking," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Rooks and Jeff McInnis were hired, in part, to provide leadership
for the young ones, but both have been raging disappointments. On Monday
McInnis showed the youngsters how to skip practice and get knocked from
the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest need the Clippers have is on-court leadership," said Bill
Walton before broadcasting Monday night's game against the Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   I suggested trading for Seattle guard Gary Payton, and Walton shook
his head no. I mentioned Denver's Nick Van Exel, and thought Walton was
going to shake his head right off his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   I happen to think Walton is the most entertaining basketball announcer
in the business, but I might change my mind if he continues to disagree
with me.</TE>
<TE>   Why not Payton? Odom is probably finished as a Clipper. He will be in
position to accept offers from other teams at the end of the season, and
while the Clippers can match any offer, I don't see Sterling paying big
bucks to someone with such a keen interest in experimenting with
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   There have been radio rumors Miami is offering Brian Grant in exchange
for Odom. I'm surprised the Heat isn't offering Pat Riley for Odom.</TE>
<TE>   What the Clippers need is a veteran guard, who can corral the talent
they have, win on the road, pounce on the playoff opportunity at hand and
maintain my affections.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think that's asking for much, but then I felt the same way in
my dealings with Snow Beauty, and that didn't go anywhere. (The good
news, of course, is it led me to my wife of 29 years and she doesn't have
a big nose.)</TE>

<HD>Afghan Journey Eases a Father's Pain</HD>
<DH>War: Derrill Bodley, who lost a child on Sept. 11, could share in
the grief left by the U.S. bombing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Derrill Bodley's search for solace after his daughter's death Sept.
11 took him thousands of miles from his comfortable Stockton home--to the
rubble of Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   As he waited for hours in a chilly office in Islamabad, Pakistan, last
week to secure a seat on a United Nations plane bound for Kabul, the
Afghan capital, he reflected on how the events of Sept. 11 mean different
things to different people.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, it was a wake-up call to try to understand what the right
thing is to do, and to do it," he said.</LD>
<TE>   By the time the 56-year-old, a music professor at Sacramento City
College, flew out of Kabul on Sunday after an emotional four-day tour, he
knew what the right thing was and was embarking on a new life course.</TE>
<TE>   While he was in Afghanistan, Bodley found his own grief ebbing. He
hugged the father of a 5-year-old girl who had been killed by an errant
U.S. bomb, and tapped out, on the tiny Casio keyboard he'd brought along,
an accompaniment to a haunting song sung by children at a local
orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   It was a trip he almost didn't make.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation, aimed at uniting families of Sept. 11 victims with
victims of the U.S. bombing in Afghanistan, came around Christmas, just
after Bodley had been treated at a hospital for stress-induced symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   His only child, Deora, 20, a junior at Santa Clara University, was
killed on United Flight 93, which crashed into a field near Pittsburgh on
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Bodley's stepdaughter, Eva Rupp, 28, had been urging him to accompany
her to Kabul. She had traveled on a previous trip to Cuba organized by
Global Exchange, a San Francisco human rights group, to study the impact
of the U.S. embargo on the economy there.</TE>
<TE>   Persuading people to go on this latest trip wasn't easy. Most victims'
families were too frightened to fly at all, let alone go all the way to
Afghanistan, said Medea Benjamin, Global Exchange's founding director.</TE>
<TE>   Three people dropped out, dissuaded by relatives who said they
couldn't bear the prospect of another death, given that bandits still
thrive in Afghanistan while a fledgling United Nations-supported
government tries to end the country's lawlessness.</TE>
<TE>   There were hints, too, that such a trip might be unpatriotic. After
all, the U.S. is still bombing Afghanistan, trying to drive out the
remnants of the Taliban regime and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Lasar, 70, whose younger brother, Abe Zelmanowitz, died in the
World Trade Center, and Kelly Campbell, whose brother-in-law Craig
Amundson, 28, was killed at the Pentagon, decided to take the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Bodley wavered. Lasar, whose brother died because he remained at the
side of a paraplegic colleague at the trade center, urged Bodley to join
her on the trip. Her first question hadn't been whether it would be safe
but whether she could smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, she'd gone from smoking a few cigarettes a day to
chain-smoking, an unconscious desire to hurt herself, she surmises, to
somehow share in the pain her brother must have felt. It's the same
reason, she thinks, that although she didn't want her sons to take a
cross-country flight or drive through the tunnels from New Jersey to New
York, she wasn't afraid to fly halfway around the world to a dangerous
place.</TE>
<TE>   A tough-talking New Yorker with a coarse voice, Lasar telephoned
Bodley and told him that if what she'd read about his daughter was true,
Deora would have wanted him to go to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Never a reader of horoscopes, Lasar happened to see hers as she
downloaded a crossword puzzle that day.</TE>
<TE>   "Your fellow traveler is not too sure where the journey will lead and
whether he can do it," the horoscope read, "but with a little
encouragement from you, it will come off."</TE>
<TE>   Lasar, who had run a small electronics factory with her late husband,
was going because she feared that others would die in her brother's name.</TE>
<TE>   "They cited him as a hero to justify collateral damage," she said.
"You know, from the kind of deed he did, that's the last thing my brother
would have wanted. By mistake or not, the lives of other innocent people
have been taken. I didn't want others to die in his name, and I thought
if I could come and get the attention of the American people, I could
help."</TE>
<TE>   The trip was put together in less than two weeks, and on Jan. 12, the
pilgrims left for London. After stops in the United Arab Emirates and
Islamabad, they arrived in Afghanistan on Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   As their vans swerved to avoid bomb craters on the hourlong ride from
the Bagram military airport south to Kabul, the evidence of Afghanistan's
23-year trajectory of tragedy was overpowering. There were tank
skeletons, minefields and, every few miles, checkpoints manned by
soldiers of unknown allegiance with Kalashnikov assault rifles mounted on
makeshift tripods.</TE>
<TE>   The twisted wreckage of a mosque reminded Lasar of the remains of the
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviet Union's decade-long occupation of Afghanistan ended
in 1989, warring internal factions destroyed whole sections of Kabul:
Roofs are gone and only adobe walls remain, if that. Women carrying
children and still shrouded in blue burkas, some in high heels, beg money
from foreigners. Giant, crudely fashioned scales weigh firewood; goats
and donkey carts share the streets with Toyotas.</TE>
<TE>Natural Beauty and Human Resilience</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the place astounds: Barren mountains are set against a
backdrop of soaring white-capped peaks. Colorful turbans, caps and shawls
reflect a plethora of ethnic groups. A child flies a kite--among the
first things banned when the Taliban took power--while another blows a
foreigner a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   "The faces are yearning," said Bodley. "At other times, the human
spirit finds a way to laugh and smile. Human beings are pretty
resilient."</TE>
<TE>   Bodley and the other visitors' exhausting schedule over the next four
days was packed with tragedy and pain: meetings with land mine victims,
children injured by U.S. cluster bombs, children abandoned when their
mothers remarried and deposited them at orphanages.</TE>
<TE>   On the sixth floor of a concrete building with no heat and no lights
in the stairwell, Bodley cried with Abdul Basir, who lost his 5-year-old
daughter, Nazilla, to an errant U.S. bomb. It fell near their apartment
building late one fall morning, collapsing a concrete vestibule that
crushed her.</TE>
<TE>   The two men showed each other photos of their daughters and shared
their memories.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on for 30 years," Basir said. "The two weeks of
bombing upset my daughter so much. She had headaches. She had
toothaches."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bodley: "My body grieved for 2 1/2 months. The body can fix
itself, but you never forget the grief."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody loved her," Basir said of Nazilla. "We're in the same
boat."</TE>
<TE>   Added his wife, Shakila, weeping: "I wish the U.S. government would
bring peace here. Our wartime government is in a bad way. Our children
are in a bad way. There are no proper playgrounds or schools. Whatever
help you could give, we'd be grateful."</TE>
<TE>   A few women in burkas waited outside, thinking that the commotion came
from a relief group handing out money. They were there for their share.</TE>
<TE>   No one can say how many Afghan civilians have been killed or injured
by U.S. bombs. Some aid groups estimate at least 500; other researchers
put the toll in the thousands. But no one in Kabul seems angry at the
United States. They were grateful for help in getting rid of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "We know [my daughter's death] was an accident here," Basir said. "The
attack on the U.S. was deliberate."</TE>
<TE>   He confided to Bodley that, somehow, he still thinks his daughter is
alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," Bodley said of his. "She talks to me."</TE>
<TE>   Bodley played for him a CD of a melody he wrote for his daughter. It's
called "Steps to Peace."</TE>
<TE>   The music just flowed through Bodley as he sat at the piano two days
after Deora's death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like she wrote it for me," he said. "This is the song my
daughter gave me, telling me to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>Mourners in U.S. Recall a 'Helper'</TE>
<TE>   At three memorial services in the United States, pretty Deora was
described as a "helper," someone who taught second-graders to read at a
school near Santa Clara University, where she was a psychology major.</TE>
<TE>   Bodley quoted Deora's mother, his former wife, Deborah Borza, as
saying: "She spread her light, and all of us have a piece of her." Deora
had written in her journal on an unspecified date: "People ask what,
people ask why, people ask where, people ask how, I ask peace."</TE>
<TE>   Deora wasn't supposed to be on Flight 93 bound for San Francisco, but
she was so eager to return home to see her boyfriend after visiting
friends on the East Coast that she rushed to catch a flight that left an
hour earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bodley found omens in Afghanistan that he was doing the right thing.
On his CD is a song his father, who was choir director for half a century
at University of the Pacific, wrote years ago about four girls making
paper flowers.</TE>
<TE>   In a center for street children the group visited in Kabul, little
girls were making paper flowers.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the music.</TE>
<TE>   With the Casio keyboard he bought for $30 in Islamabad, Bodley jammed
at a radio station with a well-known Afghan vocalist and sitar and tabla
players. He recorded the session for a world music class he'll teach when
the semester opens this week at Sacramento City College.</TE>
<TE>   In some jottings on the eve of his return trip to the U.S., he wrote
about his transformation.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually measure transformation over days, weeks or years--years
because we think in terms of a lifetime," he wrote. "I think I've had a
four-day transformation."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing how much pain people endure in Afghanistan put his own grief
into perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Things seem to fall into place when I see the tragedy here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's already planning to go back. He will be appearing with a choir in
France and Spain in July but hopes to journey to Afghanistan for the
remaining six weeks of his summer break to help wherever he can.</TE>
<TE>   Lasar, who is scheduled to depart Afghanistan later this week, says
she may never leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to devote the rest of my life to getting these people
whole," she said.</TE>
<TE>Thinking of Ways to Raise Funds</TE>
<TE>   Bodley is thinking of a campaign to raise money for Afghanistan on the
order of the millions Americans gave to the families of those killed
Sept. 11. He recalled that one day, on his 45-minute drive to work, a
radio station raised $60,000 for the victims, and he's thinking of
similar strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Americans would do more if they were less insular, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we knew, I think we would care, and I think true caring would make
what people need to do obvious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been asked in the U.S. to go back to normal. Normal isn't the
same. Our normal ended Sept. 11. If we go back to the same normal, there
will be another possibility of another Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Bodley also plans to ask other relatives of victims of Flight 93, who
keep in touch via an e-mail newsletter, for donations. He has received an
advance on a settlement from the airline and some financial help from the
Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money he gets from his daughter's death, he says, will go
to relief projects in Afghanistan. He won't say how much, but at Deora's
memorial, he quoted Scripture: "Lay ye not treasures here on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just giving a dime," Bodley said, "but giving until you feel
it. That's what I'm doing."</TE>

<HD>Former Exec Says Enron Destroyed Documents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. shredded documents after the company came under federal
investigation, attorneys for shareholders said Monday, and the energy
company said it would review the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   The claim that shredding took place in Enron's accounting offices was
made Monday by a former Enron executive who was laid off from the company
this month.</LD>
<LD>   The executive, Maureen Castaneda, collected a box of shreddings and
will be a witness for plaintiffs suing over stock losses in the Enron
collapse, said attorney William Lerach, who represents a group of
shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   "Not just one document was destroyed, but it looks like hundreds of
thousands were destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Lerach said he intended to raise the issue at a federal court hearing
here today.</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda, a director in Enron's foreign investments section, said in
an interview with ABC News that she witnessed the shredding of documents
that began around Thanksgiving and continued at least until she left the
company in the second week of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, previously acknowledged that
thousands of documents related to Enron were shredded by its Houston
office. But Castaneda is the first to say publicly that Enron destroyed
relevant papers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Howes, an attorney working with Lerach, said text was legible in
some of the shredded documents and included references to controversial
partnerships such as Jedi II and Chewco. Losses by such off-the-book
partnerships played a key role in triggering Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Based on statements from witnesses, Lerach estimated that possibly
hundreds of thousands of documents were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of
documents," Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney who is representing
Enron, said in a statement issued late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said Enron had issued "several directives" in October to all
employees saying that "all relevant documents should be preserved in
light of pending litigation."</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone violated those directives," Bennett said, "they will be
dealt with appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
said congressional investigators will look into the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute," he said.
"It's one thing to make bad business decisions. It's something else
entirely to try to cover up bad business decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Howes said fired Enron employees were told to gather their work papers
in boxes and turn them over to company officials, who went through them
and shredded numerous documents.</TE>
<TE>   He said the shredding began with the layoffs triggered by Enron's Dec.
2 declaration of bankruptcy, and accelerated during the Christmas and New
Year's holidays. He said the shredded documents were dated from at least
1994 through Dec. 20, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company does not "have any
knowledge of the material that the plaintiffs' attorneys are parading in
front of the media." But he said that if the allegations prove true, the
people responsible will be fired.</TE>
<TE>   The company sent e-mails to employees on Oct. 25, Oct. 26, Oct. 31 and
Jan. 14 instructing them to retain all documents dealing with
"related-party transactions, SEC requests, or any Enron transactions or
accounting for those transactions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The January e-mail was sent as a reminder after it was revealed that
Andersen had shredded Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   "These e-mails were very specific that employees who did not follow
these procedures were liable for civil or criminal penalties," Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer confirmed that Castaneda was an employee at Enron who left the
company in a recent round of layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   She was director of "foreign exchange and sovereign risk," analyzing
currency exchange rates and the possibility that companies outside the
U.S. would nationalize assets.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schiliro, chief of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles),
a senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that
if documents were destroyed, it "raises the real possibility of
obstruction of justice. We need to know if Enron is destroying documents,
and if they are, learn what Enron is trying to hide."</TE>
<TE>   Though many companies routinely shred old or sensitive documents,
business experts expressed surprise Monday that Enron might have
destroyed key records, particularly after the company became the target
of numerous lawsuits and government investigations.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 22, the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had launched a preliminary inquiry into some of the company's
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances, this could be a very serious issue," said
Nicholas Economides, business professor at New York University's Leonard
N. Stern School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   "'When someone destroys documents, people start wondering what was in
those documents," Economides said. "Even if they didn't say something
horrible, a bad impression remains. And at Enron, there's no
justification. Certainly no one could say they destroyed documents
because they thought they were unimportant."</TE>
<TE>   Former employees reacted with concern and anger to the new charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It does take it to a new level," said Maritta Mullet, 58, a 10-year
employee who lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement
benefit when the company crashed. "It's criminal. You just don't destroy
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   The accusations of document shredding at Enron came as congressional
investigators continued preparations for a hearing scheduled Thursday
into the destruction of thousands of documents by Chicago-based Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators said they will issue subpoenas today for
key witnesses who fail to commit to testifying at Thursday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee turned down
an appeal Monday from David B. Duncan for more time to prepare. Duncan
was Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account until he was fired last
week for allegedly destroying documents. Duncan maintains he was
following company orders.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently [Duncan] would like to have more time to refresh his
memory about events," said Johnson, who works for committee Chairman Rep.
W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is he will agree to testify by [today] or he will be
subpoenaed," Johnson said. "All the witnesses have been put on notice
that they are expected to appear and will face contempt-of-Congress
charges and criminal penalties if they do not."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the committee Monday, Duncan's attorney, Robert
Giuffra, said it is premature to require his client's testimony. Giuffra
said Duncan wants to review boxes of documents that Andersen gave the
committee but has not yet shared with him.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is Andersen's destruction of documents relating to Enron,
shredding that took place even after the accounting firm was aware that
the SEC was looking into the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In firing Duncan, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and
chief executive, asserted that the 42-year-old executive had organized
the destruction of records. The firm, he said, would not tolerate
"unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our
policies."</TE>
<TE>   In private interviews with congressional staffers last week, Duncan
and another Andersen official, Michael C. Odom, indicated that others at
the accounting firm were "at the table" when the memo regarding the
destruction of material was discussed, one congressional investigator
said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent a memo Oct. 12 reminding employees
of the company's long-standing policy to get rid of nonessential
documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Duncan and Odom said there were other partners and managers at the
table when the retention policy was handed out," said an investigator,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Employees were told to do no
less or no more than the policy called for."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, and nearly three weeks after Enron disclosed it was the
subject of an SEC probe, Temple wrote another memo instructing company
employees to preserve Enron documents. As of late Monday, she was the
only one of four Andersen executives summoned who has told investigators
she will appear on Capitol Hill for the Thursday hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry has been called to investigate who was involved in the
destruction of evidence, which documents were destroyed and why.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, who was in charge of risk management at Andersen's Houston
office, was told Monday that he would be called to testify. The
subcommittee also has summoned Berardino, who has been given the option
of sending a proxy and who is familiar with his company's internal
investigation into the document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance over the weekend on NBC's "Meet the Press," Berardino
did not indicate his plans for the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's bankruptcy is widely considered to have the potential to
become a political scandal because of the donations--almost $6 million
over the last decade--to both parties from the company's officers,
directors, employees and political action committee. Kenneth L. Lay,
Enron's chairman and chief executive, was one of President Bush's top
donors.</TE>
<TE>   A number of legislative efforts have been proposed to prevent a
reoccurrence of Enron's unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Monday that she plans to introduce
a bill this week that would prohibit accounting firms from also serving
as consultants for the companies they are auditing.</TE>
<TE>   The practice, which in the case of Enron allowed Andersen to earn more
in consulting fees than from actual audit charges, has been widely
derided in the wake of the bankruptcy as a clear-cut conflict of
interest.</TE>

<HD>Enron Refuels Energy Debate</HD>
<DH>Politics: The power industry moves to fight growing skepticism of
deregulation after the collapse of its most vocal proponent and the
crisis in California last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The nation's energy industry is mobilizing in the aftermath of
Enron Corp.'s collapse against attempts to slow down or reverse
deregulation of power markets, setting the stage for the biggest debate
over the issue since the California energy crisis last year.</LD>
<LD>   Electricity suppliers and other energy players are talking with James
J. Hoecker, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and now a Washington lobbyist, about creating a coalition of deregulation
proponents that will lobby Congress, testify at forthcoming hearings,
file comments on proposed rules and, if necessary, take legal action to
block efforts to re-regulate the industry.</LD>
<LD>   "Our concern is that some people are now saying that Enron could not
have amassed such an inflated stock value and done the things that it did
if not for the fact that energy markets have become much freer in the
last three years," said Hoecker, insisting that Enron's bankruptcy filing
Dec. 2 instead appears to have been caused by accounting practices
unrelated to energy deregulation.</LD>
<TE>   The national debate over energy deregulation was largely overshadowed
by the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes. But Enron's collapse has reignited the
issue, with critics of deregulation saying energy is too vital to the
public good to be left to volatile markets. Some lawmakers are advocating
a go-slow approach on further deregulation of energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot more skepticism about deregulation now," said Howard
A. Learner, executive director at the Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center,
a Chicago-based advocacy organization that favors a hybrid model of
competition and government oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Hoecker, who has been criticized by California leaders for not doing
more to help the state during last year's energy crisis, said he expected
a decision about the new coalition to be made shortly, but declined to
identify specific participants.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies, such as Dynegy Inc., already have deployed their
lobbying forces.</TE>
<TE>   One factor propelling the lobbying push was FERC's Jan. 15
announcement that it was moving quickly to hire a director for the newly
created Office of Market Oversight and Investigations, which will be
responsible for overseeing and auditing the nation's energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III floated the new office last fall,
but industry leaders fear that FERC may try to give the office sweeping
new powers in light of the Enron debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Wood, a former Texas utility regulator appointed by President Bush,
declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Commissioner Nora M. Brownell, another Bush appointee who favors
deregulation and competitive markets, said the industry need not worry
about punitive responses from FERC's new oversight division. She said the
California energy crisis, in which some suppliers were accused of
creating electricity shortages to inflate prices, highlighted the need
for a greater federal role.</TE>
<TE>   "To make the markets work, you have to have a market oversight
function that people believe in," Brownell said. "Before, there wasn't a
place people could go. When the industry understands that this is going
to be fair, they'll calm down."</TE>
<TE>Enron Leaves Lobbying Void</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron had been the most vocal supporter of deregulation,
but its tumble into Bankruptcy Court has forced other industry players to
step up to the plate to fill the lobbying void.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was the 800-pound gorilla for deregulation," Learner said.
"With Enron out of the picture, now everyone else in the industry can't
piggyback on its political and financial juices."</TE>
<TE>   Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's
largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled one in four
wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.</TE>
<TE>   Because Enron helped keep energy trading exempt from oversight by FERC
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, deregulation supporters are
bracing for an effort to bring the energy markets--and particularly
online trading--under more government supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Energy companies also fear that an Enron-related backlash might cause
some states to rethink their deregulation plans or prompt new federal
regulations that would limit how much they can charge and what their
access to different markets might be.</TE>
<TE>   California, for one, has taken a big step back from deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   To stabilize prices, the state purchased more than $10 billion of
power for utility customers in the last year and won't be out of the
power-buying business until at least 2003.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Legislature created a public power agency that is
authorized to build more power plants if private industry fails to come
through with adequate supplies.</TE>
<TE>   With these and other factors causing uncertainty, California
politicians are debating whether the solution lies in more or less
government regulation.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who helped craft California's
1996 deregulation plan in the Legislature, said California politicians
and business leaders must unite to fight Hoecker's agenda. The chief
beneficiaries of the sort of "wild West" form of deregulation Hoecker's
group espouses, Peace said, are bound to be big oil and gas companies
based out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Peace argues that California's experiment with deregulation failed not
because it was poorly constructed but because federal regulators in
Washington, unduly influenced by companies such as Enron, refused to
referee the market.</TE>
<TE>   Hoecker disagrees: "There's a big difference between reasonable
oversight and re-regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Other energy lobbyists stress that Enron's demise was largely
unrelated to its energy business.</TE>
<TE>   "The failure of Enron wasn't a failure of the competitive markets,"
said Dynegy spokesman David Byford. The Houston-based energy company,
which abruptly called off a proposed purchase of Enron in November, is
dispatching its lobbyists to Capitol Hill and regulatory agencies to urge
Washington not to overreact to Enron's implosion.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a member of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, rejected the notion that Enron's meltdown should
cause Congress to rethink deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron could have been in the Hula-Hoop business and done exactly the
same thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's swift demise last fall after disclosures of more than $600
million in losses and the existence of several complex, off-balance-sheet
partnerships is being investigated by several federal agencies and
members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Still, because of the California electricity crisis, further
deregulation of energy markets was already in some trouble. Now critics
of deregulation are pouncing on Enron's troubles to bolster their case.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has called an electricity
deregulation bill the "One Last Gift for Enron Act."</TE>
<TE>   But deregulation supporters say that Enron's troubles have nothing to
do with energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of a House
energy subcommittee, said her boss was pressing ahead on his electricity
restructuring bill.</TE>
<TE>   Barton believes that "Enron's problems were Enron-based. They weren't
demonstrative of a greater flaw in the energy markets or industry,"
Samantha Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>Deregulation Push Expected to Lose Steam</TE>
<TE>   "We need to figure out how to prevent future energy collapses like
Enron," Waxman said during a recent debate. "The answer will require more
regulation and oversight and oversight of energy marketers--not more
deregulation."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman contends that the theory advanced by deregulation proponents is
based on a belief that large energy companies will always bet right in
the energy market.</TE>
<TE>   But as Enron proves, that's not the case, he said, contending that
some of the company's problems eventually will be traced to bad decisions
about energy purchases.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, expects the Enron collapse to damp
enthusiasm for deregulation because lawmakers will want to sort out the
implications of the Enron collapse for the energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although some in Congress argue that Enron's collapse has nothing to
do with their core energy businesses or the energy markets, Markey
spokesman David Moulton said he doesn't know how anyone can reach that
conclusion without further study.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know the full extent of Enron's 'book'--that is, the
long-term energy contracts or derivatives that they entered into with
other firms. It is quite possible that there could be issues with some of
those other trades, but we won't know for sure unless we look," Moulton
said. "We're opposed to taking the government out of the business of
overseeing the electricity markets. You can't just take the government
out of the business and expect to get a good result."</TE>
<TE>   Learner of the Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center said the regulatory
"black hole" may have enabled Enron to inflate the amount of revenue it
was collecting from trades.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is likely to pick up Jan. 29, when Sen. Jeff Bingaman
(D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
has scheduled a hearing on what Enron's collapse means for energy
markets.</TE>
<TE>   More than $12 billion of investment in new power plants has been
shelved in recent weeks as financial markets effectively raised the cost
of capital and began more closely scrutinizing the debt and balance
sheets of borrowers, energy experts say. Such cutbacks could lead to
power shortages and higher costs for consumers.</TE>
<TE>Enron Collapse Didn't Rock Energy Market</TE>
<TE>   But Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Assn.,
and others contend that the Enron collapse proved that deregulation works
because it did not result in immediate price spikes, trading hiccups or
loss of confidence among energy traders.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that Enron's demise caused literally no dislocation in the
marketplace proves that deregulation can work," he said. "Indeed, dozens
of new and old wholesale players, with huge amounts of real assets, not
just paper assets, have stepped in to fill the void left by Enron."</TE>
<TE>   According to FERC's Brownell, "The markets worked with ruthless
efficiency."</TE>

<HD>Israel Tightens Its Noose on Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Pressure on the Palestinian leader mounts as troops move
on to Nablus after a landmark seizure of Tulkarm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>His headquarters is flanked by Israeli tanks. The road to his front
door has been blocked by a mountain of dirt, courtesy of the Israeli
army. His territory is sliced into bits.</LD>
<LD>   Day by day, Israel tightens the noose around Yasser Arafat. The
Palestinian Authority president, whom Israel holds responsible for
attacks on its citizens, is virtually cut off from the outside world at
his headquarters in Ramallah and is under an ever more stifling siege.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Israel launched another phase in its campaign to crush
Palestinian militants and relegate Arafat to political oblivion.</LD>
<TE>   Forces seized control of the major West Bank town of Tulkarm, in
Israel's largest and most extensive incursion yet in nearly 16 months of
fighting. It was the first time Israel has reoccupied in full a major
Palestinian town or city since Israel and the Palestinians signed the
landmark Oslo peace accords nearly nine years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli forces began moving into Nablus, the
Palestinians' largest West Bank city. In fighting on the western edge of
the city, five Palestinians were killed, nine arrested and an explosives
lab discovered, the army said in a statement. Four Israeli soldiers were
injured. A Palestinian security official said Israel had promised that
the Nablus operation would be smaller in scope than the one carried out
in Tulkarm, and within several hours of entering Nablus, the troops
withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   In Tulkarm before dawn Monday, scores of tanks and armored personnel
carriers rumbled into the town from all sides, firing mounted machine
guns against sporadic Palestinian resistance as paratroopers seized
homes, took up positions and began rounding up alleged militants. Troops
planted Israeli flags on top of several seized buildings, including the
home of Mayor Mahmoud Jalad, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The army immediately slapped a 24-hour curfew on residents, ordering
all to remain inside.</TE>
<TE>   In a house-to-house dragnet, 18 people were captured by dusk, the army
said. Military footage showed Palestinian men, blindfolded and hands tied
behind their backs, lying face down in homes that soldiers had searched.
A large quantity of guns was confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   "The people were caught by surprise and shock by the number of tanks
and soldiers who occupied the city," Hassan Khreisheh, a member of the
Palestinian legislature, said from his home in Tulkarm, where he saw four
tanks outside his window. "Some people told me they did not see this many
tanks and soldiers in the 1967 occupation," when Israel conquered the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Two Palestinians were killed in Tulkarm and two in Ramallah in the
day's fighting. No Israeli casualties were reported in either area. Early
today, after holding the town for about 30 hours, Israeli forces began
withdrawing from Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Tulkarm was a
hotbed of terrorist activity and the first of several West Bank areas
that his army plans to lay siege to.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said the raid on
Tulkarm came in response to last week's shooting at a bat mitzvah
celebration in the city of Hadera in which six Israelis were killed by a
member of a militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah movement. Since
Friday, Israeli forces have stationed tanks and armored personnel
carriers outside Arafat's offices in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to eradicate a terror network," government spokesman
Avi Pazner said Monday night. "We are doing the job that Arafat is
supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Pazner said the operation is designed to dismantle the "terrorist
infrastructure" that Israel believes was being used in Tulkarm by Fatah
militants as well as the radical Islamic organizations Hamas and Islamic
Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   But the United Nations, through its special Middle East envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen, said the Tulkarm operation represented a "dangerous
escalation" by Israel that will only cost more lives on both sides of
this raging conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, army chief of staff, said the Tulkarm incursion
is temporary and fell short of a full reoccupation because Israel will
not establish a military government there.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Chen Livni, commander of the Tulkarm operation, said his troops
can achieve only so much.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term, we can destroy the terror infrastructure," he told
Israeli television Monday night. "But not forever. Terrorism is also fed
by things that cannot be destroyed in a military operation."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government's stated goal behind all of the pressure on
Arafat is to force him to arrest suspects in attacks on Israelis,
especially the assassins of a Cabinet minister killed in October.
Sharon's aides say his ultimate goal is to so diminish Arafat's status
that the Palestinian leader's own people will decide they are better off
without him.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat responded defiantly Monday to his predicament, vowing to fight
to the death for a Palestinian state. He said Israel had "crossed all the
red lines" with its invasion of Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell these Israeli tanks this is not the first time and will not be
the last time they place us under siege," Arafat told a group of
Palestinian academics who paid him a solidarity visit Monday. "We do not
know how to retreat; we know how to advance."</TE>
<TE>   He said he will see East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian
state "either as a shahid [martyr] or alive." For all of Arafat's
defiance, some commentators here interpreted those remarks as recognition
that he may not achieve his goals in his lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials are trying to promote the ascension of a more
malleable Palestinian leadership to replace Arafat, who shares with
Sharon a long, bitter history as intractable nemeses.</TE>
<TE>   Possible heirs include Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, top security
chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip respectively. Both have been known
to deal with the Israelis in the past, and both command many men with
guns.</TE>
<TE>   But if Arafat's demise is deemed to be the result of Israeli
machinations, no successor is likely to enjoy much in the way of
legitimacy. A successor, in fact, might find it necessary to take an even
harder line to prove himself.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's aides this week were forced further onto the defensive when
the Israeli media suggested that the Palestinian leader was about to
resign or leave the Holy Land. Then, the media were full of reports on
the Bush administration's considering severing all ties with the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   It was all part of Israeli psychological warfare to further isolate
and undermine Arafat, his aides said.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, several right-wing
ministers urged Sharon to expel Arafat once and for all. Sharon's
response, in comments reported in the media and confirmed by the prime
minister's spokesman, was that he preferred having Arafat right where he
was.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better that he [Arafat] stay here, locked up, and that he not
cause damage from without," Sharon said. "He opens a window in Ramallah,
sees the tanks, and knows he's got nowhere to go."</TE>
<TE>   Until he was confined to quarters last month, Arafat was an
indefatigable globe-trotter who used his trips to create a sense of
international stature.</TE>
<TE>   As he reminisces over his past showdowns with Israel in general and
Sharon specifically, Arafat conjures days of perseverance and survival
against all odds.</TE>
<TE>   To hear him speak, he still expects to find a way out of this crisis
and, say some who know him, may not appreciate the gravity of his
situation and the extent to which his credibility in the West has been
eroded.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is certainly in denial," said a Western diplomat who requested
anonymity. "It's never the end for him. He figures he's been doing this
for 40 years and it's never been the end before. He always sees another
day. Even when others don't."</TE>

<HD>For United, a Smaller, Humbler Era at LAX</HD>
<DH>Travel: Once highflying, the firm cuts departures by a third.
Lifting staff's spirits becomes big part of general manager's job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just after 8 a.m. as Mike Scanlan paces into Terminal 8 at Los
Angeles International Airport, a rolled-up stack of flight schedules
clutched in his fist, his eyes scanning like search beams. Thick-chested
and spike-haired, with the wide stance of a policeman, Scanlan became
United Airlines' general manager in Los Angeles three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The station was in full flower then, a budding hub painstakingly
nurtured to seize the biggest share of LAX's departure board. For
Scanlan, the post was the culmination of 30-plus years with United--the
best gig imaginable for a self-described "airport rat."</LD>
<LD>   Back then, Scanlan's morning patrol was guaranteed to provide a
certain satisfaction, even on days scuttled by weather or human foul-ups.
Signs of United's ascendance were everywhere.</LD>
<TE>   But on this Tuesday in mid-December, Scanlan turns onto the concourse
and deflates. In what should be the heart of the morning rush, the
gleaming expanse is utterly deserted.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this, it's just awful," he said. "We invested a lot of money
here."</TE>
<TE>   But he has to move on, to shake off the sting, to complete the circuit
every day, just as he must believe United will rebound from autumn's
wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   In the months since Sept. 11, United has gone from an expansive
behemoth to a company "struggling for its life," in the words of its
recently departed chief executive. The new era has chiseled out a
smaller, humbler, more anxious community at LAX, where United once
generated $1 in every $6 of its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   United made deeper service cuts at LAX than at any other hub, slashing
departures by more than one-third and scrapping its Western shuttle
service.</TE>
<TE>   More than 15% of its Los Angeles work force is gone, laid off in waves
that began just a week after the carrier lost two planes in the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time you dealt with your grieving, you were let go," said
Helene Ehrlich, who was furloughed Sept. 22 from concierge service.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan's daily circuit has become as much about holding the remaining
employees together as about making United's planes run on time. His
unflagging barrage of shoulder slaps, handshakes, banter and
commiseration doesn't always work. But he's too invested not to try.</TE>
<TE>   "How you doing? Is everything great?" he asks a gate agent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm h-a-p-p-y," she spells out sarcastically, forcing a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan can't leave it alone. Each time he passes the agent on his
rounds, he checks her expression, smiling at her broadly, finally getting
one back that might be genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll work on her all day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, United ranked a runaway No. 1 in the numbers of
people it transported and employed at LAX, in the space it occupied and
in the array of places it flew its customers.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that success was achieved since 1994, when the airline
embarked on a risky, $300-million campaign to create a hub at the
nation's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   Over a five-year span, United steadily added flights onto a foundation
of Pacific routes acquired in the mid-1980s. It annexed part of Terminal
6 to accommodate the extra planes and built its own customs facility.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle by United challenged Southwest Airlines for short Western
hops, acquiring a fleet of 737s and refurbishing Concourse 8 for the
traffic. The company added about 3,500 Los Angeles employees, who found
the momentum infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the jewel. I was a pig in mud," said Tony Geck, hired as a
mechanic in 1997. A compulsive tinkerer, Geck loved the challenges posed
by United's diverse fleet, fixing everything from armrests to engines
during his midnight shift.</TE>
<TE>   "There was good flying here," said Holly Hightower, vice president of
United's local flight attendants union.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1999, United and its affiliates owned more than one-third of
LAX's departure schedule, flying about 50,000 passengers in and out daily
on more flights than American and Delta combined.</TE>
<TE>   But the muscular franchise was showing signs of dysfunction, even
before the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A series of missteps in 2000--from the labor strife that triggered a
summer service meltdown to an ill-fated bid to acquire US Airways--left
United internally divided and financially fragile. As a recession gripped
the travel industry, every layer of the LAX station braced for cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But because of the attacks, they came more swiftly and carved more
deeply than anyone could have anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan leans back in his chair in the same conference room that,
three months earlier, served as United's crisis center.</TE>
<TE>   As he listens to routine rundowns on weather, delays, staffing and
repairs, he can still see the room as it was then: walls covered with
flip charts showing the status of people and planes, and a long
rectangular table cluttered with enough phones for a telethon.</TE>
<TE>   The mess has been cleared away, but the crisis has not ended.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Scanlan sees it playing out each day in small bursts of
tension and volatility.</TE>
<TE>   He moves briskly through Concourse 7 just before 9 on this
mid-December morning, his head pivoting to measure lines and monitor the
interplay between employees and passengers. The planes are running about
70% full, he notes, but holiday volume soon will kick it up past 90%. He
searches for signs that the operation is ready.</TE>
<TE>   On his way toward the mushroom of gates at Concourse 7's tip, he
freezes mid-step, staring at the boarding area for a flight to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>Security Screenings a Delicate Exercise</TE>
<TE>   A "selectee"--United's cheery euphemism for passengers randomly chosen
for extra security inspections--is standing stiff-spined in anger.
Dealing with selectees is now standard, a delicate exercise that can
instantly turn confrontational, even a little frightening.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan stares helplessly as gate agents try to placate the man, who
tosses down his carry-on bag and some shredded luggage tags. Finally,
they're able to steer him into a discreet corridor. Scanlan exhales.</TE>
<TE>   The quantitative damage United sustained at LAX after Sept. 11 was at
least predictable, if bruising to company pride.</TE>
<TE>   Though still tops in passengers and destinations, it has dropped to
No. 2 behind Southwest Airlines in departures, not including flights on
its commuter affiliate. It has cut its daily seat capacity to 1994
levels. The shuttle--so emblematic of the LAX success story--was
eliminated in a cost-cutting move Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Since flying resumed, the logic and rhythms of the airport often elude
even Scanlan, the airport rat. Familiar airport routines have turned
exotic, and everyone's job has mutated, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Winn, United's counter-terrorism chief, used to be a backstage
figure who dealt with a closed circle of company executives, government
agencies and security contractors. Now he is part salesman, part public
education guru, briefing big-buck corporate clients such as Mattel and
Warner Bros. on how their employees can ease their way through airport
security.</TE>
<TE>   "This is high-powered business for us," he said. "They really want to
get down to the nitty-gritty."</TE>
<TE>   Security was always Winn's focus, but it also has become uppermost for
employees whose jobs used to be primarily about efficiency, convenience
and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan points to a customer service representative redeployed at the
screening checkpoint. Before, her most stressful duty was rerouting
inconvenienced travelers. Now she grapples with seemingly small decisions
that could affect planeloads of lives.</TE>
<TE>   She relates the latest quandary as Scanlan passes by: Would the
Federal Aviation Administration want screeners to confiscate a
passenger's expensive cigarette lighter, or can they simply drainthe
butane and let him keep it?</TE>
<TE>   The adjustments have been particularly stressful for employees who
face the prospect of confronting passengers verbally or physically. Hired
to be friendly and helpful, they are on alert for suspicious or
threatening behavior in people they were trained to serve.</TE>
<TE>   Many flight attendants, in particular, have struggled with the
anxiety. Can they fulfill these new duties? Do they want to? Hightower,
the attendants union leader, has experienced the changing expectations
firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told, 'Throw yourself at the guy and do what you have to
do.' I'm like, 'That's the plan?' " Hightower said. "This has changed the
function of our job, period. I have a lot of people saying, 'I didn't
come on board for that program. I didn't sign on to be a policeman.' "</TE>
<TE>Layoffs Force More Changes</TE>
<TE>   The layoffs forced still more changes, even for employees who survived
the initial rounds of cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Seniority protected Eugene O'Donnell, a mechanic with United for about
10 years. But he lost his coveted foreman-like position and was bumped up
from four days a week to six days. Although he works about the same
number of hours, he's struggling to get comfortable with an unfamiliar
crew on a new shift.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it harder to work," he said. "You can sense the friction,
even amongst the guys."</TE>
<TE>   One reserve flight attendant said she has been working more than ever
since the attacks because so many others have taken voluntary furloughs.
Her sleeping pattern has become so truncated by middle-of-the-night duty
calls that her doctor put her on medication for exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   She has thought of quitting, but slogs on, reluctant to be jobless in
a slumping economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I fly, I'm bitter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   United's continuing crisis has had even more dire effects on the 1,282
employees laid off since September.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Gavey thought she found an invaluable measure of security under
United's giant wings. She made just $7.93 an hour cleaning plane cabins
part time, but the job came with benefits and enabled her to send her
mother on a discount trip to Washington. Now, she has lost her Compton
home and sleeps on a sofa in her mother's trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting by, but it's a struggle," Gavey said, picking up four
bags of potatoes at a union food bank in early November.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists lodge in Hawthorne started the
weekly food giveaway program in mid-October for members in distress. With
each succeeding Tuesday, the lines grew longer, the prepacked boxes of
potatoes, beans and juice covered more of the office floor and the
chitchat became angrier.</TE>
<TE>   Gavey, like many furloughed employees, suspects her termination had as
much to do with preexisting hostility between United's management and
labor unions as with the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't put it all on the tragedy," she said. "They were going to
clean house anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Liberman, vice president of United's Western region, disputes
this notion, noting that the layoffs also have thinned the airlines'
management ranks in Los Angeles by more than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone to a few too many retirement parties for people who didn't
want to retire," he said. "We, as their company and their family, have
let them down."</TE>
<TE>Divisiveness Is a Concern</TE>
<TE>   Still, he acknowledges that United's employees--current and
former--may have felt so alienated from their managers that even the
shared trauma of Sept. 11 could not bring them together.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we need to work on: trust," Liberman said. "We're
divisive in the way we do things."</TE>
<TE>   For Geck--the mechanic who once was so proud to work for United that
he hung airline gear in his home--that divisiveness made his mid-October
furlough more a relief than a setback.</TE>
<TE>   As the airline's labor situation worsened, his job became weighted
down by bureaucracy, slights and reprimands, he said. On his last day,
only one supervisor of a dozen came over to say sorry and good luck, Geck
said, blowing air through his nose in a soft snort.</TE>
<TE>   All that gear with the United logo has long since hit the trash bin.
"I've destroyed anything that remotely reminds me of them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Helene Ehrlich, by contrast, has had a tough time letting go of
United.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks after her dismissal, she returned regularly to visit former
colleagues in the concierge service, finding solace when her regulars at
the Red Carpet Club commiserated with her. She missed the job's sense of
purpose and the excitement of airport life--the constant flow of faces
and stories.</TE>
<TE>   After a while, though, the visits "just got too hard, with all the
people looking at you like, 'I'm so sorry,' " Ehrlich said. Her uniforms
still hang in her closet, but she has applied to UCLA's graduate
management school. "That community was the most wonderful thing in the
world to me. But I'm not part of it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen supervisors file into the conference room tucked underneath
Concourse 8 and Scanlan kicks off the 9:15 a.m. station briefing.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only fog in Salt Lake City has put a serious snarl into the
morning schedule. Scanlan moans in mock despair after hearing that a key
early flight missed its departure time by a single clock tick. "One
minute," he said, "You're killing me."</TE>
<TE>   Then, somehow, in between updates on employee-of-the-quarter luncheons
and wheelchair-transport programs, the agenda turns to Sept. 11 and it
just won't budge.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo manager Jack Paluska holds up a book co-written by Lisa Beamer,
widow of a passenger who resisted United Flight 93's hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the honor and privilege of being with her husband in
Shanksville," he said, referring to the 12 days he spent at Flight 93's
rural Pennsylvania crash site. He rubs his palm over the book cover.</TE>
<TE>   That somber moment segues into news on another round of pilot layoffs
and on deadlines for new federally mandated employee background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Three months have passed and United's managers still haven't made it
through the daily meeting without mentioning the attacks or changes
directly related to them, Scanlan said, adding, "It's in your face all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the damage, United has not relinquished its long-held designs
on Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still the big dog," said Alan Wayne, the company's longtime
spokesman in Southern California. "We're just not growling as loudly."</TE>
<TE>   Liberman expresses his resolve by courting corporate customers,
personally calling a local paint company executive after reading that the
man had an unpleasant experience on Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan expresses his by walking the beat.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes all he can do with the clamor and confusion set off by Sept.
11 is tell it to pipe down.</TE>
<TE>   As he makes one final circuit around the check-in area, a recorded
voice suddenly blasts over the usual murmur.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to be emerging from a speaker on a short stand. The man
kneeling beside it, noodling with volume controls, explains that he is
testing a system that instructs passengers on how to navigate the
rigorous new screening checkpoint. He's with United, the guy says,
oblivious to Scanlan's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlan, deadpan, tells the guy he's with United too.</TE>
<TE>   "And my feedback would be," he said, cupping his hands to form a
makeshift megaphone, "This is too . . . loud."</TE>

<HD>A Valley Under Wraps</HD>
<DH>Hundred-car pileups, secret kisses and illegal drug labs are all
hidden by winter's tule fog. Among the world's thickest, it plays tricks
and brings stillness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>In winter's darkest months it hunkers down like a grumpy neighbor,
an unyielding enigma wrapping cold arms around the San Joaquin Valley's
belly.</LD>
<LD>   Tule fog is once again shrouding and shaping life in this vast land.
Outsiders know it best through news reports of hundred-car pileups on the
interstate. Lore has it the fog is a curse against the white man, the
ghost of a lost lake drained by a century of agribusiness, but in fact it
has been around long before a settler's plow dug the valley's first
furrow.</LD>
<LD>   An endless siege of valley fog can send the strong spinning into
depression. It can put off the start of school in the morning and mask
the movement of criminals at night. Golf dates fade away. Pesticides and
pollutants find a ready harbor in the mists. Planes are delayed, workaday
commutes become a nightmare. The National Weather Service office in
Hanford is fittingly located on Foggy Bottom Road.</LD>
<TE>   But the story of tule fog isn't all gloom and doom.</TE>
<TE>   The cold but frostless days and nights provided by tule fog prepare
the Central Valley's bounty of fruit and nut trees for springtime bloom.
And some find solace from the hubbub of modern existence in the embracing
mists. Tule fog makes life go slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a culture of the fog that people don't often appreciate,"
said David Mas Masumoto, an author and farmer, whose 80 acres of grapes,
peaches and nectarines near Del Rey lie in the heart of the fog belt. "It
creates a sense of solitude that makes you feel at one with the land."</TE>
<TE>   For those who don't go slowly, the penalty is high.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 3, a chain-reaction crash of 77 vehicles on fogbound
California Highway 58 in Kern County left one person dead and 15 injured.
A week later, tule fog contributed to six pileups on a Sacramento River
bridge, killing two people and closing Interstate 5 for half a day.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have tried most everything--flashing lights to warn of
fog, signs to help drivers gauge distance and urge slower speeds,
pavement markers to signal looming stop signs, CHP-guided convoys down
zero-visibility freeways. But the fog is never defeated for long.</TE>
<TE>   Locals tell of driving with the window down, braving bitter cold to
crane an ear for the sound of oncoming cars at intersections. Some grade
the thickness of fog by how many telephone poles they can pick out in the
gloaming. There are three-pole days, two-pole, one-pole. At zero, you'd
best get off the road.</TE>
<TE>   The truckers and farmers forced to ply the highways even in the
thickest muck rue the outsiders who come speeding into the valley, into
the thick of fog. Just ask the gang at Zingo's Cafe, a popular truck stop
on California Highway 99 in Bakersfield, southern gateway to the valley.</TE>
<TE>   As the mists swirled around its legendary roadside sign one recent
morning, truckers--their shiny big rigs parked outside in a tidy
line--sipped black coffee and ate biscuits and gravy or T-bone steak and
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, cars zipped into the gloom. "It's crazy--they drive like
idiots," said Bob Patrick, a recently retired long-haul driver.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Peacock, a retired pastor who frequents Zingo's, agreed. "It's
those little cars--especially the red ones with the smart-alecks in
'em--that cause the problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Highway Patrol can watch such racers on the radar, hitting 75 mph
in situations that dictate speeds a quarter that. But in the thick fog,
"we don't even go after them," said Eric Skidmore, a 22-year CHP veteran.
"It's unsafe to chase."</TE>
<TE>   Trucker Stanley Decker said the fog can so disorient drivers that they
turn into lemmings. They grip the wheel and follow the taillights in
front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the time years back when Decker plunged down the Grapevine
into a sea of valley fog. A long queue of passenger cars trailed behind
him.</TE>
<TE>   When he turned off Interstate 5 onto California Highway 43 toward
Wasco, "they all just followed right along," recalled Decker, a broad
grin on his well-creased face. "When we got to Wasco, my trip was done
with. But they had no idea where in the heck they were."</TE>
<TE>   Consensus has the fog at its thickest in the region just south of
Fresno, where the Kings and Kaweah rivers drain. This broad bowl once was
dominated by a sprawling shallow inland sea dubbed Tulare Lake. Three
Native American tribes plied its waters in tule reed boats, spearing
salmon and harvesting turtles. Tules poking up on the shoreline gave the
epic fog its name.</TE>
<TE>   Early pioneers quickly discovered the perils of the mist. The old
Butterfield Overland Stage used to crawl behind a lantern-toting guide.
Farmers would plow a furrow from home to school so their children
wouldn't get lost, according to "The History of Kings County," a colorful
1940 account of the region. Those that didn't, "hunted hours, sometimes
all night, for lost children."</TE>
<TE>   The worst account recalls two sportsmen on a hunting trip with some
hearty sour mash. Fisticuffs followed an inebriated argument. One hunter
raced away with horse and cart, leaving his companion fumbling in the
fog.</TE>
<TE>   It took two days for the man in the cart to find his way back. The
other wandered for a week, surviving on grubs and crickets before finally
stumbling half dead into Visalia.</TE>
<TE>Legend of a Curse</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1880, farmers began to divert the flow of the rivers
feeding Tulare Lake. The lake slowly faded away, but the fog remained.
"First the Blade," a historical novel written in 1938 by May Merrill
Miller, offers an explanation through a character named Indian Harry. You
may take our lake, he explains, but the curse of the fog will remain.</TE>
<TE>   That curse is, meteorologically speaking, considered radiation fog.
The right ingredients are moist, cooling soil and an inversion layer that
holds clouds on the ground. Thickness can range from a few thousand feet
to less than a dozen. On some occasions, a man can climb a haystack and
poke his head through a low-lying tule blanket, said Bill Horst, a valley
historian.</TE>
<TE>   While white and seemingly unsullied, this valley fog can pose a
pollution hazard. As it forms, moisture carries pesticides aloft.
Meanwhile, everyday pollutants are trapped under the inversion, just like
a smog day in Los Angeles, said Evan Shipp, supervising meteorologist at
the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Chilled denizens
ignite fireplaces, adding to the toxic broth.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the rows of grapes south of Fresno, farm worker Gabriel Villa
and his pruning crew starts a small bonfire of branches to eke out some
warmth on a foggy day. They work under the fog's muffler of silence. Only
the drip of condensed water from vines resonates. And the fog hides all.
"The boss doesn't know if you're working," Villa joked.</TE>
<TE>   That curtain came in handy back in Prohibition days. Under the cover
of fog, countless scofflaws would distill sour mash and "white
lightning," making Fresno County one of the nation's wildest and wettest
locales. Federal agents could smell the odor of the liquor, but couldn't
trace it back through the wintertime muck.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the fog hides the nations's top producers of methamphetamine.
The fog defeats drug agents' night-vision equipment and shuts down
efforts to tail suspects on back-country roads.</TE>
<TE>   "The fog comes in and that's it," said Robert Pennal, Fresno
Methamphetamine Task Force commander. "We've already had several
surveillances this year compromised."</TE>
<TE>   Above-board business ventures are also thwarted. Vern Cornell has been
a painting contractor in Fresno for 40 years. He loathes fog season. "The
paint don't dry," Cornell said. "And the fog stays days."</TE>
<TE>   Recreation is likewise curtailed. Keigm Fannin, an associate tennis
pro at a Sacramento County racket club, can't see the courts some
mornings. It is, he said, "like a blanket of gravy." After play, Fannin

<TE>   A typical year can see Fresno Yosemite International Airport hit by 39
days of serious fog. Flight delays were once routine. But last year the
airport traded in its vacuum-tube era radar system, the nation's most
antiquated, for the latest equipment. So far, said airport spokeswoman
Patti Miller, only three days have seen flights canceled this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots may be able to land, but they're sometimes stumped getting to
the gate. The airport has "follow-me" trucks that on bad days guide big
jets safely to the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, people narrow their daily aspirations. Just getting to work
becomes a chore. Shopping trips seem a luxury sometimes not worth taking.</TE>
<TE>   "People just kind of muddle through it," said Gerald Haslam, who grew
up in Oildale and is a coauthor of "The Great Central Valley," a
collection of photos and essays. "It's kind of an environmental
inconvenience."</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, Haslam loved the fog's climatic counterpoint to the valley's
scorching summers. The Midwest has snow days; in the Central Valley,
school is delayed in winter by fog. He recalls sneaking out to neck with
a girlfriend in the fog-shrouded parking lot of his high school. Fog also
helped in gym class. Ordered to run a lap, some would trot into the
cloud, cut undetected across the field, and return in record time.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few fogs are thicker. Dr. Samuel Omolayo, a Fresno State
geography professor, noted that in Chile some villages depend on water
collected from the mist. Belgium is notorious for heavy fog and
horrendous accidents. A 1996 chain-reaction crash crumpled 120 cars
outside Brussels, killed more than a dozen motorists and injured 60.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sellens, a Sacramento environmental consultant who grew up in
London, recalls youthful days of thick Thames River fog. "But the fogs
here in the valley are worse," he said. "I just try to avoid it--or I
drive with my nose to the window trying to see."</TE>
<TE>   Some people manage to turn the insufferable sieges into something
positive. Louise Bennicoff-Nan, assistant superintendent of the Dinuba
Unified School District, saw an educational opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   As a high school teacher in Corcoran, a prison town south of Fresno,
she started "fog-busters" a few years back. Science students came up with
ways to help drivers navigate the muck: High-tech waves of light in
headlights or sonar technology to guide the fog blind, roadside sprinkler
systems to knock fog from the sky.</TE>
<TE>Dozens of Fog Poems</TE>
<TE>   Tule fog has been an artistic inspiration for photographers, painters,
writers. A UC Davis Web page features almost 50 poems lamenting or
extolling the fog. The valley's best have found wonder in the mire.
Consider William Everson's dreary final words in 1948's "Fog":</TE>
<TE>   There has been fog for a month and nothing has moved.</TE>
<TE>   The eyes and the brain drink it, but nothing has moved for a number of
days;</TE>
<TE>   And the heart will not quicken.</TE>
<TE>   Mas Masumoto sees the reflective beauty in tule fog.</TE>
<TE>   In "Epitaph for a Peach," his 1995 account of attempting to revive
market interest in his farm's juicy but frumpy "Sun Crest" peach,
Masumoto talks of the tap dance of condensation, the enlivening chill. In
the pea soup, his farmhouse would become "like a lost ship, my porch
transformed into the bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Wandering through his orchards and vines one recent day, Masumoto
noted how the fog is nature's perfect refrigerator, providing the
necessary 600 to 800 "chilling hours" of needed dormancy.</TE>
<TE>   "If the temperature swings up and down, it's sort of like the trees
and vines never get a good nights sleep," Masumoto said. "They get mixed
up, they get grumpy."</TE>
<TE>   With early rains, this season's fog has been the heaviest in recent
years, though far from the worst, Masumoto said. When it hits, he enjoys
the solitude.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the reality of the valley. It's part of who we are," he said.
"And maybe it can tell us something.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's OK to drive slow once in a while. Maybe it's OK to stop
and listen more. Maybe it's OK not to see miles ahead. Maybe it's OK to
be in the present."</TE>

<HD>Kmart Seen on Brink of Bankruptcy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. edged closer to Bankruptcy Court on Monday after its
sole supplier of groceries halted critical shipments to the nation's
second-largest discount retailer.</LD>
<LD>   Fleming Cos. said it took the action because Kmart failed to pay about
$70 million that was due Friday. Fleming's move could prompt other Kmart
vendors to follow suit, and, analysts said, it sharply increases the
likelihood that Kmart will file for bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   "We are dealing with a crisis of confidence on the part of vendors,"
said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an
industry publication in New York. "This is a very serious crisis,"
Barnard said. "It seems to be well on its way to undermining Kmart's
ability to remain as a going concern."</LD>
<TE>   Kmart has about 2,100 stores and 250,000 employees across the country.
The 105-year-old retailer operates 164 stores in California--about half
of them in Southern California--as well as a major distribution center in
Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., was once the nation's preeminent discount
retailer, but has taken a stunning fall in recent years under competitive
pressures from price-leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and more trendy Target
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's stock last week plunged to its lowest level in more than three
decades. Although Kmart is seeking additional financing, a bankruptcy
filing by Kmart would rank as one of the largest among retailers that
include once-venerable names such as Montgomery Ward and Carter
HawleyHale Stores, parent of the Broadway department store chain.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainties surrounding Kmart have prompted some of Kmart's
vendors to delay shipments. But Fleming appears to be the biggest
supplier to date to withhold new supplies, and analysts say that could
spur others to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Fleming's announcement Monday, Scotts Co., which
supplies lawn and garden products to Kmart, disclosed that last week it
began delaying shipments to the retailer because of the "uncertainty
surrounding Kmart's financial situation."</TE>
<TE>   Those uncertainties were apparent Monday to Kmart shoppers, who said
they noticed some gaping holes in some of the store's food sections. At
the Big K in Burbank, eggs and sliced bread were in short supply, and
there were empty spaces where cocoa, nondairy creamer and canned tuna
should have been. Popular items such as Doritos and Kraft macaroni and
cheese were lined up in single rows at the front of shelves, disguising
empty spaces behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank retiree Roy Biederman, 72, scanned the shelves for the Ritz
crackers featured in an ad. "I can't find the ones that I wanted," he
complained, grabbing another variety of crackers instead.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart came off disappointing holiday sales, and its stock has been
pummeled recently after bleak assessments from analysts and repeated
downgradings from ratings agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have been expecting Kmart to take refuge in Bankruptcy
Court, saying that a Chapter 11 filing would enable the company to free
itself of leases on hundreds of stores that are making little or no
money.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said it is working through "financial issues,"
including negotiating to secure a multibillion-dollar credit line. But
the retailer has declined to comment specifically on its future strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, the nation's second-largest distributor of groceries, said it
intends to resume delivery to Kmart when Fleming receives "satisfactory
assurance of Kmart's performance." For now, Fleming said, only some
perishable food already en route to Kmart was allowed to be delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to protect our company's interest as well so we're taking the
appropriate steps to do so," Fleming spokesman Shane Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart is Fleming's largest customer, generating $4.5 billion in annual
sales for the Dallas-based food supplier, Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued by Fleming, Kmart Chief Executive Chuck Conaway
said Kmart's alliance with Fleming has created a more efficient supply
chain that made consumables "a strength of our operation." He said Kmart
was looking forward to resuming its "critical business relationship" with
Fleming, but did not say when delivery of groceries might resume or how
long its current food supplies would last. Kmart officials could not be
reached Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Until last summer, Kmart received food from about 20 suppliers, Boyd
said, the bulk of it coming from Fleming and SuperValu. But in June,
Kmart and Fleming struck an agreement that made Fleming the sole
supplier. Although it was unclear how long Kmart's food supplies would
hold up, analyst Barnard said, perishable items must be restocked in a
matter of days.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said poorly stocked shelves and messy stores have been
part of Kmart's problems. Although the company has made strides in these
areas recently, some say it still has plenty of room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart is spotty," said Marie Driscoll, an analyst with Argus
Research. "Some stores are really wonderful. Some stores are deplorable,"
she said, noting that some have dirty floors and messy parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart still has many loyal customers, including DeWayne Kinsfather, a
64-year-old gardener who has shopped at a Costa Mesa store since he moved
to the city 29 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd sure hate it if they closed this one," said Kinsfather, stooping
down to look for lightbulbs on one of the lower shelves. "You get used to
something."</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear yet how much of a hole the closure of Kmart stores
would leave on the retail landscape, or what effect it would have on the
communities and shopping centers where the stores have done business for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's history can be traced to 1897, when Sebastian Kresge and John
McCrory opened five-and-dime stores in Memphis, Tenn., and Detroit. S.S.
Kresge Co. incorporated in 1912 and became one of the nation's largest
general merchandisers. The company entered discount retailing in 1958 and
opened the first Kmart store in Detroit in 1962.</TE>

<HD>Volcano Expert Foretold the Inevitable, but No One Cared</HD>
<DH>Congo: Warnings of an eruption went unheeded and scores died. More
are killed in gas station inferno.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOMA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>Dieudonne Wafula is a prophet whose predictions were not respected
in his own land.</LD>
<LD>   Only last week, the Goma volcanologist warned local authorities that
the 11,380-foot Mt. Nyiragongo volcano was going to erupt--and soon. No
one heeded his warning, and four days later the volcano unleashed its
fury on this eastern Congo town.</LD>
<LD>   Red-hot lava covered about 40% of Goma, killing scores of people and
displacing half a million. U.N. officials have said it could take weeks
before they know how many people died.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, other volcano experts and aid workers were praising
Wafula's work. "Wafula has done a beautiful job with limited equipment,"
said Jacques Durieux, a French volcanologist who is advising the United
Nations on Nyiragongo.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Mountain, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy to
the disaster area, said the world body will use research by Wafula and
other volcano experts in determining how to help victims of the eruption.</TE>
<TE>   Even as relief officials were deciding how to respond, bodies
continued to pile up.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of people were incinerated Monday as they looted gasoline from
a downtown station. Witnesses said the blaze started when gasoline
spilled onto hot lava from a can being carried by a teenage boy.</TE>
<TE>   People in Goma gathered to watch giant fireballs from the explosion
soar into the air. "I could see the young boy burning," said Herman
Zagabe, who fled the inferno. "A lot of people were trapped inside [the
station] and they didn't get out."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of refugees who crossed the Congolese border into
Rwanda after the volcano erupted have returned to their ravaged hometown.
Many lack food, water and shelter. Local leaders and the displaced say
the U.N. has been slow to respond to their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are desperate and can't find the United Nations," said Charles
Mesafiri, a warden who protects rare mountain gorillas that live in the
nearby hills.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain, the special envoy, said the U.N. faces a major challenge in
trying to help the hundreds of thousands of refugees. Providing relief
services to people in Goma will send a message that the city is safe, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Durieux, who runs the Group for the Study of Active Volcanoes in
Lyons, France, said that even though tremors could still be felt several
times a day in Goma and surrounding areas, Nyiragongo posed no known
immediate threat.</TE>
<TE>   "The phase of the active eruption is over," said Durieux, who spent a
couple of hours Monday viewing the volcano with Wafula from a U.N.
helicopter. "The volcano is quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Durieux said he had received an e-mail from Wafula on Jan. 14 saying
Nyiragongo was about to erupt.</TE>
<TE>   The French expert was not the only one to receive Wafula's warning. In
a recent issue of a monthly Goma newspaper, Wafula warned local residents
that they could expect an eruption in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He said he made his prediction after observing that there was 10 times
more lava in the volcano's crater than in 1977, when Nyiragongo erupted
and killed hundreds of people.</TE>
<TE>   After small earthquakes rocked the area early this month, Wafula said,
he knew that the eruption was just days away.</TE>
<TE>   Wafula, 48, has been tracking Nyiragongo and a nearby volcano since
the 1970s. Over the years, his monitoring equipment has been stolen and
vandalized, yet he has persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, Wafula told leaders of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, the rebel group that controls Goma, that they should have an
emergency plan to cope with an eruption. Wafula and the rebels said that
Japanese experts were brought in but that they discounted the
predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Wafula acknowledged that the attention being paid to his work means he
will probably get better equipment to predict eruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the authorities and Goma residents would heed his
warnings next time, he chuckled and said: "Certainly. They'll have to."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Graft Probe May Set Off Political War</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Inquiry by Fox administration into state-owned oil
firm could be a major blow to the former ruling party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox may have caught the first big fish of his
anti-corruption campaign--although this catch could prove to be a shark
that bites back.</LD>
<LD>   Auditor General Francisco Barrio said over the weekend that his office
is investigating charges that executives of Pemex, the state-owned oil
company, siphoned off at least $120 million and channeled it to the oil
workers union in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican media said federal prosecutors are going further,
investigating whether the union funneled the money to the failed
presidential campaign of the former ruling party.</LD>
<TE>   If true, that would be a huge blow to the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, which lost the presidency to Fox after 71 years in power. The PRI,
as the party is known, is trying to revive after a string of electoral
defeats since Fox's decisive victory in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Fox built his campaign on a promise to attack the corruption that he
said had infected successive PRI governments and undermined the rule of
law. He named Barrio, a former Chihuahua state governor from Fox's
center-right National Action Party, to the auditor general's post with
instructions to go after corruption.</TE>
<TE>   During the new administration's first year, Barrio appeared to make
little progress, leaving many Mexicans with the impression that Fox would
tread softly on wrongdoing by his predecessors. The suspicion was that
Fox was going easy in return for support for his legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   But the gravity of the allegations against Pemex officials suggests a
tougher approach, apparently including a money-laundering probe by
organized-crime investigators that allegedly has led to orders to place
three midlevel PRI officials under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   PRI leaders are fighting back, suggesting that new confrontations may
now loom between the former ruling party and Fox's government.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Humberto Roque Villanueva called Barrio's public disclosure of
the probe "a political declaration of war." Villanueva said Fox is
attacking the PRI because the party refused to support his tax reform
proposal, which was virtually rewritten by the PRI-dominated Congress
last month.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar also raised the issue of how Mexico will approach the
critical issue of energy reform, another of Fox's central campaign
themes.</TE>
<TE>   PRI President Dulce Maria Sauri told reporters that Fox apparently is
trying to undermine Pemex so he can move toward privatizing the huge oil
company. Pemex, short for Petroleos Mexicanos, was nationalized in 1938,
and its status as a state-owned cash cow remains a matter of pride for
many Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex has long been accused of improperly backing the PRI. During the
2000 campaign, a whistle-blowing employee in Tabasco state accused
management of pressuring employees to donate to the party and work for
it. Pemex officials angrily denied that accusation.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Monday, Fox insisted that he does not want to privatize
Pemex, but he argued that the nation's energy industry desperately needs
to be modernized if the economy is to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Barrio said in a radio interview Monday that his investigators had
detected two unusual payments made in 2000 by Pemex to its union,
totaling about $120 million, which he said appeared to be illegal. He
said his office had turned that information over to the attorney
general's office, which had launched its own probe. Barrio said his
office did not determine what the union did with the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican media, quoting sources in the attorney general's
organized-crime division, said the union apparently deposited the money
into several bank accounts and then transferred it to PRI coffers to help
pay for the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Reforma newspaper said the attorney general's office was building a
case of money laundering against those involved, including former Pemex
chief Rogelio Montemayor, who was active in the losing campaign of PRI
presidential candidate Francisco Labastida, and union chief Carlos Romero
Deschamps.</TE>
<TE>   La Jornada, which broke the story Saturday, said three senior PRI
officials had been under house arrest since December in what the federal
organized-crime unit was calling "Operation Crude."</TE>

<HD>Kremlin Shuts Down TV Station</HD>

<LD>Russian authorities blacked out private television station TV6
today, pulling the plug mid-broadcast in what critics called a bid to
silence the last national broadcaster willing to challenge the Kremlin
and President Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<LD>   Mass Communications Minister Mikhail Y. Lesin said he had no choice
but to close down TV6 after a court ordered the station's license revoked
late Monday, but the explanation drew cynical comments from analysts and
the staff.</LD>
<LD>   "The Kremlin is preparing for the next presidential election, and it
wants all four federal channels singing the same tune of loyalty and
approval," said Igor M. Klyamkin, director of the Institute of
Sociological Analysis, a Russian think tank.</LD>
<TE>   He predicted a chill will be felt by any who think of questioning
central authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kremlin demonstrated to every mass medium, to every journalist,
that it can close down a major television channel just like that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The revocation left Russia for the first time since 1991 without a
national broadcaster consistently willing to challenge the Kremlin line.
The remaining channels are either owned or controlled by the state or
focus on entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   TV6 was staffed largely by journalists and others who resigned in
April from another station, NTV, when it was taken over by the
government-controlled gas monopoly, Gazprom. In the past nine months, the
staff transformed the little-watched TV6, boosting its ratings so that
they often surpassed those of the state-owned ORT and RTR networks.</TE>
<TE>   But TV6's legal troubles mounted, adding to the belief that they had
more to do with politics than business.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to close TV6 culminated a campaign by a minority
shareholder, the Lukoil pension fund, which won a court order Jan. 11 to
liquidate the station based on an obscure and rarely enforced debt law
that was changed after the case was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Until Monday, the Mass Communications Ministry had been hinting that
the station could go on broadcasting and that its staff would acquire a
new license if it broke with TV6's owner, self-exiled oligarch Boris A.
Berezovsky.</TE>
<TE>   But the channel was shut off just after midnight in the midst of
"Nightingale's Night," while a presenter was singing folk ballads with
his guest. First the screen went blank. That was followed by a test
pattern, and then it went blank for good.</TE>
<TE>   "The speed and efficiency with which these people operate is
incredible, especially in the country where hundreds, if not thousands,
of people are sitting in prison for months and years waiting for trial,"
said network spokeswoman Tatyana Blinova. She said the station would have
to wait until daytime to try to get the shutdown reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Svetlana Sorokina, one of the country's best-liked news
personalities, sounded dejected in an early-morning telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sitting here looking at the black screen, and I know the worst
has happened, but it is still hard to believe and even harder to accept,"
she said. "Well, for me it means that I have lost my job. And most likely
my career in television."</TE>

<HD>Germany's Greens Struggle to Stay Politically Viable</HD>
<DH>Europe: Party decides to put a face with its name to improve its
chances in upcoming elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Like all endangered species, the Greens have learned that
adaptation is the key to survival.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the party leadership decided to break with tradition and
name a lead candidate for this year's German federal election: Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, who, unlike his party, has enjoyed steadily
rising popularity with voters.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-1 vote by the leadership council to designate Fischer the
party's de facto candidate for chancellor was the clearest indication yet
that the oft-idealistic environmentalists recognize the need for an
internal shake-up if they want to stay in power.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout its 22-year existence, the Greens party has refused to put
a single face on electoral aspirations, asking voters to endorse its
policies instead. However, the party has lost ground in state balloting
during its three-year coalition with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the Greens' defeats have cost the Social Democrats
their right to govern, as occurred last fall in Hamburg. That erosion of
support threatens the future of both parties as they face an invigorated
opposition in the Sept. 22 federal vote.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, a feisty and articulate 53-year-old, is the country's most
popular politician and the embodiment of the middle-aged German leftist
now more comfortable with armchair-quarterbacking reform than inciting
revolution. By abandoning the tenet that naming a top candidate corrupts
politics with "personalization," the Greens are hoping to ride Fischer's
coattails and receive the minimum 5% of votes needed to be awarded seats
in state and federal parliaments.</TE>
<TE>   The same national polls showing Fischer atop the list of most trusted
politicians also show the Greens as a party flirting with irrelevance.
The Dimap polling group over the weekend forecast just a 5% share of the
federal vote for the party and 37% for Schroeder's Social Democrats,
suggesting that the two governing partners would be ousted from power if
the elections were held now.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder enjoys wide respect and came in just behind Fischer on
Monday in the latest survey published by Der Spiegel magazine. He has
introduced watershed tax and pension reforms and steered Germans into a
more activist role in international affairs. But with the world's
third-largest economy in recession and unemployment at 10%, he is
vulnerable to the criticism of conservative opponent Edmund Stoiber of
the Christian Social Union that the chancellor has failed to deliver on
1998 election promises.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts show the CSU and its larger sister party, the Christian
Democratic Union, garnering as much support, or more, as Schroeder's
Social Democrats. The conservatives' usual partner in government, the
pro-business Free Democratic Party, poll about 9%. The Free Democrats
could play the role of kingmaker and have openly pondered a federal
alliance with Schroeder if the Greens fail to win enough votes.</TE>
<TE>   That fate may suit Schroeder anyway, as the Greens have been a source
of international embarrassment and internal consternation throughout most
of his tenure. Just two months ago, eight Greens members of the federal
Parliament refused to support the government's decision to send troops to
help in the U.S.-led war against terrorism, prompting Schroeder to call a
vote of confidence that he won only by strong-arming four of the eight
rebels into changing their position.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the naming of Fischer as party candidate, there is
another sign that the Greens are moving toward the mainstream. Several of
the party purists who refused to endorse the troop deployment appear to
have been dropped from the list of reelection candidates.</TE>
<TE>   At a weekend session here, Berlin Greens scratched die-hard pacifist
Hans-Christian Stroebele in favor of human rights activist Werner Schulz,
a more moderate member from the formerly Communist eastern states. At
least three other Greens who joined Stroebele in fighting the deployment
appear likely to be edged out when party leaders in their states complete
the list of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Under German law, any citizen can run for a seat in Parliament to
represent his or her electoral district after meeting routine nomination
and eligibility requirements. But half of the 598 seats to be decided
this year will be apportioned to candidates ranked on party lists,
according to the share of the vote won by the parties that garnered 5% or
more of the total.</TE>
<TE>   German voters get two ballots, one to choose their local
representative and one to show support for a party. There is no direct
vote for chancellor. The party drawing the biggest share of the vote
earns the right to lead coalition talks, and the lead candidate of the
highest-drawing party in the coalition traditionally becomes chancellor.</TE>

<LD>Prime Minister Jean-Marie Cherestal, who faced a rising tide of
criticism even from members of the ruling party over his failure to deal
with Haiti's political and economic woes, formally resigned.</LD>
<LD>   It was not clear when President Jean-Bertrand Aristide would pick a
successor.</LD>
<LD>   Cherestal, who was charged with the day-to-day running of government,
was picked by Aristide about a year ago. But the economy has continued to
deteriorate, and political leaders have failed to resolve a dispute over
legislative elections in May 2000 that has held up much-needed
international aid.</LD>

<DL>DURBAN, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>A key AIDS drug that reduces the chances of HIV-positive pregnant
mothers transmitting the virus to their children at birth is to be made
available in South Africa's most AIDS-stricken province, an official said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to make the drug available at public hospitals in the
eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, which is controlled by the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, runs counter to a national health
department directive restricting the drug's use to a few pilot sites.</LD>
<LD>   Nevirapine is approved by the World Health Organization, and studies
show it can reduce the rate of mother-to-child HIV infection by up to
50%. But the South African government says that its safety remains
unproven and that inadequate structures are in place to administer it.</LD>
<TE>   Government studies indicate more than one in three people in
KwaZulu-Natal are HIV-positive.</TE>

<LD>Gunmen riding as passengers on two motorcycles attacked the
American Center in Calcutta about 6:30 a.m. today as the building's
security guards were changing shifts, police and U.S. Embassy officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The attackers pulled assault rifles from under their shawls and opened
fire on police guards, killing four and injuring at least 21 other
people, one seriously, police said.</LD>
<LD>   No one was in the building when the shootout occurred, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon Duguid, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in New Delhi, the capital,
said no U.S. staff members were hurt.</TE>
<TE>   One official said the wounded included 11 state police officers, nine
pedestrians and one private security guard.</TE>
<TE>   "This was definitely an attack on the American . . . Center by
terrorists of some group or another," said Sujay Chakraborty, the police
commissioner in the eastern Indian city. The attackers escaped.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Home Ministry official told Associated Press that a man
phoned police in New Delhi and said the attack had been carried out by
Harkat-ul Jehad-e-Islami, a Pakistan-based militant group. The claim
could not be immediately verified.</TE>
<TE>   Chakraborty and Suresh Roy, joint commissioner of police in New Delhi,
said police had intelligence reports warning of possible attacks. But
such threats are common in India, and none of the recent ones were
specific, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Center is a U.S. government building housing a library, a
public affairs office and a press section, as well as a wing where
cultural programs are held.</TE>
<TE>   Police have descriptions of the motorcycles used in the attack and are
following other leads that should bring arrests soon, Chakraborty said.</TE>
<TE>   Security was put on high alert at the U.S. Embassy in the capital and
at U.S. consulates and other facilities around the country after the
assault, Roy said on Indian television this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of Indian and Pakistani troops are facing each
other in a military standoff sparked by a Dec. 13 terrorist attack on
India's Parliament, which New Delhi blames on two Pakistan-based groups.</TE>

<HD>China Says Radicals Led Attacks and Colluded With Bin Laden</HD>
<DH>Asia: Report blames Muslims in restive Xinjiang for 162 deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Keeping up the rhetoric against alleged terrorists in its
westernmost outpost, the Chinese government Monday accused Muslim
radicals of masterminding attacks throughout the country and colluding
with the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Beijing said that "East Turkestan terrorists," including Muslim
militants among the Turkic-speaking Uighurs under Chinese rule in the
Xinjiang region, were responsible for killing 162 people between 1990 and
2001 in a campaign of bombings, arson and poisonings. The assaults were
designed to "sabotage national unity and create an atmosphere of terror,"
the government said.</LD>
<LD>   The attackers "brazenly preached a 'holy war,' the 'elimination of
pagans' and the setting up of an 'East Turkestan Republic,' " says a
10-page report issued to foreign journalists Monday by the State Council,
China's Cabinet.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States and the subsequent war
in Afghanistan, Beijing has sought to link its problems in Xinjiang to
the global anti-terrorism agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The report alleges that Taliban leaders and Bin Laden aided Uighur and
other extremists, promising training and a "fabulous sum" of money last
year for their operations.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese police have arrested more than 100 people who allegedly were
trained in camps in Afghanistan and elsewhere and then crossed into
China, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Critics accuse Beijing of using the international war on terrorism as
political cover for its crackdown on dissent among Xinjiang's Uighurs,
many of whom resent Chinese rule and policies that they say are
discriminatory and keep them mired in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   China claims historical sovereignty over the area, a region rich in
natural resources. The government has tried before to blame unrest on
Muslim radicals carrying out a jihad, or holy struggle. However, in
perhaps a deliberate echo of statements by President Bush, its new report
says Chinese officials recognized that Islam "is a peace-loving
religion."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem for them is that they can't really establish that it is
jihad," said Dru C. Gladney, an expert on Central Asian peoples at the
University of Hawaii. "When you talk to the Uighurs and the
organizations, they always come back and say, 'No, Islam is one issue
among many' " that also include sovereignty and human rights.</TE>
<TE>   The State Council's report denies that the Chinese government is
engaged in a campaign of suppression, despite periodic arrests and
executions of suspected separatists in Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go by population," the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang,
Wang Lequan, said in a recently published interview, "the number of death
sentences in Xinjiang is about the same proportion as in the rest of
China." The nation executes more people each year than the rest of the
world combined.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, Xinjiang society is stable," Wang said. "People
go about life contentedly."</TE>
<TE>   The only targets of the government crackdown are "a few core members
and criminals," the State Council report says, adding that those who
support them are generously educated by the government and welcomed "back
to the true path."</TE>
<TE>   The report accuses hard-core militants of plotting riots,
assassinations, robberies, kidnappings and bombings, backed by an arsenal
of antitank grenades, guns and explosives. Militants met in cell groups
and trained in Xinjiang, as well as in foreign countries, it says.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating criticism of the Communist regime's crackdown, the report
warns other countries from applying "double standards" with regard to
anti-terrorism activities.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has so far refused to put the situation in Xinjiang
under the umbrella of its anti-terrorism campaign. The issue is likely to
come up next month during a presidential summit in Beijing between Bush
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</TE>

<HD>Muslim Navy Chaplain Due in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Prison: Criticism of U.S. treatment of war detainees mounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A Muslim cleric is expected to arrive today at the U.S. Navy base
at Guantanamo Bay to serve the religious needs of Afghan war detainees
being held at a makeshift prison in Cuba, U.S. military officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to send a U.S. Navy Muslim chaplain to the camp came as
the United States faced mounting criticism from European allies about the
conditions and legal standing of more than 150 inmates transported in
recent weeks to the open-air prison at the remote outpost on Cuba's
southeastern coast.</LD>
<LD>   A group of U.S. civil rights advocates, including former Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark, also has raised questions about the prisoners' treatment. A
hearing is scheduled today in federal court in Los Angeles to consider a
lawsuit filed by the group demanding that the terrorism suspects be
charged in court.</LD>
<TE>   An additional 14 detainees, transported under tight security, arrived
Monday at Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, a key U.S. ally attempted to assuage growing concerns over
the treatment of the detainees at the facility.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday that a team of
observers sent to the camp reported that three Britons in custody had no
complaints about their treatment. Accusations of torture and inhumane
conditions have been front-page news in Britain--America's closest ally
in the war on terrorism--since the U.S. military released pictures of
kneeling and shackled prisoners last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The photographs of the prisoners from Afghanistan, bound, shaven and
deprived of sense of sight, sound, touch and even smell, confirm the
folly of the United States in its determination to go it alone in
dispensing justice to those responsible for the mass murders of last
September," Britain's Independent newspaper said Monday in an editorial.</TE>
<TE>   A British Foreign Ministry team spent three days at Guantanamo, said
Ben Bradshaw, the Foreign Office parliamentary undersecretary. "There
were no gags, no goggles, no earmuffs and no shackles while [the
prisoners] are in their cells."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military leaders, who have described the men transported to the
outpost as "the worst of the worst," say extremely tight security is
warranted. The camp may eventually hold as many as 2,000 prisoners deemed
dangerous by U.S. officials, who have said the remote location makes it
possible to ensure that the prisoners can do no harm.</TE>
<TE>   Some European leaders have questioned why John Walker Lindh, the
20-year-old Californian captured in November after fighting alongside the
Taliban against U.S.-led forces, has been treated differently from his
fellow fighters. As an American citizen, Lindh has been charged in the
U.S. criminal justice system. He faces a possible life sentence for
charges that he conspired to kill U.S. citizens overseas, but has not
been charged with treason.</TE>
<TE>   International Committee of the Red Cross officials have met privately
with detainees but have declined to reveal their findings.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Central Command spokesman in Florida described as "routine" the
decision to make a Muslim spiritual advisor available.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as we would send a priest to provide for someone who is
Catholic, we're providing [the prisoners] with a Muslim chaplain in case
they require religious guidance," said Air Force Maj. Villa Vicensio.</TE>

<HD>Donors Ponder How to Spend Afghan Funds</HD>
<DH>Asia: Having pledged billions, contributors debate which projects
are priorities. Few want to help build military or pay officials'
salaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>With $4.5 billion in Afghanistan reconstruction funds pledged at a
two-day conference that ended today, officials from the United States and
other donor countries are settling down to a far more difficult task:
figuring out how to spend the money effectively in a nation that needs
almost everything.</LD>
<LD>   "We're seeing a country that's being born out of dust," said Torek
Farhadi, economic advisor to the interim Afghan government. "People tell
us, 'Give us a report of what you need.' We don't know what we need. It's
a work in progress."</LD>
<LD>   Although the pledge total--including $1.8 billion earmarked for this
year--is below the $10-billion, five-year benchmark set by the United
Nations, it represents a strong start. Several nations said they would be
back with more in coming years.</LD>
<TE>    China, India and Pakistan each offered $100 million for this year, on
top of the combined $1.3 billion pledged by the United States, Japan and
the European Union and the $220 million offered by Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing an excellent amount," said Hedayat Amin Arsala,
Afghanistan's interim finance minister, at the close of the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the funds have been pledged, decisions must be made about how
to spend the money. U.S. officials, their foreign counterparts and
members of international aid organizations emphasized that the final
determinations must be made by the Afghan government in order for the
money to have a lasting impact.</TE>
<TE>Afghan Officials Want a National Military</TE>
<TE>   But there were early indications that some Afghan priorities may not
be embraced as enthusiastically by the international community. Afghan
officials, for instance, repeatedly cited the need to build a national
military to secure the country's borders and limit the sort of meddling
by neighboring powers that helped reduce Afghanistan to a breeding ground
for warlords and terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't rebuild Afghanistan, a country that's been victimized by 23
years of war, without thinking about basic security," said Omar Samad, a
spokesman for Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. "For us, it's a top issue."</TE>
<TE>   Many donors, however, did not put creation of an Afghan military at
the top of their list.</TE>
<TE>   "Police, yes, but straightforward military expenditures, probably
not," said Alastair J. McKechnie, the World Bank's country director for
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of earmarking grant money to build an Afghan government and
pay bureaucrats' salaries likewise met with some resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "As we saw in East Timor and Kosovo, donors aren't very keen on paying
for government," said Chris Patten, external affairs commissioner for the
European Union. "They want to fund projects. But someone has to pay for
government. This is the challenge we face."</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies and major contributors also debated in meeting rooms and
corridors whether aid should be distributed directly by donor governments
or through a centralized trust fund overseen by multilateral agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Large nations such as the United States argue that direct disbursement
puts the money in Afghanistan much faster. International agencies counter
that pooled funds produce a more coordinated rebuilding effort, with less
corruption and waste. In previous reconstruction efforts, some nations
have been faced with the task of completing thousands of separate reports
to different donors about how funds were spent.</TE>
<TE>Health, Food, Roads and Education Are Priorities</TE>
<TE>   Despite some inevitable disputes over methodology and tactics, experts
said most contributors at the conference agreed on the overall
objectives, including the importance of allocating money quickly for
food, roads, education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   Programs that offer quick dividends in several priority areas also are
being pushed, officials said. Food-for-work projects, for instance, are
popular with Afghans, many of whom would rather be paid in food than the
mercurial, highly speculative afghani, the national currency.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, such projects create jobs, boost the economy and reduce
the ranks of people who might be tempted to harvest poppies for the drug
trade or join militia groups. Road repairs help get fertilizer and seeds
to farmers, surplus crops to famine areas and people to local markets.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, rehiring female civil servants and teachers--who filled 43%
of government jobs before the Taliban regime prohibited women from
working--will help rebuild the education system, boost women's role in
society and expand the nation's knowledge base.</TE>
<TE>   The interim Afghan government has outlawed poppy production. It has
promised to fight corruption, help the disabled, share power among all
ethnic groups, build a free-market economy, audit major contracts,
restore women's rights and set up a fair legal system.</TE>
<TE>    But major contributors have warned that they will be looking for,
among other steps, long-term progress toward rebuilding the country and
movement toward real democracy as preconditions for future aid.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Afghanistan turns out to be a model student, international
enthusiasm for rebuilding the Central Asian nation could drop off as
taxpayers lose interest or get distracted by a new crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell reiterated Monday that the U.S.
remains committed for the long haul. But Samad, the Afghan Foreign
Ministry spokesman, said his country already has seen donor nations lose
interest in a relatively modest $20-million fund earmarked for the Kabul
administration, and this is only the beginning. World Bank President
James D. Wolfensohn even joked that donors should leave their checks at
the door.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's interim government, headed by Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai, has only five more months before it faces possible replacement at
the hands of a \o7 loya jirga, \f7 or traditional Afghan governing
council. Political stability is a prerequisite for any rebuilding effort,
and the current government is under considerable pressure to show it has
what it takes long-term.</TE>
<TE>   So far, said foreign and Afghan officials at the conference, the new
group is off to a good start.</TE>
<TE>   "A government that can return to Kabul and say we've brought you $2
billion in pledges is pretty darned credible," said economic advisor
Farhadi.</TE>

<LD>The anthrax spores that went missing from the Army's top biological
warfare laboratory in 1991 had been sterilized and could not have played
a role in last fall's terrorism attacks, a former senior officer at the
research facility said.</LD>
<LD>   But the apparent loss of biological specimens from the military
research complex at Ft. Detrick, Md., reflected what officials described
as a dysfunctional working environment in the early 1990s. They said the
conditions contributed to security lapses and acrimony among scientists
working with some of the world's deadliest agents.</LD>

<HD>Flood of Wartime Spending Keeps Nation's Capital Flush With Capital</HD>
<DH>Economy: As much of the U.S. is mired in the downturn, Washington
companies are on a hiring binge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Tourism here was devastated by the Sept. 11 attacks, flattened to
Depression-era levels. The anthrax scare made matters worse, as news
accounts painted a picture of a city under siege. The only airport--a
feared terrorist target--closed temporarily and even now is operating far
below capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Buffeted by a storm of terrorist-related problems, the nation's
capital would seem to be ripe for economic meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Washington area is one of the few major metropolitan regions
in the country that is not in recession. In fact, thanks to federal
spending in wartime, it has proved to be remarkably resilient.</LD>
<TE>   "Follow the money," said Stephen S. Fuller, an economist at George
Mason University in Virginia, whose reports on regional forecasts are
baseline reading for local governments. Even before the war on terrorism,
federal spending in the Washington area was expected to increase to about
$80 billion this year, up from $77 billion in 2001. Now, spending in 2002
is expected to reach at least $85 million.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of a wartime boom abounds. The office vacancy rate in the
District of Columbia has fallen to 5.2%, about half the national average.
Area home prices are rising, forecast to post the nation's highest
increase--7.2%--this year. And the defense consultants and information
technology companies, whose skyscrapers line the highway from Washington
Dulles International Airport into town, are on a hiring binge.</TE>
<TE>   TRW Inc., a $3-billion company based in Reston, Va., is so
short-staffed it is contacting former employees and retirees--especially
those with security clearances--asking them to return.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, war has always been good for the economy of the nation's
capital.</TE>
<TE>   During the Civil War, poet Walt Whitman was one of a flood of
office-seekers arriving in town (he lamented that the overflow had
boosted the price of a beer to 38 cents). During World War II, an influx
of government jobs produced a housing shortage so severe that President
Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized temporary housing on the National Mall
for the so-called Government Girls who came to work as typists and clerks
while the men went off to fight.</TE>
<TE>   The current war--despite its unique multi-front mobilization against a
terrorist network rather than a sovereign nation--shows every sign of
continuing the pattern. In November, the Washington region posted a
12-month gain of 40,800 new jobs--the highest number in the nation,
according to the Labor Department. During the same period, other
communities were hurting; the Los Angeles metropolitan area, for example,
lost 11,500 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But if war has generally conferred an economic bounce locally, this
one is different, dramatized by a profound redefinition of federal
spending. This boom is driven not so much by the government creating jobs
as by the private sector minting them with federal dollars. Thanks to
President Reagan's campaigns for privatization in the 1980s and President
Clinton's efforts to reinvent government in the 1990s, both political
parties have embraced the principle that the private sector is more
efficient, flexible and innovative than the sluggish federal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell the story. The federal work force here peaked in June
1993 at nearly 400,000 workers. By 2000, 66,000 of those jobs were
eliminated. While spending on federal procurement--the purchase of goods
and services--increased nearly 16% nationwide during the same period, in
the Washington area it increased nearly 68%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a remarkable increase in federal procurement of
services, and a decrease in the purchase of goods," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   The New Economy, federal style, is more technology-driven, less
hardware-based. And Washington, which has no manufacturing base or
hometown industry to call its own, no baseball team or strong local
government, and few local heroes except transplants such as Michael
Jordan imported from Chicago, is uniquely situated to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Zandi, chief economist at economy.com, a consulting firm in West
Chester, Pa., said federal spending is "flowing into the Washington,
D.C., economy" in part because of the area's diversity. This war requires
defense spending and appropriations for research in such areas as
bioterrorism, tapping the resources not only of the technology firms in
suburban Virginia but also the medical research companies clustered
around the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed public confidence in government, coupled with the dot-com
collapse that left many young entrepreneurs eager for stable employment,
has also increased the interest in the kind of jobs Washington is now
generating.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, there was nothing sexy about being a government
contractor," said Charlene Wheeless, spokeswoman for DynCorp, a
$1.8-billion-a-year, employee-owned consulting firm based in Reston that
earns 98% of its revenue from government contracts. "Today, we're very
sexy."</TE>
<TE>   DynCorp runs telecommunication systems for the Environmental
Protection Agency and information technology services for the FBI. It
maintains the Army's helicopter training fleet in Alabama and manages a
vaccine production program for the Department of Health and Human
Services. In short, Wheeless said, DynCorp serves 42 federal agencies,
and "we want to be close to our customer."</TE>
<TE>   The need to be closer to Uncle Sam is also rippling through the local
commercial real estate market. The U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command
recently left its headquarters in Crystal City, Va., for the Navy Yards
in southeast Washington. Several private contractors combined to lease
1.5 million square feet of new office space outside the Navy Yard gates.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sept. 11 devastation at the Pentagon forced the government to
look for replacement offices for displaced workers. Within a week of the
attacks, the General Services Administration had gobbled up 1 million
square feet of office space in northern Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Thomas, president of the Greater Washington Commercial Assn.
of Realtors, notes that the war effort is boosting the amount of
government leasing. The National Reconnaissance Office in Chantilly, Va.,
he says, will need 1 million more square feet within the next four years
and the National Institutes of Health budget is likewise expected to
double within the next five years. But the nature of government leasing
is also changing. Instead of renting space in several offices, for
instance, the State Department recently leased an entire building in
Rosslyn, Va.--about 350,000 square feet--to better control security.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few blights on the region's economic picture is the tourism
industry. Nationally, hotel occupancy rates fell by more than 20% in the
weeks after the attacks. In Washington, occupancy rates fell more than
70% below the previous year's tally, and the revenue charged per room
fell by as much as 50%. Many in the industry--bellhops, waitresses,
cleaning staff--were laid off for a month or more, leaving 4,000 jobless
at one time or another.</TE>
<TE>   "New York has managed to define a discrete area of city, ground zero,
as affected by tragedy," said John Boardman, executive secretary of the
Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees Union Local 25. "In Washington, we're
perceived as having the whole place full of men in bio-suits."</TE>
<TE>   The comparison rankles local officials, who are angry that federal
officials have closed access to some of the nation's most popular and
symbolic sites.</TE>
<TE>   When Washington's high tourist season arrives this spring, local
officials hope that the White House and FBI tours have resumed and that
Reagan airport, now running at less than 60% of capacity, is back to full
strength. Already, the White House has announced it will reopen to
limited tours for schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "When revival of the economy is dependent on people spending, you have
got to lead by example," said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's
nonvoting congresswoman, who has been lobbying the White House to open
its doors.</TE>
<TE>   To help in the effort, the cast of TV's "West Wing" recently taped
public service ads urging viewers to "be inspired" by a trip to
Washington. And private appeals are going out to school districts, many
of which, under pressure from parents, have banned visits to the city.</TE>
<TE>   But the tourism industry represents the smallest of five sectors that
fuel the local economy. Generally, the Washington region had the
strongest growth rate--2.5%--and had the lowest unemployment
rate--3.5%--among major U.S. metropolitan areas in November.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, projections conducted for the Wall Street Journal by Case
Shiller Weiss, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, show that the median
real estate price for homes in the Washington area will rise faster than
any other region in the country. And projections show that while the
nation's economy will grow by 2% in 2002, Washington's will grow twice as
fast.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is fabulous," said Christine Ricketts of Pardoe ERA in
Alexandria, Va. "I wrote three [home sale] contracts the first week after
Sept. 11. It's like everybody is telling Osama bin Laden to stick it in
his ear."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from boosting housing prices, war traditionally has changed the
character of Washington, helping it grow from a sleepy swamp to a vibrant
government center.</TE>
<TE>   "By 1943, Washington was pretty much like any other boomtown during
the war," wrote historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in "No Ordinary Time," her
book about the home front during World War II. "Its population had nearly
doubled since 1940, decent housing was impossible to find, uniforms were
everywhere, gasoline was scarce, buses were overcrowded and living costs
were high."</TE>
<TE>   Many who came to Washington were on loan to the government from the
private sector for $1 a year. Now, it seems, the private sector is not
lending employees but minting them, thanks in part to federal spending at
a time of war.</TE>

<HD>Judges Push for Abused to Follow the Law</HD>
<DH>Violence: Expressing frustration, some punish women who seek help,
then violate no-contact orders themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>Judge Megan Lake Thornton is fed up. The frustration comes through
in her voice.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of women have come before her in domestic violence court over
the years, begging for protective orders to keep abusive husbands away.
Some have awakened her at 2 a.m. with pleas for emergency orders. And
then, within days, many are back in her court--arm in arm with the men
they say they fear.</LD>
<LD>   "I find that offensive," Thornton told one young mother who
acknowledged reconciling with her husband days after obtaining a
protective order. "It drives me nuts when people just decide to do
whatever they want."</LD>
<TE>   The judge then fined the woman--who is so poor she doesn't have a
phone--$100 for contempt of court.</TE>
<TE>   That case last month in Fayette County District Court here drew
national attention, with advocates for battered women warning that it
might frighten victims from asking the courts for help.</TE>
<TE>   While it made a splash, the case was not unique--and may not even have
been all that unusual.</TE>
<TE>   In rural Kentucky, some judges send women to jail for contacting their
husbands after getting court orders to keep them at bay. In Illinois,
some judges hold women in contempt for disavowing their initial
complaints of abuse after reconciling with their boyfriends. In North
Carolina, some judges have taken to charging women a $65 fee if they
apply for a protective order then decide to drop the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make these [women] insist on their own independence.
Otherwise, the court system can't help them," explained Ron Johnson, a
circuit judge in the coal fields of eastern Kentucky who has jailed women
for flouting protective orders.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for abused women--and the victims themselves--find such
logic appallingly callous.</TE>
<TE>   They say it ignores the plight of battered women who depend on their
mates for financial support. It overlooks the complications of custody
when children are involved. It fails to recognize that some victims are
coerced into returning.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, they say, sanctioning these women ignores the central
dynamic of abusive relationships: Most victims leave and return, leave
and return, in a cycle that can repeat for years until they muster the
resolve to split for good.</TE>
<TE>   In applying for a protective order, a woman may desperately want the
court to make the violence stop. But that does not mean she wants the
judge to end her relationship then and there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy for all of us to look at these cases and say, 'Why would
you ever want to go back?' But if you love someone, it's different," said
Lisa Beran, an attorney with the Kentucky Domestic Violence Assn. who is
appealing Thornton's ruling. "He may do these awful things, but you have
to remember: He's also the one who rubs your back and brings you juice
when you're sick and gets up with the baby half the time at night."</TE>
<TE>   In the case Beran is appealing, the woman grabbed her 6-month-old baby
and fled to her parents' house after a fight with her husband. The next
day, she went to court and filed a handwritten petition for protection.
Her husband, she wrote, had returned home drunk and "grabbed me by the
back of [the] neck and attempted to hit me with [a] picture frame."</TE>
<TE>   The judge on duty issued a temporary order barring the husband "from
any contact or communication" with his wife or baby. Then she ordered the
couple to return in two weeks to discuss a more permanent solution. In
the meantime, however, they reconciled.</TE>
<TE>   They returned to court on the designated day. This time, Thornton was
on duty.</TE>
<TE>   And she was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "I have [no-contact] orders in place, [and then] folks walk into the
courtroom . . . and everything's all hunky-dory," she said, fuming, at
the contempt hearing in mid-December. "When these orders are entered, you
don't just do whatever you . . . please and ignore them."</TE>
<TE>   Holding the husband and the wife in contempt, she fined each $100.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks earlier, in a similar case, Thornton had fined a woman $200
for returning home to her boyfriend. "Somebody with a fourth-grade
education ought to be able to read this [no-contact order] and understand
what it says," Thornton said in that case.</TE>
<TE>   Yet advocates for battered women insist it's the judge who's
misreading the documents. The standard emergency protection order in
Kentucky states that the "respondent," meaning the alleged abuser, is
prohibited from contacting the victim, the person who applied for the
order. There is nothing on the order that bars the alleged victim from
doing the communicating, although such attempts should not prove very
fruitful if the man is steering clear of the woman, as ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a legal issue," said Carol Jordan, director of the state's
office for domestic violence services. "Someone who is petitioning for
help is not bound by the protective order."</TE>
<TE>   That narrow point of law may be resolved by the appeal. But activists
see a broader principle at stake: "What judges forget is that the court
isn't there to tell people they can't have a relationship. The court is
there to tell people they can't be violent," said Diana Cyganovich, an
advocate for abused women in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Lecturing a battered woman from the bench is "the worst possible thing
a judge can do," because it implies that the victim is responsible for
her bruises and discourages her from seeking help, added Lynn Rosenthal,
director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence.</TE>
<TE>   In the rough hills of Appalachia, Judge Johnson disagrees. He comes
down hard on batterers. But he sees it as his duty to hold victims
accountable as well--accountable for their own safety. When a woman asks
him for a protective order, Johnson warns her that the no-contact
provisions apply to her as well as to her alleged abuser.</TE>
<TE>   "If they violate the order, I put them both in jail," he said. "I
don't hesitate to do it."</TE>
<TE>   He has jailed half a dozen women in the last few years, sentencing
them to as long as a week behind bars. He's confident that his tough-love
attitude helps, by giving them the nudge they need to get out of danger
once and for all. "I have no doubt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed by that approach, Kentucky state Rep. Johnnie Turner plans
to push for a bill to make emergency protective orders binding on both
parties. Too often, the Republican lawmaker said, women ask for a
protective order and then try to entice their men into violating it--a
misdemeanor that can be punished by as long as a year in jail. "It's
abused all the time," Turner said. "People who play that game know how to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates acknowledge that some women abuse the system. But an
overwhelming majority, they say, make no such calculations. They request
a protective order because they're terrified. When the terror subsides,
they figure it's their choice if they want to talk things out with their
batterer--or at least return home to collect their belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they did explain to me [the restrictions a protective order
would entail], but it's not a time when you can clearly look at the pros
and cons," said Ann, who asked that her last name not be used. A
Lexington resident, she fled her abusive husband once and for all five
years ago after he bashed her head against a wall. "When I went to court
[to get the order], I was just thinking, 'Please stop him from hurting
me. Please protect my children. Protect me.' I didn't think through
whether I ever wanted to see him again."</TE>

<HD>Americans Mark King Day With Service, Marches</HD>

<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Under the shadow of America's war on terrorism, thousands gathered
across the country Monday to pay tribute to the late Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and his message of unity and equality.</LD>
<LD>   In Atlanta, a standing-room-only crowd of about 2,000 packed Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where the civil rights leader once preached. King,
assassinated in 1968 at age 39, would have turned 73 last Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't help but think how Dr. King would be pleased at how we've
come together since Sept. 11," said Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.).</LD>
<TE>   First Lady Laura Bush, who also attended the service, called King "a
man committed to peace and a man committed to change."</TE>
<TE>   "American history is unimaginable without him," Bush said. "He stood
for truth, he did the will of God and made America a more just nation."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, President Bush signed a proclamation crediting
King with helping the United States "become a fairer and more colorblind
society" and announced the creation of federal scholarships encouraging
young people to study education and public policy. But he cautioned:
"There is much work to be done, both at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   King's widow, Coretta Scott King; his son, Martin Luther King III; and
daughter the Rev. Bernice King, presented Bush with a portrait of the
slain civil rights leader.</TE>
<TE>   The King scholarships will go to "promising students all across
America," Bush said in the East Room to a crowd of about 200
administration officials, foreign ambassadors and civil rights leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Coretta Scott King asked people to use the holiday as a day of
service, as did her son, Martin Luther King III, in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see it as a day off," he said. "We see it as a day on which
people can be involved in community service."</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, King's eldest daughter, Yolanda, addressed 1,500 people at
the city's MLK Memorial Breakfast. She said Sept. 11 erased racial
differences--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "Skin color was covered by the ash of burning towers," she said.
"Perhaps the best response to this tragedy is to not go back to normal."</TE>
<TE>   Schoolchildren, public officials and religious leaders spent the day
volunteering in communities around Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Children from Jewish and Muslim schools worked at the Greater
Philadelphia Food Bank to package food for needy families.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows how much we can do to help people when we put our minds to
it," said Sophia Bernstein, 12, a seventh-grader at Perelman Jewish
Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was touched by what happened Sept. 11 and because we're
Muslims, some people in this country thought we were happy about it,"
said Hend Salah, 10, a fifth-grader at Al-Aqsa. "If kids are brought up
right and brought up good, they won't believe those things."</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 people attended the King Day march in San Antonio,
one of the largest in the nation. T-shirts and hats bearing King's image
were common in the crowd, as were American flags.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Democratic-controlled Colorado Senate were among the
politicians in Denver's 17th annual King parade and march. Senators had
the day off for the first time since Colorado recognized the holiday in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled Colorado House of Representatives continued
working.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 51-year-old man who last year became the world's fifth recipient
of a self-contained artificial heart has been released from a
Philadelphia hospital to a nearby hotel, doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   James Quinn, 51, was released last week from Hahnemann University
Hospital, 70 days after being implanted with the AbioCor artificial
heart.</LD>
<LD>   The retired baker and grandfather from West Philadelphia was put up at
a hotel about three blocks from the hospital, with caregivers in an
adjoining room.</LD>
<TE>   Hahnemann is one of five sites participating in studies involving the
AbioCor, which has been implanted in six patients who were dying of heart
failure and too sick to qualify for human heart transplants. Three of the
patients have died, two of organ failure and one of massive bleeding
during the surgery.</TE>

<LD>The chairman of the House Transportation Committee said he's
rethinking his 1987 vote supporting a proposal to bury the nation's
nuclear waste in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) said at a meeting with Nevada transportation
officials, Gov. Kenny Guinn and the state's two House members that it
might be more practical to leave radioactive waste where it is than to
ship it by train or truck to Yucca Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm getting closer to saying this shouldn't happen," Young said.</LD>
<TE>   Young's comments came 11 days after Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham

<HD>Limbaugh Gets Some Hearing Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Talk show host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners Monday that an ear
implant has partially restored his hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Limbaugh had an electronic device placed in his skull late last year,
and the final hookup, which partially restored his hearing, took place
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "When you've had, in my case, over 50 years of normal hearing and to
lose it suddenly, as I did, it's . . . a shock," said Limbaugh, who went
deaf last year because of an autoimmune inner-ear disease. "You adapt to
it, as you have no choice."</LD>
<TE>   Limbaugh, who has 20 million weekly listeners on about 600 radio
stations, said his mind played tricks on him at times.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hearing the soundtracks to westerns," Limbaugh said. "It was as
loud as can be. It was distracting. I knew I wasn't hearing it because
those noises weren't being made."</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh had continued to do his show as his hearing deteriorated and
eventually disappeared, using an elaborate setup at his South Florida
studio involving transcribers and computer screens to read listeners'
calls.</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh said he is relearning how to hear. Voices are a bit fuzzy,
like they have been recorded on a minicassette recorder, he said. But
during one-on-one conversations, his hearing is about 90% normal.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pretty dependent on what people's lip movements are, although
that is improving every day," Limbaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh warned his listeners that telephone calls have so far posed
the biggest problem for him, saying he'll have to "wait and see" if that
improves. If not, he'll still use the setup devised when he was deaf.</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh said he never was really depressed about his deafness, and
was grateful there was a chance he could regain his hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just constantly thankful . . . for the era in which I was born
because that is what has made this all possible," Limbaugh said. "That
and the freedom we all have as Americans to invent and create and explore
all these medical marvels."</TE>

<KH>MILITARY MEMO</KH>
<HD>Building Up a False Sense of Security?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon is building up a force of 45,000 guards and sentries
at scores of overseas bases as part of a five-year plan to defend against
terrorist attacks on U.S. armed forces, according to service documents
and military officers.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, a component of the new buildup of U.S. military bases
in the Islamic world and throughout Asia, places more military police
than ground combat troops on the front lines of the mobilization against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But some military officials and counterterrorism experts worry that
the new effort creates a false sense of security for overseas forces and
may increase the vulnerability of both military personnel outside the
bases and civilians in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Is the deployment of tens of thousands of guards, which requires
extended activation of thousands more reserve troops, a "conventional
response to an unconventional threat?" asked a military officer who
served in counterterrorism and special operations before retiring last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The first potential problem with adding more guards and military
police at overseas bases, another expert says, is that seized
terrorist-training manuals stress that "we don't have to attack a tiger
if we can attack a lamb."</TE>
<TE>   Few in the military believe that Al Qaeda or other terrorist
organizations will undertake direct assaults against large U.S. bases.
The threat is far greater to forces in transit, ships in civilian ports
and U.S. service members and contractors venturing off base.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, earlier security measures at major bases probably explain the
pattern of attacks in the last decade: In 1996, terrorists attacked the
exposed Khobar Towers apartment complex rather than the more isolated and
better protected air bases in Saudi Arabia. In 1998, U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya were similarly chosen for their vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the U.S. destroyer Cole was hit as it was moored in Aden
harbor in Yemen, not at the Navy's far more active base in Bahrain, where
the security, according to Pentagon counterterror experts, was perhaps
the best in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>Civilians May Be at Risk</TE>
<TE>   The principle applies even more strongly to civilian targets in the
United States and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists are adaptive adversaries who constantly look for ways to
strike where their victims are most vulnerable," Brig. Gen. Jonathan H.
Cofer, the Joint Staff deputy director for combating terrorism, told
Congress last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The second problem with the buildup in so-called force protection is
that it wraps the armed forces in bureaucratic and labor-intensive
procedures that reduce military flexibility by creating a hunkered-down
bunker mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "We are, in fact, our own prisoners of war," said the recently retired
counterterrorism officer.</TE>
<TE>   Those responsible for protecting American military facilities overseas
face a mind-boggling set of warnings and "conditions," many of which seem
to produce more confusion than protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Force protection" is the Pentagon term for the full range of measures
designed to safeguard soldiers from non-battle injury and death--from
physical security and threat assessment to safe driving and preventive
health practices.</TE>
<TE>   As far as potential terrorist attacks are concerned, the Defense
Intelligence Agency sets the "threat level" on a country-by-country
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Then, for each military facility within the country, the local
commander establishes a Terrorist Force Protection Condition, or FPCon.
The "condition" is based on the level of political turbulence in the
country and any special alerts from the DIA.</TE>
<TE>   FPCon was created in June 2001 to replace Threatcon, or Terrorist
Threat Condition. The change was recommended by the Pentagon commission
that investigated the attack on the Cole; commission members thought the
old term might be confused with the terminology used by the DIA to
describe countrywide threat levels.</TE>
<TE>   Threat levels for each country are set on a scale ranging from low and
moderate upward to significant and high. These are supplemented by
FPCon's Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. In addition, each
country gets a "level" designation to indicate the extent of criminal
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, according to Pentagon documents, a "high" threat level is
defined as "anti-U.S. terrorists are operationally active and use large
casualty-producing attacks as their preferred method of operation. There
is a substantial [Department of Defense] presence and the operating
environment favors the terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   FPCon Charlie applies at a base "when an incident occurs or
intelligence indicates some form of threat action against personnel
and/or facilities is imminent."</TE>
<TE>   In the real world, this alphabet soup of technical jargon and warnings
does not necessarily produce changes on the ground--either in security
procedures or in individual conduct.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of living under a continuous state of heightened alert
is seen in public reaction to the spate of nationwide warnings from the
Justice Department since Sept. 11; local officials and ordinary citizens
complain that the warnings are so unspecific that they do little more
than raise anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, for the military operating overseas, the buildup of combat
forces and the assumption of active hostilities have had only minor
impact on the formal alerts. Since Sept. 11, according to military
documents, only Greece, Pakistan and Uzbekistan have been added to the
high-threat list.</TE>
<TE>Few Attack Plots Foiled</TE>
<TE>   If their own experts question the overall effectiveness of a massive
buildup in force protection, why are senior military officials plunging
ahead?</TE>
<TE>   The answer lies in the continual failure of what all agree would be a
better approach: specific, timely warnings from intelligence agencies
about impending attacks.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some claimed successes, cases in which authorities
foiled projected attacks because of explicit intelligence triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, however, the obstacles to obtaining such information
have usually proved insurmountable. Throughout the 1990s, intelligence
services failed time and again to provide effective warning--from the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center to the Khobar Towers attack.</TE>
<TE>   According to internal Defense Department documents obtained by the Los
Angeles Times, in the weeks leading up to Sept. 11, there was no formal
alert or notification to U.S. forces of an impending terrorist event.</TE>
<TE>   The classified Joint Chiefs of Staff "Threat Level and FPCon Update"
dated Aug. 27 listed five countries as having a "high" terrorist threat
level: Colombia, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   FPCon Charlie was in effect for every country in the Middle East and
Central Command domain except Bahrain, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates, which were all carried at FPCon Bravo. For the
continental United States, the "baseline FPCon" was listed as "normal."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 6, the Joint Staff issued a new list: Everything remained the
same except for the FPCon for Qatar and Kuwait, which was actually
downgraded from Charlie to Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   A "worldwide caution" was issued Sept. 7 stating that "we have
received unconfirmed information that terrorist actions may be taken
against U.S. military facilities and/or establishments frequented by U.S.
military personnel in Korea and Japan."</TE>
<TE>   According to the caution, information received in May indicated that
American citizens "may be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist
groups with links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in all this set off alarm bells anywhere that made a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Absent an effective warning capability in the intelligence agencies,
military planners have seen no alternative to focusing on the defensive
component of force protection--including the current buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "Something has to be done that's visible," one expert said. "The
increase in security has some deterrent value." But he also worried that
terrorist organizations will merely refocus their efforts elsewhere,
including the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad guys do have a tendency to adapt a lot quicker than we do,"
he said. "At this point we have the advantage. But we're going to have to
continue to press it and not lose interest."</TE>
