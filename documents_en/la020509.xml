<HD>Bravo, L.A.--Even Your Off-Key Music Is Sweet</HD>

<LD>There's an old guy who sits on a chair in the Music Center plaza
every time there's anything going on, singing the most tuneless song
I've ever heard.</LD>
<LD>   He has my sense of rhythm, which is no sense of rhythm at all, and
a flat, off-key way of presenting his endless solo that is almost
hypnotic. It's like he's singing to a cobra swaying in a basket.</LD>
<LD>   I put a dollar in his pot one evening and tried speaking to him,
but he just kept on making those dissonant sounds without even
noticing that I was there.</LD>
<TE>   I guess a buck wasn't enough to interrupt his presentation, but
that was my limit. Pavarotti he wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Later I got to thinking that he was probably doing the best he
could, and in a way was adding to the total sound of the city, which
is not always on the level of grand opera.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Mr. Music, we were at a performance of the L.A.
Philharmonic that same night, listening to the heavenly compositions
of Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   I love the philharmonic almost as much as I love my dog, and I
guess Mr. Music, defiling the very air with his atonal vocalizations,
momentarily intruded on my rare infusion of haute musique.</TE>
<TE>   But at least he helped reinforce my hypothesis that contrary to
outside opinion, there's music in the air in the City of Angles, even
if it's sometimes flat. The "Outside Opinion" was a musician friend
in San Francisco who remarked when I was up there a few weeks ago
that the only worthwhile sound in L.A. was the wailing of agents.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I'm not exactly a civic booster, but the arrogance of the
north rankled me and I went out to prove otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to imply that L.A. is anything like those old MGM
musicals where waitresses and cops join in a song and dance in the
center of town. Show me a cop who dances in the street and I'll show
you a narc who's been sniffing the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   You also don't see troubadours on the corners in downtown L.A. at
night because there's nobody to sing to. Only downtown Oakland equals
L.A.'s city center in its rate of abandonment after the sun goes
down.</TE>
<TE>   But we do have venues, as we say, where one can hear music to feed
every taste. During a two-week prove-it period in Greater L.A.,
Cinelli and I went from a presentation of "West Side Story" at
Moorpark College to an outdoor concert of the Topanga Philharmonic,
with concertos as sweet as the day they adorned.</TE>
<TE>   I was especially impressed by the college show. Drama professor
Les Wieder, who produced and directed, prodded his all-student cast
into professional performances the likes of which I've never seen in
a college. The kids gave the music new energy and danced like the
devil was beating time.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights later we were in a back room of McCabe's Guitar Shop on
Pico, listening to a folk rock band called the Jayhawks. The music
was OK, even though I find it difficult to appreciate vocalists who
shout, whisper or sing through their noses.</TE>
<TE>   What fascinated me was the back room itself, with a dozen or so
guitars hanging from the wall, and folding chairs to accommodate the
150 people who can cozy into the room. There was kind of a 1960s feel
to the place, except that there was no ropey-dopey smell in the air,
and everyone had their clothes on.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after that came the L.A. Philharmonic, and three days
later Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, with its wide, and often
strange, variety of street performers, some of whom might fall under
the general term of musician.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular evening, a little girl bounced out of a crowd
that had circled around a man doing karaoke and suddenly began
dancing. She was maybe 7 and was oblivious to her surroundings as she
dipped and whirled to the music.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think she was part of the show because the vocalist seemed
surprised by her sudden appearance, but it brought a surge of money
into the pot.</TE>
<TE>   I guess she could have been a shill, like the precocious little
hustler Tatum O'Neal played in "Paper Moon." Who knows? Kids learn
fast.</TE>
<TE>   The last stop on our two-week musical odyssey was "The Full
Monty," which is playing at the Ahmanson Theater. For those
unfamiliar with the story, it's about six unemployed steelworkers who
become strippers in order to survive. The show's title refers to the
end of their act in which they, well, show it all.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed to me the audience that night consisted mostly of women
who voiced their pleasure by shrieking. One of the shriekers was a
heavily made-up woman in her 40s who, I would guess, wasn't exactly
seeing naked men for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   She was among the loudest of the banshees, and by the time the
show was over, my ears were ringing. Only mortar shells exploding a
few feet away had ever before caused a similar reaction.</TE>
<TE>   The music was good and the show well done generally, except that
God never intended men to prance around naked or even semi-naked. But
I guess it wouldn't be a skin show if they were wearing blue serge
suits, and a skin show was what it was.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, at the end of the two weeks, I realized I
didn't have to prove a thing to the dude up north. We may not dance
all in the streets down here, but there's music enough if we wanted
to.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Music was still singing away when we left "The Full Monty." I
gave him another buck and said "Bravo." He didn't blink an eye. Cool.</TE>

<LD>Actress Marla Sokoloff, best known as the receptionist on "The
Practice," has joined the legions of thespian rockers: Russell Crowe
and his band Thirty Odd Foot of Grunts, Jason Schwartzmann's Phantom
Planet and Keanu Reeves' Dogstar, to name a few. As lead vocalist and
rhythm guitarist in the band Smittin, Sokoloff says she's prepared to
go the distance in the struggle to land a record deal. "We're really,
really determined," she said in a phone interview from her Sherman
Oaks home on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   It could be a long road. Sokoloff says the record companies the
band has been approaching don't hear a hit single among its songs.
"It's a little bit of a difficult time period for us as a band," she
said. "It's unfortunate because ... [record labels are] not as likely
to nurture bands as they used to." And even big-name actors don't
have an easy time of crossing over into the music business. Reeves'
band just issued its first U.S. release after years of touring and
recording, and Crowe's band has self-released the two albums it's put
out in 17 years. But Sokoloff, 21, isn't discouraged. She spends
almost every day off practicing with the band and writing songs about
her life as an actor, her family and her boyfriend, "Spider-Man"
co-star James Franco.</LD>
<TE>   In her song "Ode to Hollywood," Sokoloff riffs on the industry's
image machine: "I saw her just the other day/looking thin she was
wasting away/Should I start to play the game?/So we can all look the
same."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of [the songs] come from sacrifices I make as an actor and
how hard it is on your body and as a person," she said. "I'm really,
really hard on myself. I have this need to succeed all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Blake Story to the Bank</TE>
<TE>   As pundits ponder O.J. versus Robert Blake, various
entrepreneurs--beyond lawyers--are already spinning gold.</TE>
<TE>   Books and movie deals include SilverCreek Entertainment's picking
up movie and literary rights to the Blake case as told by Christina
Scheier, a friend of Blake's slain wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. And this
week, bestselling author Dennis McDougal (a former L.A. Times
reporter) sold his telling of the story of Robert Blake's life and
trial for an advance "in the low six figures" to Penguin Putnam.
Working title? "Cold Blood: The Saga of Robert Blake."</TE>
<TE>   "What's the thesis?" said McDougal, when reached by phone at his
Long Beach home. "Different kind of star-crossed lovers: a child of
Hollywood meets a child of American Bandstand, adventures ensue."
McDougal added, "It's a cautionary tale."</TE>
<TE>   After Blake's arrest, the author (whose previous books include
"The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the Hidden History of
Hollywood," and "Privileged Son: Otis Chandler and the Rise and Fall
of the L.A. Times Dynasty") dashed off a two-page proposal. Within a
couple of weeks, his agent had secured the deal. McDougal hasn't yet
discussed any possible participation by Blake with the actor's lawyer
Harland W. Braun, but hopes the actor will tell his side of the
story--in a jiffy.</TE>
<TE>   "They want it, like, yesterday," McDougal said about the
publication plans. "Before the summer is over, it'll be on the
bookshelves."</TE>
<TE>   Already on the shelves is murder-case merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   The Y-Que Trading Post on Vermont Avenue in Los Feliz (maker of
the popular "Free Winona" T-shirts following Winona Ryder's arrest on
suspicion of shoplifting at Saks) has come up with a line of Blake
wear.</TE>
<TE>   Designs on the $10 T-shirts include a photo of Blake and phrases
including, "Who Dunnit? Ask the Bird" (a reference to the cockatoo he
shouldered in "Baretta") and "You Can Take This to the Bank."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously.</TE>
<TE>   House Guest Takes His Act on the Road</TE>
<TE>   It's been nearly a decade since famous former house guest Brian
"Kato" Kaelin testified in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, yet his 15
minutes of fame seem never to end.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he has filmed a pilot of a reality-based show titled (cringe)
"Houseguest."</TE>
<TE>   No word yet on where--and if--it will air. The plot? "It's a show
where I ... go across America," Kaelin told Barbara Walters on
Wednesday night. "I knock on doors of the unsuspecting and invite
myself in to spend a weekend with a family. And it's ... an absolute
ball."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of the celebrities I've met I would consider
friendly acquaintances. Except Russell Crowe....I'll still go and see
his movies but if someone told me he was going to be at a party I
might not go."--Moby tells the British music publication Q Magazine
in the May issue.</TE>

<LD>CAN'T BE SATISFIED</LD>
<LD>   The Life and Times of</LD>
<LD>   Muddy Waters</LD>
<TE>   By Robert Gordon</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   408 Pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner wrote in the magazine's first
issue in 1967 that though its name refers to the old saying "A
rolling stone gathers no moss," the magazine's name was inspired by
Muddy Waters, who first used it as a song title. It was also from
this song title that the Rolling Stones took their name. In fact,
Waters' first hit, "I Can't Be Satisfied," would eventually evolve
into the Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction." Preceding both the
British group and folk-rock artist Bob Dylan, who titled his first
album "Like a Rolling Stone," Waters would bring Mississippi Delta
blues to the world of white rock 'n' roll, influencing its sound
forever.</TE>
<TE>   In "Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters,"
Robert Gordon traces the development of this "father figure of
electric blues," his rise to stardom and his enormous influence on
20th century musicians, beginning with his childhood in the lower
quarter of the Mississippi Delta. Born on April 4, 1913, the young
McKinley A. Morganfield worked alongside his family sharecropping
cotton on the Stovall Plantation, about 80 miles north of Jug's
Corner, where he was born. As Gordon quips, "Sharecropping--getting
less than half of what you got coming to you--was good training for a
life in the music business." Earlier, when McKinley took to playing
in the dangerous waters near his birthplace, his grandmother Della
gave him the nickname that would stick with him for life.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon points out that life on the Delta had changed little in the
half century before Muddy's birth, stating that the "Delta land
itself rebels against change." But Gordon is also quick to point out
that if Waters had been born a half century earlier, the music would
have been different: "Muddy Waters was raised on a musical cusp,
coming of age at the time the blues began crystallizing as a genre,"
catalyzed by Reconstruction, when a large population of blacks was
sent adrift. And while church singing was one of the first major
influences on the blues, as it was on Waters' singing, by the
mid-20th century "the power of the church was losing influence to the
power of the blues."</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, Waters made his own instruments to accompany his voice,
beginning with an old kerosene can that he would beat on, and moving
to the crude homemade "git-ars" common to the Delta. While at
Stovall, Della bought a phonograph powered by a hand crank. Waters
soon got recordings by such artists as Texas Alexander, Barbecue Bob,
Blind Lemon Jefferson and Blind Blake and began incorporating their
sounds. The bottleneck style, which used a butter knife or penknife
against the strings to create a keening sound, soon opened the way
for slide guitars, and Waters' first experience with this method came
when he was 14, listening to Son House play in the Delta. The boy was
quick to ask for lessons, and House gladly obliged.</TE>
<TE>   Waters played locally and in Memphis until he was about 25, when
his reputation began to grow, especially after his version of Sonny
Boy Williamson's "Bluebird Blues" became popular. Despite occasional
trips into the city, Waters had kept pretty much to the backwoods,
though he began questioning friends who played in Chicago whether
they thought he could make it there.</TE>
<TE>   Little did he know the impact his country style would have on the
Chicago Blues sound, which in the early '40s critics called "well
turned and sophisticated" though often "empty of genuine emotion."
Gordon tells us that Waters' own estimation of this style of the
blues was not very high; he called it "sweet jazz," and it has since
been referred to as "hokum." Waters' expressive, raspy style took
Chicago by storm and would influence bands and individual musicians
beyond the Chicago blues world. The Butterfield Blues Band, Led
Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Dylan and countless others would incorporate
his gutsy electric exposition into their own music.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon also discusses the musician's personal life, including his
several marriages, one of which endured for 25 years despite Waters'
constant infidelities. The bluesman fathered children with his wives
and with road companions (he was especially fond of young women
barely out of their teens), and his attention to his kids seemed to
vary, depending on other factors in his life such as his performance
schedule and general financial demands.</TE>
<TE>   Thorough and balanced, Gordon's biography takes in both the broad
musical trends of the time and some of its subject's knotty details,
including Waters' contentious rivalry with his renowned contemporary
Howlin' Wolf. Gordon shows us a musician who was quick to accept and
absorb the work of the new generation, helping the blues, as Waters
himself put it, give birth to the baby called rock 'n' roll.</TE>

<DH>New horticultural society chief brings commercial instincts
to the nonprofit.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Katy Ross Warner has three more checks to sign before she can begin
the phone interview. The sound of executive pen scratching comes over
the line, and then the new president of the American Horticultural
Society is ready to talk. Last month, she was chosen to lead the
80-year-old society into the 21st century for two reasons, she says.
First, there is the small matter of turning the United States into "a
land of gardens and nation of gardeners."</LD>
<LD>   Second, the society is banking that she will bring blockbuster
commercial instincts to a nonprofit organization. Warner comes very
much from the "for-profit world." After earning a degree in landscape
architecture from the University of Arizona, she worked for close to
a quarter of a century, from 1976 to 2000, at Walt Disney World in
Lake Buena Vista, Fla., working her way up from gardener to director
of horticulture. There she had 700 horticulturalists tending 30,000
acres serving 40 million visitors every year.</LD>
<TE>   Taken at face value, the move has an infancy-to-senility quality.
The American Horticultural Society is by reputation blue-rinse,
Daughters of the American Revolution territory. The headquarters are
set on 26 acres in Alexandria, Va., on River Farm, a historic
property that once belonged to George Washington. There, the staff of
20 puts out the bimonthly national magazine, the American Gardener,
for 26,000 members and works with the British-based publisher Dorling
Kindersley on garden reference books. It also maintains the society's
public gardens, runs an education program for school gardens and
ensures its members a nice collection of perks, from seed exchange
programs to free entrance to garden shows.</TE>
<TE>   But for Warner, the jump from landscaping around "Camp
Minnie-Mickey" to encouraging the public to visit George Washington's
azalea and dogwood garden isn't all that big. To her, in both places,
it's all about the plants.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, she says, the theme park bought enough land to create a
rural illusion and plants became surprise stars. An early
horticultural staff of 100 grew sevenfold. "We went for beautiful,
interesting gardens with a broad palette of plants that told the
story of different places around the world, of deserts and jungles,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, she says, Disney "showcased the variety of flowers
that can be grown in Florida and dramatically changed what was sold
there." It was Disney gardens, she adds, that popularized bedding
plants in Florida, acclimating begonias and finding which pansies did
best there. "With our animal kingdom, we were the first ones to use
ornamental grasses on a major scale," she says.</TE>
<TE>   All very impressive. But what will it mean to Californians? Bart
O'Brien, director of Horticulture at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,
one of three gardens in the state dedicated to California native
plants, says the national organization has never really penetrated
west of the Rockies. "It's an East Coast organization, and really a
lot of what they do isn't that relevant to the West Coast," he says.
Californians looking to Virginia for direction on how to garden
"would be the same thing as the Huntington Botanical Gardens trying
to cater to New Yorkers. It doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Eltzroth, a professor of horticulture at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo and director of its Leaning Pine Arboretum, agrees that
Californians have always regarded themselves as a breed apart. The
climate and flora are so different, most of the wisdom from the East
simply doesn't translate in California, he says. The rift is so deep
that when the American Horticultural Society and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture came out with a national heat tolerance index in the
mid-1990s, California didn't use it.</TE>
<TE>   "We just sort of kissed it off," he says. "It was very, very
flawed." Whereas it delineated fewer than a dozen heat zones, the
Sunset Publishing Corp. developed a system with 24 zones. "The Sunset
system has taken priority because it's so much more accurate," he
says. "If you go into any nursery, they'll say, 'Let's look it up in
Sunset.'"</TE>
<TE>   But if California horticulturalists are aloof from the national
organization, on a personal level, one of Warner's biggest fans is
Peter Atkins, chief executive officer of the Arboretum of Los Angeles
County in Arcadia. "Katy and I have had a professional relationship
bordering on a love affair for like 25 years," he says, hastily
adding that he is happily married. But he is such a Warner fan that
he has roped her into the 18-person board of the arboretum.</TE>
<TE>   Her genius, he says, isn't replacing local organizations but in
her attitude and philosophy of making plants an "attraction." "Katy
brought to Disney the concept that if you give people a beautiful,
exciting, floriferous, lush landscape, that would be as much of an
attraction, if not more so, than Mickey Mouse," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Her landscaping helped attract 40 million through the gates of
Disney World every year, and the American Horticultural Society is
clearly not the only organization hoping she can repeat the trick.
Atkins says that he is involving her here because he wants to
increase the arboretum's attendance from its current 300,000 visitors
a year to 750,000.</TE>
<TE>   Elzroth agrees that getting people into arboretums across the
country will encourage gardening. "The more you encourage gardening,
the more people will become environmentally conscious and become more
aware of what happens when we spray pesticides and overfertilize.
Once you get involved, you start talking to other people and going to
conferences," he says. "Being rah-rah for gardening is the socially
responsible thing."</TE>
<TE>   Atkins describes it as socially essential. Behind the plans for
raising attendance at the arboretum is a quest. "At the root of
everything we do," Atkins says, "is the concept of ethno-botany, or
the relationship between people and plants. The single message to our
visitors is that our lives are 100% dependent on plants. Without
plants, we die. No plants, no oxygen. No food."</TE>
<TE>   From back in George Washington's place in Virginia, Warner reels
off what she sees as the list of challenges facing American
gardeners: lawns in arid areas, asphalt put where grass should be,
parks unsafe for children, pesticide abuse, the need for horticulture
to be taught in schools, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   But then she slows down, and the businesswoman who has given
America marching orders to get out and garden suddenly poses a
teasing, eternal question: "What does beauty look like?" she says.
"Then how are we going to deliver on that beauty?"</TE>

<LD>How would you like to work with your brother or sister when you grow
up? Ida and Ani Kavafian are sisters and professional musicians who
are doing just that. They were born in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to
the United States with their parents as children. Both graduated from
the Juilliard School of Music with honors. They started out playing
solo, but in 1983 decided to also perform as a duo. In this Learning
Link they talk about what it's like to be sisters and musicians.</LD>
<LD>   "It's wonderful to work with Ida for so many reasons," Ani says.
"We have a history of life together. If I'm not feeling great, Ida
can bring me out of it, even during a performance."</LD>
<LD>   Ida adds, "When we were kids, our parents never pushed us to play
together. We've never been jealous of each other. People get us mixed
up all the time. But I don't mind because Ani's a great player too."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the similarities between them, each sister has a unique
personality. According to Ani, "Ida is outgoing and I'm more quiet.
But we play off of that, we feel each other's energy. When we play
together, it's probably more musically fulfilling than just about
anything else we do. We have tremendous respect for each other."</TE>
<TE>   When they travel for work they share meals together and love to
shop--especially for gowns--but they have quite different tastes in
clothing. Ida prefers beaded gowns with lots of sparkle, while Ani
likes hers less flashy. "I don't want to look dull next to Ida when
we perform," says Ani. "So we try to coordinate our dresses."</TE>
<TE>   Do they think it's a good idea for brothers and sisters to work
together? "If you can be yourself and respect your sibling," Ida
exclaims, "you can't find a joy like this anywhere else!"</TE>
<TE>   Ani and Ida Kavafian will play the violin and viola with the
Pasadena Symphony Saturday at 8 p.m. For more information, call (626)
793-7172 or visit www.pasadena symphony.org.</TE>

<LD>"Art and crafts are in a great time right now," says Kevin V.
Wallace, a curator and author on the subject of contemporary crafts.
On a visit to the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, where the
exhibition "Enhancements: Handcrafted Functional Objects" is on view,
Wallace points to the enduring quality of handmade objects.</LD>
<LD>   "Before there were paintings, probably even before cave paintings,
people were making little bowls and leaving their marks on them. It
was the first form of function and expression that people worked
with. That's why it's so wonderful that these media--glass, wood and
pottery--are taking off right now."</LD>
<LD>   Wallace helped with the installation of this traveling exhibition,
which includes 98 objects by 30 artists from around the United
States. The show was curated by Robert Logan and Robert Cugno,
independent curators from Garnett, Kan. Most of the works in the show
were made in the past five years, making this a sampler of the
directions that functional crafts are taking.</LD>
<TE>   Jan McKeachie-Johnston's wood-fired stoneware bowl, titled "Folded
Basket," 1999, was inspired by American Indian pottery, as well as
the ancient civilizations of Crete and Africa, among others. Jay
Jensen's soda-fired "Teapot," 2000, and wood-fired "Oil Can," 2000,
are anthropomorphic in their shapes and have touches of whimsy, with
the long-spouted oil can's shape closely resembling the pot's.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey N. Oestreich's ceramic bird-like "Beaked Pitcher" and
coordinated "Dessert Plates," 1997, look at nature in a humorous
vein. "In the form of craft, the vessel takes the place of the
figure," says Wallace. "Look closely at them and you'll see feet,
shoulders, mouths."</TE>
<TE>   Craftsmen stretch the imagination in their use of their materials.
For example, Darryl and Karen Arawjo's "Lightvessels," done in 1998
and 2000, look like traditional vases, yet they're made of white oak
and woven synthetic monofilament.</TE>
<TE>   Lightweight and translucent, they are "a wonderful example of
artists looking at new materials," says Wallace. "They used the
modern monofilament, but in forms that have been around since the
beginning of time and have been perfected through our human
aesthetic."</TE>
<TE>   The furniture runs the spectrum from Rick Stein's "Hall Table,"
2000, of American black cherry, with classic clean lines, to Boris
Bally's "Transit Chair," 2000, made from recycled traffic signs and
copper rivets. Looking at ordinary objects in new ways is something
artists do, and Bally recycles to create this chair as well as a
"Belly Table," 2000, and a large "DPW Bowl," 2000, that hangs on the
wall.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Ellison's "Bottle Cap Chair," 2000, is made of
low-carbon steel shaped into two large bottle caps for the seat and
back. The legs look as if they're ready to take off and run at a
moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   Also worthy of note are David Baird's elegant silver-colored
"Candle Sticks," 2000, made from rhodium-plated wire, Cynthia Eid's
"Folded Vase," 1998, a copper work that almost looks like origami,
and Deborah Jemmott's "Entwined Copper Table Lamp," 1998, which has
three copper tubes twisted together for the base and is topped by a
handmade paper shade. W. Chester Old's "Tower," 2000, is a
rectangular table lamp done in aluminum and stone.</TE>
<TE>   Wall and floor coverings include Sara Hotchkiss' "Bantam
Bungalow," 2000, a hand-woven cotton tapestry in a stars and stripes
pattern, and Kathy Cooper's "Abstract Floral," 2000, a floor cloth,
displayed here on the wall, that's made of painted canvas.</TE>
<TE>   "In crafts, glass was the first to step over into the art realm,
largely because of Dale Chihuly, who opened the door for a lot of
people," Wallace says. Michael K. Hansen and Nina Paladino-Caron's
large handblown art glass bowls in the center of the exhibition
include splashes of bright color reminiscent of Chihuly's work. Some
of these works are so precious looking that it would seem a shame to
use them.</TE>
<TE>   "The artists really hate that," Wallace says. "The reason artists
make things in these media is that they want to create things that
become a part of people's lives. If you have a ceramic mug that you
use every day and a David Hockney work on the wall, you have a closer
relationship with the mug because your hands go where the potter's
hand went before. Your relationship with these objects when you use
them becomes much more intimate and, in a way, it elevates your
everyday life too."</TE>
<TE>   As a companion to this exhibition, there are 88 turned-wood bowls
by Bob Stockdale from the Forrest Merrill Collection.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wallace, Stockdale was a modern pioneer in the crafts
field and has influenced thousands of artists because he uses forms
that enhance his wood. His range of wood and shapes for just one
form--the bowl--is remarkable. The fiber works of Kay Sekimachi,
Stockdale's wife, also influential in the history of crafts, are on
view.</TE>
<TE>   "Enhancements: Handcrafted Functional Objects" continues through
May 19; works by Stockdale and Sekimachi will be on view through May
28. The Craft and Folk Art Museum is at 5814 Wilshire Blvd. Hours:
Wednesday through Sunday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. (323) 937-4230.</TE>

<LD>Even though Boody was about the same age as my grandma, she was fast!
She ran over and wiped the gooey filling off the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Just as she took a step backward, I noticed a big blob of red goo
she hadn't cleaned up.</LD>
<LD>   "Boody, watch out!" I yelled. But she slipped and landed on a big
bag of sponges. The bag was like a pillow, and by her smile, I knew
she wasn't hurt. I tried to help her up when suddenly ... whoops! I
fell backward too. Our yellow aprons were covered in red jelly. Tears
rolled down my cheeks, and my stomach hurt from laughing so hard.</LD>
<TE>   "Sorry. I guess I really do like to make a mess," I said between
small giggles.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all right, sweet pea," she said as she wrapped her arm
around me. "I've always thought filling doughnuts was kind of like
loving someone. It gets messy at times, but too much is always better
than not enough."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't quite sure what she meant. Boody didn't have any of her
own kids, but I had a feeling she had a lot of people who loved her.</TE>
<TE>   "Time to go, Lucy!" my dad shouted. "You'll be late for school."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for letting me ... try to help," I said.</TE>
<TE>   She reached over and kissed me on the cheek. "Any time. I can use
your help next week too."</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   She nodded. "And this time we'll try lemon cream. The yellow won't
stain our aprons!"</TE>

<HD>He Totally Got It</HD>
<DH>Ad man Jay Chiat spoofed and celebrated pop culture with a
hip, West Coast style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're glad you're not an Oscar Mayer wiener, you may have Jay
Chiat partly to thank. If you can pass by the Charmin on the rack at
your local supermarket without reflexively picturing Mr. Whipple
plunging his obsessive-compulsive fingers into mounds of toilet
tissue, say a quick prayer of gratitude for Chiat.</LD>
<LD>   For it was Chiat, the legendary ad executive and cultural
provocateur, who helped rescue American television advertising from
terminal silliness, who wrested it from the puerile mind-set of
Madison Avenue and gave it a more thoughtful center, a more nuanced,
sophisticated sheen. The brain cells he saved may be your own.</LD>
<LD>   But Chiat, who died at age 70 of prostate cancer last month at his
Venice home, leaves a far more subtle and complex legacy than this.
While American TV advertising has generally consisted of corny
sentiments and family-friendly cliches, Chiat and his Los Angeles
firm, Chiat/Day, dared to sell products using a bizarre mascot, a
manic pink bunny who later morphed into a pop-culture touchstone.</LD>
<TE>   While behemoth corporate firms still relied on silly jingles and
simple-minded slogans incessantly pounded home to move products off
shelves, Chiat/Day pioneered a mode of expression that was indirect
and allusive, disorienting and occasionally unnerving. Images of
famous athletes were blown up to the size of buildings and draped
across office towers to sell Nike footwear. The noir-ish image of a
woman hurling a sledgehammer at an Orwellian authority figure blurred
across TV screens at warp speed during the 1984 Super Bowl, leaving
viewers scratching their heads and asking, "Whoa! What was that?"</TE>
<TE>   It was, of course, an ad for Apple Macintosh computers, as every
business school graduate in America now knows. But it also was a
prescient dramatization of the new American worker and a changed
American workplace at the dawn of the Information Age.</TE>
<TE>   If the first wave of TV advertising following World War II was
designed to teach Americans how to be middle-class consumers, how to
fit in, Chiat understood sooner than most that the "new economy"
prized the ideals of nonconformity and open-mindedness, at least in
theory. Chiat/Day's preference for the enigmatic over the obvious,
the mythical over the mundane, suited a new economic model that
purported to be as much about intangible products like "knowledge"
and "information" as it was about PCs and cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the products in Chiat/Day ads were never actually seen.
Corporate logos might be buried in the corner of a billboard. This
was advertising as a nonstop Fellini film, a surrealist medium that
faintly mocked and, some critics charged, even subverted the
commercial imperative of sell, sell, sell!</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Chiat was sensitive to the criticism that
his ads were better at stirring the pot than sealing the deal. He
once wryly observed, "My real talent was for losing clients," a
blue-chip list that included Honda, Reebok, Apple Computer and Nike.
But Chiat/Day shook up an industry that, like the Detroit automakers
of the 1970s, had become stuffy and predictable, leaving American
advertisers lagging behind their more nimble and innovative foreign
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising in the '70s and going into the '80s had gotten a
little conservative," says Warren Berger, author of "Advertising
Today" (Phaidon Press, 2001). "It had become a business of
mega-merged giants, corporate giants, and it was producing
commercials that weren't very interesting, 'ring around the collar'
type commercials. Jay was kind of like the pirate. He wanted to stir
up trouble, and he did it."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was born in the Bronx and spent much of his working life
in Manhattan, Chiat (rhymes with Hyatt) has been recognized as the
founding philosopher-king of the so-called "West Coast" school of
advertising with the firm he launched in 1968. Those of us who make
our homes on the eastern cusp of the Pacific have learned to be leery
of such designations. Yet in Chiat's case, "West Coast" is a telling
epithet that can shoulder the weight of its own contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   Like the "West Coast jazz" of the 1950s, Chiat's creative
sensibility was cool, intellectual, slightly detached--the visual
equivalent of a Chet Baker trumpet solo. At the opposite extreme,
Chiat/Day ads could be flashy and explosive, like the quick-strike
"West Coast offense" perfected by the San Francisco 49ers football
team of the 1980s and '90s. And, as if taking a cue from "West Coast
rap," they used sly, topical humor and manifested a sense of
cross-cultural awareness that helped cut across ethnic, social and
economic boundaries. Chiat/Day ads had street cred. They knew what
time it was. And they had attitude to burn.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Chiat/Day knew that, conceptually, less can be
more. "I think they were very influential when it came to very clean
looks, very brief kind of hip images," says Jeff Goodby, co-chairman
of Goodby, Silverstein and Partners in San Francisco, which developed
the "Got Milk?" ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In their eye-tickling, cinematic look, Chiat/Day's TV spots were
more like mini-movies than traditional TV ads. And as often as not
they were more intelligent and artistic than the televised
entertainments they bracketed. Though Chiat often professed disdain
for Tinseltown philistines and once claimed that Hollywood had had
"less than no impact" on his business, he wasn't above hiring
top-rank industry directors like Ridley Scott, who helmed the "1984"
ad.</TE>
<TE>   Marrying Hollywood-grade production values to an absurdist comic
streak, Chiat/Day constructed an advertising universe in which image
took precedence over text, symbols over slogans. Chiat/Day ads helped
teach the consuming masses to think in pictures, to interpret the
world hyper-textually and by free association. Chiat could manipulate
hearts and minds with the best of 'em, but he treated his customers
as intelligent adults, not perpetual adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   Chiat "let the viewer or the reader finish the ad. [He] let them
connect the dots," says Lawrence R. Samuel, author of "Brought to You
By: Postwar Television Advertising and the American Dream"
(University of Texas Press, 2001). "He understood that baby boomers
were very savvy visually, that we were brought up on television."</TE>
<TE>   Chiat/Day caught the irreverent spirit of the times (circa
1985-90), when "Spy" magazine was on newsstands, the "Naked Gun"
movies were in cineplexes and rap acts like the Beastie Boys and
Run-DMC were concocting hip-hop songs that, like Chiat/Day, cleverly
spoofed commercial culture while simultaneously celebrating it as a
form of pop art (remember "Cookie Puss" and "My Adidas?").</TE>
<TE>   When Chiat/Day co-opted Randy Newman's ironic anthem "I Love L.A."
to promote Nike for the 1984 Summer Olympics, the ads crystallized a
vision of the city as a mature, self-critical metropolis, not the
laid-back La-La Land of the East Coast imagination. Like the
avant-garde director Peter Sellars, another creative powerhouse who
first made his mark on L.A. during that Olympic summer with the Los
Angeles Festival, Chiat saw L.A. in a way the city was not yet able
to see itself.</TE>
<TE>   An enthusiastic art patron, Chiat presided over the blurring of
art and commerce, but he recognized that the exchange could work both
ways. Art, architecture and design could elevate commercial culture.
"Commercializing" needn't be a synonym for dumbing down. "It was part
of his DNA to encourage new ideas and to challenge the status quo, in
any medium," says Richard Koshalek, former director of the Museum of
Contemporary Art and now president of Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   He also recognized the extent to which television advertising,
always something of a world unto itself, had become increasingly
self-referential and self-contained; that the various components of
TV entertainment--from news programs to soap operas to commercials
and promos--formed a seamless visual habitat where everything was
free to move about and inter-breed. Though the Energizer Bunny,
perhaps the most recognizable advertising icon of the past 15 years,
actually was created by the Chicago office of DDB Needham Worldwide,
Chiat/Day expanded the idea, turning the lapin hipster loose to
invade other commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Chiat appreciated that the world economy was changing,
and modes of visual representation had to change with it. In a 1999
interview with the Los Angeles Times, Chiat described himself as "a
frustrated architect." But in a crucial sense he was an architect who
constructed his business around the perception that advertising was
an inescapable part of our environment, as much a part of the
postmodern landscape as asphalt and skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   To walk down the street in any major American city, or cruise a
suburban commercial strip, or fly by an interstate exit graced by a
glowing pair of golden arches is to understand a basic truth of
contemporary American life that Chiat grasped intuitively and
exploited brilliantly: It's an advertiser's world. The rest of us
just live in it.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with Jay was fun because he was open to ideas, and you
could play, and he was a good critic, and he drove me nuts because he
was always pushing me, and he would say nasty things like, 'Is that
all you could do?' 'Can't we do better?'" says Frank Gehry, a
longtime friend who designed Chiat/Day's former Venice headquarters,
popularly known as the "binoculars building" after the huge Claes
Oldenburg sculpture that serves as its entrance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a manifestation of his persona and the way he egged people
on and the kind of ideas he was willing to entertain without
editing," Gehry says. Chiat, he adds, was a "very special kind of
person that you can free-associate with, that is intuitively
inspiring. I don't think he planned where he was going."</TE>
<TE>   Now advertising may be groping again for its sense of direction,
as innovative boutique firms are swallowed up by huge agencies and
quirky, self-conscious ads are the rule, not the exception. (In 1995,
Chiat himself sold his agency to the mega Omnicom Group Inc., which
absorbed it into its TBWA Advertising unit.) Chiat/Day "made
advertising hip," says Berger. "But it's been hip for about 10 years.
Now there's a sense of 'OK, what's the next big move or the next big
leap for the industry to make?' And there' a sense that they're going
to need a Jay Chiat to make it happen."</TE>

<LD>The New Orleans rap duo the Big Tymers top the nation's album sales
chart this week, leading a rush of three new releases--including the
"Spider-Man" soundtrack collection--that claim three of the five top
chart positions.</LD>
<LD>   The pair's "Hood Rich" sold 160,000 copies last week, trailed by
Ashanti's self-titled debut collection, which sold 128,000. The New
York R&amp;B singer's album has now sold 1.2 million copies in five
weeks, according to SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   The other arrivals were "Spider-Man" and Vanessa Carlton's "Be Not
Nobody," which placed No. 4 and No. 5, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   The "Spider-Man" package, which features tracks by promising young
rock bands such as the Strokes and the Hives, sold 112,000 copies,
while the 19-year-old pop singer-songwriter's debut package sold
102,000.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the top 10 were claimed, in order, by
Kenny Chesney, Celine Dion, Vol. 9 of the "Now That's What I Call
Music" compilation, Sheryl Crow, Josh Groban and the "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   The second 10 spots were claimed by Pink, Shakira, "The Scorpion
King" soundtrack, Tweet, the "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones" soundtrack, Ludacris, Bonnie Raitt, System of a Down, Puddle
of Mudd and Linkin Park. The best-selling single for the seventh

<LD>   The first Bollywood-style film to receive an Oscar nomination for
best foreign-language film, "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India,"
comes to L.A. this week. India has the largest film industry in the
world--triple Hollywood's output--producing three-hour spectacles
featuring musical numbers, sexy stars and plenty of action. "Lagaan,"
written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker and produced by and
starring Aamir Khan, details an 1893 tax revolt by a small village
against a tyrannical British captain, which is settled by a cricket
match. In English and Hindi, with English subtitles.</LD>
<LD>   "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India," rated PG for language and
some violence, opens Friday exclusively at the Landmark's Nuart,
11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A. (310) 478-6379.</LD>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   The Lyon Opera Ballet production of Maguy Marin's "Cinderella" has
been a hit with local audiences on stage and public television for
the last 15 years. Nearly everyone has enjoyed seeing the traditional
story of the girl with the glass slipper retold inside a giant
dollhouse, with dancers costumed and masked to look like antique
porcelain dolls. Fewer spectators, however, have been as enchanted
with the cuts that Marin makes in Prokofiev's score--or the baby
gurgles added to the soundtrack. A month ago, Marin's own company
performed a full-evening abstraction in Southland venues, and those
who consider her a major figure on the European dance-theater scene
should appreciate another look at one of her most celebrated early
works.</TE>
<TE>   Lyon Opera Ballet in "Cinderella," Royce Hall, UCLA campus, 405
Hilgard Ave., Westwood, 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 8 p.m. $30 to $45; UCLA
students with I.D., $16. (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Maytime is MicroFest time, and this year's spring festival of
microtonal music offers five concerts. The first, to be performed by
the Harvey Mudd Gamelan and guests, is called "Mostly Metallophones"
and brings together music by Bill Alves, Tom Flaherty, Kraig Grady,
Masashi Ito and George Zellenz.</TE>
<TE>   MicroFest, Lyman Hall, Thatcher Music Building, Pomona College,
4th street and College Avenue, Claremont, 8 p.m., Free. (909)
621-8022. Also May 11 and 18 at Pacific Asia Museum, Pasadena, and
May 25 and 26 at Pierce College, Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   At 54, Mikhail Baryshnikov continues to rewrite dance history,
showing with every tour by his seven-member White Oak Dance Project
that ballet stars need not give up major roles or compromise their
standards when, inevitably, time erodes their classical virtuosity.
Indeed, new worlds of dance await them, as Baryshnikov keeps proving.
Always committed to contemporary expression, he has turned himself
into a modern dancer of exceptional lucidity in his White Oak career,
and his repertory choices are invariably daring. The four-part

Baldwin's honeymoon gift for his fourth wife, Lillie Bennett, and
designed by her father, architect Albert A. Bennett. The Baldwins'
marital bliss was short-lived, however, and by 1886 they had
separated. Lucky then converted the cottage into a shrine to his
third wife, Jennie Dexter, who had died five years earlier. The
arboretum's biannual open house at the cottage offers views of its
interior and furnishings, usually only seen through its windows.</TE>

<HD>Going Back to Basics</HD>
<DH>Korean village cookery inspires Si Gol's made-from-scratch
ingredients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the pages of Time or Fortune, South Korea comes off as a modern
industrial powerhouse, intently pumping out millions of Hyundais and
digital gizmos. But Korea's flip side is a deep nostalgia for the
food traditions of old-fashioned village life. Most adult Koreans can
still remember when families made their own kimchi, chile paste and
toenjang, a dark, miso-like, fermented soybean paste. Cooks were
proud of these homemade basics and used them daily to put a personal
stamp on their cooking.</LD>
<LD>   Si Gol, a modest family-owned barbecue in L.A.'s Koreatown,
satisfies both sides of the Korean disposition. In the time-honored
way, the restaurant makes its own condiments and kimchis, but it
presents its food in a style that brings it into the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   The plain dining room is fitted out with the usual hooded grills
and heavy wooden tables of a Korean barbecue.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the walls are hung with a museum-like series of
carefully restored old photographs. Many chronicle Korea in its
horse-and-buggy days: white-bearded elders in pantaloons and flowing
robes, jars stacked Ali Baba-style in an outdoor food market and a
troupe of freshly scrubbed children dressed in traditional Korean
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The specialty at Si Gol is ssam-bap, grilled meat rolled up in
your choice of leafy greens. It's a very primal meal. The sizzling
meat--crisped at the edges, their juices still running--is sparked
with herbaceous flavors from the lettuces and herbs provided for
wrapping the package. Eating with your hands creates a sensuous
connection to the simple, direct flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever you eat ssam-bap style, you slather the leaves with
ssam-jang, a seasoning paste used much the same way as ketchup on a
burger. Ssam-jangs based on toenjang, as many are, can be extremely
salty. But Si Gol's roughhewn, slightly peppery ssam-jang (as the
menu explains) is composed of 20 sorts of ground seeds, nuts and
legumes, including sprouted wild sesame seeds and apricot
kernels--ingredients regarded as health-enhancing in Korea. The
sprouting adds intricate grace notes to the sauce's flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Many Korean barbecue places offer a plate of lettuce; at Si Gol,
every table has a gargantuan platter piled with about 25 kinds of
greenery. Larger leaves serve as wrappers; others, such as edible
chrysanthemum and dandelion greens, are herbal flavorings.</TE>
<TE>   There are only seven items on Si Gol's dinner menu. All, apart
from a rather ordinary seafood soup, are grilled meats for ssam-bap.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite is pork bulgogi. Sliced paper-thin, fragrant with
sesame oil and bright orange from its faintly sweet, chile-laced
marinade, it caramelizes slightly on the grill. When black pork--like
thick bacon with wide swaths of lean--is wrapped in leaves, it's like
a hand-held spinach salad. There are also paper-thin beef bulgogi and
a thicker-cut chicken bulgogi.</TE>
<TE>   Marinated meats tend to make grills sticky, and the waitresses
happily provide a clean one in the middle of the meal. Some meats
aren't marinated: beef chuck flap (choice grade, according to the
menu), which comes cut into bite-size squares like miniature steaks
with a good meaty flavor; and the Si Gol Special, combining sliced
beef and thick-cut fresh bacon.</TE>
<TE>   Kimchi devotees will appreciate Si Gol's fastidiously made
kimchis. One involves chile-laced baby white radishes with their tops
on. Another, a mixture of lettuces and greens, comes in a chile sauce
made with crushed nuts. Kimchi, rice and a robust spicy tofu soup
round out the meal.</TE>
<TE>   Not on the menu but available in a refrigerated glass display case
are Korean beer and soju, a sort of barley vodka.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, the scoop-your-own ice cream, stored in a small
upright freezer by the door, is just one more element that gives Si
Gol a personal touch.</TE>
<TE>   Finding Si Gol may pose a challenge because the outside sign is
written in Korean. Look for the bright yellow sign of the Original
Thai B.B.Q next door in the same mall, located at Maplewood and
Western (between Beverly and Melrose).</TE>
<TE>   Si Gol Restaurant, 478-480 N. Western Ave., Los Angeles, (323)

<HD>One Square Mile of Cool</HD>
<DH>It's been a long time coming, but the NoHo section of North
Hollywood is turning into an artists' haven with working-class
diversity and little of the attitude found elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>Diane Haithman is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As I stand outside North Hollywood's Interact Theatre on a recent
Thursday night, two things catch my eye: first, a couple of kids
rocketing down Bakman Street on skateboards in search of an SUV to
slam into in the dark. The other is a lighted sign on a storefront on
nearby Magnolia Boulevard that reads: "Unfinished."</LD>
<LD>   If you've been on this stretch of Magnolia in the daytime, you
know that underneath "Unfinished" is the word "Furniture," and that
the display windows below contain a forest of bare wood. But tonight,
as patrons wait for curtain time at one of the many small theaters
clustered in this part of town, the word, lighted like the marquee
for the opening of a new Broadway show, seems to refer to NoHo.</LD>
<LD>   NoHo, or, more formally, the NoHo Arts District, is an aspiring
neighborhood of aspiring artists, unfinished, waiting for a final
coat of varnish--or perhaps more appropriately, greasepaint.</LD>
<TE>   Though it may appear to be just another flat strip of Valley from
the window of a car, the approximate square mile called NoHo contains
a surprisingly dense and diverse cluster of theater companies, dance
studios, a handful of fledgling art galleries and enough old
neighborhood restaurants and new, shiny eateries to be able to walk
to dinner before the show. The only thing you can't do in NoHo is see
a movie--the one old movie palace in the area has been turned into
NoHo's largest legitimate theater, the El Portal on Lankershim
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Bounded on the east and west by Cahuenga and Tujunga boulevards,
and on the north and south by Burbank Boulevard and Camarillo Street,
the area was dubbed NoHo by the city of Los Angeles in 1992, in an
attempt to take note of the fact that there were a number of small
theaters blossoming in the area, and perhaps to inspire other artists
of all kinds to move to NoHo.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the NoHo moniker arrived just in time to cement its
association with Southern California's early '90s economic downturn,
the 1994 Northridge quake and the invasive pavement surgery required
for the North Hollywood MTA subway station, which opened in June
2000. For years, there was a broken street for virtually every light
in NoHo.</TE>
<TE>   Plus Lankershim Boulevard, NoHo's main street, was--and still
is--as much about automobiles as art, with dealerships and body shops
outnumbering performance spaces. One half-expects to come across a
sign for NoHo Repertory Theater &amp; Discount Tire.</TE>
<TE>   NoHo is a little tough, a little hard-edged, a little more resale
than retail; younger and poorer than the well-established shopping
strips nearby on Ventura Boulevard or cute Tujunga Village,
Carmel-by-the-101, with its mellow house blend of gourmet pastries,
flowery dress shops, power yoga and murder. (This block is home to
Vitello's restaurant, recently making headlines in the murder case of
Bonny Lee Bakley, wife of actor Robert Blake. Vitello's has long had
a pasta-and-spinach item called "the Robert Blake.")</TE>
<TE>   A couple of upscale restaurants in NoHo (Eclectic Cafe, 5156
Lankershim, and the venerable, mildly spicy Salomi Indian &amp;
Bangladesh Restaurant, 5225 Lankershim) have made their homes here,
but downscale Eagles Newsstand Cafe is a better landmark of the local
culture. With its dark atmosphere, display of oddball license plates,
worn board games and fingerprint-y candy machines stuffed with bubble
gum and M&amp;Ms, it would fit right in at the funky east end of Melrose.</TE>
<TE>   Sound engineering students Patrick Plummer, 25, and Christian
Mendoza, 28, were studying here the other day. Plummer lives a few
blocks away. "There's a creative vibe here," he mused, an unlit
cigarette dangling from his fingers. "And this place, compared to
Starbucks, has a personality. The person next to you could be writing
a screenplay, or they could offer you a palm reading. You never
know."</TE>
<TE>   The area's strength--and hope--remains in its theaters. There are
21 of them, and 30 theater companies operate in the area. Some NoHo
theaters have struggled for survival, including the El Portal. But
others are moving into NoHo--and thriving.</TE>
<TE>   One such newcomer is Deaf West Theatre, which casts its plays with
deaf and hearing actors, and draws audiences that are about 75%
hearing people and 25% hearing-impaired. The theater, founded in
1991, has been itinerant except for five years in the mid-'90s at the
Heliotrope Theatre in Los Angeles. In 2000, Deaf West moved into a
60-seat space in a renovated Art Deco storefront space on Lankershim
with a five-year lease, and it plans to remain permanently.</TE>
<TE>   In a first for a NoHo theater, Deaf West will see one of its
productions, the Huckleberry Finn musical "Big River," move downtown
to the 760-seat Mark Taper Forum this year (Nov. 14-Dec. 29).</TE>
<TE>   Deaf West artistic director Ed Waterstreet wants to open a "Deaf
Starbucks"--a coffeehouse for the hearing and deaf to exchange
ideas--inside its Lankershim Boulevard building. Because of the
presence of so many other artists, Waterstreet says, he "doesn't feel
handicapped" in NoHo.</TE>
<TE>   In another coup for the area, Hollywood's Fountain Theater is
actively looking for a second space in North Hollywood. Says Fountain
artistic co-director Stephen Sachs: "My interest in the area is that
feeling of community; it's a perfect area for theater to blossom.
There are restaurants, cafes, street traffic, public transportation,
nearby neighborhoods with families."</TE>
<TE>   David Cox is artistic director of the American Renegade Theatre,
where "Red River," a new family musical written and directed by Sally
Wills, has just been extended through June 16. He is involved in a
new plan by the Community Redevelopment Agency to add neon marquees
to NoHo's theaters to unify the district. "I think it's an
up-and-coming area, and, contrary to public opinion, a safe area," he
says. "If it continues as it has been, it could be wildly
successful." But, he cautions, "L.A. is a movie town, and if you lose
sight of that and think it's going to be a theater town, you're in
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, nobody seemed to want anything to do with North
Hollywood, period. Former North Hollywood neighborhoods anxiously
renamed themselves "Valley Village" and "West Toluca Lake." Since the
hilly area south of Ventura Boulevard has traditionally been the
Valley's answer to Santa Monica's prestigious "North of Montana," it
seemed only a matter of time before all of North Hollywood was
renamed "North of South of the Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, one thing that could be counted on to draw a
visible crowd to North Hollywood was the annual NoHo Theatre &amp; Arts
Festival, where visitors could eat at food booths, listen to live
music and shop for arts and crafts in a reassuring, contained area.
This year's 10th anniversary street fair takes place May 18 and 19.</TE>
<TE>   But the image of NoHo seems to be changing. The MTA station is
finished and so well used that the city has had to add an additional
parking lot. Though many are simply commuters on their way to
somewhere else, local business owners believe it's only a matter of
time before the public recognizes how easy it is to get to NoHo.</TE>
<TE>   One of those people is Dan Hirsch, owner of NoHo Actors Studio
since the bleak days of 1993. Hirsch says he can also tell how many
people are rehearsing or taking classes in the area by how many
outdoor trash bins are filled up ("See the new show in NoHo--it's a
four-trash-bin hit!").</TE>
<TE>   "I know I was the first business to call itself NoHo anything--and
I got a lot of grief about it at first," Hirsch says. "People hadn't
heard the term, and they hadn't been to New York's SoHo. I think it's
been a sort of astonishing turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle of that period when MTA was ripping up Lankershim
Boulevard, and we had big, stinky diesel trucks, pipes, dirt, dust
and street blockages, it was really rough. That was about as low as
you could go. All this supposed redevelopment was going to
happen--but it didn't really start looking like something until the
last three or four years."</TE>
<TE>   At least until the next NoHo Seismic Activity Festival, property
values are rising. Businesses are opening, not closing. And the Los
Angeles City Council recently approved NoHo Commons, a new
$218-million development partnership, headed by builder J.H. Snyder,
near the MTA station that will include offices, shops and
apartments--as well as some live-in artists' lofts.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences moved into sleek
headquarters at Lankershim and Magnolia in 1990. But locals say that
the entertainment industry landmark has never really shared the
mission of the starving artists who struggle to exist all around it.
Still, even those in the business find themselves mingling with the
local artists for breakfast and lunch.</TE>
<TE>   One such hangout is Ned's on Magnolia, where regulars report
seeing a lot of those actors whose faces you know and names you
don't, wandering over from the academy or its adjacent apartments.
It's an unpretentious diner offering great breakfasts and lunches for
approximately the price of two Starbucks grande cinnamon spice
mochas. A Ned's specialty is sauteed "zucchini shredders," a green
alternative to hash browns. What you won't find at Ned's is Ned. Ned
Forman, a North Hollywood native who opened the restaurant in 1995,
retired and sold it to newlyweds Sean and Shelly Smith of Los Feliz
around the first of the year. Shelly bakes the muffins and also
offers them split and grilled in butter.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Smith says Ned's crowd of middle-aged regulars is mixing
nicely with a newer, younger clientele. Some, he says, venture from
the other side of the hill to Ned's, and NoHo, because it's "Silver
Lake without the attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Or check out the Tokyo Delve's Sushi Bar on Lankershim. Behind
windowless walls, painted black, is the weirdest sushi bar on this
planet. Cheerful sushi chefs shout "Irrashai!" (welcome) as you
enter, and "Sapporo!" (the Japanese beer they serve) at random. Decor
includes tiny sparkly lights and a miniature Ferris wheel. Dress
code: The first Friday and Saturday of the month are "crazy hat"
nights; the second Friday and Saturday call for "crazy sunglasses."
The third Friday features '70s music; the third Saturday flashes back
to the '80s. Friday and Saturday of the fourth weekend are all about
Hollywood glamour--but save those clothes, because if there happens
to be a fifth weekend day, the theme is cross-dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the optimistically named HaHa Cafe, a must-visit
location, not necessarily for laughs ("North Hollywood--it's great if
you're looking for a futon!" ... "Too bad, I think the guy from
Universal has already left!") but because they ask everybody for ID,
even if you haven't been carded since 1989. The cafe's bar is about
the only energetic spot on this dark stretch of Lankershim on a
weeknight. Do not, however, order the french-fried ice cream; it's no
laughing matter.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., where people know more about what goes on at Brad and
Jennifer's house than they do about their next-door neighbor, it's
easy to have missed NoHo, even if you live next door. There is a
difference--and an anticipation--in making it a destination instead
of just passing through.</TE>
<TE>   The old joke goes something like this: "I spent a month in Buffalo
one day." The opposite is true of NoHo--it takes about a month of
sporadic visits to piece together enough destinations to fill a day.</TE>
<TE>   Theaters tend to be open only on weekends, and not every one has a
show running every week. Restaurants and shops are spread out and
seem to cater to the locals who work, live or attend classes
here--not tourists. (There is no nearby university, but NoHo is a
creative workshop capital, with myriad classes in acting, writing,
dance, sound engineering and animation.) Business hours are odd and
unique to each location. Unlike Universal CityWalk, Santa Monica's
Third Street Promenade or the Sunset Strip, NoHo is not about you.</TE>
<TE>   That said, for a neighbor who doesn't invite you over, NoHo is
extraordinarily--and touchingly--welcoming if you knock. Business
owners may provide an impromptu tour or open after closing time if
they see you looking in the window. There is still almost enough
street parking (bring quarters). They want you here. NoHo is no place
for scenesters, fashionistas and others who thrive on possible
rejection.</TE>
<TE>   The welcome mat is out for budding artists here, too. In nearby
Studio City and Burbank, many small businesses feature walls filled
with head shots of actors you've never heard of. In NoHo, walls
display the paintings, drawings and murals of artists you've never
heard of. Most NoHo establishments offer their walls as gallery
space.</TE>
<TE>   Many artists volunteer their work, so quality is less blue chip
than poker chip--that is, a gamble. Visual artists still struggle to
become as established as the theaters (though onstage quality is a
mixed bag, too). But much can be said for a place where the answer to
the question, "Can I paint your floor?" might just be yes.</TE>
<TE>   On Lankershim, what looks from the window like just another Color
Me Mine pottery emporium is actually the NoHo Ceramics Gallery/Color
Me Mine company's international headquarters, with a professional
ceramics gallery attached. The headquarters' business office, located
in back of the gallery, becomes part of the show, decorated with a
brightly painted baby grand piano and equally bright arches of
painted wood forming wild rainbows over the sofas--installations
created by Nancy Mooslin, wife of Color Me Mine CEO Michael Mooslin.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery also bears a plaque, and takes in the mail, for
NoHo&amp;gt;LA, the local newspaper, though the paper's offices are
elsewhere (no one seems to know where, exactly). In October, the
space, a brick-walled former furniture store, hosted NoHo&amp;gt;LA's
third anniversary bash, perhaps the closest NoHo has come to being
hip, with celebrity guests and a show by Bubbles the Artist,
presented by songwriter-multimedia artist-set
designer-writer-director (and NoHo local) Allee Willis. On June 15,
the gallery will open a juried show in conjunction with North
Hollywood High's "NoHo Varsity Clay" ceramics students.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this area, I think it's really interesting, but it's not
the safest place," observes Nancy Lane, who manages the gallery.
"There is still that grunge element happening, crime and
homelessness; it's just a little bit grungy. Which I also happen to
like."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street and downstairs, at the Lankershim Arts Center, you
can see work by local artists, both the bad and the good. Upstairs is
the Road Theatre Company. Although artworks here are for sale
(including one wall of pieces under $50), 30-year-old Dover Abrams,
paint-spattered artist and gallery director, says he hopes people
will see this as a place not just to buy things but also to spend
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to reeducate people; in art galleries, people think they
have to be real quiet or put on something special. We want to be more
user-friendly," says Abrams. "If you are a writer, you can come here
and write your short stories and be inspired by the art."</TE>
<TE>   The gallery also participates in an informal "art walk" that takes
place on the second Saturday of the month, organized by the nearby
Art Coalition at 5227 Lankershim. This is not a guided tour, but
rather a designated time period in which various businesses on
Lankershim between Magnolia and Weddington may lend gallery or
sidewalk space to artists, as well as to fashion shows, live music or
other types of presentations. In the last year, Abrams has seen more
growth of NoHo as an arts center than in its previous nine years of
existence. "I think it matters, I think it exists," he says. "It's
right before the start line; it just needs a push."</TE>

<HD>Festival Sets Its 'Agenda'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 10th annual NoHo Theatre &amp; Arts Festival next weekend will be
less the generic street fair and business expo of past years and more
an event with a "complete arts agenda," says festival executive
director Don Eitner. This year's festival is expected to draw 50,000
visitors.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps as a symbol of its new commitment to fine art, the
festival will have on display an early Andy Warhol print titled "Cow
1966." The work is on loan from New York's Andy Warhol Foundation
(which is headed by former Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs)
and can be seen in the lobby of the 5200 Lankershim Academy office
building, which will be open to the public during festival hours.</LD>
<LD>   This year's festival, Eitner adds, will include more family
activities than its earlier incarnations, including storytelling,
finger and face painting, comedy improv, mask making, print making,
puppetry, music, dance and crafts.</LD>
<TE>   Other highlights include a salute to America's musical roots with
live concerts on the American Stage (jazz, rock, big band, bluegrass,
R&amp;B, country, swing and blues, and dance lessons in swing dancing,
line dancing, clogging and the Charleston); world music on the
International Stage; 120 free daytime theater events; outdoor
galleries; and the vendors' marketplace, with arts and crafts booths
and the international cuisine of 15 countries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NoHo Theatre &amp; Arts Festival, May 18 and 19, 11 a.m.- 8 p.m.,
corner of Lankershim and Magnolia boulevards. Information:

<LD>The kids would have walked right past it, as they had dozens of other
paintings by "guys who've been dead for like a million-billion years
or something." But playing the game meant we had to stop, so there we
were, the four of us, standing in a familial half-circle, intently
studying one of Monet's grapes.</LD>
<LD>   And it was fun. For all of us. The boys--ages 8 and 11--suddenly
realized "still life" didn't have to mean "deadly boring." They
counted the different colors in that tiny piece of fruit as my wife
and I counted the many blessings of the Getty Center's programs to
get kids interested in art.</LD>
<LD>   The game we were playing--What's My Style?--is just one of several
activities parents can check out from the center's Family Room and
enjoy together in the galleries of the J. Paul Getty Museum. The
Family Room is a fun resource--a place where kids can try on
costumes, draw pictures, piece together computer artwork or do other
things you couldn't do at a typical, stodgy,
all-the-time-with-the-shushing art museum.</LD>
<TE>   That's the point, said Elizabeth Escamilla, manager of family,
student and teacher programs at the Getty.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so programmed to speak in hushed tones, to act a certain
way in these pristine places, that families don't always know it's OK
to interact with their kids in the galleries," Escamilla said. "We
think that's a missed opportunity. So we try to teach that it's OK to
sit on the floor and talk with your child and have this rewarding
experience."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the games, the Getty offers a family audio guide
that features special stops, activities and stories picked to pique
kids' curiosity. It rents for $3. The museum also conducts
family-friendly gallery tours called Art Adventures at 2 p.m. each
Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Our adventure began even before we reached the museum--atop the
Getty's parking garage. That's where we caught the tram for the
winding ride up the hill to the center's sprawling complex.</TE>
<TE>   Before we'd left home, the kids were having a hard time recalling
whether they liked the Getty, which we'd visited once before. "It's
the one that's high on a hill," we prodded. "Lots of portraits of
people in funny clothes. Really, really fancy furniture. Van Gogh's
'Irises.'" Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Tram from the parking garage that kind of looks like a subway
car, only there isn't a driver and it rides on a cushion of air?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ohhhhh," they said in unified recognition.</TE>
<TE>   To their credit, once we hit the grounds, they did remember many
of the works, especially the Greek and Roman statues and their
missing appendages as well as the over-the-top showy decorative arts
objects.</TE>
<TE>   But the non-tram thing they remembered most was the Family Room,
so that was our first stop. The 8-year-old made a beeline for one of
the two computers, where he used the mouse to move puzzle pieces and
reconstruct works by Cezanne and Lichtenstein. Meanwhile, his brother
donned a regal robe modeled after the one in the museum's 16th
century portrait of Spanish aristocrat Francisco de los Cobos y
Molina.</TE>
<TE>   I think at first our older boy tried on the heavy, high-necked
garment just to humor the nice staff member assisting him. But when
she revealed a panel backdrop of a palace setting, complete with an
ornate fireplace, he started to relish the role. He changed into the
cloak of an English gentleman from a Thomas Gainsborough work, and
suddenly he adopted the stern, haughty chin-up pose we would see in
so many portraits during our visit.</TE>
<TE>   A smile back on his face and the cloak back on its hook, we
learned more about the games we didn't have time to play during our
previous visit. We decided to try two: the Getty Art Detective and
What's My Style?</TE>
<TE>   The object of the latter is to find a particular painting in one
of the galleries using only a picture of a detail from the work.</TE>
<TE>   Our older son was so proud of himself when he spotted the telltale
Monet grape in "Still Life With Flowers and Fruit" that he acted as
if he were leading a class. "See the many brush strokes, even in the
shadows," he read from the card. "Look at how many colors Monet uses
for a single grape."</TE>
<TE>   "I see six," the younger boy declared. "Now can we play the
detective game?"</TE>
<TE>   His brother started humming the James Bond theme, which was our
cue to try tackling the first mystery in the stack of detective
cards. "What season and time of day do you think are shown in this
painting?" the game card asked of a 19th century portrait by Franz
Xaver Winterhalter. The boys noted the warm sunlight and the long
shadows and guessed late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a fan," the younger boy said. "Must be summer." Two
mysteries solved.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly the stuff of a John le Carre novel, but the boys were
content to track down clues for more than 45 minutes, and all told,
their parents got to spend close to two hours in galleries without
having to endure even a whit of whining.</TE>
<TE>   When the spell finally did wear off, we were all ready to retire
to the gardens anyway. I sat on the grass as my wife used drawing
materials borrowed from the Family Room to sketch the flowers that
line a man-made stream. Meanwhile, the boys were busy discovering
their new favorite thing about the Getty.</TE>
<TE>   They lay on the grass at the top of a slope--their eyes closed,
their hands tucked in tight--and began rolling down the great expanse
of green like runaway logs. "The grass is perfect," the 11-year-old
would say later. "It's cut close and it's smooth--no bumps."</TE>
<TE>   Now if there were only a tram that ran back to the top.</TE>
<TE>   The Family Room at the Getty Center is recommended for children
ages 5 to 13 accompanied by an adult. On June 1, the museum will host
its quarterly Family Festival, with free art-making workshops,
musical performances, storytelling and gallery activities.</TE>

atmosphere where people really listen to you read.</LD>
<TE>   Mourning the Onyx: The only coffeehouse that seems to be
up-and-coming at all is the Coffee Table on Rowena. They do a decent
job of bridging the gap between coffee and food. On Sundays, it's not
a bad place to get breakfast and the coffee is pretty good. There are
still some of the people who used to go to the Onyx hanging out
there. When they closed the Onyx, they really took the heart out of
the Los Feliz neighborhood. I don't care what people say about that
place, it was a great community center. It was like something out of
the Lost Generation or a Henry Miller book. It was all of these
dysfunctional people and artists and even transients coming together,
and there was a real symbiosis going on. I have been spending time in
coffeehouses for all my life and that place is definitely missed.</TE>
<TE>   Best Words in Town: A lot of the poetry scene is about slams and I
don't partake in slam events, because I don't believe in competition.
I'd say one of the cooler things is down in Leimert Park, this
regular reading series run by Michael Datcher at the World Stage.
They have a workshop down there as well, and they don't seem to be
letting their egos run the workshop. They really are very
constructive with people. Of all the poetry things I've encountered
in the past few years, I thought this was the best one.</TE>
<TE>   Bun Boy: Baker, this town between L.A. and Vegas with the world's
largest thermometer and this restaurant the Mad Greek, is a lot of
fun. I have my Bun Boy coffee mug and my Bun Boy hat that I acquired
at the Bun Boy Restaurant there.</TE>
<TE>   Quiet View of the City: I like to go up to the Angeles National
Forest and then up to Mt. Wilson and almost to the observatory. You
can see pretty much all of Los Angeles at night, this vast lake of
light, and it seems like it's miles and miles below you. It's
perfectly quiet up there, and then above you, there's nothing but
stars. It's an incredible juxtaposition to be able to view the city
so quietly and from so far away.</TE>

<HD>Behind the Scenes With a Rockette</HD>
<DH>In Cate Cohen's 'Out of Line,' life's humiliations make
compelling theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any actor worth his or her salt has a collection of tales from the
theatrical trenches, war stories of professional disasters that can
only happen in the theater.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, actors regale each other with these tales at social
gatherings. But for those who don't know a green room from a
chartreuse parlor, "Out of Line," Cate Cohen's one-woman show at the
Powerhouse Theatre, is a gilt-edged invitation to the cast party, an
entree into an exotic world peopled by towering temperaments and
larger-than-life personalities.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, who wrote the show with director Gibson Frazier, is a
charming hostess, and those who love anecdote will delight in her
candid reminiscences about her life in the theater. Granted, this
buoyant entertainment is tethered by the thinnest of plots. Cohen,
who spent three weeks in a psychiatric ward when she was a UCLA
student, uses that youthful trauma as ballast for her
lighter-than-air vehicle. The prevailing theme--that we're all nuts
rattling around an insane world--is insufficiently developed and
hardly profound. However, it is sufficient excuse for the fun that
Cohen amply provides.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after her release from the hospital, Cohen moved to New
York City, where she dabbled in experimental theater and worked a
"survival job" at a special events firm that provided entertainment
for various functions. The various humiliations and mishaps she
endured are richly recapitulated here. However, it is Cohen's
three-year tenure as a Radio City Music Hall Rockette that makes for
the juiciest dish in this deliciously dishy evening.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's grandfather was a pit musician at Radio City during the
Depression, a pedigree that appealed to Radio City's public relations
department. Her newsworthy antecedents, combined with her leggy good
looks and rigorous professional dance training, ensured Cohen a
coveted place in the "line"--and all the grueling responsibilities
and pressures that came with it.</TE>
<TE>   With a keen attention to detail, Cohen takes us behind the scenes
at the Radio City Music Hall, vividly re-creating the hothouse
microcosm of a beloved American institution with great good humor and
high-kicking panache.</TE>

<HD>Lonsdale's 'On Approval' Satisfies as a Delectable Trifle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time sure flies when you're having a wry time.</LD>
<LD>   "On Approval," Frederick Lonsdale's breezy, biting comedy about
the English upper-classes, is being revived by Pacific Resident
Theatre in honor of the play's 75th anniversary. Although hardly the
stuff of deathless drama, it remains a delicious if insubstantial
confection whipped to a fine froth by director Joe Olivieri and his
deft cast.</LD>
<LD>   Like Noel Coward, with whom he is sometimes compared, Lonsdale
wrote about the British aristocracy from the perspective of a
low-born outsider. Wildly popular in their heyday, Lonsdale's plays
are only infrequently produced today, in contrast to the undiminished
spate of Coward revivals.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps that's because Lonsdale's dialogue is less showy than
Coward's campy exchanges. However, given the right combination of
delicacy and timing, as in this production, "On Approval" endures, if
only as a pleasant and purely escapist diversion.</TE>
<TE>   The story, which Olivieri keeps in the 1920s, is set in a bygone
world of British empire and class privilege, before peers punched
time clocks and duchesses resorted to microwaves. Maria Wislack (Amy
Warner), a wealthy widow beloved from afar by her longtime admirer
Richard Halton (Tony Pasqualini), decides to take Richard off to her
remote Scotland estate for a month to determine if he is fitting
marital material.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Maria is her heiress friend Helen (Devon Raymond),
who hopes to snag George (Matt Letscher), alternating in the role
with Robert Lee Jacobs, an impecunious duke, as a husband. But Maria
and George prove such monsters of ego and entitlement, they richly
deserve the comical comeuppance that is forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   The thin plot is sufficient excuse for these choice comic
performances. Warner and Letscher are sterling in their
larger-than-life portrayals, while Raymond and Pasqualini are canny
underlings, holding their resources in patient reserve--until the
inevitable and satisfying explosion.</TE>

<LD>   Monster--Derek Nguyen's new play begins as a contemporary noir
narrative but ends as something quite different--a subtly spooky
script that casts aside realism to become a poignant reflection on
the haunted psychological journey faced by Vietnamese Americans and
other veterans of America's blighted experiences in Vietnam. The
first part of "Monster" includes some apparently clumsy moments--but
that impression is somewhat mitigated later when you realize what
Nguyen is up to. The second half takes such an imaginative leap that
the play becomes, on balance, one of East West Players' most
successful premieres since the company moved to Little Tokyo. It's
also the company's first play by a Vietnamese American. By the time
the play's biggest twist takes place, however, it's clear that Nguyen
has many things on his mind besides fidelity to a genre or to
objective facts. We won't discuss the details of that twist; just be
prepared for some mind-bending.</LD>

<DH>With a new sense of purpose, Rick James is focused on his
legacy. But on stage, he'll give his freaky side free rein.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, more than ever, folks need "Super Freak." At least, that's how
it seems to veteran funk-rocker Rick James, who will perform his very
kinky 1981 hit and more when his tour arrives at the Greek Theatre on
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "[The song] came during a time when all people wanted to do was
party, get dressed up and go to the disco," says James, 54. "Right
now people want to revert back to that simpler time. There's a lot of
negativity going on, and our music [can] take people's minds off of
it. For an hour and a half or two hours, you don't have to hear about
the Taliban, and the racism, and the economics, and George Bush, and
all that. It's therapeutic."</LD>
<LD>   In his late-'70s and early-'80s heyday, James helped resuscitate
Motown Records with a blend of bass-heavy funk, squealing
synthesizers and gritty salaciousness he called "punk funk." Where
younger rival Prince tended to be sexually explicit yet romantic, the
brash and boastful James was all about just getting down 'n' dirty.</LD>
<TE>   Back then, he lived as large as any decadence-oriented rock star
could, surrounding himself with scantily clad women, dreaming up
outrageous stage shows with pyrotechnics and wild costumes, and
partying heavily with drugs and alcohol. In addition to scoring pop
and R&amp;B hits, he wrote and produced hits for such artists as the
Temptations, Teena Marie and Eddie Murphy. Even when his own records
stopped making the pop or R&amp;B charts, his sound lived on in M.C.
Hammer's 1990 hit single "U Can't Touch This," which cribbed the bass
line from "Super Freak." (You can bet James got paid--eventually.)</TE>
<TE>   But by the '90s, the L.A.-based singer-songwriter's wild ways had
taken their toll, as he and his then-girlfriend, now his ex-wife,
served prison time for charges stemming from cocaine use and two
sexual assaults on women. His 1997 album, "Urban Rapsody," got little
notice. In 1998, he had a stroke that derailed a comeback tour.</TE>
<TE>   These days, James is in some ways older and wiser for his
travails.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a desire and a purpose now," he says. "Before, I was
really on drugs [when] I went on stage. Now I can remember the cities
I'm in and the songs I'm singing."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Universal, which now owns Motown, re-released James'
biggest-selling album, 1981's "Street Songs," with extra tracks and a
bonus live disc. "They've only done that for a certain amount of
[people], like Marvin Gaye or James Brown," James says, flashing his
old braggadocio. "So I'm among an elite few."</TE>
<TE>   He is focused on his legacy to a degree, citing long-held plans to
release a biography titled "Memoirs of a Super Freak," but James says
he has written a lot of new songs. "At one time I was going to put
out an acoustic album," he says. "But I changed my mind." Now he
plans to make another recording that incorporates "rock, jazz,
funk--a potpourri of different styles and sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Although he enjoyed working with such younger artists as Snoop
Dogg, who appeared on "Urban Rapsody," James feels there's a lack of
innovative musicianship today.</TE>
<TE>   "The government took music out of the schools, and kids have no
way to learn an instrument or theory and harmony," he says. "So they
have to resort to sampling. If music were taught in schools, kids
would learn how to create on their own."</TE>
<TE>   He is fonder of collaborating with older acts he respects, such as
Ike Turner for a 1998 track on "Chef Aid," an album stemming from the
"South Park" comedy series. "That was a thrill," he says. "The
highlights of my life were working with Smokey Robinson, the
Temptations, Chaka Khan or Stevie Wonder."</TE>
<TE>   Khan will share the bill with James on Friday, but he's not sure
they'll perform together on stage. He promises some surprises,
however, as well as a return to bawdy form.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the ringleader!" he says. "I'm Caligula. [The stage show] is
very decadent, and I'm filthier and nastier than ever. Nasty boy is
back!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick James, with Chaka Khan, Cameo, the Ohio Players and Lakeside,
Friday at the Greek Theatre, 2700 Vermont Canyon Road, L.A., 6 p.m.
$33.50 to $71.50. (323) 665-1927.</TE>

<HD>The Xs and the Ohs</HD>
<DH>Athletes' expertise was needed to turn action sports
thrills into an Imax ride. But filmmakers had to win their trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You're perched atop a 12 1/2-foot wall, and one thing is clear: Like
it or not, you're going down. As the ground rushes toward you, the
wall curves into the floor. Suddenly, being on horizontal ground
never felt so good. Until, some 14 feet later, the next wall comes.
You ascend 12 1/2 feet, to a shelf so high that Mama dare not hide
the cookies up there.</LD>
<LD>   Feeling scared? A little sick? Remember, in skateboarding and
other action sports, to be sick, dude, leads to being stoked. And
"ESPN's Ultimate X," an Imax film from Disney opening Friday, tries
to get audiences to feel that stoke, without risking life or limb.</LD>
<LD>   The movie chronicles events at last year's Summer X Games in
Philadelphia, including vert skateboarding, held in the
aforementioned U-shaped half-pipe; Moto X, featuring acrobatic
motorcycle jumps; inline skating; street luge; and BMX stunt biking.
It does so through interviews with athletes and fans as well as
through action footage taken from tight and unusual angles, even from
the athletes' point of view, more or less.</LD>
<TE>   Add to that a soundtrack ranging from Ozzy Osbourne to Cypress
Hill, and "Ultimate X" marks the spot where documentary, music video
and Imax thrill ride intersect.</TE>
<TE>   Weaving those elements into one film was no easy task for
Imax-virgin director Bruce Hendricks, who jokingly volunteered to do
the job about a month before the games began in August. The original
director, Michael Bay ("Pearl Harbor," "Armageddon"), had dropped out
because of other commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Hendricks' initial challenge was nailing down the concept, in a
format prone to overemphasizing sheer visual and aural experience at
the expense of storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that if I just did a 40-minute highlight reel, it would be
very cool for five or six minutes, and then it would get repetitive,"
Hendricks said. "So I focused on the stories and how to best
represent the sports."</TE>
<TE>   Certain personalities emerged, like BMX rider Cory "Nasty"
Nastazio, who boasts of a degree in "anger management"; and Moto Xers
Brian Deegan, leader of the hard-edged Metal Mulisha riders' group,
and Travis Pastrana, the sport's Mr. Nice Guy.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that sets action sports apart from others is an emphasis
on camaraderie. "Some guys are very competitive, but there's no
rivalry," said Bob Burnquist, a 25-year-old skateboarder from Brazil.
"It's more of an against-yourself kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   While Hendricks immersed himself in the culture, he and the crew
also dealt with technical difficulties. "A great majority of
large-format films involve beautiful, gorgeous shots, waiting for
just the right light," said Art Repola, "Ultimate X's" producer.
"Here, there were no take-twos. We worked with the available light,
and it was a very run-and-gun approach."</TE>
<TE>   Because two middle-aged guys with no particular expertise in
action sports were at the helm, a key to solving such problems was
the cooperation of the athletes. Most videotape their friends' tricks
and are aware of the best--and safest--angles from which to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone's doing a 360, and you're shooting it from the front,
for half of the time you're going to see" the rider's backside, said
Ryan Nyquist, a 23-year-old BMX rider from North Carolina. "If you
shoot it more underneath, you're going to see more of the body for a
longer time."</TE>
<TE>   But first, the filmmakers had to gain the trust of the
competitors. Many cast a wary eye, because mainstream media tend to
portray them as slacker daredevils rather than as athletes who train
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Having ESPN, which launched the X Games in 1995, in the Disney
corporate family helped open doors. In the end, several athletes
assisted. Meanwhile, "Ultimate X" crew members, many of whom had
worked on last year's "Pearl Harbor," added visual tricks from their
own repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   The film that resulted from this unusual alliance seems to please
the athletes who've seen it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little worried on the way to the premiere. You never know
how they're going to do it," skateboarder Burnquist said. "But it
turned out amazing.... You're surrounded by, like, this poetry in
motion right in your face."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that the point-of-view shots are always
representative of what the athletes see, however. A
skateboard-mounted camera, for example, shows the view from close to
the ground, not from the skater's eye level. "It's definitely a
different feeling," Burnquist said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the cameras on the street luges were behind the
sliders' heads, giving more of the athlete's perspective of hurtling
down the road at up to 80 mph. You can see the sparks flying from the
wheels of competing luges, the bales of hay awaiting those who skid
away on the turns.</TE>
<TE>   What you won't feel, though, are the G-forces of each sport--or,
aside from possible dizziness, the injuries. Burnquist has broken 19
bones over the years and endured countless cases of "swellbow," from
smacking his elbows. Pastrana, at 18 the winningest freestyle Moto X
rider, has had 26 broken bones and nine concussions.</TE>
<TE>   Danger figures prominently in all these sports, but Moto X somehow
seems most treacherous. Competitors launch themselves and their
motorcycles into the air, where they perform tricks with such names
as the Superman Seat Grab, the Sterilizer and the Kiss of Death. All
involve the hope that when you land, you're back on the bike in an
upright position.</TE>
<TE>   Such was not the case for Carey Hart, the first man in competition
to complete a back-flip, a move now known as the Hart Breaker. He
tried this trick at the Moto X Big Air event. While Hart was upside
down, his right hand lost its grip; he fell away from the bike and
landed hard, breaking a couple of ribs and bones in his feet and
bruising his tailbone.</TE>
<TE>   As with any sport, though, you can't focus on injuries. Instead,
you strive to achieve "flow." For some, that involves music. Few
activities other than dancing are as inextricably linked with it as
action sports.</TE>
<TE>   Hendricks, a musician on the side, helped put together the
soundtrack, which is being released on Disney's Hollywood Records.
After he and the crew consulted with athletes, they went mainly with
hard-rock acts such as P.O.D., 3rd Strike and Pennywise. But there's
also Fatboy Slim, Moby and, for a montage of crashes, Janis Joplin's
"Cry Baby."</TE>
<TE>   If Burnquist had had his way, the film would have some Brazilian
pop, African drums and solo guitar. Nevertheless, he said the
soundtrack captures the X Games' spirit and that the audiovisual
experience is inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a tease of what we actually feel out there," he said.
"I think if kids see this, they might think it's cool to try
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Hendricks agrees but, being older and a bit more cautious, offers
advice for those so inspired: "I would say, 'Wear padding.'"</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andrea Kalin's "Partners of the Heart," which premieres tonight at
6:30 at the Museum of Tolerance in L.A., explores an extraordinary
professional relationship between cardiac surgical pioneers Albert
Blalock and Vivien Thomas that cuts to the paradoxes, absurdities,
cruelties and injustices of segregated America.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Kalin's film celebrates the resilience of the
human spirit in a profoundly moving fashion, and shows what a
resolute individual can accomplish within rigid social constraints.</LD>
<LD>   The result is an eloquent, well-researched work narrated by Morgan
Freeman. It features many notable interviewees and a smooth blending
of archival materials with understated, re-created sequences directed
by Bill Duke.</LD>
<TE>   In 1929, 19-year-old Thomas, a young man from Nashville's African
American middle class, was looking forward to college and medical
school when his savings earned in carpentry were wiped out in the
stock market crash. The best Thomas could do was to land a job as a
janitor in a Vanderbilt University research laboratory, where he
caught the attention of Dr. Blalock, scion of a renowned Georgia
plantation and business family. Thomas soon became Blalock's research
assistant, and accompanied the doctor to Johns Hopkins University in
1941.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague, pediatric surgeon Dr. Helen Taussig, suggested a way
in which Blalock might operate on the obstructed hearts of "blue
babies." It fell to Thomas to conduct a series of successful
experiments on animals and also design and fabricate the surgical
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   When Blalock was ready to perform the first surgery in 1944, he
relied on Thomas to guide him through the process. It was a success,
and Thomas would remain at Blalock's side for the next 20 years,
during which time Blalock and Hopkins became world-renowned.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Thomas was unable to sit at the same table at lunch
with Blalock, and had to observe the doctor's 60th birthday gala in a
hotel ballroom from a back room.</TE>
<TE>   Blalock, a Southern traditionalist, died at 65, just as the civil
rights movement was gathering force; Thomas lived to 85, long enough
to be formally recognized by Johns Hopkins and his colleagues. But
Dr. Levi Watkins of the university's medical school says Thomas is
still "the most untalked about, unappreciated, unknown giant in the
African American community. What he helped facilitate impacted people
all over the world." (310) 772-2529.</TE>

<TE>   The American Cinematheque's "A Matter of Life and Death: The Films
of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger" concludes tonight at 7 with
one of the team's masterpieces, "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"
(1943), which offers the old-fashioned satisfaction of fully rounded
central characters who evolve over an adult lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   The movie spans 1902 to 1943 in the life of a kindly, aristocratic
career officer (a superb Roger Livesey), a symbol of British fair
play who finds himself obsolete with the outbreak of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   This handsome Technicolor production, restored by the British Film
Institute to its original 163 minutes, is subtle and paradoxical: Its
makers regret their hero's naivete while respecting his innate
decency, and they anticipate the ruthlessness of the postwar world.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Walbrook is Livesey's urbane German friend and rival;
Deborah Kerr plays all the key women in both their lives. "Colonel
Blimp" will be followed by the mystical "Gone to Earth" (1950).

<TE>   Veteran German producer Regina Ziegler commissioned both new and
established filmmakers to contribute to "Erotic Tales," a series that
was broadcast on German TV. The Laemmle Theaters will present a
selection in six separate programs. Program I screens at the Sunset 5
on Friday and Saturday at midnight, and at 10 a.m. Saturday and
Sunday..</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rafelson's "Wet" is a sly and sexy tale in which the stunning
Davida (Cynda Williams of "One False Move") enters a luxury bathroom
fixtures store just as it is closing. Quickly, she and Bruce (Arliss
Howard), the store manager are alone, and she picks out a bathtub for
purchase but insists on trying it out first.... Melvin Van Peebles'
"Vroom, Vroom, Vroom" stars Robert Barboza as a luckless farm boy
whose kindness to an older woman is rewarded with a very special
bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all is Eoin Moore's steamy "Why Don't We Do It in the
Road?" The witty, fully developed vignette looks at the relationship
of pretty postmodern artist Zarah (Isabelle Stoffel) and her lover,
Anton (Erdal Yildiz), a dance band bassist, and how it's affected
when Zarah wins a choice commission to create an assemblage for
Berlin's spectacularly rebuilt Potsdamer Platz. Anton becomes jealous
of the time the commission is taking--until he recalls how Zarah
likes to carry on romantically in high-risk places.</TE>

<HD>Class, Credulity Crossed in 'Love'</HD>
<DH>David E. Talbert's comedy feels a bit forced in hooking up
an executive and mailroom worker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Love Makes Things Happen" might better be called "Playwright Makes
Things Happen," for just about every plot turn in this romantic
comedy with music stems from the bald-faced contrivances of writer
and director David E. Talbert rather than from authentic feelings of
love between the characters or any other halfway plausible reason.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't likely to matter much to the fans of Talbert's previous
work ("His Woman, His Wife" and "Mr. Right Now), who flocked to the
Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday for the opening of the first installment
in what Talbert bills as the "Urban Broadway Series."</LD>
<LD>   Talbert calls himself "America's leading producer of urban
comedies and gospel musicals." "Love Makes Things Happen" is in the
former category, with relatively few references to God. The musical
numbers are from the glossy pop catalog of Kenneth "Babyface"
Edmonds, who is one of the executive producers along with Talbert and
Noel Jones. Edmonds wrote one new song for this show.</LD>
<TE>   The story is ostensibly a cross-class romantic comedy, in which a
newly divorced Internet start-up executive (Dawn Robinson) and a new
mailroom worker (Kevon Edmonds, brother of Kenneth) in her building
fall in love, much to the consternation of her overbearing friend
(Demetress Long) and much to the surprise of the layabouts who
inhabit the mailroom (comedian Joe Torry, Cheryl "Coko" Gamble, Damon
Butler).</TE>
<TE>   Without giving away the ending, let's just say that the class
clash isn't as stark as it's initially portrayed, and it's finally
defused in the manner of many a Hollywood or romance-novel fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   It's safe to add, however, that when the exec starts fretting over
whether her new guy is only after her money, the scene in which she
is talked into shedding those doubts is awfully awkward. She's
persuaded to revive the affair by listening to the dubious advice of
a many-times-married janitor (Chris Simpson) who purports to be an
expert on the power of love.</TE>
<TE>   The songs are staged in the manner of concert interludes rather
than integrated into the action in musical-comedy style.</TE>
<TE>   As the lovers, Robinson and Kevon Edmonds conduct a rather chaste
affair, becoming soulful only in their musical solos, in which the
volume is amplified to a level far beyond what's necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting players provide comic relief with the usual
sitcom-influenced banter. Butler's overblown performance as an
effeminate sidekick drifts back in the direction of unsavory
decades-old stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   Dewayne Porter's set is notable mostly for providing this powerful
executive with a strangely garish office and a desk that's barely
larger than one of those old TV-dinner trays.</TE>

<HD>A Dance With Diversity</HD>
<DH>Traditional African movement proves irresistible to
students of varying ethnicity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Man, those girls could moo-ooh-ove! They were shaking and jumping,
prancing and strutting, just dancing. And with so much attitude
nobody could tell them they didn't have soul. Hands on hips, chins in
the air, bare feet bouncing to African rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   "Push, push, push," said Omowale Awe, leading lines of the sweaty,
panting students in her African dance class at the Lula Washington
Dance Theatre one Wednesday night. Wearing a matching African printed
lappa (wrap skirt), blouse and head wrap, she watched the women in
sweatpants and T-shirts dance so beautifully it surprised her.</LD>
<LD>   Who said white girls have no rhythm? In Awe's African dance
class--which is mixed with whites, blacks, Latinos and Asians from 8
years old to 62--held in the Mid-Wilshire district, they sure do.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, finding people of various ethnicities is common in
African dance classes throughout Los Angeles nowadays. The dance,
which used to belong to an exclusive club of African teachers and
African American students who treated it as a way of life rather than
a recreational activity, is now open to anyone who can pay the $10
class fee and isn't afraid to let go of inhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   And they can't be scared of the beat. Tiki tiki, boom, boom. Tiki
tiki, boom, boom. Francis Awe pounded his dundun drum (boom boom)
with a bent metal rod so hard (boom boom) you would think he was
trying to (boom boom) break the darn thing. But his hard-hitting
beats only made the other drummers tap their Nigerian talking drums
faster and faster. And it led the dancers to protrude and retract
their chests harder and harder. Hit it, man, hit it. Boom boom.</TE>
<TE>   "They make you sweat," said Nobuko Miyamoto, a 62-year-old
Japanese American, after completing the 90-minute workout. But
African dance is not simply a form of exercise, she said: "I just
think the connection to the earth and spirit, it brings all different
types of people together."</TE>
<TE>   The diversity of students in the class led by Omowale Awe, an
African American, and Francis Awe, a Nigerian, shocked Patricia
Hernandez, a Mexican American. She received a flier for the class at
a drum festival a few years ago but was apprehensive about attending.
"I didn't know how to dress. But I just saw a mix of people," she
said. "That's one thing I didn't expect."</TE>
<TE>   The drums sometimes move unsuspecting people to dance, like
Rebecca Blake, who removed the blazer from her business suit and
started following the African movements while waiting for her
daughter to finish class at Lula Washington's. And one woman who
wandered into the studio from the street and started dancing wildly
for a few minutes, obviously moved by the pulsating drums, then
walked out.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, Africans use dance to commemorate different aspects
of life, such as puberty or a good harvest. A dance and drum rhythm
called Lamban (LAAM-ba) is used in several West African countries
including Guinea, Mali and Senegal to celebrate births, marriages or
deaths. The fast-paced, high-kicking dance is also used to honor
griots, or oral historians.</TE>
<TE>   "All the dances tell a story," said Dadisi Sanyika, an African
American who teaches an African dance class based around the djembe
drum at the Homeland Cultural Center in Long Beach. Through dance, he
said, "You actually learn about the social life and the values of
traditional African people."</TE>
<TE>   That's why he began teaching: "To reconnect African [American]
people with their traditional culture," he said.</TE>
<TE>   African dance has existed in Los Angeles for at least 40 years.
Iya Nifa Komode, a dancer and teacher from Los Angeles, said that
after the Watts riots in 1965, more people became interested in
African culture as talk of black pride and black power were all the
rave.</TE>
<TE>   Her godfather, Baba Jomo Kenyatta, began teaching children in
housing projects what he learned from recent African immigrants about
the history of the African movements, which many already secretly
knew.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of shame connected with doing those dances,"
Komode said. "It was considered low class."</TE>
<TE>   Because of this newfound pride, Komode said, African Americans not
only did the dances publicly but wore African clothes and hairstyles,
learned African languages and adopted African religions.</TE>
<TE>   African dance gained popularity in Los Angeles in 1973 when a
group of dancers, including Ibrahim "Papa" Camara, from Les Ballets
Africains, the premier dance troupe of Guinea, came to town.</TE>
<TE>   Nzingha Camara, a dancer and teacher at the Dance Collective in
Leimert Park, remembers seeing the dance for the first time at an old
Los Angeles bowling alley. "My mouth just fell open and I was
mesmerized," she said. "Something inside of me said, 'This is it.
You're home.'"</TE>
<TE>   Camara said the spirituality, freedom and contrasting discipline
in the movements attracted her to African dance. And her former
husband, Ibrahim Camara, encouraged her to teach.</TE>
<TE>   When she looks around at the people taking her classes now, she is
sometimes amazed. "It's a real jambalaya," she said.Learning how to
sing in African languages, like Wolof, is also part of African dance.
Each dance corresponds with a song, which is sung by teacher and
students in call-and-response form before dancing begins.</TE>
<TE>   Masha Vasilkovsky, who moved from Russia to Los Angeles in 1990,
said African dance with its bouncing and kicking is similar to
Russian dance. And recently, she said, she started taking classes at
the Dance Collective religiously. "This is like a totally spiritual
thing to me," Vasilkovsky said. "There's God talking through this
music."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of most classes, the dancers form a circle and--if the
spirit moves them--they can enter to perform a solo. After this, the
dancers join hands and the teacher leads them in prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started coming, I felt very afraid," said Natalia Riesgo
from Spain. "But everybody respects me." Now she takes Sanyika's
class every week.</TE>
<TE>   African dance is also taught at several Los Angeles colleges
including UCLA, Santa Monica College and Pasadena City College. While
many say that African dance and its culture should be shared, a few
believe that mainstreaming is leading to a diluted dance and a
forgotten culture.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people that are teaching just the steps don't have any
spirituality," Komode said. "It accommodates a lot of people but I
think it bastardizes [African dance]."</TE>
<TE>   Ya-Yah Quarles teaches African drumming at the Homeland Center and
said it's better to teach everyone who wants to learn the right way,
rather than having them pick it up the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally, my intention was to get this to [black] people. To me
we're the ones that need this the most," Quarles said. "But, there's
something in it for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Sanyika said learning about different cultures is definitely a
good thing. "It helps eliminate hate. It helps humanize people," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalie Marley from Pasadena may have trouble keeping up in some
African dance classes, but she said her white skin never makes her
feel out of place. "We all come from Africa, some more recently than
others," she said at Lula Washington's. "So don't get caught up in
appearances."</TE>

<HD>Should It Be 'Ocean's 10'?</HD>
<DH>Clooney's missing on the caper flick's DVD commentary, but
his co-stars fill in nicely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where is George Clooney?</LD>
<LD>   Although the heartthrob has the title role in "Ocean's Eleven" and
was one of the executive producers of the remake of the 1960 Rat Pack
caper flick, his participation on the entertaining DVD (Warner, $27)
is limited. Clooney appears in interviews and clowns around on the
set in the "HBO First Look" documentary, but he doesn't offer his
opinions on either of the two commentary tracks.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, his fellow stars Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia
step up to offer funny and often perceptive commentary--and to joke
about Clooney. Pitt, who previously has mumbled on several DVD
commentaries, is much more animated and understandable this time
around; Damon is chatty and articulate; and Garcia has a good sense
of humor.</LD>
<TE>   The other commentary track features director-executive producer
Steven Soderbergh and writer Ted Griffin, who, like the movie, keep
it light and funny.</TE>
<TE>   Available in both wide-screen and full-screen editions, "Ocean's
Eleven" also features a nifty little documentary, "The Look of the
Con," which outlines the film's lush and overtly stylized production
and costume design.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before landing the star-making role of Dr. Doug Ross in "ER" in
1994, Clooney appeared in numerous TV series, including "The Facts of
Life" and "Roseanne," and several very forgettable movies. Anchor Bay
Entertainment has unearthed a few of these turkeys and released them
on DVD ($15).</TE>
<TE>   Clooney is killed off pretty quickly in 1987's "Return to Horror
High," a dreadful exploitation film about a movie company that makes
a film about a real-life serial killer at the actual high school the
murders took place. The murderer is still lurking in the halls of the
now-abandoned high school, and one by one, the cast and the crew
disappear. Vince Edwards and Alex Rocco also star.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Condit--yes, that Gary Condit--and Rick Rockwell of "Who
Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" fame pop up in 1988's "Return of
the Killer Tomatoes," the lame sequel to the camp classic "Attack of
the Killer Tomatoes." In this flick, a mullet-haired Clooney plays a
pizza chef. Condit has an unbilled cameo as a pizzeria customer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Waltz" is an exceptional concert film and an equally
exceptional DVD (MGM, $25). This 1978 film, masterfully directed by
Martin Scorsese, captures the Thanksgiving Day 1976 concert at the
Winterland in San Francisco when the Band--Robbie Robertson, Levon
Helm, Garth Hudson, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel--took the stage for
the last time.</TE>
<TE>   Produced by concert promoter Bill Graham, the five-hour show
included performances by such Band contemporaries as Ronnie Hawkins,
Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Neil
Diamond, Eric Clapton, Bobby Charles and Muddy Waters. Using seven
35-millimeter cameras to capture the event, Scorsese spent two years
editing the 160,000 feet of film.</TE>
<TE>   The special-edition DVD features the wide-screen version of the
beautiful, crisp new digital transfer with the original remastered
stereo mix. A new documentary, "Revisiting the Last Waltz," features
interviews with Robertson and Scorsese. They talk lovingly about the
inception of the project, Scorsese's intricate planning, and
production designer Boris Leven's magical transformation of the
Winterland.</TE>
<TE>   Another highlight is never-before-seen "jam footage" that took
place at the end of the concert, featuring the Band grooving with the
likes of Dr. John, Ringo Starr, Clapton, Ron Wood, Young and Paul
Butterfield. After six hours of running, though, the cameras gave out
during the jam session.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson and Scorsese supply the intelligent, informative
commentary, though they do repeat a lot of the stories they discuss
in the documentary. The second commentary track features, among
others, screenwriter and former critic Jay Cocks; the film's
producer, Jonathan Taplin; the associate producer, Steven Prince, who
does an uncanny impersonation of Scorsese; and Ronnie Hawkins, Hudson
and Helm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon Voight and Bruce Dern offer very emotional commentary on the
digital edition of the 1978 Oscar-winning drama "Coming Home" (MGM,
$20). Jane Fonda and Voight won Academy Awards for their touching
performances in this drama about the relationship between an
embittered paraplegic Vietnam vet and a married VA hospital
volunteer. Dern received an Oscar nomination as Fonda's conservative,
gung-ho Marine husband, who returns from Vietnam psychologically
disabled. Hal Ashby directed.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition features two terrific new documentaries: one
on the making of the film, complete with interviews with Voight, Dern
and cinematographer Haskell Wexler, and another on the career of the

<TE>   Fonda is notably missing in action from the DVD. Considering that
the project began with her, it would have been more enriching to have
her participate in the disc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three vintage "Winnie the Pooh" shorts make up the delightful 1977
film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," which makes its DVD
bow this week (Disney, $30).</TE>
<TE>   Digitally remastered and restored, these shorts are based on the
beloved stories of A.A. Milne and feature Sterling Holloway as the
voice of Pooh.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes the animated short "A Day for
Eeyore"; a "Story Behind the Masterpiece" documentary on how Walt
Disney brought the famous tales to animated life; a "Pooh's Pop-Up
Fun Facts" extra that offers tidbits about the production while the
movie is playing; a Disney storybook; a video art gallery; "The
Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" sing-along song; Carly Simon's
performance of the "Winnie-the-Pooh Theme Song"; and a very shameless
plug for the upcoming made-for-video "Winnie the Pooh: Happy Holidays
to You" and the 2003 theatrical, "Piglet's BIG Movie."</TE>
<TE>   A VHS version ($25) includes the documentary, the Simon music
video, the "Eeyore" short and the sneak previews.</TE>

<HD>'Sylvia' Is a Sentimental Tale of a Pup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor Kate. Her marriage to Greg has been derailed by a mysterious
rival. Greg met the rival in the park near his Manhattan apartment
and that was that. He barely looks at his wife now, finding
middle-age solace in the frisky flirtations of another.</LD>
<LD>   Kismet comes in all forms, or so it would seem in A.R. Gurney's
"Sylvia." For Greg, it's a dog's world. He can't stop obsessing over
Sylvia, the stray pooch he brings home and lets take over his dull
life.</LD>
<LD>   Gurney's ploy of placing an attractive actress in the role has
proved successful at the box office since 1995, when this goofy
romantic comedy was first staged and soon became a favorite at
regional playhouses.</LD>
<TE>   The Grove Theater Center has apparently scored as well--a
spokesman said its recent run of "Sylvia" was extended for three
weekends at the center's Gem Theater until May 18.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many big insights here, but Gurney has found at least
one, which goes to the core of the play's popularity: We all want a
loyalist, a person (or pet, if you're really desperate) to offer
unconditional love when we feel boxed in. "Sylvia," as is customary
from the writer of the dewy "Love Letters" and "Ancestral Voices," is
unrepentantly sentimental.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kevin Cochran's direction at the Grove, Sondi Kroeger Foley
goes with that flow. She's all about oversized feelings ... you know
dogs. They've got all oversized feelings--and kneeling by her man. Of
course, Greg has the best of it through Gurney's gimmick; this
devotion comes in an appealing package. Anyone surprised that Kate
feels threatened, even by a mutt?</TE>
<TE>   Foley could have tripped over Gurney's trick, but she manages to
dash around the stage, taking time to bark at strange noises, chew
shoes and sniff a lap or two without prompting groans. She knows the
part has a layer of self-mockery and works with it. Foley seems to be
tickling herself as Sylvia as much as she tickles the audience.</TE>
<TE>   There's a comfortable rapport between her and David Allen Jones'
Greg.</TE>
<TE>   The unhurried Jones has the hang-dog look of a guy trying to
figure out the next path for his life, only brightening when Sylvia
is there with him. Even his voice sounds hang-dog, bracketed by
regret and confusion as he stumbles away from his wife, then tries to
stumble back to her.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Nicholson is too young for Kate in this production, but
she's a resourceful actress. Her Kate, an intellectual who quotes
Shakespeare to underscore her frustration at any given moment, is
naturally edgy and becomes more unstrung as Greg's affection for
Sylvia (or "Saliva" as Kate calls her) increases.</TE>
<TE>   Her long Dog Day Afternoon eventually ends happily (Gurney is into
happy endings), but getting there for Kate is a growling, howling
test of wills.</TE>

<HD>The Road to El Dorado</HD>
<DH>Actually, it's a boulevard, San Vicente, that leads to this
popular Brentwood cantina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can tell a lot about a place by its doorman. Over the years, I've
met some stellar guardians at the gate: Steve Harlow from the Viper
Room, Eric Elle from Deep and Big John at the Key Club embody grace
under pressure. You can now add Doug Biolchini to that short list of
smooth operators. The doorman at the El Dorado Cantina in Brentwood
puts you in a good mood before you even enter the popular Mexican
restaurant and nightclub.</LD>
<LD>   First off, his resemblance to Matt LeBlanc is so startling,
"Friends" junkies will feel as if they already know him. An aspiring
actor from Oklahoma, Biolchini greets total strangers with a
warmhearted smile and, as the weekend nights heat up to full
capacity, he appears genuinely bummed when he can't let people
inside.</LD>
<LD>   And they do line up. Despite its very un-Hollywood location, smack
in the heart of Brentwood's sleepy business district, the El Dorado
Cantina attracts club-goers from all over town.</LD>
<TE>   It's not easy to keep a venue jumping on the Westside at night.
For the most part, partygoers are accustomed to heading to Hollywood.
But these days you've got to be a pretty seasoned clubber to get the
gumption up to head to Tinseltown on a weekend. There are traffic
snarls and tourists and doormen who look as if they'd just as soon
whack you as let you in.</TE>
<TE>   Head on over to the El Dorado Cantina and it's c'mon, get happy.
Biolchini, who honed his skills at such Hollywood hot spots as Jones
and Bar Marmont, gives the first good impression. Then there's the
price. There's no cover, ever, and if you arrive early, there's no
waiting. (And at any popular spot, the later it gets, the more likely
a venue will hit capacity.) Save yourself the trouble and make dinner
reservations. The 18-month-old venue has made a name for itself with
its sumptuous tamale bar, which offers such late-night snacks as ahi,
mole and sweet corn tamales.</TE>
<TE>   To get the club's look just right, owner Will Karges visited
Mexican restaurants throughout California and Mexico, and the result
is a clean, warm venue with lots to offer. Its look is upscale Latin
American, but it feels like a jovial sports bar. Adjacent to the El
Dorado's spacious restaurant is the Velvet Lounge, a cozy party room,
complete with DJ booth and raised platforms. The Westside crowd is
easy and inviting; no one's mugging for the cameras. It's Brentwood,
for crying out loud.</TE>
<TE>   The El Dorado makes good use of its space at the base of an office
building. In addition to the Velvet Lounge, there's an outdoor
smoking patio in front of the club and another DJ area in the
restaurant room.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesdays are Brazilian nights, and the place gets packed with
samba lines and the power of positivity--compliments of a seven-piece
band playing near the tamale bar.</TE>
<TE>   And back to that tamale bar. It's a draw in and of itself. The
bar's glass case is engraved with "how to" instructions for cooking
the perfect tamale. And by the way, those with a sweet tooth can go
home with hot fudge sundae tamales. OK, so it's not exactly authentic
Mexican, but it's definitely Angeleno.</TE>

<HD>Guitarist Malone Tries to Make Puzzle Pieces Fit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Listening to guitarist Russell Malone in performance sometimes calls
up Winston Churchill's famous description of Russia as "a riddle
inside a mystery, wrapped in an enigma." What better way to describe
a player whose music can range so widely in quality over the course
of a set?</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night at the Jazz Bakery, for example, Malone offered an
utterly exquisite solo version of (how's this for an unusual choice?)
the Bee Gees' "How Deep Is Your Love," following it, shortly
thereafter, with a busy, multi-noted, funk-driven original, "Bird
Dog."</LD>
<LD>   That sort of off-the-wall juxtaposition of styles and genres was
typical of the entire set.</LD>
<TE>   Working with pianist Martin Berjerano, bassist Gerald Cannon and
drummer E.J. Strickland, Malone's musical skills were never in doubt.
His opening numbers--an original, "Look Who's Here," and the standard
"All Through the Night"--essentially served as showcases for his
fast-fingered technical virtuosity. It wasn't until he reached Milt
Jackson's lovely ballad "Heartstrings" that the music began to reveal
the graceful melodic qualities that always have characterized his
finest efforts.</TE>
<TE>   He followed that with "Soulful Kisses," displaying his marvelous
fluency with blues-driven phrasing. And one more ballad, the standard
"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry," further revealed Malone's
remarkable capacity to create rich harmonic textures.</TE>
<TE>   All of which simply underscored one's riddle/mystery/enigma
reaction. Malone clearly seems capable of extraordinary feats on his
instrument. Yet too often he willingly places that skill at the
service of music goals that fail to bring out the best in his
playing. And that's a shame. Because if he ever finds and maintains
the sort of creative focus that allows his most attractive musical
attributes to flourish, he could become one of the significant
guitarists of his generation.</TE>

<LD>* It could be filled with nuts or chocolate chips--as long as it's
moist and chocolaty, with a little crustiness on top, we're happy.</LD>
<LD>   Sweet Lady Jane: This two-inch square may look small, but wait
till you take a bite--it's one rich brownie, fudgy and full of
flavor. The combination of ingredients is a bit of a secret, but it
clearly includes chopped walnuts, essence of espresso and amaretto.
(Brownie, $1.50.) Sweet Lady Jane, 8360 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood,
(323) 653-7145.</LD>
<LD>   Rockenwagner: The "gourmet triple chocolate brownies" here blend
French chocolate chips, cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate with a
dash of espresso powder to make big, dark, quite moist, deeply
chocolaty squares. You can get them with or without walnuts. Eat them
on the go or bring them home to have with a scoop of ice cream.
(Brownies, $2; with nuts, $2.50.) Rockenwagner, Edgemar Complex, 2435
Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 399-6504.</LD>
<TE>   Stir Crazy: Once you've tried this enormous, exceptionally moist
brownie, you'll be addicted. The ingredients are secret, but if you
don't like nuts in your brownies, you'll be pleased to know these are
nut-free. (Chocolate brownie, $3.) Stir Crazy, 6917 Melrose Ave., Los
Angeles, (323) 934-4656.</TE>
<TE>   Patticakes: This hot seller is made with semi-sweet chunks of
Caillebaut chocolate, as well as chocolate chips, big walnut pieces
and a hit of espresso. The result is a rich, moist, very dense
brownie with a perfect crust. (Chocolate brownie, $3.) Patticakes,
1900 N. Allen Ave., Altadena, (626) 794-1128.</TE>
<TE>   Say Cheese: Take a bite of this thick little square and the first
thing you'll notice is how moist it is, nearly wet. Then you'll taste
dark chocolate, and finally the intensity of almond paste will come
through. It's a marzipan-chocolate brownie. (Brownie, $1.50.) Say
Cheese, 2800 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, (323) 665-0545.</TE>
<TE>   Greenblatt's: This classic brownie is soft and slightly chewy,
filled with finely chopped walnuts and dusted with powdered sugar. If
you really want to treat yourself, order it heated up with a scoop of
Haagen Dazs vanilla. (Brownie, $2.25; brownie a la mode, $3.75.)
Greenblatt's, 8017 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 656-0606.</TE>

<LD>   'Millionaire' Producer: Less Is Definitely More</LD>
<LD>   With the television networks set to announce their fall plans next
week, Michael Davies, executive producer of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," finds himself in the unusual position of trying to keep
his show off the schedule.</LD>
<TE>   Davies says he's lobbying ABC to return the show to its roots as a
periodic special, airing several nights in a row. The program, hosted
by Regis Philbin, now airs twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, Davies says, is to focus viewer attention on the
half-hour syndicated "Millionaire," hosted by Meredith Vieira,
premiering in September. "We're just going to confuse the audience if
you have a regular prime-time show and a syndicated show," he
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Implementing his wish may be difficult for ABC, which has lost
about a quarter of its prime-time audience this season. "Millionaire"
represents an easy, inexpensive alternative in a schedule likely to
be full of holes.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brockman, an ABC spokesman, said that executives were too
busy screening potential new series to comment on Davies' proposal.</TE>

<TE>   Anyone Interested in Hosting the Tonys?</TE>
<TE>   With less than a month to go before the Tony Awards, the June 2
telecast is still minus a master of ceremonies, the New York Post
reports. "We're scrambling to line someone up, but so far, we're
stuck," one Tony source conceded.</TE>
<TE>   If no one's yet in place, it's not for lack of trying. An offer
was made last Friday to Nathan Lane, who co-hosted the awards last
year with Matthew Broderick. Lane, however, will be busy shooting the
movie version of "Nicholas Nickleby" in London. Steve Martin and
Angela Lansbury also passed.</TE>
<TE>   What about Whoopi Goldberg, one of the producers of the
multi-nominated "Thoroughly Modern Millie"? Insiders say she was
rejected by some Tony officials because she just hosted the Oscars.</TE>

<TE>   Staley Overdosed, Autopsy Concludes</TE>
<TE>   The autopsy results are in, and suspicions are confirmed: Alice in
Chains lead singer Layne Staley died of a drug overdose, a cocktail
of heroin and cocaine, E Online reports.</TE>
<TE>   The substance is referred to as a "speedball" or a "Belushi"--a
reference to actor John Belushi, who overdosed after injecting it
into his system in 1982. Staley, 34, apparently did the same on April
5 and died soon after, the coroner in the King County, Wash., Medical
Examiner's Office said.</TE>
<TE>   Staley's badly decomposed body was discovered two weeks
later--slumped on a couch next to what police described as a heroin
kit. The revelation came as no surprise: He documented his
substance-abuse problems in his lyrics and discussed his heroin habit
in interviews.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   NBC has renewed its drama series "Third Watch" for a fourth
season.... NBC has bought the rights to Andrew Kirtzman's "Emperor of
the City," a book about Rudolph W. Giuliani's tenure as mayor of New
York City. Another Giuliani project is in the works at USA
Networks....Jamie Foxx will star in "Unchain My Heart: The Ray
Charles Story," according to the Hollywood Reporter....Robin Williams
will return to TV on July 14 in HBO's "Robin Williams: Live on
Broadway".... Paul McCartney will participate in what is billed as
his first live online chat with fans at 5 today at
http://chat.msn.com/.</TE>

<LD>Welsh quintet Super Furry Animals took listeners on a journey to the
center of its twisted little mind on Tuesday during an El Rey Theatre
concert that blended space-rock artiness with a wry rebelliousness
against government, religion and the status quo in general.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing from its current collection, "Rings Around the World," and
other records from its nine-year career, the group offered melodic,
slightly dissonant, highly impudent anthems and ballads that
displayed a deft grasp of rock's past and present. By turns
gutturally distorted, vividly erotic and delicately unearthly, the
90-minute set variously evoked such similarly
backward/forward-looking American acts as B.R.M.C., the Dandy Warhols
and Beachwood Sparks.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Furries' sonic vocabulary was even broader, as the players
crafted their modern sound by fusing classic psychedelic flavors of
the Beach Boys, the Beatles, David Bowie and T. Rex (to name a few)
with Stooges-esque punk bits and techno elements, mostly in the form
of deep bass notes that shook the very hairs on one's head.</LD>
<TE>   Almost every number had an accompanying film that provided another
dimension as well as something engaging to watch during those moments
when the music got bogged down in all the sprawling subtleties.</TE>
<TE>   Er, not that there was anything subtle about the raging fist-waver
that cribbed from Steely Dan's "Showbiz Kids" to stick it to the Man
but good. But the droll, acoustic-flavored "Run! Christian, Run!"
played like a majestic satanic twist on the twangy, Byrds-associated
"The Christian Life." Although not always delivering the proverbial
revolution you can dance to, Super Furry Animals came plenty close
enough for these under-protested times.</TE>

<LD>New this week: "Waking Life," an adventurous yet problematic
undertaking from Austin, Texas, filmmaker Richard Linklater
("Slacker," "Dazed and Confused"), is an experiment in animation in
which graphic artists "paint" via computer the images of live-action
film. The resulting beautiful surreal effects are to express a young
man's quest to discover whether he's awake or asleep, dead or alive.
What's problematic about the film is that the responses the young man
(Wiley Wiggins) gets from those he meets are for the most part
lengthy treatises on the human condition. All this talk distracts the
viewer from the constant pleasure the film's visual richness
provides. Kevin Thomas</LD>

<HD>Stepping Up to a Roomier Interior</HD>
<DH>Petersen Automotive Museum, in a design by architects
Keating/Khang, will expand 4th level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Petersen Automotive Museum, aiming to widen its audience while
adding exhibition space, a ground-floor restaurant and a fourth-floor
ballroom, has chosen Los Angeles architects Keating/Khang to redesign
its home at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Architect Richard Keating said the goal of the project, which has
an estimated cost of between $23 million and $28 million, is to
create an environment that not only holds more cars, but serves as a
stage for "vintage cars, beautiful clothes and beautiful people." His
plans call for enclosing much of the existing building behind a new
glass facade and adding a gently sloping tent in back, which will
cover 40,000 square feet atop an existing parking structure.</LD>
<LD>   But museum officials, who on April 30 selected Keating/Khang, say
the design's most significant element may be its expansion of the
fourth floor. That 45,000-square-foot space will house a ballroom for
banquets and parties--rental uses that are a key source of revenue
for the museum. The new fourth floor will accommodate groups as large
as 900, officials said, while the new restaurant, along Fairfax on
the ground floor, would seat 70 to 80 diners.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the plan adds about 80,000 square feet to a
200,000-square-foot building. The Keating/Khang design is possible,
in part, because the building was engineered 40 years ago to
accommodate additions to its upper floors.</TE>
<TE>   To pay for that and create an endowment fund for the 8-year-old
institution, museum officials said, they will launch a $75-million
fund-raising campaign in the next few months. Bruce Meyer, the museum
board's chairman for the last two years, said he would share that
responsibility with a new co-chairman, Peter Mullin, and that they
have no formal financial commitments to the campaign yet.</TE>
<TE>   Keating said he and managing partner Bonnie Khang intend to
finalize designs by the end of 2002, hoping that an 18-month
construction phase can be completed by the end of 2004. Though
details are yet to be decided, officials said they expect most of the
museum to remain open during the expansion and redesign.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's six trustees chose Keating/Khang from a field of six
invited competitors, all with Los Angeles offices. The other
competitors were Jerde Partnership International; AC Martin Partners;
Bruce Becket; Gensler; and Mark Whipple of Russell Group.</TE>
<TE>   Keating, raised in Orinda, is no newcomer to California car
culture, having attended vintage car events for nearly four decades,
beginning with the 1954 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, where
Keating's father, William, won a best-in-class prize for his Ferrari.
Keating's own garage holds a BMS motorcycle, a Mercedes coupe, a
Porsche and a 1934 MG Brooklands Racer (with right-hand drive) from
England.</TE>
<TE>   His other projects include the 55-story Gas Company Tower in
downtown Los Angeles and the 1-million-square-foot Korea Development
Bank headquarters building in Seoul. Renovations include Fresno
Yosemite International Airport and the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art
in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The central logistical challenge of the Petersen project, Keating
said, is also the challenge of Los Angeles: to create an environment
friendly to both cars and pedestrians. Inside the museum, that means
making sure vehicles to be exhibited can move easily among four
levels via ramps and elevators. (As now configured, the museum can
move cars only on its first and second levels, and has used a crane
to place vehicles for display on its fourth-floor pavilion.)</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, museum officials say they're counting on Keating to
make the museum's exterior more inviting to the thousands of drivers
and passengers who daily pass its location at Fairfax and Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   Built as a 160,000-square-foot Seibu department store in the
1960s, then bought by another department store and expanded by 40,000
square feet in the 1970s, the building was taken over the automotive
museum in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Its exterior now is painted masonry and black glass, punctuated on
its Fairfax side by a brightly colored race car on an outdoor
pedestal. The museum's collection includes about 275 vehicles, of
which about 150 are displayed.</TE>
<TE>   The Petersen museum operated for six years under the aegis of the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. After its early years were
marred by shaky finances, the institution became independent in 2000
when founding benefactors Robert E. and Margie Petersen contributed
$24.8 million to pay off debts and buy its building.</TE>
<TE>   The museum counts a membership of about 1,800 (each contributing
$50 yearly or more), a staff of 28, an annual budget of about $3.2
million, an annual attendance of about 200,000--figures that museum
officials expect will grow as the museum's space grows.</TE>
<TE>   Mullin said he expects the museum's expansion to attract more
loans and donations from car collectors seeking venues for their
collections.</TE>
<TE>   Keating and Khang said the idea of a parking structure tent arose
only about 10 days ago, and wasn't inspired by architect Rem
Koolhaas' proposal for the neighboring Los Angeles County Museum of
Art. That plan calls for a Mylar tent over the museum's four central
buildings. However, noted Mullin, "we're certainly thinking about how
these museums are going to bounce off each other, and complement each
other."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joining the growing parade of raw, stripped-down rock bands (the
Strokes, the White Stripes, the Hives, etc.), the Vines played the
requisite big-buzz show at a jampacked Troubadour on Tuesday,
showcasing songs from its debut album, "Highly Evolved," which will
be released in July by Capitol Records.</LD>
<LD>   Well in step with rock's new austerity, the Australian quartet
distills three decades of guitar noise into stark bursts of melodic
energy. Now that it's de rigueur to work with a limited palette,
bands such as the Vines can thrive by making do with less. For the
most part, the sound came straight from the garage, but with an
undercurrent of sexual menace. Frontman Craig Nicholls' vocals
slithered and sputtered around the band's euphoric melodies,
occasionally ramping up into a tongue-wagging squelch.</LD>
<LD>   Like the Strokes', the Vines' sound is a triumph of pastiche. The
band can be chameleonic, shifting from tart power-pop to the
distorted crescendos of old-school grunge, only to settle comfortably
into a limpid ballad about "Mary Jane" (get it?). Nicholls already
has the rumpled insouciance of a veteran rock god--every casual
tousle of his shaggy mane seemed premeditated.</LD>
<TE>   But to ask a band like the Vines to deliver on the promise of so
much hype is to do it a disservice. Its appealingly modest rock
accomplished exactly what it sets out to do.</TE>

<HD>A Fresh Updating of Surf 'n' Turf</HD>
<DH>Review* The Cannery restaurant on Lido Island has a new
look and new menu that features seafood with Asian and Mexican
flourishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By my definition, surf 'n' turf restaurants are where your
fish-hating dad took your mom when she felt like seafood. There, over
a cocktail or two, she ordered some heavily breaded fried
seafood--probably shrimp, scallops or clams--while he could have his
steak, all in a funky nautical setting.</LD>
<LD>   And so peace reigned in the family.</LD>
<LD>   Though I never went to the old Cannery on Lido Island, I gather it
was this sort of place before it went out of business several years
ago. It seemed destined to be knocked down or turned into offices
until Ron Salisbury, owner of the El Cholo restaurants, came to its
rescue.</LD>
<TE>   The Cannery, which was once an actual cannery, reopened in
February after a thorough face lift of the decor and the menu. It
still has a charming, lived-in feeling, with bare wood floors that
are either well-worn or made to look that way, and there's still that
lovely marina view outside the windows. Dangling from the ceiling are
colorful glass lanterns shaped like whimsical cartoon jellyfish. The
booths, tables and other fixtures are all new. From what I'm told,
the place is a good deal more comfortable than it was in scruffier
days.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations are a good idea Fridays and Saturdays. You're likely
to see a fairly long line spilling into the parking lot those days,
but don't take the throng as a sign that you're necessarily in for a
long wait. A lot of people will be heading for the enormously popular
sushi bar/watering hole upstairs from the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   I'm going to call the Cannery's current menu surf 'n' turf for
baby boomers, and I mean it as a compliment. Chef Felix Salcedo is
adept at coloring just far enough outside the lines to make eating
there fun and interesting. He uses Mexican and Asian flourishes but
basically keeps things simple with no murky clutter of fusion.</TE>
<TE>   The shrimp cocktail is a fine example. The shrimp are the size of
a fat man's fingers, but the cocktail sauce is spiked with habanero
chile--just enough habanero to make you wake up and take notice.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the scallop ceviche, which has a twist. Instead of being
chopped, as they usually are for ceviche, the scallops are cut in
thin slices, pleasingly soft to the bite. I suspect this way of
cutting helps them absorb the marinade of citrus juices, red onion,
tomato and cilantro too.</TE>
<TE>   Skip the calamari; they're fried to the point where there's no
flavor left, just a crunch. A better choice is panko-crusted crab
cakes. They come in a "mango beurre blanc" that is not what you'd
expect--at least, in so far as you'd have any expectations for
something called mango beurre blanc. Kind of risky, but it works; the
sauce turns out to be just tangy enough to tango with the crab.</TE>
<TE>   The spinach salad is wonderful and unusual. It incorporates flakes
of smoked salmon and chunks of bacon, and the light Stilton dressing
goes well with it all. The sweet-corn lobster bisque is good too,
with hunks of lobster meat floating in it, though it could use
something to play off its sweetness.</TE>
<TE>   The entrees are a little less even. The Colorado rack of lamb is
tender and cooked medium rare, but I taste some sort of voodoo with
mesquite going on here (a fellow diner agrees with me). If there's no
mesquite involved (the menu doesn't mention any), it sure tastes as
if there is, and to my taste the mesquite flavor makes lamb seem
acrid and mutes its mellower attributes.</TE>
<TE>   However, the side dish, sweet-pepper-shiitake chilaquiles, is an
interesting gambit. I don't find much evidence of the mushrooms, but
the corn tortilla strips smothered in salsa find a nice balance
between sweet and sharp.</TE>
<TE>   The wood-broiled sea scallops seem to prove that scallops are the
winning number here. They're served in a sweet chipotle sauce that
could use a little more fire, but the scallops are perfectly seared
and it works.</TE>
<TE>   The "bicoastal" salmon (meaning the restaurant doesn't commit to
its origins) is similarly well turned, and though I can't quite
decipher what the menu means by the "caramelized dried
apricot-balsamic beurre rouge" that accompanies it, it's a fine dish,
elevating an ordinary piece of fish to something special.</TE>
<TE>   The menu doesn't say how large the rib-eye steak is, but it's a
big one. The marbling is uneven, though, and as a steak it's more
impressive for size than quality.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Cannery's food justifies its prices, but at these
rates I'd expect sharper service. The young waiters are pleasant but
inexperienced and spread a bit too thin. All in all, though, the
Cannery is a cozy place serving good food with flair.</TE>

<HD>Jazz Instrumentalists' Flying V Doubles the Pleasure</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The local jazz concert series known as "Ventura Vanguard Jazz Club"
hit a high, slightly offbeat note last week with the presentation of
Flying V. With its unusual instrumentation--two saxes, two basses and
two percussionists--and its seamless blend of avant-garde and
mainstream stances, the group made a captivating noise.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly it was one of the creative highlights of the jazz year
in Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   In such an odd configuration, balance and interactive sensitivity
help. The group was sometimes reminiscent of Jack DeJohnette's
Special Edition, a notable two-sax band without a chordal instrument.
Paul Carman and Kim Richmond are fine horn players, tapping into
various niches of jazz, Carman leaning toward experimentalism and
Richmond toward boppish phrases (as on his tune "Frames") and lush
balladry (on "If You Could See Me Now"). Bassists Chris Symer and
Trey Henry, likewise, are musically multilingual, from free improv
sections to foundational work and tight unison lines (as on Carman's
skittering "What's He Doing in There?"). Drummer Kendall Kaye was the
sensitive straight man to the manic yet ever-musical Brad Dutz's
percussion antics.</LD>
<TE>   Like many bands, this group came together serendipitously. Two
established Los Angeles-based trios were doing a doubleheader gig and
decided to play together instead of consecutively. As heard in the
intimate basement space of the Laurel Theater, it's an idea worth
pursuing, developing and recording.</TE>
<TE>   Festival Continues: The 11-day Ventura Chamber Music Festival,
which opened a week ago, reaches its zenith this weekend. Tonight's
concert may be the festival highlight, as celebrated Spanish pianist
Alicia de Larrocha gives a solo recital at Ventura College. De
Larrocha returns as a soloist with the Festival Orchestra, a concert
that also includes music by Ventura's John Biggs and Burns Taft.
Ventura College teacher and composer Cesar Mateus will have a new
work premiered Saturday afternoon at the Church of Religious Science
in a program called "Improv, Mozart and Mateus."</TE>
<TE>   The Rossetti String Quartet returns Friday night at the Mission,
joined by English clarinetist Gareth Davis. Camerata Pacifica will
perform a sold-out Mother's Day concert Sunday morning, and the
Second Avenue Klezmer Ensemble performs Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura Chamber Music Festival, through Sunday. Alicia de
Larrocha, Ventura College Theater, on Loma Vista Road between Ashwood
Avenue and Day Road, 8 p.m. today. The Rossetti String Quartet, with
Gareth Davis, San Buenaventura Mission, 211 E. Main St., 8 p.m.
Friday. Festival Orchestra with Alicia de Larrocha, Ventura College
Theater, 8 p.m. Saturday. Camerata Pacifica, Ventura City Hall, 501
Poli St., 11 a.m. Sunday, sold out. Second Avenue Klezmer Ensemble,
Serra Center at San Buenaventura Mission, 7 p.m. Sunday. (805)

<TE>   Apparitional Family Tree: Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts" is a family
portrait with a dark undercoating. It's what we don't see that
ultimately defines the work's stealthy emotional power. In the
current production at the Ojai Center for the Arts, running through
this weekend, the staging is fittingly simple and stark. Christopher
Jones' one-room set conveys a house on a Norwegian fjord in the late
1800s, as a back story unfolds through tortured lives.</TE>
<TE>   The living characters are few, along with the ghostly presence of
a patriarch who succumbed to syphilis after a sordid history of
philandering. The upright and uptight Pastor Manders (played with apt
stiffness by Jesse Lovejoy, also the director) admonishes and
manipulates Mrs. Alving (Catherine Dain), and her son Osvald (Arnold
William Geer), an artist who has crawled home from Europe, vainly
dreaming of "love of life." In the periphery, with their own secrets
to bear, are the young maid Regine Engstrand (Brook Masters) and her
scalawag of a "father" (Ron Rowe, lovably despicable).</TE>
<TE>   Among the themes threading through the play are indictments of
socially acceptable hypocrisy and repression, as well as the
obstinacy of a less-than-savory fam- ily lineage, "the sins of the
father visited upon the child." Take away its moral implications and
period piece specifics, and we're still left with a hypnotic lament
on its own dramatic terms, emerging intact in this admirable
production.</TE>
<TE>   * "Ghosts," Ojai Center Center for the Arts, 113 S. Montgomery
St., Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m. $12, general; $10, senior citizens
and Art Center members. (805) 640-8797.</TE>
<TE>   Art About Culture: The annual "De Colores" art show, at the
California Oil Museum in Santa Paula, has expanded this year, giving
a broader, too-rare glimpse of aspects of Latino life and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Montes' paintings of farm workers being visited by chummy
skeletons convey easy mordant humor, while Gail Pidduck shows
dignified portraits of farm workers in toil. Michele Flores'
"Ophelia" finds a woman floating in a body of water and a 19th
century legacy of mystery. The photography segment ranges from Eugene
Huguez's candid shots of Carlos Santana and Cesar Chavez to Arturo
Perez's imagery of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   * "De Colores" art show, California Oil Museum, 1001 E. Main St.,
Santa Paula. Ends May 19. Viewing hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays
to Sundays. (805) 933-0076.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every TV generation has its most trusted doctor. Decades ago it was
Marcus Welby. Then it was Hawkeye Pierce, jokes and all.</LD>
<LD>   For the last eight years it has been Mark Greene, the essence of
"ER," the harried but cool everyman who brought an air of heightened
realism to the frenzied proceedings at County General.</LD>
<LD>   There was always something reassuring about the bespectacled gaze
of the actor who inhabited Greene's character, Anthony Edwards. He
had the focus of a skilled, tireless practitioner. But it was more
than a look. The way he carried himself, you knew he belonged in
scrubs, never in street clothes.</LD>
<TE>   If your medical plan allowed you to choose a fictional doctor as
your primary care provider, Greene is the one you would take.</TE>
<TE>   He lived by his oath, and even the one time he didn't--when he let
a murderer flat-line in an elevator--he brought an understated moral
anguish to the episode.</TE>
<TE>   The news of Dr. Greene's death last week stunned the hospital
staff, if not the show's legion of fans (who knew Edwards planned to
move on to other projects). Tonight's farewell show (10 p.m., NBC)
flashes back to his final days as he tries to reconcile with his
rebellious daughter. Whether he succeeds or not, we'll always know
that Dr. Greene, like Edwards, made the most of his time.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. plans to take out a $5-billion loan from banks after it
exercises an option to borrow on an existing credit line for one
year, according to people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The long-distance phone company, which has reported seven
consecutive drops in quarterly profit, plans to take up its right to
borrow $2.65billion on the existing credit line before it expires
June 7.</LD>
<LD>   Banks may demand that the company pledge assets to secure the
$5-billion loan, which would repay the one-year credit line and help
pay off $3.4 billion of bonds it has coming due in the next 18
months, sources said. WorldCom has $1.6 billion in cash and a
projected $1 billion in free cash flow this year to meet its
obligations, including $4.9 billion in capital spending.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom declined to comment. Its shares fell 6 cents to $2.15 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NTL Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing $23.38
billion in debt, as part of a recovery plan that will hand
bondholders a controlling stake in Britain's largest cable-television
company.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company's debt default is the largest in
history, eclipsing Enron Corp.'s $9.9-billion nonpayment last year.
NTL, which never made a profit in its nine-year history, filed papers
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, listing $16.83 billion in
assets.</LD>
<LD>   NTL Chief Executive Barclay Knapp amassed the debt during an
$18-billion spending spree at the height of the telecommunications
boom. NTL ran into trouble when sales of TV, phone and Internet
services lagged expectations, leaving it unable to meet payments on
its debt.</LD>

<LD>General Electric Co.'s chief executive affirmed earnings guidance for
2002 but said the company will face pressure over the next several
years because of lower gas turbine sales.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Immelt said the company is on track to earn more than
$16.5 billion, or $1.65 to $1.67 a share, for 2002, excluding
accounting changes.</LD>
<LD>   The company also remains comfortable with analysts' 2003 earnings
projections calling for double-digit earnings growth.</LD>
<TE>   Immelt said he didn't expect the economy to turn around in the
second half, but some units within the company are showing small
signs of improvement, namely plastics and broadcasting unit NBC.</TE>

<LD>Tough antitrust penalties sought by nine states against Microsoft
Corp. would hurt consumers and encourage other companies to use
federal antitrust law as a substitute for their own research and
development, an economist said.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying as an expert witness for Microsoft, University of
Virginia professor Kenneth G. Elzinga said the remedies proposed by
the states would raise consumer prices and stifle innovation by
Microsoft and other high-tech companies.</LD>
<LD>   If Microsoft is required to disclose technical information about
its Windows operating system, Elzinga said it would result in "a
dampening of incentive" for companies to do their own research and
development.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc., Cigna Corp., Oxford Health Plans Inc. and other health
insurers are being sued by the Medical Society of New Jersey, which
accused the companies of denying or delaying payments for medical
care.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits allege the managed-care companies improperly overrule
physicians on whether a treatment is medically necessary, don't
explain why claims have been denied and use computer programs to cut
or deny doctors reimbursement.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey's medical society is at least the fifth to sue health
insurers in state court.</LD>
<TE>   Similar cases have been brought in Connecticut, New York, South
Carolina and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers also face federal lawsuits that allege health maintenance
organizations put profit ahead of patients. Doctors in Florida,
California, Texas and Georgia have joined those suits.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna and Cigna, the second- and third-biggest U.S. health
insurers, Health Net Inc., Oxford and AmeriHealth HMO of New Jersey
Inc. are named in the lawsuits. The insurers deny the accusations.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Seeks to Settle Probe</HD>
<DH>Securities: Brokerage firm's shares climb on news of
'productive' negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. shares had their biggest gain in more than a year
Wednesday as the firm neared a settlement of New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer's probe of whether its stock analysts misled investors.
Spitzer said he may not ask Merrill to compensate aggrieved
shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill (ticker symbol: MER) climbed $3.15 to $43.95 in the
biggest gain since April 2001. Spitzer in an interview said
compensation to investors who relied on research of the largest
securities firm by capital should come from lawsuits or arbitration.
Negotiations have been "productive," said Merrill spokesman Tim Cobb.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill lost as much as $11 billion in market value in the weeks
after Spitzer announced his probe on April 8, releasing e-mails
indicating the firm's research was influenced by banking
relationships. Investors expect any penalties Merrill may face from
the attorney general's probe will be smaller than suggested by the
shares' recent slide.</LD>
<TE>   "No matter how high the settlement ends up being, it's already
been discounted in the price," said Joe Sharma, a money manager at
Systematic Financial Management. "The question now is, when is it
going to be over?"</TE>
<TE>   Though Spitzer said he probably won't seek money for investors,
Merrill and other firms still face class-action lawsuits and
potential arbitration claims. Federal regulators, including the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and other state regulators have
also started investigating Merrill and other Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. (MWD), Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. (LEH) all rose in step with
Merrill. They each climbed more than 6%, sending the American Stock
Exchange Broker/Dealer index up 6.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Chooses Two</TE>
<TE>   Fed Board Nominees</TE>
<TE>   President Bush picked a Princeton economist and a top advisor to
Alan Greenspan as his nominees for vacant positions on the Federal
Reserve Board, the administration announced Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bernanke of Princeton was nominated for the two years
remaining on a Fed term that will run until Jan. 31, 2004. If
confirmed by the Senate, he will complete the term of Edward Kelley
Jr., who resigned last December.</TE>
<TE>   Fed staffer Donald Kohn was nominated for a full 14-year term that
will run until Jan. 21, 2016. His spot opened up when Laurence H.
Meyer left in January after deciding not to seek another term.</TE>
<TE>   With the two nominations, Bush will have picked five of the seven
Fed board spots in his first 16 months in office.</TE>

<TE>   Pitt Defends Private Meeting With KPMG</TE>
<TE>   Top U.S. markets regulator Harvey L. Pitt moved to extinguish
another flare-up over his former Wall Street connections Wednesday,
telling Republican lawmakers he is recused from matters on accounting
firm KPMG .</TE>
<TE>   The SEC chairman wrote to Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin in answer to
the Louisiana Republican's demand for an explanation of a private
meeting Pitt held on April 26 with KPMG Chairman Eugene O'Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, one of the world's largest accounting firms, is under SEC
investigation for its auditing work at Xerox Corp. KPMG employed Pitt
before he became SEC chief.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as Chairman Tauzin is concerned, the case is now
closed....We're convinced nothing improper was discussed," said Ken
Johnson, spokesman for Tauzin.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Pitt repeated that he and O'Kelly did not discuss
potential SEC enforcement action against KPMG. O'Kelly, in a
statement earlier this week, said the topic was raised.</TE>

<TE>   The rules, which prohibit firms from tying their analysts'
compensation to related investment-banking business and make other
changes, have been criticized by consumer advocates and some
lawmakers as not going far enough.</TE>

<HD>Cadiz Farm Deal With Waleed Hits Snags</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Firm seeks infusion of funds from merger of
unit with Saudi investor's Kadco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc. said Wednesday that the proposed merger of its
agricultural operations with those of a billionaire Saudi prince has
run into regulatory snags and probably would not be completed before
the end of next month.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based company initially said it expected the
merger of its Sun World subsidiary with Kingdom Agricultural
Development Co., or Kadco, to be completed by April 30. Kadco is
owned by Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud, a
member of the Saudi royal family and an active investor in U.S.
communications and financial companies.</LD>
<LD>   The closing is "going to slip a little" past the end of the second
quarter, Cadiz Chairman and Chief Executive Keith Brackpool told
investors in a conference call.</LD>
<TE>   Kadco would invest as much as $80 million in Cadiz in a deal
crucial to restructuring the company's heavy debt load, although
Cadiz executives said Wednesday that they were ready with an
unspecified "Plan B" if the merger does not take place soon. At the
end of last year, Cadiz reported $141.4million in debt, compared with
shareholder equity of $17.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz is negotiating with the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California to build a $150-million water storage project in
the Mojave Desert. The deal would require the heavily leveraged
company to come up with as much as $75 million of additional
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the delay in the Sun World-Kadco merger came as
Cadiz reported a net loss of $7.8million, or 22 cents a share, on
revenue of $7.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31. That
compares with a loss of $9.6 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue
of $7.4million in the same period a year earlier. The year-earlier
figures exclude one-time items.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Cadiz's revenue comes almost exclusively from Sun
World's harvesting and packaging of grapes and citrus produce.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool said the Sun World-Kadco merger has been delayed by
regulatory issues in Egypt, where Kadco is helping the government
develop an experimental agricultural zone fed by waters diverted from
the Nile. Sun World is a subcontractor of Kadco in the program. The
Egyptians apparently are balking at the transfer of some development
concessions to the merged company, Brackpool said.</TE>

<HD>Mariah Carey Signs New Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop star Mariah Carey, dumped four months ago by EMI Group after a
disappointing album, on Wednesday signed an estimated $20-million,
three-album deal with rival Universal Music Group, the world's
biggest record company.</LD>
<LD>   It's been a stressful, yet extremely lucrative, year for Carey.
She was paid $30 million by EMI to buy out her contract after the
fall release of a poor-selling soundtrack album and last summer she
suffered a breakdown.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Carey was the target of a fierce bidding war, and she
signed her new deal with Universal's Island division after turning
down offers from several competitors, including Bertelsmann Music
Group's J Records and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Elektra label.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe everything happens for a reason," Carey said in a phone
interview from her New York home. "This year was a great learning
experience for me. A lot of bizarre things happened. But I feel like
I'm in good hands now.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who run Universal paid no attention to all that drama,"
she said. "They were so practical and understanding. And now, after
it all, for me to have the biggest, strongest music company in the
world in my corner, I feel so fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Carey's new pact with Universal will pay her about $8 million for
her first album and underscores the improvisational nature of the
music business in which high-stake decisions often are based on
creative instinct instead of corporate bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Although EMI executives were eager to dump Carey, viewing her as a
washed-up and uncontrollable talent, executives at Universal pursued
her aggressively. They were convinced that the best-selling female
musician in history still has strong commercial potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I never once looked at Mariah as washed up," said Lyor Cohen,
chairman of the Island Def Jam Group. "I've always viewed her as this
amazing artist--a great singer and a great songwriter. We were dying
to sign her."</TE>
<TE>   Carey is in the studio recording her next album with some of the
industry's hottest producers, including Seven, the Island Def
Jam-affiliated production whiz behind recent chart-topping CDs by
singer Ashanti and rapper Ja Rule.</TE>
<TE>   Universal, which is owned by French giant Vivendi Universal, will
release Carey's music on her own unnamed Island-affiliated label.</TE>
<TE>   EMI Group dropped Carey in January--less than a year after signing
her to a blockbuster four-album contract worth more than $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Carey's first album for EMI, the "Glitter" soundtrack, was
panned by critics and sold only about 2 million copies worldwide. Her
1993 album, "Music Box," sold about 20 million copies for Sony.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic move by EMI marked the first time a major music
corporation cut its losses on an unprofitable superstar pact after
one album.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music Group Chairman Doug Morris said he could
personally relate to Carey's very public struggle with a corporate
boss.</TE>
<TE>   Morris was fired a few years ago without notice by Time Warner on
the day he was supposed to take over their global music division. The
30-year music veteran had to start over and within several years
ended up running Universal.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this is the Cinderella story of the year," Morris said. "I
can relate to what Mariah went through. I know what it feels like. I
took a beating and I just kept walking. She's going to come back. I
can see Mariah scoring a No. 1 hit next year and holding a Grammy in
the air."</TE>

<HD>Analysts Skeptical About Big Tech Surge</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Investors seeing sector recovery in Cisco's upbeat
earnings report may be jumping the gun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Even as technology stocks scored huge gains Wednesday, analysts
remained skeptical that Wall Street's enthusiasm reflects a near-term
recovery for the sluggish tech sector.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a moment of irrational anticipation," said Ken McGee, an
analyst with Gartner Inc., which surveys 10,000 large technology
buyers.</LD>
<LD>   The market bounce, spurred by a favorable earnings report Tuesday
from Cisco Systems Inc., "totally discounts IBM's announcement about
the absence of demand," he said. "We're not seeing systematic demand
backing up the exuberance of Cisco's numbers."</LD>
<TE>   IBM Corp.'s chief executive, Sam Palmisano, told employees late
last month that the market for technology products and services would
remain weak until sometime next year, according to an investor
newsletter and news reports.</TE>
<TE>   Given slack demand and downward pricing pressures, Ashok Kumar, a
technology analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said Wednesday,
"This year is a complete write-off....We don't see any meaningful
recovery before 2003."</TE>
<TE>   But investors hungering for good tech news seemed to find it in
network-equipment bellwether Cisco, which reported earnings of 10
cents a share, slightly higher than the average forecast of analysts
polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Large companies "are starting to buy technology again, albeit
slowly," said Harry Fenik, an analyst with Segaza Group. Cisco and
other giant tech suppliers finally are reducing their inventory
backlogs.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's revenue of $4.8 billion was a scant 2% above the $4.7
billion logged during the disastrous quarter a year earlier, when the
company lost $2.7 billion, or 37 cents a share. The profit was
squeezed from cost-cutting moves.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco CEO John Chambers expressed cautious optimism about Cisco's
business prospects in the current quarter but pointedly refused to
project a general recovery in technology.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar said that if Cisco is experiencing such modest growth, the
industry can't be expected to do much better.</TE>
<TE>   "Cisco [alone] represents 65% to 70% of the market cap of the
whole telco-equipment space," Kumar said. "So how much headroom can
there be for growth?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors took Chambers' remarks as a signal that a
recovery is near--and jumped whole hog into technology stocks
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in San Jose-based Cisco leaped $3.19, or more than 24%, to
close at $16.27 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Most other major tech companies followed close behind. Also on
Nasdaq, database software giant Oracle Corp. jumped 90 cents, or
nearly 11%, to $9.15--shaking off both a slack software market and
the company's involvement in a software-contract scandal with the
state of California.</TE>
<TE>   Internet leader Yahoo Inc. rose $1.58, or about 11%, to close at
$16.32, and microprocessor titan Intel Corp. rose $2.83, also about
11%, to $28.98. Both trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. shares surged $5.50 to close at $54.97, also on
Nasdaq. Part of that rise was attributed to the firm's announcement
that sales of its Xbox game console had improved in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar called that justification "worse than clinging to a straw,"
because European Xbox sales account for just a sliver of the software
giant's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors may finally have shaken their protracted
cynicism about the tech recovery, jumping onto what they hope will be
the ground floor of a new bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Many may be disappointed within a few days, Kumar predicted.</TE>
<TE>   More than a year of reduced purchases by large firms has depressed
prices in PCs, servers (more powerful computers that manage networks)
and network equipment, among other categories--suggesting that even
as the recovery slowly takes hold, profit growth will lag.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed part of the tech malaise to the bursting of
the Internet bubble and the steep drop in buying by corporations that
had binged on new equipment to avoid trouble with the year-2000
software bug.</TE>

<HD>Subpoena Seeks DaVita Records</HD>
<DH>Health care: Dialysis centers' dealings with doctors, drug
firms are under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaVita Inc., a leading operator of dialysis centers, said Wednesday
that it received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human
Services for documents on its financial relationships with physicians
and drug makers.</LD>
<LD>   The subpoena also demanded that DaVita "update" records turned
over to authorities 15 months ago on its billing practices and
financial dealings with doctors.</LD>
<LD>   DaVita said the subpoena was from the Office of the Inspector
General in Philadelphia, the investigative arm of HHS.</LD>
<TE>   The Torrance-based company did not respond to requests for
additional comment. A government spokesman declined to provide
further detail.</TE>
<TE>   The action comes during an HHS review, announced in October, of
"potentially excessive" Medicare claims by dialysis centers for the
anti-anemia drug Epogen. The Amgen Inc. drug accounted for 25% of
DaVita's $1.65-billion operating revenue in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts speculated that the subpoena was related to a
previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia. DaVita disclosed in February 2001 that the government
requested information on Medicare billings for services not performed
and on incentive payments to doctors for patient referrals.</TE>
<TE>   DaVita said Wednesday that no proceedings have been initiated
against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare accounts for 52% of DaVita's dialysis revenue, and
Medicaid, the federal-state insurance plan for the poor, accounts for
an additional 5%. The company reported 2001 income of $137.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is that sometime in the next two years, DaVita will
reach a settlement with Medicare in these matters, and the amount
will be less than $2 a share, about $120 million total," said Andrew
May, Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you bill the government, you run the risk of fraud,
and a company the size of DaVita probably bills the government a
thousand times a day," May said. "The potential to run afoul of what
a prosecutor thinks is fraud is enormously high."</TE>
<TE>   DaVita operates 495 centers in 32 states, including 81 centers in
California.</TE>
<TE>   DaVita disclosed in previous filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that some of its financial relationships with
physicians may not comply with federal regulations that took effect
during the first quarter of this year. DaVita said that some of its
medical directors have equity in entities that operate DaVita
dialysis centers. In other cases, DaVita leases dialysis centers from
entities partially owned by physicians who make referrals to DaVita.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said that it believes the contracts conform with the new
rules, but that the government "could view them as prohibited."</TE>
<TE>   DaVita's shares closed at $23.05 on the New York Stock Exchange,
down $2.65. The decline came during the company's tender offer for
about 24% of its shares at prices ranging from $22 to $26 per
share--a deal that until Wednesday had not generated much excitement.</TE>

<HD>SEC Steps Up Probe of Dynegy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc., already under scrutiny for power trading in California,
said Wednesday that Securities and Exchange Commission investigators
are seeking a formal investigation of natural-gas transactions that
inflated how much cash the company generated from operations. The
stock fell to a 2 1/2-year low.</LD>
<LD>   Investors and regulators have been reviewing Dynegy and other
energy traders more closely since the collapse of Enron Corp.
Dynegy's stock tumbled Tuesday on concern that traders might have to
pay more than $1 billion in California refunds after indications by
Enron that it manipulated the power market.</LD>
<LD>   The formal investigation, which lets the SEC subpoena documents or
testimony, follows a commission inquiry last month. Dynegy is
cooperating with the investigation of the "Project Alpha"
transaction, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based Dynegy fell $1.11, or 9.1%, to $11.15.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy declined to comment further on the SEC probe.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday told energy
traders to preserve all documents relating to strategies they used in
California's energy market during the state's power crisis in 2000
and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's any evidence of illegal market manipulation, this
administration will go after it," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer
said. "We're investigating it now."</TE>

<HD>EBay to Digitally Verify New Sellers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online auctioneer EBay Inc. will begin digitally confirming the
identity of sellers this summer in an attempt to reduce fraudulent
transactions.</LD>
<LD>   The site, which auctioned off more than $11 billion of merchandise
last year, will use authentication software designed by VeriSign Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The process matches user information such as an address and
telephone number against several national databases.</LD>
<TE>   Only new sellers will be affected. Those already registered will
not be required to reapply.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have security measures in place," said EBay spokesman
Kevin Pursglove, who would not disclose how many of the site's 46
million users are registered as sellers. "We've been asking sellers
for pertinent information, including credit card numbers, for about
two years."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, digital verification marks a sharp contrast to the time
when EBay, founded in 1995, was considered a community that would
self regulate by encouraging feedback on buyers and sellers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not a small city the size of Portland anymore," Pursglove
said. "Now we are the total of New York, London and Paris combined.
When you get to those kind of numbers, you will see players who want
to play outside the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Auctions are by far the largest source of fraud complaints from
online users, according to the Internet Fraud Watch. About 70% of the
complaints it received last year concerned online auctions.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that anything EBay does to try and combat fraud is
great," said spokeswoman Holly Anderson. "We just wish they would
implement it for all their sellers. Those people who lost money last
year are not going to feel so great knowing that these sellers are
still out there and probably still scamming people."</TE>
<TE>   Pursglove said the rate of confirmed fraudulent transactions on
EBay is about one-hundredth of 1%. "A lot of the fraud complaints we
get turn out to be just a disagreement between a buyer and seller.
It's about whether an item is blue or turquoise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The VeriSign process is automated and will take less time than
EBay's current verification regimen. "We have also added in data we
got from EBay on people who in the past said they were someone they
weren't," said John Weinschenk of VeriSign. "You never get fraud down
to zero, but the aim is to take a major chunk out of it."</TE>

<HD>Brad Grey TV Signs Exclusive With Fox</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The three-year deal gives the studio first
choice of new cable TV series and access to talent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Grey Television, an independent company that produces "The
Sopranos" for HBO and "Just Shoot Me" for NBC, has signed an
exclusive deal with 20th Century Fox Television to create new shows,
executives announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-year deal unites Grey--one of Hollywood's most
successful talent managers and producers--with a studio that has more
shows on the air than any other TV producer.</LD>
<LD>   The Fox studio has 24 prime-time shows on broadcast networks this
year and expects to have at least 16 in the fall.</LD>
<TE>   Neither side would discuss the financial details.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said Fox will cover development overhead, share in the
profits and underwrite programs the networks pull into their lineups.
Fox also will have first choice of cable TV series, if the
distribution rights are available.</TE>
<TE>   For 11 years, Grey's shows have been distributed by Sony Pictures
Entertainment, which packaged them with other successful programs for
syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's decision last fall to get out of TV production left the
studio with fewer offerings for syndication.</TE>
<TE>   "It's essential for a company like ours to partner with a company
with great leverage, and our friends at Fox clearly represent that,"
Grey said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Grey has partnered with other studios in the past, this
is his first exclusive deal with Fox.</TE>
<TE>   For the studio, Grey and his television team represent not only a
solid record of programs, but also access to talent.</TE>
<TE>   For example, CBS is considering a television show based on the
film "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which Grey is producing with Rita
Wilson and her husband, Tom Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   "He has found not only shows that work, but shows that are
different from other things on the air," said 20th Century Fox

<HD>Generic Makers Post Mixed Results</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Drug firms are being battered by
competitors after the six-month exclusivity period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three mixed earnings reports by generic drug makers on Wednesday show
that the generics industry is becoming just as vulnerable to
competition and price-cutting as the big brand-name pharmaceutical
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers of generics have just six months to reap big profits
on their generic versions after the patent expires on a brand-name
drug. After that, they face competition from other generics.</LD>
<LD>   That is happening to Corona-based Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
which reported declining revenue and earnings after being battered by
other generic competitors. Watson had enjoyed a six-month exclusivity
period, which it shared with Mylan Laboratories, for generic forms of
the anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, but that has been opened to other
generic competitors</LD>
<TE>   Watson's shift to produce more brand name drugs of its own, to
give it a more stable profit run, hasn't taken wing yet. Its most
promising new drug, Oxytrol for overactive bladder control, still
needs approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The wait for FDA approval of Oxytrol "has clouded their outlook,"
said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Angela Larson, who follows all
three companies.</TE>
<TE>   Barr Laboratories Inc. and Mylan Laboratories are at the top of
the cycle. Both companies reported strong earnings gains, benefiting
from their six-month exclusivity rights to market certain drugs. But
that, analysts point out, is a temporary advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies also had new products in the pipeline to take up
the slack when their exclusive rights expired.</TE>
<TE>   "Barr has expert manufacturing in hormones, and they are
leveraging that by developing both brand and generics. They have a
clearer strategy and fewer moving pieces at the moment," Larson said.
"Mylan is slowly growing its brand name drug development, but its not
as tightly focused as Barr."</TE>
<TE>   Barr Laboratories, of Pomona, N.Y., said net earnings more than
doubled to $53.1 million, or $1.17 a share, for the third quarter of
fiscal 2002. Total revenue climbed to $261.4 million during the same
period, an increase of 64% over total revenue of $159.8million.
Barr's stock climbed to $66.61, up $3.53, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Mylan Laboratories, based in Pittsburgh, Pa., reported net
earnings increased 60% to $67.3 million, or 53 cents a share, for the
quarter. Net revenue increased 14% to $282.6 million. Mylan's stock
rose $2.12 to $27.27 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Watson earned $32.1 million, or 30 cents a share, in the first
quarter. A year earlier, it earned $62.5million, or 58 cents a share,
after a gain of 18 cents a share on the sale of stock in Andrx Corp.
Excluding one-time items, the firm earned 34 cents a share in the
2002 quarter compared with 40 cents a year ago, in line with Wall
Street estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Net revenue was $285.7 million, compared with $296.8 million
reported in the first quarter of 2001. The stock rose $1.05, or 4.4%,
to $25.20 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Says Loss Grew but It's on Track</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. said Wednesday that its loss widened and its
cash balance fell in March but that the company is on track to
survive bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications company, which filed for Bankruptcy Court
protection Jan. 28, said its operating loss grew to $171 million, or
19 cents a share, compared with an operating loss of $152 million, or
17 cents, in February.</LD>
<LD>   As of March 31, the company had about $894 million in cash listed
on its balance sheet, down from about $1.72 billion at the end of
February. Both figures exclude cash held by subsidiary Asia Global
Crossing.</LD>
<TE>   The drop in cash during March reflects most of the company's
one-time costs associated with layoffs and office closures. Global
added that its cash on hand as of March 31 was just $53 million less
than it was Jan. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Legere said the results are in line with the
performance promised to its creditors and bankers, who have been
anxious to make sure the company's cash position does not erode
during bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "We hit the bottom, we faced the ugliness of what we had to do ...
and we've taken all the tough actions," Legere said Wednesday.
"Customer retention is on track ... and we delivered the financials."</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, Global Crossing cut 2,000 jobs, some of them
through voluntary buyouts, and closed 181 offices to slash operating
costs by 42%, to about $900million by the end of this year. An
additional 36 offices are expected to be shuttered by the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cutbacks, Legere said customers remain satisfied with
the company's service. He said Global Crossing signed 475 service
contracts with new and existing customers in the first three months
of this year.</TE>
<TE>   In a Wednesday release, Global Crossing estimated its
first-quarter consolidated revenue to be $788million, including
service revenue of about $754million.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding revenue at Asia Global Crossing, the revenue for the
period totaled $768million, including $736million in service revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which operates a worldwide fiber-optic network,
is based in Bermuda and run from offices in Madison, N.J.</TE>

<HD>State Panel Faults Housing Policies for Growing Crisis</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Report says high home costs threaten to hurt
California's growth, whereas rules prohibit more building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's escalating housing crisis is the result of failed public
policies that threaten to impede the state's economic growth, a state
oversight panel said in a report released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2.2 million low-income homeowners and renters in urban
California pay so much for housing that they don't have enough funds
left to pay for such necessities as food and medical care, said the
Little Hoover Commission, a bipartisan watchdog agency that issues
studies to the governor and Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   Among low-income renters, 91% pay more than the recommended 30% of
their incomes on housing, and two-thirds of those renters pay more
than half.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence now shows that the problem is chronic and getting
worse," the report said. "California is consistently under-building
houses and apartments and the prices are so high in so many places
that it threatens the viability of regional economies."</TE>
<TE>   Though the report praises the state and Gov. Gray Davis for
establishing goals and providing some funding for housing, it also
criticizes the state's complex regulations and taxation system as
barriers to new housing.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest roadblock to realizing the state's housing goals is
its long-standing tradition of not interfering with cities' local
control over land use.</TE>
<TE>   That hands-off policy has often resulted in the failure to
adequately meet regional housing needs, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission urged the state to prod local governments into
meeting the state's goals by assisting and rewarding cities that
develop affordable housing and sanctioning those that do not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to quit planning and begin building," said Little
Hoover Commissioner Dan Hancock. "The state has a legitimate role to
play making sure good land-use decisions are made and housing is
produced."</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations include public policies that encourage greater use
of "brownfields"--mostly abandoned pieces of industrial property with
a history of pollution, incentives to bring investors into local
markets by reducing the risks associated with affordable housing and
easier availability of public subsidies by streamlining requirements
and providing technical assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Local housing advocates applauded the commission's report,
especially the recommendations for a joint state- and
local-government approach to producing more housing.</TE>
<TE>   "This report talks, as others have, about the need for financing
and land," said Jan Breidenbach, director of the Southern California
Assn. of Nonprofit Housing. "Now we need the political will. The
local governments, Legislature and the governor have to make it a
priority."</TE>

<HD>KPMG to Buy Some Units of Andersen</HD>
<DH>Consulting: The deals would have to be negotiated
separately with each member firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HERBERT G. McCANN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>KPMG Consulting Inc. plans to acquire as many as 23 business
consulting units of Andersen Worldwide's member firms for up to $284
million, KPMG said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG said it had signed a letter of intent that covers the
consulting business of Andersen member firms in the United States,
Europe, Asia and Latin America. Those businesses had combined revenue
of about $1.4 billion last fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG already has acquired Andersen's consulting business in Hong
Kong and China.</LD>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Ernst &amp; Young acquired Arthur Andersen's
Pittsburgh audit and tax practices in a deal involving 87 Andersen
employees, who will join Ernst &amp; Young's office in that city.</TE>
<TE>   McLean, Va.-based KPMG said completion of the deal is subject to
reaching agreements with each of the Andersen member firms. Each deal
will require the approval of local partners and regulatory
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the cash, KPMG said it planned to issue up to 6.5 million
shares of stock over three years to Andersen's consulting partners
who join KPMG Consulting in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of KPMG Consulting rose $2.22, or 15%, to $17.27 Wednesday
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Worldwide includes Arthur Andersen, the Chicago-based
company that audited Enron Corp.'s financial records. Andersen is on
trial in Houston for an obstruction charge stemming from the
shredding of Enron-related documents last year.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG said the purchase of the business consulting practice of
Andersen in the United States depends on "the satisfactory resolution
of potential liability issues."</TE>
<TE>   "Our proposed acquisitions are consistent with KPMG Consulting's
stated business goal of strengthening our ability to service our
global clients," KPMG Chairman and Chief Executive Rand Blazer said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG hopes to have definitive agreements with the offices of
Andersen willing to join the firm within 30 to 45 days, with closings
completed sometime this summer, according to company officials.</TE>
<TE>   The final cost of the acquisition will depend on how many Andersen
offices agree to join KPMG, Blazer said, adding that 90% of the
partners of each office must agree to join the company for the
acquisition of the office to go forward. Those partners that refuse
to join KPMG must abide by the non-compete agreement they signed with
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's operations continue to shrink as more companies have
dropped the firm as their auditor.</TE>

<HD>Branching Out of the 'Hood</HD>
<DH>Development: 'Magic' Johnson enters suburban market with
the opening of his new sports club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Earvin "Magic" Johnson opens his new sports club today in tony
Sherman Oaks, it will be a clear signal that the
basketball-great-turned-businessman is expanding his magic kingdom
beyond the 'hood.</LD>
<LD>   As founder and chief executive of Magic Johnson Enterprises,
Johnson has spent the last nine years bringing theaters, restaurants
and coffee houses to under-served communities--typically urban
centers with large minority populations.</LD>
<LD>   But there's nothing under-served about Sherman Oaks, an
upper-income community along Ventura Boulevard, one of the busiest
shopping, dining and entertainment strips in the region. Or
Brentwood, where Johnson recently opened a Fatburger restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson's heart, and the bulk of his development efforts, remain
rooted in the urban core. But over the last several months his
business portfolio has been gaining an added dimension--diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to show that we can be successful not just in urban
areas," Johnson said. "So that when we see a development opportunity
in Beverly Hills, we can show that we can do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still the king of urban development," he added, repeating a
moniker given him in local African American newspapers. "This doesn't
change things."</TE>
<TE>   His company refers to the coffee shops--part of a partnership with
Starbucks Corp.--as Urban Coffee Opportunities stores, and at least
90% are located in under-served communities, according to Johnson's
company.</TE>
<TE>   But with the purchase last fall of the Fatburger chain, which has
most of its outlets in non-urban centers, Johnson began gaining
ground in suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   Development experts said that, long term, if Johnson wants to play
ball with the big boys, he'll have to show that he can be successful
even without home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're large enough, you need to be both urban and suburban,"
said James Rabe, a principal with Keyser Marston Associates, a San
Francisco-based real estate consulting firm. "You need to diversify
that portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   And by opening a high-end, high-profile club north of the
Hollywood Hills, Johnson, who has suggested he may want to run for
mayor in 2005, also gains access to a new constituent group--and a
different demographic.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson joked that if he were mayor, he would have to be mayor of
all of Los Angeles, not just South L.A. He insists that future
political advantage played no role in his selection of the site, and
he remains noncommittal about a potential run.</TE>
<TE>   Still, political observers said expanding his base can't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's going to run for mayor of L.A., he's not going to be
elected mayor of L.A. solely by appealing to people of color from
underserved communities," said David Bositis, senior analyst for the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based
think-tank that tracks black political activity. "So opening [a club
in a suburban area] could potentially have an upside in terms of his
running for office."</TE>
<TE>   The Sherman Oaks outlet is the first of at least six slated to
open this year as part of a 2-year-old partnership between Johnson
and Pleasanton, Calif.-based 24 Hour Fitness, the world's largest
privately held fitness center chain. Another is set to open in June
in Santa Fe Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the first partnership club opened in Richmond, a
working-class suburb of San Francisco. It's doing well, operating at
127% of budgeted net revenue, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who has a seat on the club's board, said he hopes to open
six more 24 Hour Fitness Magic Johnson Sport Clubs next year. He is
now seeking sites in the Crenshaw area.</TE>
<TE>   Through his Johnson Development Corp. subsidiary, the former
Lakers star also has inked deals with such industry leaders as Sony
Entertainment, Starbucks and Carlson Restaurants Worldwide Inc.,
which owns the T.G.I. Friday's chain.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those outlets, especially the early ones, were placed in
urban centers. And Johnson said the added portfolio diversity will
not divert him from what he still sees as his mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never going to go away from what's been good to me, what I
know best," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concentration will still be the urban market. That's what I
am about.</TE>
<TE>   "But you venture outside of that community as well," Johnson said.
"We just want to broaden the mix a little. That's just good business
sense."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Stocks Rally on Cisco Profit Report</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Dow jumps 3.1%, while Nasdaq ends up 7.8%, its
biggest one-day gain in more than a year. But investors are wary of a
snapback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A strong profit report from Cisco Systems sparked a furious stock
market rally Wednesday, as investors starved for good news sent the
Dow industrials up more than 300 points and the Nasdaq composite
index up 7.8%, the tech-laden index's best gain in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   But Wall Street pros and individual investors said the bounce
could be short-lived--like so many others during the bear market of
the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   "The stock market was way oversold and looking for any excuse to
bounce, but we've seen these kinds of days many times all the way
down," said Bob Dickey, managing director at brokerage RBC Dain
Rauscher. "I'm not surprised by this rally, but I don't necessarily
believe it either."</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq rocketed 122.47 points to 1,696.29, its biggest one-day
gain since April 2001. Cisco--which released earnings after the
market closed Tuesday--zoomed $3.19 to $16.27, and among other major
tech names, Microsoft soared $5.50 to $54.97, Dell Computer rose
$3.32 to $25.65, Intel gained $2.83 to $28.98 and Qualcomm climbed
$4.63 to $29.43.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 305.28 points, or 3.1%, to
10,141.83, pushing the widely followed barometer back over the 10,000
mark and into positive territory for the year with a 1.2%
year-to-date gain. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index soared
39.36 points, or 3.8% to 1,088.85. It was the biggest one-day gain
for both indexes since Sept. 24, helped by computer giant IBM, which
rose $6.10 to $82.45 after hitting a 31/2-year low Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and 12 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange in heavy trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq rally snapped a five-day losing streak and provided a
needed bounce for the index, which has slumped seven of the last
eight weeks. Even with Wednesday's surge, the index is down 13% this
year and 66% since its March 2000 peak, as tech and telecom stocks
have suffered the brunt of the bear market damage.</TE>
<TE>   With the mood on Wall Street so glum lately, investors were
relieved by the combination of Cisco's profit report, growing
prospects for a settlement in the New York attorney general's probe
of brokerage giant Merrill Lynch over conflict-of-interest
allegations and a robust productivity report earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "People needed a reason to celebrate and we've just gotten
several," said Mark Keller, investment strategist at A.G. Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   But the market's ability to sustain the rally will depend on
corporate earnings, strategists said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cisco was a positive surprise, but so far an isolated one,"
Dickey said. "We need to see other companies beat their profit
estimates and see analysts raise their forecasts for later in the
year."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, analysts said Cisco's surprisingly strong earnings may
prove to be little more than a blip.</TE>
<TE>   "The general economy is doing well, and so are the majority of
stocks, but I don't see much end demand for tech and telecom," Keller
said, noting that Cisco's latest quarterly sales were up only
slightly from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors also expressed wariness, especially toward
the big, battered tech stocks weighing down the indexes.</TE>
<TE>   "Two parts of the three-legged stool are working right now.
Inflation and interest rates are low, but corporate earnings are
unclear," said Jim Peoples, a health-care consultant in Agoura Hills.
"You have to step back and ask whether Cisco did well because of
cost-cutting and inventory re-stocking, or a sustainable trend based
on demand."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said so-called short covering also powered the rally, a
trend that might not continue. In a short sale, an investor bets on a
decline in price using borrowed shares; in a "short covering rally,"
traders rush to close out their bets by buying back the shares to
lock in gains or stem losses.</TE>
<TE>   With first-quarter earnings season over, the market could bounce
along in a "trading range" over the next few months of roughly 1,550
to 1,700 on the Nasdaq and 9,700 to 10,200 on the Dow, Dickey
said--typical of the market's "summer doldrums."</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil prices and oil stocks also rallied after the latest
suicide bombing in Israel renewed fears that escalating Middle East
violence might disrupt supplies. Crude rose $1.22 to $27.85 a barrel
in New York trading. A key index of oilfield services stocks gained
4%, led by Schlumberger, up $2.32 to $56.35.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields jumped as the rally in stocks drew cash away
from fixed-income investments. Traders also expressed concern that
the Federal Reserve might hike interest rates, still at 40-year lows,
as early as August to keep inflation at bay.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 5.22% from 5.06%
Tuesday, its biggest one-day rise in two months.</TE>
<TE>   Among other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Several Southern California tech stocks posted big gains,
including Qlogic, up $10.24 to $48.50; Vitesse Semiconductor, up
$1.33 to $6.10; and Broadcom, up $3.65 to $28.37.</TE>
<TE>   * Expedia and Hotels.com sank after two large hotel chains said
they will offer lower rates than those available through Internet
booking sites. Expedia lost $5.06 to $76.59 and Hotels.com slipped
$5.52 to $55.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, Japan's Nikkei index gained 1.8%, while in Europe,
Germany's DAX rose 3.2%, Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 1.7%, and
France's CAC-40 gained 2.5%.</TE>

<HD>Northrop to Delay TRW Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. agreed to halt its $6.7-billion hostile
takeover bid for TRW Inc. until Sept. 30 while it reviews the smaller
defense contractor's financial information, according to a regulatory
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The length of the so-called standstill agreement had been at the
center of a dispute between the companies about opening talks on a
possible Northrop acquisition. Cleveland-based TRW had sought a
longer delay.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement would be extended another year if TRW announces on
or before Sept. 30 that it has entered into a combination involving
all or most of the company, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Northrop agreed to the accord Monday after weeks
of acrimony between the companies, signaling the No.4 U.S. defense
contractor may sweeten its offer.</LD>
<TE>   TRW had called Northrop's $53-a-share offer inadequate and
proposed a plan to separate its automotive business from the defense
unit to increase shareholder value. The firm's shares rose 6 cents to
$55.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop shares rose $2.14 to $121.61, also on the NYSE. The Los
Angeles-based company would assume about $5.5 billion in TRW debt
under its takeover proposal.</TE>

<HD>Railroad Settles Suit Over Genetic Testing</HD>
<DH>Workplace: BNSF to pay $2.2million to 36 workers subjected
to secret program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-six railroad workers will share in a $2.2-million settlement
announced Wednesday of a landmark lawsuit that accused Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. of violating the Americans with Disabilities
Act by secretly conducting genetic tests to investigate workers'
compensation claims.</LD>
<LD>   Filed in February 2001, the suit targeted the first known case of
on-the-job genetic testing. In the claims, the rail workers blamed
their carpal tunnel syndrome, the most-frequently reported repetitive
stress injury, on the jarring vibrations of the heavy power tools
that they use to repair and replace track.</LD>
<LD>   Without the knowledge or consent of 20 of the workers, the EEOC
had alleged, the railroad submitted vials of their blood for tests
for a genetic marker that the railroad believed might show the carpal
tunnel syndrome was a preexisting--not job-related--condition.</LD>
<TE>   Genetics experts said the test results could not be interpreted to
rule repetitive stress in or out as a cause of the painful wrist
condition.</TE>
<TE>   When workers learned of the genetic testing, they complained to
the EEOC, which filed suit. The railroad agreed in April 2001 to halt
the testing during the EEOC's investigation and later agreed to
mediation, which led to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   BNSF Chairman Matthew K. Rose said in a statement that "we
continue to believe none of the company's actions were contrary to
the law."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making the settlement payment, the Fort Worth-based
railroad agreed to refrain from further genetic testing, give
employees access to their medical records and update the training of
its medical personnel regarding the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very, very excited," said Janice Avary, a nurse and
Nebraska railroad worker's wife, whose suspicions led to her
discovery of the secret testing. "This is going to set an example not
only for this corporation but for any corporation around the country
that even thinks of using genetics for employment or insurance
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Though the settlement doesn't set a legal precedent, "it stands as
a lesson for employers" that the agency will enforce the ADA
provision that bars employers from conducting medical tests that are
not job-related or required by business necessity, said Laurie
Vasichek, the EEOC attorney in Minneapolis who handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   Employee advocates say the case would not improve protections
against job discrimination based on genetic factors, which is not
explicitly banned under federal law or in many states.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, while this may be a wake-up call to employers
generally, there is nothing that would legally bind a subsequent
employer," said Jeremy Gruber, legal director for the National
Workrights Institute in Princeton, N.J. "This settlement will not
prevent genetic discrimination from occurring in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Avary, who became an advocate for such protections, has testified
before Congress, which is considering two bills that would ban the
collection of genetic information, including testing, for any reason,
as well as discrimination based on genetics.</TE>
<TE>   She said she does not know what her husband Gary's share of the
settlement money will be. "We never asked," she said. "It was never a
money issue for us. It was genetic privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Vasichek said the payments would range from $5,900 to $75,000,
depending, in part, on whether a worker's blood was tested or not.</TE>

<HD>Judge Allows Electronic Copyright Case to Proceed</HD>
<DH>Technology: Digital Millennium Copyright Act is
constitutional, the opinion says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an important legal victory for publishers, movie studios and
record companies, a federal judge ruled Wednesday that a
controversial 1998 law bars the distribution of any tools that crack
electronic locks on a copyrighted work.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte held that the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act is constitutional even though electronic
locks could make it hard for consumers to make "fair use" of the
copyrighted products they buy.</LD>
<LD>   "That is part of the sacrifice Congress was willing to make in
order to protect against unlawful piracy and promote the development
of electronic commerce and the availability of copyrighted material
on the Internet," Whyte wrote in a 32-page opinion.</LD>
<TE>   Critics of the DMCA, including some lawmakers, said it allows
copyright owners to wipe out consumers' ability to copy music, books
and movies for personal use. But Hollywood studios and record labels,
alarmed by the flood of unauthorized copies online, are pushing for
even stronger measures to limit what consumers can do.</TE>
<TE>   In the first criminal prosecution under the DMCA, Russian
programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested last year for distributing a
program that removes the electronic locks from Adobe Systems Inc.'s
e-books. Charges against Sklyarov were dropped after he agreed to
testify against his employer, Elcom Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Elcom's lawyers argued that the DMCA is unconstitutional, but
Whyte dismissed their motion and let the case proceed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Federal copyright law gives the owners of a copyrighted work the
exclusive right to copy and perform it publicly. The main exception
is for "fair uses," such as making a back-up copy or printing
excerpts in an academic paper. In the DMCA, Congress made it illegal
for any person to manufacture, import or distribute technology whose
main purpose is to circumvent the electronic locks that limit access
to or use of a copyrighted work.</TE>
<TE>   That provision covered such things as the anti-copying controls on
DVDs and the software that prevents consumers from reading the Wall
Street Journal online without a subscription.</TE>
<TE>   Elcom's lawyers contend that the company's software lets e-book
buyers do a host of legal things that Adobe's locks prevent, such as
making back-up copies, using text-to-speech converters and printing
out chapters.</TE>
<TE>   But Whyte ruled that the law "bans trafficking in or the marketing
of all circumvention devices," even if they could be used to support
fair uses.</TE>
<TE>   "The DMCA does not 'eliminate' fair use," Whyte wrote. "Although
certain fair uses may become more difficult, no fair use has been
prohibited." Besides, Whyte said, no law or court ruling guarantees a
consumer "the right to the most technologically convenient way to
engage in a fair use."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
said, "It's as if the judge ruled that Congress can ban the sale of
printing presses, because the 1st Amendment right to publish speech
was not attacked directly and quills and ink are still available.
What good are the public's rights if the tools needed to make fair
use or access works in the public domain are illegal?"</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil and natural gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it
outbid four rivals for the right to acquire Enron Corp.'s former
stake in a $3.5-billion natural gas project controlled by the United
Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   Occidental's bid for the 24.5% stake was selected ahead of those
made by Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group, BP and Conoco
Inc., said Abdulla Khouri, a spokesman for Dolphin Energy Ltd. Terms
weren't disclosed. Occidental said it expects to sign an agreement by
June 1.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphin project would be the first to pipe gas from Qatar's
offshore North Dome field to another country.</LD>
<TE>   The Emirates government is seeking to attract foreign investment
and gain fuel for power plants by building a line from Qatar, holder
of the world's third-largest gas reserves. Los Angeles-based
Occidental already produces oil in Qatar, Oman and Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental shares Wednesday rose 62 cents to $29.10 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Pixar Reports a Profit Increase of Nearly 90%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the strength of its computer-animated blockbuster film "Monsters,
Inc.," Pixar Animation Studios said Wednesday that its first-quarter
profit rose nearly 90%.</LD>
<LD>   Pixar, headed by Apple Computer Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, earned
$15.6 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $37.1 million in
the quarter. That compares with earnings of $8.3 million, or 16
cents, on revenue of $16.2 million a year earlier. Analysts polled by
Thomson Financial/First Call had estimated 23 cents a share for the
Emeryville, Calif.-based company.</LD>
<LD>   The strong numbers reflected box-office success for "Monsters,
Inc.," especially in foreign markets such as Japan. Since its
November debut, the film has grossed $514 million in worldwide ticket
sales. That makes it the most successful of a string of Pixar/Walt
Disney productions that began with the 1995 hit "Toy Story."</LD>
<TE>   "The worldwide box-office success of 'Monsters, Inc.' cements
Pixar's position as the world's most successful animation studio,''
Jobs told analysts Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar and Disney last month announced plans for three more
computer animated films: "Finding Nemo," an underwater adventure (to
be released in the summer of 2003); "The Incredibles," an action
adventure comedy (2004); and "Cars," a comedy featuring cars as
characters (2005).</TE>
<TE>   Pixar makes the movies and Disney markets and distributes them.
The companies split production costs and profit under a partnership
that began in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The future of that relationship remains uncertain. Jobs told
analysts that Pixar will green light its own fully financed film
later this year. "We have no plans to negotiate any new deal with
Disney or anyone else this year," Jobs said.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-picture deal expires in 2005, when Pixar could negotiate
a better deal for itself or go independent.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar raised its projections for 2002 earnings to $1.15 to $1.25 a
share from the previous range of $1 to $1.20.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares Wednesday closed at $41, up 94 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Tourists Surpass Expectations</HD>
<DH>Travel: In L.A. and Orange counties, better-than- forecast
visitor attendance last year boosts hopes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a drop-off in tourism after Sept. 11 and gloomy outlooks for
visitors to Los Angeles and Orange counties for all of 2001, more
tourists came and spent last year than officials initially forecast.</LD>
<LD>   The final tally for Orange County showed a 1.7% increase in
visitor attendance over 2000--an improvement over the 5% decline
officials were bracing for immediately after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   For an area that had staked billions on remaking itself for
tourism and was headed toward a record year for visitors before Sept.
11, the numbers are being regarded as a sign that "the worst is
over," said Charles Ahlers, president of the Anaheim/Orange County
Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau.</LD>
<TE>   "Things were not looking good there in the beginning. Not good at
all," he said. "But with these numbers ... we're hopeful even better
things are in store for us in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   About 41 million visitors to Orange County spent $6.5 billion last
year--about the same dollar amount as 2000, according to Skip Hull,
director of CIC Research, which tracks tourism statistics for visitor
bureaus.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a 5% increase in the number of day visitors to
Orange County, as families chose shorter trips over longer, more
expensive overnight stays. Of the total visitors to Orange County,
22.7million were day trips, Hull said. A day visitor is someone who
does not live or work in the county and who does not stay overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers give hope to such places as Disneyland Resort, which
incurred dips in attendance at the end of last year but has since
shown steady increases and solid crowds. Several attractions slated
to open this fall at theme park California Adventure stand to further
boost attendance, which has been off an average of 10,000 a day or
more since opening last February.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A. County, the 1.8% drop in overall visitors last year was
much easier to shoulder than the 5% decrease officials anticipated
after Sept. 11, said David Sheatsley, research director for the Los
Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   About 23.8 million visitors spent nearly $12 billion in Los
Angeles last year. That visitor number represents international and
overnight visitors only and excludes day trips by L.A.'s 9.4 million
residents. If day trips were included, Sheatsley said, the number
would approach 50 million visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we did far better than we thought we would in terms of
visitors," he said. "But the drop in visitor spending was larger than
we were anticipating."</TE>
<TE>   That drop is being attributed largely to the decline in
international tourists after Sept. 11. Foreign tourists made up more
than a fifth of L.A. visitors in 2000 and accounted for 32% of
tourist spending, or about $4.4 billion. After the terrorist attacks,
overseas travel to L.A. fell by half and still has not recovered
fully, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Sony to Launch Feature Animation Unit</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Studio taps ex-DreamWorks execs in hopes of
cashing in on digital trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Pictures Entertainment is plunging into the feature animation
business in hopes of cashing in on the kind of blockbuster success
that rival studios have had with computer-generated family hits such
as "Ice Age," "Monsters, Inc." and "Shrek."</LD>
<LD>   Penney Finkelman Cox and Sandra Rabins, who started DreamWorks
SKG's animation division at the studio's inception in 1994 and was
executive producer of its Oscar-winning hit "Shrek," will head a new
animation unit within Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   The pair will oversee the development and production of
computer-generated features, reporting to Sony Pictures Digital
Entertainment President Yair Landau.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big step forward," said Landau, who has long championed
Sony's move into animation. Landau said that corporate brass at
parent Sony Corp. is now fully on board.</TE>
<TE>   "Tokyo really loves the idea of us creating original characters
digitally. It's a fulfillment of what they believe the company can
become," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Rabins, who left DreamWorks last summer to be independent
producers, said their mandate is to deliver one animated film every
18 months once the development pipeline is full.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not coming in with any preconceived ideas, though we know
we want to make wide-appeal movies with universal themes," Cox said.
Though Sony Animation will have its own annual budget to cover
development and overhead costs, its sister movie studio Columbia
Pictures will finance the productions and handle marketing and
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Landau said Sony is prepared to make whatever capital investment
it takes to develop and produce competitive movies, though at this
early stage it is unclear what the studio's ultimate financial
commitment will be.</TE>
<TE>   Rabins and Cox said that throughout the creative process they will
work with Columbia Pictures chief Amy Pascal and Sony Pictures
Chairman John Calley, who will ultimately "green light" which movies
get made.</TE>
<TE>   They also will work closely with Sony's in-house visual
effects and digital character animation unit Imageworks, headed by Tim
Sarnoff, which has cutting-edge technological capabilities and
employs several hundred effects artists, digital animators and
technicians.</TE>
<TE>   Housed just down the road from Sony's main studio lot in Culver
City, Imageworks created the visual effects for such Columbia movies
as "Spider-Man" and "Stuart Little" and its upcoming sequel, as well
as Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Rabins, who will be based at Imageworks, said they will
put together a small development staff and will ramp up over the next
year by hiring layout, visual development and storyboard artists.</TE>
<TE>   Once projects move into the pre-production phase and closer to
production, they said, they will tap animators both from Imageworks
and from the outside as needed.</TE>
<TE>   Rabins estimated that the staff will grow to at least 150 once a
movie is in production.</TE>
<TE>   A new player in the animation field is welcome news to the nearly
1,000 displaced animators who have lost their jobs over the last 18
months at Walt Disney Co. and DreamWorks amid escalating production
costs, salary inflation and a move toward computer animation.</TE>
<TE>   Sony is entering the fray as the animation business is redefining
itself in light of a trend toward digitally created movies.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the "Toy Story" films and most recently "Ice Age,"
"Monster's, Inc." and "Shrek" has upstaged disappointing results from
such traditional, hand-drawn 2-D animated films as "The Road to El
Dorado," "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" and "Osmosis Jones."</TE>
<TE>   In a pop-culture age dominated by MTV, the Internet, interactive
video games and sophisticated special effects, today's audiences,
kids and parents alike, seem particularly wowed by the characters and
backgrounds made possible by artists painting on computers.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Rabins have firsthand experience in digital and
traditional animation, having worked as producers and top executives
at DreamWorks for seven years, where they produced "The Prince of
Egypt" and were executive producers of the computer-generated "Antz."</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Rabins said they strongly believe that digital movies are
what audiences prefer.</TE>
<TE>   The runaway success of 20th Century Fox's current release "Ice
Age," which has grossed $170 million to date, underscores that
studios other than Disney and DreamWorks are capable of creating
animated blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   "The 3-D world allows you to push the boundaries of imagination
and expression. It's a very powerful way to tell a story visually,"
Landau said.</TE>
<TE>   They are particularly appealing to studios because they're much
cheaper and quicker to produce. The rule of thumb, Cox said, is that
it takes 400 artists four years to bring a 2-D movie to theaters.</TE>
<TE>   It takes half that number in three years to accomplish the same
for a computer-generated movie.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a digital movie typically costs about $80 million,
compared with $150 million for a traditional animated feature.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Fox and Warner Bros., which a few years back made and then
lost significant investments in the animation business by launching
full-scale divisions that produced such costly flops as "Titan A.E."
and "Quest for Camelot," Sony is taking a more measured approach as
it goes into the business.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really an outgrowth of the evolution of Imageworks," said
Landau, explaining that after the studio saw an early screening of
"Shrek," he started discussing the idea of Sony Animation with Calley
and Sony Corp. of America chief Howard Stringer "in earnest."</TE>

<HD>Chocolate Manufacturers Sued Over Toxic Metals</HD>
<DH>Courts: Products from food makers including Hershey and
Mars contain high levels of lead, a group alleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming that chocolate contains enough toxic metals such as lead to
pose a health risk, especially for children, a California watchdog
group Wednesday launched a lawsuit against major chocolate makers for
failing to warn consumers of the alleged danger.</LD>
<LD>   The American Environmental Safety Institute said it is suing
chocolate makers, including Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., for
not disclosing that their products contain enough lead and cadmium to
pose a serious health risk--a disclosure required by California law.</LD>
<LD>   The chocolate companies dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous and
alarmist, saying the amount of lead and cadmium in candy bars and
instant hot chocolate is no more than in other common foods because
the metals are naturally occurring.</LD>
<TE>   "People have been eating chocolate safely for hundreds of years,"
said Michele Corash, an attorney for the Chocolate Manufacturers
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, charges
Nestle USA Inc., Kraft Foods North America Inc., Rocky Mountain
Chocolate Factory Inc. and See's Candies Inc. with violating
California's Proposition 65, a consumer health law that requires
warnings to be given to individuals before they are exposed to
hazardous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   The California's attorney general's office found that lead in
chocolate products is not caused by human activity. The law exempts
food makers whose products contain toxic chemicals that are not added
during production.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey Foods closed down 23 cents at $68.06 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Kraft closed down 67 cents at $39.24, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Enron Auditors Warned About Accounting</HD>
<DH>Courts: Andersen partner testifies that he relayed concerns
to the firm's Houston office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>An Arthur Andersen partner testified Wednesday that he was warned
about Enron Corp.'s accounting methods by Enron Vice President
Sherron S. Watkins, and that he relayed those concerns to his firm's
Enron team.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen partner James Hecker told a federal jury here that he
received the call from Watkins, a former colleague at Andersen, Aug.
20. Hecker said Watkins confided her increasing uncertainty over the
propriety of Enron's methods of accounting for off-the-books
partnerships managed by her supervisor, Enron Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow.</LD>
<LD>   Hecker was not involved with the Enron audit but said he relayed
Watkins' concerns to several Andersen partners in the Houston office
who were.</LD>
<TE>   Hecker, the first Andersen executive to testify in the trial, took
the stand as prosecutors sought to prove that Andersen feared a
Securities and Exchange Commission probe of Enron and shredded
documents to obstruct the inquiry. A conviction on the obstruction
charge could prompt the SEC to prohibit Andersen from auditing public
companies, dealing a devastating blow to the 89-year-old firm.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from prosecutors, Hecker said he had long
harbored concerns about the "innovative" accounting techniques
employed by Enron, one of Andersen's biggest clients, and the degree
to which it held sway over the accounting firm. Prosecutors
introduced the text of a song Hecker had written in 1995--a parody of
the Eagles' hit, "Hotel California"--in which he mocked Enron by
calling it "Hotel Cram-It-Down-Ya." But under cross-examination from
an Andersen attorney, Hecker said he intended the song parody as a
joke that he "absolutely" did not believe Enron or Andersen had
committed a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Hecker also depicted his firm as one that sometimes appeared to be
too closely tied to Enron, but he said, "Our folks didn't let them go
over the line."</TE>
<TE>   Hecker, who audits other energy firms, also testified under
Andersen questioning that document shredding is a "normal process for
auditors dealing with confidential client" information, and said he
never recalled anyone at the firm suggesting that auditors trash
papers or e-mails to avoid litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Hecker told prosecutors that he had no specific information about
how Andersen's Enron team handled documents. The government's
three-lawyer team has told jurors that Andersen, which had been
censured by regulators for audit failures on another client's books,
was motivated to improperly destroy records to avoid potential
Enron-related sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen asked U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon to order
attorneys for the government's star witness, former Andersen partner
David B. Duncan, to turn over notes and documents that might indicate
Duncan insisted he did nothing wrong until he agreed to plead guilty
and cooperate with the Justice Department. Duncan's lawyers said the
documents were protected under attorney-client privilege. Harmon said
she would review the notes in private and decide whether to release
them to Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, prosecutors continued to elicit testimony
explaining Andersen's possible motive. Thomas Newkirk, an associate
director of enforcement at the SEC who oversaw previous probes of
other Andersen clients, said Andersen executive Gary Goolsby told him
regulators didn't have to seek a large civil judgment against his
firm because it had "learned its lesson" and enacted reforms to
prevent future accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials also explained for the first time what prompted the
agency to launch an investigation of Enron. Spencer Barasch, a senior
official in the SEC's Fort Worth office, said his staff on Aug. 28
began an informal inquiry into Enron after reading a Wall Street
Journal article following the exit of former Enron Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling that cited investor frustration with Enron's
"complex" financial reports. The article also said that Enron had
entered into transactions with ostensibly independent partnerships
managed by Fastow. Barasch said the agency sent a letter to Enron
requesting documents on Oct. 17, and said it was common for companies
under scrutiny to notify their accountants of such inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   But Hardin suggested that it was the SEC, not Andersen, that
failed to adequately monitor the energy firm. "Isn't it true the SEC
was fiddling while Rome burned?" he asked at one point. Prosecutors
objected to the question and Barasch didn't answer.</TE>

titles in 13 seasons. Before he arrived, the school had won two
league titles in 24 years. LaRuffa also led Edison to four league
titles in 12 seasons.</LD>

<HD>Baseball Could Use Its Own Superhero</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the headline, "Don't Take Me Out to the Ballgame," Thomas
Boswell of the Washington Post writes: "For generations, baseball has
compared its industry to the movies. Similar ticket prices, family
entertainment, larger-than-life heroes who become nationally famous.
What is more American than the big leagues and Hollywood?</LD>
<LD>   "Against that backdrop, perhaps baseball should pay attention to
two statistics from last weekend. 'Spider-Man' grossed $115 million,
a three-day record ...</LD>
<LD>   "Meanwhile, baseball attendance, which was down 3.5% early last
season, is now down 5% versus the comparable numbers of games for
last season. It's bad and getting worse."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for field goals attempted
in a playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Chicken partners: Barry Bonds has been signed by KFC to team with
Seinfeld's George Constanza (Jason Alexander) to reintroduce the
company's Popcorn Chicken. The two men have taped a 30-second
commercial that will start airing May 20.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of fun," Bonds told Associated Press. "He's an
actor, talented, funny and makes it look easy. I'm a baseball player.
He did it in one take; I did it in 15."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, but can Jason hit a curveball?</TE>
<TE>   Not particular: Mike Berardino of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel
marvels at the ability of Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero to hit pitches
barely off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Guerrero is the standard bearer for a disappearing breed in the
major leagues: the bad-ball hitter."</TE>
<TE>   The last round, really: The bad news for Tony Muser was that he
learned that he had been fired as the Kansas City Royals' manager not
from a member of the organization but from a beat writer who found
him in a bar.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Muser: The bar extended closing time by an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Bad track record: If the Chicago Bulls are in a position to draft
Yao Ming, they should pass, says Bob Verdi of the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "Given this city's horrific history for securing future talent, it
would be just their luck to select the 7-foot-5 center from China in
the first round of the NBA auction, only to discover that he wants to
be a jockey."</TE>
<TE>   Carried away: After a bidder paid $59,000 for a longhorn steer at
a recent cattle auction on Red McCombs' Texas ranch, the Minnesota
Viking owner crowed to the New York Times, "This is the Super Bowl,
the World Series and the Stanley Cup all in one."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1991, the Detroit Pistons set an NBA
playoff record with only four turnovers against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Elgin Baylor, 46, against Boston on April 14, 1962.
He made 22.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Associated Press reports that John Daly has always
had a Ruthian swing. Now, he worries about looking like the Bambino.</TE>
<TE>   After an allergic reaction to diet pills last week, Daly said
Wednesday he will cut back on his appetite for his mother's
cooking--especially her chocolate gravy and biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could zap my fingers, I'd love to weigh 195 or 200, but I
don't see that happening," Daly said.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Base Hit"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Alan Posner</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Vantage Press</TE>
<TE>   Price: $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Alan Posner's "Base Hit" is a smoothly written novel that combines
the intricacies of baseball, love and revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The main character, Chris Donovan, is a longtime New York Yankee
revered by many as the best player in the game for his knack of
hitting the ball where he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan is hit in the head during the American League championship
series by Chicago rookie pitcher Don McGinniss, knocked unconscious,
and forced to sit out the rest of the postseason, including his first
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan spends his off-season watching videotape of McGinniss'
pitches with hopes of discovering a way to drive a ball up the middle
against him in a future at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan accomplishes his goal on the first crack the following
spring, nailing McGinniss in the forehead and killing him.</TE>
<TE>   When a camera catches Donovan smiling at his triumph, Chicago
assistant district attorney Robert Kasoff, watching the game from a
bar, vows to uncover Donovan's premeditated malice.</TE>
<TE>   The author does a nice job of detailing the courtroom drama and
the trials of McGinniss' widow, Mary, before and after her husband's
death.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and James Blake became the first trio of
Americans in the round of 16 at the Italian Open since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   To advance even further, they won't have to face the world's top
two players and the defending champion, who all lost.</LD>
<LD>   In second-round action Wednesday, Blake beat Andrea Gaudenzi, 3-6,
6-4, 6-1, Roddick overcame Andrei Pavel, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, and Agassi
breezed past Michel Kratochvil, 6-0, 6-1, in 43 minutes--the fastest
match on the ATP Tour this year.</LD>
<TE>   Other top players had a much tougher time on the red clay at the
Tennis Masters Series event.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt lost to Carlos Moya, 6-3, 6-2; No. 2 Gustavo
Kuerten lost to Albert Montanes, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1; and 2001 champion
Juan Carlos Ferrero lost to Ivan Ljubicic, 7-5, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jennifer Capriati advanced to the third round of the
German Open at Berlin, beating Meilen Tu, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   In other second-round matches, fourth-seeded Serena Williams
defeated Barbara Schett, 6-3, 6-3, and third-seeded Kim Clijsters
fought off four match points before losing, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5, to Anna
Smashnova.</TE>
<TE>   College Sports</TE>
<TE>   The Southeastern Conference is investigating new allegations of
rules violations involving former Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is looking into alleged payments in February 1999 totaling
$4,500 from Diane Sanford, then an executive at Aarco Insurance,
forwarded to Martin from Mobile (Ala.) Register sports reporter Wayne
Rowe.</TE>
<TE>   Three Notre Dame football players and a former player are fighting
the school's decision to expel them after they were accused of raping
a female student.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore point guard Wesley Stokes will transfer from Missouri at
the end of this semester, but hasn't said where he will go. The North
County Times in Escondido reported that Stokes would consider
transferring to San Diego State, a school that recruited him out of
Long Beach Poly High in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore guard Bernard Robinson Jr., Michigan's second-leading
scorer last season, has been charged with misdemeanor sexual assault,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   A warrant for Robinson's arrest has been authorized by the
Washtenaw County prosecutor, Diane Brown, a spokeswoman for Dept. of
Public Safety at the University of Michigan, said Wednesday.... Duke
forward Casey Sanders was charged with grabbing his girlfriend and
pushing her into a wall during a breakfast argument at her home.
Sanders is scheduled to appear in court on the misdemeanor charge on
June 3.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Mike Tyson's public relations agency evidently quit this week, a
month before his lucrative heavyweight title fight with Lennox Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's profanity-laced tirades in a series of interviews arranged
by New York-based Dan Klores Communications in Hawaii last week
apparently prompted the company to sever its ties.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's name no longer appears on Tyson news releases, and
former Tyson spokesman Adam Grant confirmed he was hired by Showtime
to handle PR.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Fisher, the third woman to drive in the Indianapolis 500,
found a car for this year's race, signing with Dreyer &amp; Reinbold
Racing. Fisher will drive the No. 23 car in the May 26 event and her
primary sponsor will be Allegra, Dennis Reinbold said.... Jerry
Nadeau was released from his contract with Hendrick Motorsports,
leaving a team that has drivers Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte and Jimmie
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas and NBC have agreed to a four-year deal that is
expected to be announced next week, a TV industry source told
Associated Press. The agreement is worth more than $1 million a year,
the source said.... Former world champion sprinter Merlene Ottey was
granted Slovene citizenship. The Jamaican-born Ottey has lived in
Slovenia for several years.</TE>

<LD>The USC men's basketball team has scheduled a holiday trip to Hawaii
to play in the Rainbow Classic tournament next season. But the
Trojans are awaiting a possible change in the NCAA's rule of schools
playing in no more than two exempt events every four years before
breaking out the leis.</LD>
<LD>   USC, which played in the Yahoo Sports Invitational in 2000-01 and
the Preseason NIT last season, already has played in the maximum
number of exempt events allowed by the NCAA.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit by a variety of exempt events--a tournament that is
counted as only one game toward a school's maximum allowance of 28
games in a regular season--is looking to change the NCAA's stance,
which would allow schools to participate in one a season. A ruling is
expected this month.</LD>
<TE>   Also scheduled to participate in the eight-team Rainbow Classic
Dec. 28-30: Hawaii, Western Kentucky, Texas Pan American, Butler,
Bradley and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth spot is being held for an unnamed program hoping for a
favorable verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Should the NCAA win the case, the Trojans will schedule a team for
that weekend.</TE>
<TE>   USC has filled out the rest of its nonconference schedule.</TE>
<TE>   USC opens the season at the Sports Arena against UC Riverside on
Nov. 22 and plays at Rhode Island on Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans play host to Morris Brown on Nov. 30 before traveling
to UC Santa Barbara on Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   USC will meet Elite Eight team Missouri in the Wooden Classic at
the Arrowhead Pond on Dec. 7 before playing host to Cal State
Northridge on Dec. 14 and LaSalle on Dec. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' final two nonconference games will be Jan. 11 at the
Forum against Ivy League champion Pennsylvania and Feb. 9 at Nevada
Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Short on Time in Quest for Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Is the re-energized U.S. quest for peace in the Middle East, launched
barely a month ago by the Bush administration, already facing
derailment by the double whammy of a new suicide bombing and
diplomatic deadlock?</LD>
<LD>   Not necessarily, say both U.S. officials and Middle East experts,
even as they caution that another Israeli military operation could
complicate an already fragile and messy process.</LD>
<LD>   But concern is growing among both Arabs and Israelis, as well as
U.S. observers, that the administration needs to accelerate its own
decision-making process to chart a clearer course toward peace.</LD>
<TE>   "The administration is dangerously undecided," said an Arab envoy
who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive diplomacy. "Time
is a luxury we no longer have."</TE>
<TE>   The administration struggled Wednesday to keep its peace
initiative on track as President Bush met with Jordan's King Abdullah
II and U.S. officials expressed confidence that their efforts will
prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell acknowledged that the latest
bombing--a Tuesday night attack on a pool hall near Tel Aviv that
killed 16 Israelis--would again "put at risk" the possibility of
progress. But he sought to keep attention focused on the long-term
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time one of these events happens, it takes us off a course
that we were on for a while. But I think it's a course that,
ultimately, we have to get back to, because no matter how many
military operations one conducts or how many suicide bombs are
delivered, at the end of the day we have to find a political
solution," Powell said after talks with British Foreign Minister Jack
Straw.</TE>
<TE>   Bush singled out for praise Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's announcement that he had ordered Palestinian security forces
to try to prevent all terrorist attacks. Bush called that decision,
coming after weeks of U.S. pressure on Arafat to issue such a
declaration, an "incredibly positive sign."</TE>
<TE>   Events Squeeze</TE>
<TE>   the United States</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials and Middle East experts stressed that the realities
of the situation in the region haven't changed, despite the gripping
drama that played out Tuesday across global television screens after
the pool hall bombing and an angry reaction from Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, who a short time later abruptly ended his
visit to Washington to return home.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had anticipated that Sharon, in his Oval Office
meeting Tuesday with Bush, would maintain his tough stand against
negotiating with Arafat and propose slowing the peace process to a
virtual crawl.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, U.S. officials also had warned that additional suicide
bombings were inevitable, saying that Israel's military incursion
into the West Bank could dismantle some extremist cells but not
eliminate Palestinian anger and frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of these events were perfectly predictable, and they
shouldn't change what people already had in mind," said Robert
Malley, a Middle East negotiator for the Clinton administration's
National Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The issue now is how much the latest developments, potentially
compounded by an Israeli military response, will hurt efforts to get
the major players around a conference table--and whether it widened
the gap among them. Administration officials recognize that even as
they continue their push to get the regional players together, a
major danger is that such an initiative would collapse because of
bickering.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, already factoring in an Israeli military response
to the latest bombing, suggested that the diplomatic and security
challenges are squeezing the United States more than any other
country. Events continue to force the Bush administration to move
beyond general principles for resolving the Middle East conflict to
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone realizes that this descending spiral of violence will
continue until there is a political breakthrough--and that can only
come through assertive U.S. intervention," said Geoffrey Kemp, a
National Security Council specialist on the Middle East during the
Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Bush team has been straddling the positions of Israel
and moderate Arabs, "depending on who was the last person in the Oval
Office," Kemp said.</TE>
<TE>   "Making a tough call will require being tough on the Arabs, but
also presenting Israel with clear indications about American
preferences over how a final settlement should be implemented and
what it will look like," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and Arab officials involved in the flurry of diplomatic
talks in Washington this week increasingly are worried that the
administration, particularly Bush, has not decided what to do with
the disparate peace proposals pushed by Israel and moderate Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters is that different branches of the
administration are leaning in different directions, according to
Israeli and Arab diplomats involved in recent talks with U.S.
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was bolstered by his talks in Washington with Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, according to Israeli sources. The
Pentagon appeared more sympathetic to Israel's preference to
marginalize Arafat from the peace process and focus on Israel's
security rather than a final political settlement leading to a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumsfeld totally bought Sharon's line. They now read from the
same scriptwriter," an Arab official said.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for Shorter</TE>
<TE>   Peace Process</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Powell's State Department has been more receptive to
the position of moderate Arabs that no progress is likely to be made
unless the political process is accelerated and combined with all
other aspects of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   There is a growing consensus among experts who served in previous
administrations--both Republican and Democratic--that the Bush team
eventually will have to accept pushing for a final settlement as soon
as possible. Shortening the peace process will help preempt
militants, these experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time something starts to move, terrorists act because it's
not in their interests, and then peace efforts come unstuck," said
Martin Indyk, who was U.S. ambassador to Israel under Clinton and
during the first months of the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Indyk said, the parties are headed in the right
direction--rebuilding security arrangements, advocating reform of the
Palestinian Authority and organizing a conference to launch
negotiations. But even that combination is not enough, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States and the Mideast leaders don't want the whole
thing to blow up in their faces, everybody is going to have to
stretch in terms of what they're going to do," Indyk said.</TE>

<HD>China Detains 5 in Alleged Asylum Bid</HD>
<DH>Asia: Those held, believed to be North Koreans, tried to
rush the Japanese Consulate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Two people scaled the wall of the U.S. Consulate on Wednesday and
five others tried to rush the Japanese mission in Shenyang in
northeastern China, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The five in the second incident, thought to be North Koreans, were
taken away by armed Chinese police who apparently entered the
consulate, prompting Japan to lodge a complaint with China.</LD>
<LD>   The two incidents followed a spate of similar events by North
Koreans seeking political asylum. The asylum bids have embarrassed
China, which has stepped up security in Beijing's diplomatic
districts.</LD>
<TE>   The incidents have thrown a spotlight on the Chinese government's
refusal to recognize as refugees tens of thousands of North Koreans
hiding on its northeastern borders with the Communist state, an old
ally.</TE>
<TE>   The fates and nationalities of the two people who tried to enter
the U.S. Consulate--also in an apparent attempt for asylum--were not
immediately clear.</TE>
<TE>   "Two intruders scaled the wall and entered the compound at the
U.S. Consulate in Shenyang," a U.S. spokeswoman said. She said there
were no further details.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese police officers grabbed three of the apparent asylum
seekers at the entrance to the Japanese Consulate, but the officers
then rushed into the diplomatic compound to seize the other two
people, according to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The embassy said that if Chinese police officers had indeed
entered the consulate without consent, it would constitute a
violation of international laws and be "extremely regrettable."</TE>
<TE>   "We think China's response in this case was very problematic," a
Japanese Embassy official was quoted as saying in a meeting with a
Chinese Foreign Ministry official.</TE>
<TE>   The official also said Japan wants China to return the detainees
to Japanese authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese police have been on high alert for potential asylum bids
after 25 North Koreans sprinted past Chinese guards at the gates of
Spain's mission in March, the second major North Korean defection in
less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Beijing put up barbed wire and doubled patrols around
embassies in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the protest, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
played down the impact that Wednesday's incident might have on shaky
Sino-Japanese relations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to respond so that issues like these do not
impede Japan-China friendship," he told reporters in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has appealed to China not to repatriate the detained
would-be asylum seekers to Communist North Korea, because they could
face penalties ranging from jail to execution, activists say.</TE>
<TE>   Aid groups say between 100,000 and 300,000 North Koreans have fled
to northeastern China in recent years to escape political repression
and famine in which hundreds of thousands have died.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 North Korean escapees have settled in South Korea.
Most have arrived via China in recent years.</TE>

<LD>   Floods and landslides have killed 46 Kenyans and injured eight
others in the last two weeks, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "Of the 46 dead, 15 died when landslides covered their homes
[while] the others were drowned in the raging floods," police
spokesman Dola Indidis said. Kenyan charities and local media had put
the death toll at between 20 and 30.</LD>
<TE>   The Kenyan branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross
said the floods forced up to 150,000 people to leave their homes,
raising fears of a cholera outbreak as victims huddle in makeshift
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The relief agency warned that flood victims were in urgent need of
health and sanitation assistance to stave off the threat of

<HD>U.N. Forum on Children Takes Up Abortion</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Delegates argue about whether phrase
'reproductive health services' should be included in conference
documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- More than 60 world leaders and 6,000 other
delegates gathered here Wednesday for a three-day meeting on
children's issues ranging from primary education funding to infant
AIDS prevention and child labor abuses.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the main issue preoccupying the gathering is reproductive
health services for adolescent girls--not because of its inherent
importance, but because the United States and a few predominantly
Roman Catholic and Muslim allies are pressing for the elimination
from conference documents of any direct or indirect endorsement of
abortion counseling.</LD>
<LD>   And, in a related position not widely shared here, U.S. officials
say the final conference declaration should promote sexual abstinence
as the best defense against disease and unwanted pregnancies for the
world's adolescents.</LD>
<TE>   "As President Bush has said, abstinence is the only sure way of
avoiding sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy and the
social and personal difficulties attendant to nonmarital sexual
activity," Tommy G. Thompson, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human
Services, told the delegates.</TE>
<TE>   The official assignment of the U.N. General Assembly Special
Session on Children is to review accomplishments and failures in the
field of children's rights and health since the last international
meeting on the issue, in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates agree that major achievements have been made in the last
decade, especially in health: Polio has been nearly eradicated,
childhood deaths from diarrhea in impoverished nations have been
dramatically reduced, and more children are being educated than ever
before, U.N. agencies report.</TE>
<TE>   But the United Nations also reports that 10 million children die
each year from preventable illnesses and that an estimated 150
million of the more than 2 billion children in the world are severely
malnourished. The AIDS pandemic has left millions of children
infected and an estimated 13 million orphaned--12 million of them in
Africa, according to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1990 children's conference, wealthy nations promised to
increase foreign aid contributions to impoverished countries, and the
impoverished countries pledged to increase the share of their budgets
devoted to basic health and education services for the young. Neither
goal has been met, U.N. officials said. By insisting that references
to reproductive health services for adolescent girls be included in
the document that the conference is expected to adopt Friday,
abortion rights advocates and adolescent health specialists have
diverted attention from other, more significant children's issues,
such as education, U.S. officials charged.</TE>
<TE>   "A document on children should not be focused on abortion and
things like that. It should be focused on positive things," Michael
J. Dennis, a State Department human rights advisor in the U.S.
delegation, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants the United Nations to condemn child
prostitution and child pornography in much stronger terms than it has
in the past, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It also is urging forceful action against the deployment of
adolescents in armed combat. Administration officials say there is
resistance to a U.S. proposal for a worldwide crackdown on the use of
soldiers under age 18 by "non-state" forces--that is, rebel or
guerrilla movements--but not by uniformed national armies.</TE>
<TE>   But critics counter that the U.S. delegation itself has
spotlighted the issue of reproductive health services, thus obscuring
other important children's issues in which the United States enjoys
broader international support for its views.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Wednesday, Thompson indicated that concerns about
birth control and abortion counseling were a priority for the Bush
administration, both in its domestic programs and at the U.N.
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Our efforts include strengthening close parent-child
relationships, encouraging the delay of sexual activity and
supporting abstinence education programs," Thompson said before
detailing other U.S. goals for the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The very phrase "reproductive health services" has become an
object of contention here, with the U.S. government urging that the
word "services" be replaced by the word "care" or some other word
that they believe would not imply medical intervention after a
pregnancy. As an alternative, U.S. officials suggest, the phrase
could be footnoted with a statement indicating that "services" should
not be interpreted to include abortions or abortion counseling.</TE>
<TE>   But even critics of the U.S. policy here acknowledge that abortion
rights are, in fact, implicitly supported in the proposed U.N. texts
being debated.</TE>
<TE>   "Abortion is legal in more than a hundred countries, including the
United States," Tim Wirth, a former Democratic senator and Clinton
administration official, said Wednesday. For the last decade, Wirth
noted, resolutions adopted at U.N. conferences have used the phrase
"reproductive health services" to include "safe abortion in those
countries where it is not against the law, and the complications of
unsafe abortion everywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   As speaker after speaker made clear, most U.N. members--from the
wealthiest nations of northern Europe to the poorest countries of
southern Africa--favor the aggressive promotion of birth control
advice and devices as the best ways to combat AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases and to prevent unwanted pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. stance has received strong backing from the Vatican and
several Islamic countries that are rarely allied with Washington,
among them Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   But in striking contrast to past U.N. conference disputes over
abortion and birth control, most nations with a majority Catholic
population are no longer supporting the Vatican. Spain, speaking for
the European Union, called Wednesday for comprehensive reproductive
health services and "high-quality sexual education" for children.
Latin American countries have expressed similar views.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thompson's advisors at the U.N. gathering is John M. Klink,
an anti-abortion activist who has served as a lay Vatican
representative at U.N. meetings on women's health and population
issues. Klink was once expected to be a leader of the U.S. delegation
here, but his planned appointment as head of the State Department
Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration was withdrawn by the
Bush administration in the face of Senate resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Klink's advisory role here was seen by U.S. abortion rights
activists as a signal that the administration planned to take a
hard-line position on the issue. But Wade F. Horn, an assistant
secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the
U.S. delegation hopes to reach a compromise on a document that could
be adopted by consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Presbyterian," Horn said when asked whether U.S. policy was
being dictated by the fundamentalist right. "That is about as
moderate as you can get."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Times photographer Carolyn Cole entered Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity last Thursday with a group of international activists. More
than 100 Palestinians and their sympathizers are inside.</LD>
<LD>   BETHLEHEM, West Bank--You can't say I wasn't warned, considering
I'd just run through a dark entrance called the Door of Humility.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the Church of the Nativity, candy bars are divided into 20
pieces. Crackers are broken into thirds. Occasionally, there is a
meal--four macaroni noodles one day, a dozen spoonfuls of soup the
next.</LD>
<TE>   During particularly desperate days, some of the Palestinians
venture into a courtyard behind the sanctuary to strip leaves from a
lemon tree. They cook the leaves into chips that smell like burnt
popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   They sleep sporadically, mostly lined up against the walls and
away from the windows, adhering even then to the principle that if
you can see outside, someone on the outside can see you. The men wrap
themselves in pink blankets that offer little protection from the
cold stone floor.</TE>
<TE>   Mornings are oddly peaceful, marked by the sound of birds, snoring
and strains of Arabic music from a hand-held radio. Some days, I can
hear the early risers sweeping 21st century dust from the 4th century
floors and scraping away the residue of candles.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, members of the three religious orders that operate
here--Armenians, Greek Orthodox leaders and Roman Catholics--are
chanting prayers by 6:30 a.m. The Palestinians, almost all of them
Muslims, sleep nearby, next to their rifles and under icons of
Christianity--depictions of the Last Supper, 6-foot-tall crosses.</TE>
<TE>   I entered the church around dusk last Thursday. In Manger Square,
near the sanctuary, I had heard that members of a group called the
International Solidarity Movement planned to make a run past the
Israeli soldiers surrounding the church to deliver food to those
inside. I went with them.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers gave chase. About 10 of us reached the Door of Humility,
hands raised over our heads, and rushed inside.</TE>
<TE>   The main sanctuary of the church is about 45 yards long, lined
with four rows of enormous marble columns under a vaulted ceiling.
The men inside had not eaten for three days, and they eagerly, but
patiently, gathered for the meager rations brought by the activists.</TE>
<TE>   There is a routine of sorts in here. Boredom and hunger are
standard. So are headaches, a result of not eating. A backgammon
board gets passed around, but mostly small groups gather around
candles to swap morsels of gossip. They talk about their families,
their children, and what they will eat when they get out. They ask me
questions about U.S. Middle East policy and my life back in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians' relationship with the priests is good. The
clergymen have been kind to the Palestinians and have helped carry
the bodies of those slain out of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians spend hours on end figuring out how to charge
their cell phones from a jury-rigged power source. Ringing phones,
not church bells, are the dominant sound. As night falls, men gather
in darkening corners of the church, the candles casting their long
shadows on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   That serenity is often shattered by spasms of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon, a single shot rang out upstairs. I ran up with
a small group and found 40-year-old Khalaf Najazeh on the floor. A
member of a Palestinian security force, he had been walking along a
covered walkway when a bullet hit him in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   While one comrade gave him a tranquilizer, another stroked his
face and held his hand. After 35 minutes of negotiations with the
Israelis, he was taken to a hospital in a jeep. He died before he got
there.</TE>
<TE>   Najazeh had been shot by a remote-controlled Israeli weapon hung
from a nearby crane. Another Palestinian, Abdallah Duwood, was shot
in the right leg about a month ago. He lies next to the main altar,
unable to stand. Well-wishers try to keep his spirits up. He says he
will not leave the church.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, spirits soar as word spreads that negotiations are
moving along. Just as suddenly come moments like Tuesday morning,
when two Palestinian mediators entered the church--the first
newcomers since our arrival.</TE>
<TE>   They came with a list of 13 people inside the church wanted by
Israeli authorities. The group would be exiled to Italy. Some of the
men wept.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, that deal fell apart when Italy balked at accepting
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians in the church are a family of sorts. Some are
already planning a reunion--same time, next year. There was a wake
recently when one man learned that his father had died. As the days
drag on, many of them hold hands and stand with their arms around one
another's shoulders. And they pace together along the sanctuary
floor, fingering their prayer beads, hoping for a way out.</TE>

<HD>Bush Praises Arafat's Response</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Prime Minister Sharon is urged to temper his
reaction to the latest bombing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon on Wednesday to moderate his response to the latest suicide
bombing and praised Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
condemnation of terrorism as "incredibly positive."</LD>
<LD>   The president spoke forcefully at the start of a meeting with King
Abdullah II of Jordan, signaling concern that the bombing would put
at risk recent halting steps toward peace. The explosion Tuesday
night killed 16 people, including the bomber.</LD>
<LD>   "Whatever response Israel decides to take, my hope, of course, is
that the prime minister keeps his vision of peace in mind," Bush
said.</LD>
<TE>   Bush said he had read a translation of Arafat's statement in
Arabic, broadcast on Palestinian television, in which Arafat said he
had ordered security forces to prevent terrorist attacks on Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was an incredibly positive sign," Bush said. "I
hope that his actions now match his words."</TE>
<TE>   A current of deep skepticism has run beneath Bush's statements
about Arafat, and his remarks Wednesday contrasted sharply with his
frequent denunciation of the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   The Jordanian king urged Bush to mobilize a peace conference to
settle all disputes between Israel and the Arab world, and not just
those involving the Palestinians, senior Jordanian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They said the king also told Bush that Arafat must be included in
the peace process--a step that Sharon has strongly resisted.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters during a photo session, Bush said he was in
the midst of a series of contacts with Mideast leaders to try to
"seize the moment to bring peace to the region." On Tuesday, the
president met in the Oval Office with Sharon and spoke on the
telephone with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   King Abdullah, encouraging greater U.S. involvement, said he hoped
the talks "can find a road map to have America's support to bring
Israelis and Palestinians the peace that they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   He also encouraged fellow Arabs, specifically Mubarak and Crown
Prince Abdullah, who are meeting with other Arab leaders this
weekend, "to really step up to the plate, and move forward with the
responsibility that we need from them."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials said they had not specifically told
Israel to limit its response to the suicide bombing, and they were
uncertain what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   "The big variable right now is what Israel will do and how bad it
will be," said a State Department official who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. "The longer the wait, the bigger danger it is a larger
one."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials cast doubt on the possibility that the peace
process can move quickly to take on a broad agenda--exactly the path
King Abdullah was advocating.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is talking about trying to go from zero to 100 here, where
you're having full-scale final status talks and people are sitting
around in working groups talking about the future of Jerusalem.
Nobody thinks that's where we are," a Bush administration official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah brought to the White House three key messages, his
foreign minister, Marwan Muasher, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Muasher said any peace conference must aim for an overall
settlement rather than one that deals in stages with security,
economic issues and rebuilding the Palestinian Authority. He said
moderate Arab leaders were prepared to try to translate into tangible
proposals their offer to normalize relations with Israel in exchange
for Israeli withdrawal of territory occupied since the 1967 Mideast
War.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arabs are willing to do our part. We want to show we are
following through with solid recommendations," Muasher said.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan on High Alert After Blast</HD>
<DH>South Asia: President labels car bombing that killed 13 an
act of international terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf ordered security forces on maximum alert
Wednesday and said a suicide car bombing that killed 11 French
workers and two of his citizens was an act of international
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   An Interior Ministry official blamed the attack, which took place
here Wednesday morning, on "external elements," saying they could be
either members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization
or agents of Pakistan's archrival, India.</LD>
<LD>   "This act of international terrorism has to be met with full
force," Musharraf said on state television. "My government has the
complete resolve for meeting this threat."</LD>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Musharraf had called an emergency national
security meeting in the capital, Islamabad. The military ruler
ordered security along the border with Afghanistan further
strengthened to stanch the flow of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
fleeing U.S.-led coalition forces.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities blamed external forces, many Islamic
militants inside Pakistan have close links to Al Qaeda. They have
vowed revenge for Musharraf's ban on five militant groups earlier
this year after he sided with the United States in its anti-terrorism
campaign and war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The car bombing injured dozens and blew a hole 10 feet deep in the
pavement outside the Sheraton hotel. Police said 23 people were
hospitalized, 12 of them French.</TE>
<TE>   The French victims were engineers from France's state-owned naval
construction service building a submarine purchased by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac condemned the attack as "odious"
and dispatched his newly appointed defense minister to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone call, Chirac urged Musharraf to take necessary measures
to protect the French community and to "put everything in place to
find and punish the authors of this terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf invited French authorities to assist in the
investigation, Pakistan's state news agency reported. The Interior
Ministry official said that the Pakistani leader had also asked
anti-terrorism experts from the United States and Japan to join the
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the French workers were sitting in a shuttle bus
waiting to be taken to the Arabian Sea port when the bomber pulled
alongside. Seconds later, a thunderous explosion launched the car's
engine 40 yards, flipped the bus over and broke windows nine stories
up in the hotel and surrounding buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber, the bus driver and a bystander died along with the
Frenchmen. It was the third deadly attack this year on foreigners in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   A grenade attack in March on an Islamabad church catering to
foreigners killed five people. In late January, Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi and killed by Islamic
militants.</TE>

<HD>Bombing Leaves Scars on Another Israeli Town</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: A day after a suicide blast, the residents of a
Tel Aviv suburb cope with pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RISHON LE ZION, Israel</DL>
<LD>The mayor of this prosperous coastal town comes to work each day with
a pistol strapped to his hip and has ordered every municipal worker
who has served in an army combat unit and has a gun permit to do the
same.</LD>
<LD>   "I issued the order a month ago," said Meir Nitzan, a button-down,
bespectacled septuagenarian who is an unlikely-looking gunslinger.</LD>
<LD>   "We realized that people who are by chance in the spot where
terror attacks occur, if they are armed, might be able to shoot the
terrorist. You don't know where it may happen or when it may happen,
so you have to be prepared."</LD>
<TE>   But nothing prepared anyone here for what happened Tuesday night
when a Palestinian walked into the Sheffield Snooker Club and
Cafeteria and detonated explosives around his waist, killing himself
and 14 Israeli patrons. Another Israeli victim died on the operating
table early Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   In an instant, the club was reduced to twisted steel and shattered
bodies, and Rishon Le Zion was ushered into the sad and growing club
of seemingly ordinary Israeli communities scarred by terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The blast ended a nearly monthlong respite from suicide bombings,
a break that had given some Israelis the courage to head back to
entertainment spots many had abandoned. The attack also sparked calls
within the Israeli government to banish Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat from the West Bank and Gaza Strip forever.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic implications of Tuesday's bombing were far from the
minds of Rishon residents Wednesday, however. Many of them could be
found visiting the wounded in hospitals, saying goodbye to the dead
at cemeteries and comforting the survivors in homes plunged into
mourning.</TE>
<TE>   Nitzan visited some residents who were among 31 wounded in the
attack and attended the first of four funerals scheduled for victims
who were from Rishon. The other slain residents were due to be buried
today, at least two in the town's tree-shaded cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could carry flowers instead of a gun," the mayor said as
he waited with a crowd for the body of 56-year-old Dalia Masa to
arrive from the national morgue. "But I cannot carry flowers in these
days. As they say: If you want peace, be ready for war."</TE>
<TE>   The fighting that erupted between Israelis and Palestinians in
September 2000 first directly touched this town in March. Seven
members of the Nehmad family died in a Jerusalem bombing. Two
soldiers from Rishon were killed in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times then, Nitzan said he was thankful
that his town had escaped months of bloodshed without an attack
inside its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   The community's luck ran out Tuesday in a part of town where
factories, nightclubs, wedding halls and restaurants line the
streets, attracting patrons from communities miles away. The snooker
club was a slightly seedy illegal gambling hall, a place that
attracted low-income people looking to play slot machines or snooker,
to have a beer and a sandwich. The municipality, Nitzan said, had
waged legal battles with the owner for years in an effort to close
the place.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel and Anat Tramporosh stumbled across it Tuesday about half
an hour before the bomber walked through the door and blew their
lives apart. The couple had mostly stayed home during the long months
of trouble because Anat was afraid of attacks, said Gila Tramporosh,
Daniel's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were tired of sitting in the house," she said. "How long
could they stay in their home? Sometimes a person thinks: What can
happen? This is Rishon Le Zion."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, things had been quieter since the army launched a massive
military sweep through the West Bank on March 29, arresting or
killing scores of Palestinian militants, confiscating weapons and
destroying makeshift explosives factories.</TE>
<TE>   The couple took Anat's mother, Hana Almasioy Gohen, and Anat's
younger sister out for coffee. They noticed the third-floor snooker
club and decided to have a look.</TE>
<TE>   The blast blew all four out of their chairs at the table they
shared. With a tremendous roar, the ceiling caved in and the room
went dark. Screws packed around the bomb and other shrapnel tore into
Daniel Tramporosh's legs and abdomen, but he managed to crawl through
the darkness and debris to his wife. He found her dead, her skull
crushed by a block of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling. His
mother-in-law and sister-in-law were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   As Daniel Tramporosh lay awaiting surgery Wednesday, relatives
held up his lightly injured but distraught mother-in-law as she
walked slowly from her room to see him for the first time since the
attack. She threw herself across his bed, screaming and crying.</TE>
<TE>   "Anat! Anat! Anat!" Gohen wailed. "I wish it had been me instead,
that I had died and it was she crying for me."</TE>
<TE>   "The children came to me and asked, 'Where is Ima [Mother]?'" said
Daniel Tramporosh, 35, his voice breaking with emotion. "They can't
believe that Ima is gone." Married 12 years, the couple had three
children, ages 11, 6 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what to do anymore," said his aunt, Rahel Mor, as
she sat in the hospital corridor and listened to Gohen's anguished
cries. "God help us to know what to do."</TE>

<HD>A Beloved Path Bereft of Strollers</HD>
<DH>Landscape: Since the first segment of the Haas Promenade
opened in 1987, its vistas of Jerusalem have delighted visitors. Now
fear has left the area all but empty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>For years, the Haas Promenade offered a rare public refuge from the
seething tensions of this riven city. Built on a ridge straddling the
onetime divide between East and West Jerusalem, the walkway boasts
breathtaking panoramas of the walled Old City and the stark Judean
desert beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Both Israelis and Palestinians brought their children to fly kites
and play soccer on the lawns of the tayelet, as the promenade is
called in Hebrew. Tourists visited by the busload.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the grass is strewn with garbage and nearly empty of people,
save for the occasional patrol of grim-faced soldiers.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Israelis will observe Jerusalem Day, celebrating their
capture of the city's mostly Arab east side from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War. The day is meant to highlight what Israelis consider
the city's reunification.</TE>
<TE>   But the sad state of the tayelet is testimony to how more than 19
months of fighting have left even the open space of this sacred city
soaked in blood and hatred, and how far Jerusalem is from being a
truly unified city.</TE>
<TE>   As the casualties on each side have mounted, Jerusalemites have
pulled apart, retreating to their homes, abandoning their public
spaces, turning away from anything that might once have made them
feel citizens of the same city.</TE>
<TE>   The municipality tried to battle the pervading sense of gloom in
the run-up to Jerusalem Day. It bedecked streets with Israeli flags
and scattered dozens of gaily painted sculptures of lions--the city's
symbol--on street corners.</TE>
<TE>   But with tourists and Israelis who live outside the city too
frightened to visit, this year's crowds are expected to be thin. And
even residents are reluctant to gather in public areas, including the
promenade that both Arabs and Jews treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Two Jews have been attacked here since the Palestinian revolt
erupted in September 2000. One was a young woman who was stabbed to
death by a gang of Palestinian youths as she strolled with her
boyfriend, the other a 63-year-old man who was stabbed while jogging
along the promenade but survived.</TE>
<TE>   The assaults unnerved both Arabs and Jews. Now the promenade's
broad stone walkways and terraced, lushly landscaped hillsides
spilling down toward the Kidron Valley have become another in a
growing list of no-go zones.</TE>
<TE>   "We came because I feel that it is important to come, because if
we don't come here, they [the Arabs] will," said Rivka Medan, 24, as
she and her boyfriend, Ariel Imber, 23, sat on a lawn beneath the
promenade one afternoon. The couple--and two heavily armed
soldiers--were the only people enjoying the view.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here now is a form of idealism," Medan said. "Because this
is Jerusalem, so we should be here."</TE>
<TE>   Close by, the glass-walled restaurant where Arabs and Jews used to
watch the sunset as they sipped coffee and ate watermelon stands
empty, closed because of lack of business. It is a trash-strewn
shell, a jumbled mess of upended tables and chairs. A coffee shop
built farther down the hillside was torched by, police believe,
Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't feel safe there anymore," said Intissar Qaq, who lives
in Jebel Mukaber, a Palestinian village that clings to the hillside a
few dozen feet from the eastern edge of the promenade. "It used to be
a place that was good for our children, with wonderful views. But not
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The villagers always regarded the promenade with mixed emotions,
Qaq said. Much of Jebel Mukaber was zoned as a "green area" by
Israeli authorities after the semicircular ridge was declared a
scenic overlook. The designation meant that few residents were
allowed to build homes or even add to old ones. The Qaqs, she said,
have grown over the years to six families of 10 people each who live
crammed inside half a dozen tiny homes they long to expand.</TE>
<TE>   They look across the valley to the western side of the promenade
and see luxury apartment towers rising along Caspi Street. There, she
notes, Israelis are free to build spacious homes with magnificent
views on one of Jerusalem's most prestigious thoroughfares.</TE>
<TE>   'It Was Lovely'</TE>
<TE>   "So there has always been two sides to this tayelet for us," Qaq
said. "But friends would come here and we would take them there to
have coffee in the restaurant and it was lovely." Whatever the
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, she said, "it should be
something that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to share the
tayelet."</TE>
<TE>   Built with funds donated by the Haas family, owners of San
Francisco-based Levi Strauss &amp; Co., and expanded by other donors from
Israel and abroad, the promenade became the favorite launch point for
visitors here as soon as its first segment opened in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   It is a site steeped in the history of the land. The ridge was
known in biblical times as the Hill of Evil Counsel. Christians
believe that the home of Caiaphas, the high priest of the Jews, stood
on the heights and that it was there that Judas Iscariot closed his
deal to betray Jesus to the Romans.</TE>
<TE>   Today, hidden by a pine grove on the site stands Government House.
Headquarters of the British authorities before Israeli independence
in 1948, it serves as the local United Nations headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   It was on this spot that the Jordanian army breached the
cease-fire lines at the start of the 1967 war, triggering the Israeli
counterattack that led to Israel's capture of East Jerusalem, the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war, we would get as close to the ridge as we could,
because it was one of the few places where we could see the Old
City," recalled Ruth Cheshin, president of the Jerusalem Foundation,
which helped build the promenade. "That was the place you went to
think and to dream about Jerusalem, the place of the poetic view."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the promenade today stand with Government House on
their right, Jewish West Jerusalem on their left and a view before
them that stretches from the Garden of Gethsemane to Mt. Zion.</TE>
<TE>   The golden Dome of the Rock glitters above the burnished rock
walls of the Old City, and at certain hours both church bells and the
call of the muezzin ring out across the Valley of Hinnom.</TE>
<TE>   Peace Forest Below</TE>
<TE>   Terraces covered with flowering rosemary bushes, cedars, olive
trees and almond trees awash with white blossoms meander down the
hillside to the Peace Forest, built by the Jewish National Fund after
1967 as a symbol of the city's reunification under Israeli rule.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not many vantage points from where you can see the
whole of Jerusalem," said Shlomo Aronson, the promenade's designer.
"From the tayelet, you get the whole story of the city. You see the
Jerusalem of David and of Jesus. It gives you the archeological,
historical and religious aspects of the city in a way no other view
does."</TE>
<TE>   Aronson, one of Israel's foremost landscape architects, said he
designed the promenade as a place where Arabs and Jews would feel
comfortable together. He has watched with sadness as that vision has
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other spots in the city, Aronson said, this one was
nearly devoid of sacred sites.</TE>
<TE>   "My own theory is that because a fault line runs through the
ridge, in ancient times the fear of earthquakes kept people from
building on it," he said. "We were lucky to have a big piece of land
that doesn't have holy relics on it--we got the land without the past
that can be such a burden in Jerusalem."</TE>
<TE>   Determined to preserve that luck when he designed the promenade
with San Francisco landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, Aronson
said, "I deliberately steered clear of religious symbols and chose
plants--olives, rosemary and wheat--that are beloved by both
peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Though known in its entirety as the Haas Promenade, over the years
the walkway has been extended to include a section called the Gabriel
Sherover Promenade, built on the western side of the ridge, and the
only recently added Goldman Promenade, extending east. Each segment
of the 3-mile-long path offers a different feel and different vistas
to visitors, from the grandeur of the Haas segment to the intimacy
and rural atmosphere of the Goldman stretch.</TE>
<TE>   For months after the current Palestinian revolt erupted, the
promenade seemed to stay above the fray, Aronson said. Arab and
Jewish families kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't mingle, but they coexisted, and that was enough," he
said. But the attacks on the path proved too much for the delicate
balance.</TE>
<TE>   That the walkway was built at all was a triumph for Teddy Kollek,
then Jerusalem's mayor, over developers who wanted to line the ridge
with high-rise hotels. Today, environmentalists are fighting plans to
build at least four hotels nearby along with a tower more than 400
feet tall crowned with a revolving restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Uri Sheetrit, Jerusalem's chief engineer, is hoping to lure
residents back with art exhibits, open-air concerts and other events.</TE>
<TE>   "The tayelet is a grand gesture of the city to its people and its
visitors," Sheetrit said. "The site suggests all the beauty and the
complexity of Jerusalem. You travel there from west to east--from
grandeur to wild, untamed nature."</TE>
<TE>   In a city as troubled as Jerusalem, Sheetrit said, "you cannot
hold the position I am in unless you are optimistic, unless you
squeeze out of this very harsh life hope." His hope is that the
violence will end and the promenade will be reborn as a gathering
place.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see insanity, it really frustrates me," he said. "But I
cannot afford to yield to those frustrations. My job is to look
forward, many, many years forward. I have no doubt that people will
one day regain sanity."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan's Female Pioneers in Print</HD>
<DH>Media: Journalists cover 'men's turf' in a weekly billed as
the nation's first independent paper run by women for women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In the mornings, Marry Nabard Aaeen sits in a dim room with fellow
female reporters, separated from the male journalists of the
government-run Bakhtar news agency by a heavy curtain and a closed
door.</LD>
<LD>   She's relegated to "women's articles" on health, food, culture and
children.</LD>
<LD>   In the afternoons, Aaeen sits in a different room with other
female reporters, but she's in charge. In this room, she's the editor
of Seerat, which calls itself Afghanistan's first independent weekly
newspaper run by women for women.</LD>
<TE>   The room is the size of a storage closet--actually, it is a
storage closet. In its tiny confines, Aaeen directs coverage of
women's interest stories, but she also sends her reporters out to
cover the "men's turf" of Afghanistan: politics, drugs, government,
crime and controversial social issues.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-December, barely a month after the fall of the Taliban here
in Kabul, the capital, Aaeen and four other women created Seerat as a
one-page weekly. Late last month, Seerat published its 13th issue, a
comparatively fat edition with four printed pages and a publication
run of 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   The women launched Seerat after getting back their old jobs at
Bakhtar, which the Taliban had taken away in the mid-1990s. Although
they were gratified to have their jobs back, the women said, they
felt constrained by their second-class status at the male-dominated
news agency.</TE>
<TE>   At Bakhtar, the women rarely are permitted to venture out on
assignments, and the men, seen as the breadwinners, end up with
bigger paychecks because they're allowed to work longer hours.</TE>
<TE>   Pooling their money, the women started writing their own articles
in the afternoons. They paid a private printing company to run off
500 copies of a one-page newsletter, complete with cartoons and
editorials. They had no computers or typewriters; they still write
their articles longhand.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of Seerat is 1,000 afghanis, or about three cents
(foreigners pay $1). In part because the paper fails to publish some
weeks, circulation has been unsteady, ranging from 100 to 500 paid
copies per issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still hard to attract readers because their curiosity, their
intelligence, has been worn away by all the years under the Taliban,"
said Aaeen, a 38-year-old who favors long, stylish dresses that cover
her arms and legs but are a far cry from the burkas that the Taliban
forced women to wear in public.</TE>
<TE>   Seerat has attitude. Aaeen recently wrote a blistering editorial
demanding that women stop sitting in the back of buses and taxicabs
or, in some cases, in open taxi trunks. Another article pointed out
that administrations before the Taliban provided day care for female
government employees, while the new government does not.</TE>
<TE>   Some interviews are tough. Afghans whose family members were
killed during the U.S.-led campaign that drove the Taliban from Kabul
angrily chased the Seerat reporters from their homes a few weeks ago,
the women said.</TE>
<TE>   Riding the bus last week, Aaeen struck up a conversation with a
woman who mentioned that her daughter, a newlywed, was killed in a
U.S. airstrike last fall. The woman pulled out her daughter's photo
and began weeping.</TE>
<TE>   Aaeen asked the woman to lend her the photo and to meet her for an
interview. The woman refused, saying her husband would never give her
permission.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long way to go before Afghanistan is a modern country,"
Aaeen said. "That's what Seerat is trying to achieve. We want the
women of Afghanistan to be more modern, more educated, more in
control of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Though Seerat promotes what Aaeen calls "progressive ideas," she
said it also seeks to inform and entertain women. "Their lives have
been terrible not just under the Taliban, but under 23 years of war,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaeen despised the burka. She said she ripped it off Nov. 13, the
day the Taliban began fleeing Kabul. Aaeen, a mother of four, taught
an illegal girls school in her home during the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   In the Seerat office, a blue burka lies on a mattress on the
floor. It belongs to Najeeba Maraam, a reporter who doubles as the
weekly's treasurer. Maraam said she wears the suffocating garment to
and from work because she passes through conservative neighborhoods,
including her own.</TE>
<TE>   At the office, she changes into a long-sleeved blouse and long
dress. She puts on makeup and lipstick. And, like the other four
staffers, she wears a dark scarf that covers her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still a little afraid people will cause problems for me,"
Maraam said. "People's attitudes have not entirely changed just
because the Taliban is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Among other exposes, the weekly has published articles on the
miserable conditions for returning Afghan refugees, and one
condemning the corruption and profiteering in the nation's lucrative
opium trade.</TE>
<TE>   Rukhshana Alawee, 35, an aggressive reporter and mother of four,
said there are few stories women can't cover as well as men, despite
working in a society in which women are often treated as chattel and
men dominate public life. Only a small percentage of women mix with
men in public, and very few appear without burkas, even in Kabul. In
most homes, women serve the men meals and eat alone later.</TE>
<TE>   "We interview ministers, lawyers, doctors--all men," Alawee said.
"Men are used to women reporters. There is a long tradition of women
journalists here. The men are very polite to us ladies."</TE>
<TE>   The women say their husbands are supportive and "modern." Aaeen's
husband is a judge. Alawee and Maraam are married to engineers. Each
woman has a university journalism degree.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandre Plichon, a French journalist who heads the private
agency that helps fund Seerat, said the women need guidance in
newspaper production and distribution. "But as journalists," he said,
"they're very competent."</TE>
<TE>   Plichon's agency, Aina, which promotes independent reporting in
Afghanistan, pays the weekly's salaries and other costs through
grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the
British and French governments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The women said they have been paid once in the last three months
for their government work at Bakhtar. They earn about $50 a month,
they said, but they were paid just $38 in March. At Seerat, they
said, Aaeen is paid $150 a month as editor, and her reporters earn
$100 to $150.</TE>
<TE>   As a commentary on a government that rarely pays its employees,
Seerat ran a cartoon showing a worker shouting down at a penniless
colleague who had just died and was being buried: "Get up! The
government's going to start paying salaries any day now!"</TE>
<TE>   The paper also ran an anti-burka cartoon about a little boy and
his female teacher. It defies translation, but the punch line refers
to "big blue tents." The reporters said it was a hit with female
readers.</TE>
<TE>   Also popular are the paper's traditional service features on such
subjects as keeping children clean and healthy in summertime, and the
importance of adding fruits and vegetables to the heavily
meat-and-starch Afghan diet.</TE>
<TE>   But news drives the paper. The day the country's former monarch,
Mohammad Zaher Shah, arrived after 29 years in exile, Alawee was in
the middle of the scrum of Western and Afghan reporters, male and
female, pushing and shoving at the airport to catch a glimpse. She
followed her report on his arrival with an analysis of his impact on
the country's fragile political equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   For an upcoming issue, Aaeen said, she's working on a new expose:
why the new government, even with the Taliban gone, still refuses to
play the music of female singers and musicians on government-run TV
and radio.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an inequity that really makes me angry," Aaeen said. She
thought for a moment, then added, "But we're not sacrificing news
coverage to run this story. If a hot story is breaking, you can be
sure we'll be right on it."</TE>

<HD>Student Admits to Bombings</HD>
<DH>Crime: His father alerted FBI about his likely role in
rural mailbox incidents. He will face charges in Iowa after Nevada
hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>College student Luke John Helder confessed that he is the mailbox
pipe bomber, traveling so fast on his interstate crime spree that he
was stopped twice for speeding, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Helder, 21, was arrested Tuesday after his father, Cameron Helder,
alerted the FBI that his son was a likely suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Cameron Helder turned over letters from his son about explosions
and death, and said Luke told him in a phone call, "I may have to
blow myself away."</LD>
<TE>   The FBI issued a nationwide bulletin for Helder's arrest. Agents
tracked his harried travels across the Western states and captured
him Tuesday afternoon in the Nevada desert with the help of an alert
motorist.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Helder then confessed to planting the pipe bombs in rural
mailboxes across the country's midsection, the FBI said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, U.S. District Magistrate Robert McQuaid in Reno
ordered that Helder be sent to Cedar Rapids, Iowa--the first of three
jurisdictions that want to prosecute him on multiple federal charges
in connection with pipe bombings that injured six and rattled
residents in Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Texas and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Helder appeared in court Wednesday wearing an orange jail uniform.
"It's apparent to me that he suffers from some apparent mental health
problems," McQuaid said. He was placed on suicide watch Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Helder's public defender, Vito de la Cruz, said his client is
"willing to face the charges. He's anxious to have a jury trial."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of the most serious charges, Helder faces a maximum
sentence of 30 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Helder's motive for the bombings remains unclear, but in letters
left with the bombs, and mailed to his adoptive father and a college
newspaper, Helder rambled about government control and chided
conformists who fear death.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI in Las Vegas said Helder had constructed 24 pipe bombs. He
admitted placing 18 of the bombs inside rural mailboxes in five
states; the first eight were rigged to explode and the other 10 were
not, said FBI spokeswoman Gayle Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   Another six bombs were found in his car when he was arrested about
60 miles east of Reno, Jacobs said. Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman
Alan Davidson said Helder was believed headed for California.</TE>
<TE>   The spree began Friday and was quickly characterized by
authorities as domestic terrorism. On Saturday, the third-year
student at the University of Wisconsin at Stout in Menomonie left a
cryptic telephone message for his roommate advising him to check the
news, according to various FBI affidavits filed to support charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Cameron Helder received an envelope at the family's
Minnesota home containing various letters that made reference to
explosions. Then came the phone call in which the younger Helder
spoke of dying.</TE>
<TE>   The father called his son's roommate, who searched Helder's
bedroom and found the makings of pipe bombs--nails, paper clips,
explosive powder and receipts for pipes.</TE>
<TE>   Helder's roommate told investigators that, over the last year, the
suspect showed keen interest in "out-of-body experiences" and that
death is a "way of going on to another life" and that he was "looking
forward to it as a new experience."</TE>
<TE>   The father contacted authorities Monday evening and on Tuesday
tearfully read a statement to his son: "Please don't hurt anyone
else. You have the attention you wanted."</TE>
<TE>   By now, authorities were following Helder's travels through credit
card receipts and by tracking the location of Helder's cell phone as
he used it.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI put the Nevada Highway Patrol and local sheriff's deputies
on alert, and they converged along Interstate 80 across northern,
desolate Nevada, Davidson said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorist Lori McDonagh spotted Helder's car as he drove by on the
highway and recognized it from news reports.</TE>
<TE>   "He passed right by us," McDonagh said Wednesday. "It looked like
he was reading a map atlas. We noticed the Minnesota plates and I
said, 'That's the kid!'"</TE>
<TE>   She wrote down the license plate number and called 911 and the
FBI.</TE>
<TE>   As Helder sped by, poised law enforcement gave chase at speeds
reaching 110 mph, Davidson said.</TE>
<TE>   Talking to him by cell phone, FBI agents calmed Helder and he
eventually stopped his car, threw a gun out the window and gave
himself up after being promised he would not be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Helder was stopped three times for traffic violations during his
crime spree, before he had been named as a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers, Helder was first stopped, for speeding,
shortly after midnight Saturday. He told a police officer in St.
Edward, Neb., "I didn't mean to hurt anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Helder had just rigged a bomb in a rural mailbox 12 miles away,
but it hadn't been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Later Saturday, Helder was stopped near Watongo, Okla., for not
wearing a seat belt. Helder told the state trooper that he spent
Friday near Omaha and was headed toward Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Helder also told the state trooper that he was "very tired and
needed to find a motel room," according to the affidavit. He was
cited for an expired driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday afternoon, Helder was stopped for speeding at Fowler,
Colo., about 125 miles from where a bomb would be found the next day.
He was given a warning for driving too fast through town.</TE>
<TE>   According to the court papers, the trooper said Helder "appeared
to be very nervous and had very watery eyes, like he was going to
cry."</TE>
<TE>   Helder spent Tuesday night in Washoe County Jail, said Sheriff
Dennis Balaam.</TE>
<TE>   He described Helder as "a model prisoner, very polite, pleasant,
cordial and cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have since learned that the quiet, guitar-playing
college student was accused four years ago of threatening to blow up
a friend's mailbox in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Julie Cart in Denver contributed to this
report.</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate gave final approval to a farm bill that will shower
billions of dollars in new subsidies on political battleground states
and scrap a 1996 law that was intended to make growers less dependent
on the government.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has promised to sign the bill, which is expected to
swell agriculture spending by nearly 80% over the cost of existing
programs. The Democrat-controlled Senate approved the legislation, 64
to 35, over the objections of Republicans who said it was too
expensive and a step backward in policy.</LD>
<TE>   The bill guarantees a more stable income by raising subsidies for
grain and cotton growers, by reviving subsidies for wool and honey,
and by providing new payments for milk, peanuts, lentils and dry
peas.</TE>

<LD>   A retired FBI agent went on trial in Boston on charges he let two
high-ranking mob informants literally get away with murder.</LD>
<LD>   John Connolly, 61, is charged with racketeering, obstruction of
justice and conspiracy for allegedly protecting James J. "Whitey"
Bulger and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi from prosecution, and for
providing the reputed gangsters with confidential law enforcement
information.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutor John Durham said Connolly tipped off Bulger in
1994 that he was about to be indicted. The reputed gangster
disappeared and is now on the FBI's most-wanted list. The indictment
against Bulger links him and his associates to 21 murders. Flemmi is
awaiting trial for his alleged role in 10 murders.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Easing of Mine-Waste Rules</HD>
<DH>Environment: Bush's decision to allow dumping into streams
'must fail,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the U.S. government to stop
permitting coal companies to put tons of dirt and rock from their
mountaintop mining operations into streams and valleys, a practice
that has permanently changed the topography of Appalachia.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, which prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from
issuing new permits for piling leftover dirt and rock into streams,
could greatly reduce mountaintop removal mining. The practice, in
which mountaintops are sheared off to reach seams of coal, provided
inexpensive, clean-burning coal and underwrote an economic boom in
southern West Virginia and parts of Kentucky over the last decade.
The ruling also could complicate hard-rock mining operations in the
West.</LD>
<LD>   Just last week, the Bush administration rewrote the Corps of
Engineers' clean water regulations to allow companies to continue
filling valleys with the mining dirt, which already covers 1,000
miles of streams across Appalachia.</LD>
<TE>   But District Judge Charles H. Haden II in Charleston, W.Va., ruled
that the revision was illegal, as was the corps' routine practice of
allowing companies to fill streams and valleys with rock and dirt
from mining operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The agencies' attempt to legalize their long-standing illegal
regulatory practice must fail," Haden said in his ruling. "The
regulators' practice is illegal because it is contrary to the spirit
and letter of the Clean Water Act."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, which
participated in the rule change, said the agency will seek a stay of
the ruling pending an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned about the economic effect on the citizens
of the impacted states and on future energy supplies," said Joe
Martyak. "We consider this rule an effort to establish a regulatory
environment that is clear, predictable, fair and fosters good
environmental stewardship."</TE>
<TE>   The judge, however, stressed that the Bush administration was
acting out of turn by rewriting the rule. It should leave such
sweeping changes of environmental laws to Congress, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "However important to the energy requirements of the economy and
to employment in the region, amendments to the act should be
considered and accomplished in the sunlight of open congressional
debate and resolution, not within the murk of administrative
after-the-fact ratification of questionable regulatory practices,"
Haden wrote in his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Haden made a similar ruling in a West Virginia case, but
an appeals court voided his decision on jurisdictional grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Lovett, a West Virginia attorney who represented the
environmental group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth in its case
against the Corps of Engineers, said the ruling was a victory for the
people whose lifestyles and security had been threatened by the
massive engineering projects underway in Appalachia.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who live near the mines will be saying hallelujah,"
Lovett said. "It's good news for the environment of the region and
the forests and streams."</TE>
<TE>   But Freda Williams, a local activist who has been struggling
against mountaintop removal mining, was more cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "With as many failures as we've had and as hard as we've been
working, I'm hopeful--but I'm being realistic about it," she said.
"With the administration that we've got right now on the federal and
state level, I don't believe it will be banned, but I think it should
be."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of representatives
introduced legislation to overturn the administration's new
regulation permitting mining companies to fill streams and valleys.</TE>
<TE>   "This rule change by the Bush administration is the worst thing
that has happened to the Clean Water Act since it was created in
1972," said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.).</TE>
<TE>   Robert McLusky, an attorney for the Kentucky Coal Assn., which
intervened in the lawsuit in support of the corps, said Haden's
ruling would have a broad effect not just on mountaintop removal
mining but also on deep mining and other types of surface mining.</TE>
<TE>   The rugged, mountainous terrain of West Virginia lacks flat land
to deposit the rock and dirt from mining, so companies routinely get
permits to put them into valleys with streams.</TE>
<TE>   McLusky stressed that in mountaintop removal mining, the operators
have no choice but to put some of the mining dirt in valleys that
hold streams because the pitch of the mountains is so steep.</TE>
<TE>   Even after restoring the approximate contour of the mountains, the
companies have extra rock and dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to go somewhere," McLusky said. "You can't put back more
than will stay at an angle of repose."</TE>
<TE>   The mining industry, which argues that filling valleys is the only
economical way to extract the clean-burning coal from Appalachia, was
stunned by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We are startled by the scope of his ruling," said Carol Raulston,
spokeswoman for the National Mining Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Raulston predicted that the ruling could have broad implications.
For instance, it would prevent hard-rock mining companies in the West
from getting permits to fill streams or wetlands with the byproducts
of their operations.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's ruling was full of a sense of outrage at the use of
streams as disposal sites for mining waste--and at the Bush
administration's effort to legitimize the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "This obviously absurd exception would turn the Clean Water Act on
its head and use it to authorize polluting and destroying the
nation's waters for no reason but cheap waste disposal," Haden said.</TE>
<TE>   He called the agency's attempt to disguise a major rule change as
a mere effort to clarify a difference between EPA and Corps of
Engineers regulations "disingenuous and incomplete."</TE>
<TE>   This was not the first time that a Haden ruling has thrown the
mining industry back on its heels.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the judge ruled in favor of a group of West Virginians
who sued the Corps of Engineers, charging that burying streams in
mining dirt violated the federal Surface Mining and Clean Water acts.</TE>
<TE>   The decision sent a panic through the mining industry, but an
appeals court voided his decision, arguing that the state court
should have heard the case.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Need to Break From Their Routine</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their Western Conference semifinal series against the San
Antonio Spurs tied at 1-1, the Lakers got down to business Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   They took their seats at the tables lined up along the far side of
the gym, grabbed the pens and began signing basketball after
basketball--a couple dozen boxes' worth.</LD>
<LD>   Every team in the league holds these kinds of autograph sessions
to stock up on supplies for charity events. Most aren't presumptive
enough to schedule them in the middle of the second round of the
playoffs, but the Lakers were expected to still be around, playing
not only in May but well into June.</LD>
<TE>   With that assumption in place the Lakers seemed to view everything
before the NBA Finals just like their autographing duties--one big
obligation. Show up, play, travel, play. Sign, pass the ball down,
sign. As routine as an assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   You would think the playoffs would break the monotony, like
Laverne and Shirley sticking a glove on a beer bottle passing by in
the brewery.</TE>
<TE>   But the postseason in and of itself didn't bring about inspired
play. They kept doing just enough to win.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-point deficit to the Spurs at halftime in Game 2? That got
their attention.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half they hustled, with even Shaquille O'Neal
hitting the deck to grab a ball. They shot 50% and committed only
five turnovers. Kobe Bryant, playing all 24 minutes, scored 20 points
on nine-for-17 shooting. O'Neal had 13 in 20 minutes. They came up
with seven steals.</TE>
<TE>   If they played that way all the time they could start choosing
ring designs right now.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can sustain that effort for 48 minutes," Coach
Phil Jackson said. "Not too many teams can. We can play some defense
and we can get some urgency to our game.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have that sense of urgency to start some games. And we
haven't. We've been too controlled and too thoughtful, perhaps."</TE>
<TE>   It's time to wonder if they'll come to their senses before it's
too late. It already cost them a game. It could come back to cost
them a series.</TE>
<TE>   As Rick Fox said, "You come out on cruise control and you're going
to get spanked around at this time of year."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers should beat the Spurs because they're just better. If
anything, Tuesday night reaffirmed that. They gave San Antonio the
first two quarters, the Spurs played harder from start to finish and
yet the Lakers still had a chance to tie the score or go ahead on
their last possession.</TE>
<TE>   But Game 2 also showed you can't assume everything will follow
form. The officials didn't give the Lakers any breaks you'd expect
for the defending champions playing at home. Only two free throws in
the first half? Only two for Bryant the entire game? As forensic
expert Henry Lee said in the O.J. Simpson trial: "Something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with the Lakers?" was a question asked throughout
the league, even as they won their first four playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Their sleepwalking ways aren't simply a Laker problem or a
today's-athletes problem. The greats need a challenge before them for
motivation. In a recent interview with Oscar Robertson, he said that
it was top-notch opponents that got him up for games.</TE>
<TE>   "Competition is the thing that makes you go," Robertson said.
Playing against "Jerry West, Walt Frazier or Dick Barnett, you're
going to pick your game up.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you go in to a basketball game, you don't feel like
playing. When the horn blows, that turns you on."</TE>
<TE>   And that's coming from a guy who averaged a triple-double every
game 40 seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another quote that's jumping out of the notebook is from Laker
assistant coach Tex Winter. He has coached both the Michael
Jordan/Scottie Pippen combo and the Shaquille O'Neal/Kobe Bryant duo.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I've learned--really, in a way I'm sort of obsessed
with it--is the fact that it's a team game," Winter said. "It's not
the superstars necessarily that wins for you, it's the chemistry of
the ballclub. It's how those superstars are utilized in conjunction
with their complementary players. Generally it's that X-factor in the
complementary players that makes the difference."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are having a hard time finding third and fourth scoring
options behind O'Neal and Bryant. Teams are less reluctant to leave
Derek Fisher open for three-pointers after his sizzling shooting in
last year's playoffs. So they'll run at him, force him to put the
ball on the floor and try to get to the basket, where he's having
trouble finishing. Devean George is playing hard but not shooting
well. And there are fewer shot opportunities for everybody because
the Spurs (and Portland Trail Blazers) keep extending their own
possessions with offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, O'Neal's toe and now cut finger are nuisances. But they
didn't keep him from dominating when it mattered Sunday. I'm not
ready to blame the loss on his reduced effectiveness. And neither is
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can play well enough with Shaq at the level that he's
playing at right now," Jackson said. "It's the rest of the team that
has to step into the vacuum and provide some help."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the only thing that hasn't deserted the Lakers is their
swagger.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant greeted the media after the Game 2 defeat while wearing a
pair of yellow Gucci sunglasses he must have found in Elton John's
glove box, and said: "The party's just getting started. This is where
the fun starts."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said: "We're confident in our ability to respond in these
types of situations. It doesn't mean we like to be in this type of
situations. We just feel confident that we won't panic and we won't
get down on ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Right now they need a little less sense of entitlement, and a lot
more title-type effort.</TE>

<DH>Badminton: Two-time champion Wu won't compete in individual
playoffs, enhancing the chances of teammate Hu to win the title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elie Wu blazed a trail of dominance in badminton by winning the last
two Southern Section girls' singles titles.</LD>
<LD>   But the senior at Alhambra Keppel High is stepping aside this
season in deference to a younger teammate and because she needs a
break from her busy playing schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Wu has decided not to defend her title at the section individual
tournament Saturday at the Orange County Badminton Club in Orange.
Instead, she'll be rooting for sophomore Jun Hu, a budding talent who
developed her skills in the demanding Chinese national training
program.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe Jun can take it," Wu said. "We play together and I know
she's good, compared to most high school kids."</TE>
<TE>   Wu would seem a good judge of talent. Though only 19, she is the
No. 2-ranked women's player in the United States, a member of the
national team and the defending under-22 junior national champion.
International competition has taken her to 20 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Few doubt she would have been the first to win four Southern
Section singles titles had she not been playing in Denmark as a
freshman during the individual tournament and had she chosen to
compete this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe she is the best [girls' player] the CIF has ever seen,
by far," said Keppel Coach Vy Vien. "Whether she wins three, two,
whatever [number of] titles, there's nobody who has come even close
to what she has done; just blowing the competition away. She's at a
different level than the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Wu, who trained in Taiwan before moving to the United States
before the start of her freshman year, has won all of her high school
singles matches, a number that well exceeds 100, said Keppel
assistant and former head coach Harold George. In her two section
singles finals, Wu barely broke a sweat in routing May Mangkalakiri
of Villa Park, 11-1, 11-3, in 2000 and Amanda Lum of Palos Verdes
Peninsula, 11-1, 11-1, last year.</TE>
<TE>   Given Wu's record, it's not surprising that an opponent once asked
Wu not to "bagel" her before a match. For those unfamiliar with the
term, that means 11-0, 11-0.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a superhero," George said.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Wu didn't feel very heroic. Because she couldn't
speak English, she felt lost after moving to the United States in
1998. That's when she considered giving up badminton, the sport she
hopes to play at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Wu is ranked No. 34 in
the world, and the top 29 players will qualify for the next Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to quit badminton because the reason I moved here was
to study," she said. "Studies were always much more important than
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   But she kept playing after realizing she could eventually compete
for the U.S. national team because she was a citizen. Wu was born in
Monterey Park specifically so she could gain U.S. citizenship before
her family moved back to Taiwan, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though it took Wu two years before she could speak English, she
quickly adapted to the freedoms in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "In Taiwan, we had to wear a [school] uniform," she said. "You
cannot have long hair. You cannot dye your hair. No earrings, no
necklace.... You cannot do anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, you can do anything you want. It's very different."</TE>
<TE>   Wu has helped ease the cultural transition for Hu, whose family
moved to the United States from China last June. Because Hu is still
learning English, Wu serves as an interpreter and relays that Hu
attended a training academy in China, where she played badminton six
days a week and attended school three days a week.</TE>
<TE>   That explains how the 17-year-old was able to compile a 30-0
singles record in her first season at Keppel, winning the Almont
League title and earning the No. 3 seeding for the section individual
tournament. Hu defeated No. 2-seeded Samatha Jinadasa of Long Beach
Poly in an early-season match and has fared well in practice matches
against top-seeded Lum, who competes independently because Peninsula
does not have a team.</TE>
<TE>   Vien, in his first season as Keppel's head coach, says Hu could
start her own streak of section singles titles Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be too confident, but I believe she has a great
shot," said Vien, a former Keppel player who guided Alhambra to the
section's team title in 2000. "She is really skilled. Because of her
training in China, her game is really sound."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, high school badminton in Southern California has
been dominated by Asians whose families hail from countries where the
sport is revered. Keppel, with a student body that is 70% Asian, won
nine section coed team titles from 1987 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Wu honed her skills in Taiwan, but she says playing for Keppel has
taught her something just as valuable--teamwork. Although she has
played in only about a third of the Aztecs' matches this season
because of an international schedule that takes her abroad every
month, she will play for No. 2-seeded Keppel when the section team
playoffs start Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The team helped me a lot when I first moved here," she said. "I
didn't know anything."</TE>
<TE>   That has changed, Vien said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a great leader," he said. "As busy as she is this year with
her schedule and competition, she's still going to play with her
[high school] team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players have picked up a lot from her, just watching her
compete."</TE>

<LD>Even though he prefers the roof closed at Bank One Ballpark, Curt
Schilling pitched sharply into the ninth inning under the stars to
become baseball's first seven-game winner as the Arizona Diamondbacks
defeated Pittsburgh, 4-3, Wednesday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling surrendered a three-run homer to Craig Wilson in the
first inning. The Pirates got little off him after that.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (7-1) struck out nine and gave up six hits. He left
after issuing his only walk, to Armando Rios, leading off the ninth.</LD>
<TE>   Over a week ago, Schilling asked that the retractable roof be
closed when he pitches because he feels the ball carries farther when
it is open. The Diamondbacks agreed, and said Arizona starting
pitchers could decide whether to open the roof.</TE>
<TE>   The roof was closed in Schilling's last start, even though it was
83 degrees outside.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Diamondbacks were bombarded with e-mails and phone
calls from angry fans who prefer the roof open, managing general
partner Jerry Colangelo met with Schilling before Wednesday's game,
then announced that the new policy had been rescinded.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim relieved Schilling and got his 10th save.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Bautista, 16 for 33 in the nine-game homestand, tripled and,
for the second night in a row, singled in the go-ahead run as the
Diamondbacks won for the fifth time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, Houston 3--Pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee hit a two-run
homer with two outs in the ninth to give the Phillies a victory over
the Astros at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, who lost a club-record 18 games in April, have won
five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Montreal 0--Todd Helton, Larry Walker and Todd Zeile
homered, leading Shawn Chacon and the Rockies at Montreal to extend
the Expos' season-high losing streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon (3-4) combined with four relievers on a six-hit shutout. He
scattered five hits in six innings before leaving with a strained
chest muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, San Diego 4--Third baseman Cesar Crespo's throwing
error keyed the Marlins' four-run rally in the eighth inning and the
Marlins won at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Crespo, who replaced rookie Sean Burroughs at third base to start
the inning, threw wide of the plate with the bases loaded, allowing
Cliff Floyd and Derrek Lee to score.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 14, Milwaukee 5--Austin Kearns hit a three-run homer
and Adam Dunn doubled with the bases loaded to lead the Reds at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Chicago 2--Matt Morris survived a shaky start after
yielding Sammy Sosa's 14th homer, and the Cubs went hitless over the
last seven innings as the Cardinals won at Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Rueter Wins 100th at Expense of Estes</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Giant pitcher reaches milestone in 8-2 victory
over Mets, but he doesn't enjoy defeating his best friend in the
process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The only negative for Kirk Rueter about winning his 100th career game
was that he had to defeat his best friend to do it.</LD>
<LD>   Rueter outpitched former teammate Shawn Estes to beat the Mets for
the first time in 13 tries and the San Francisco Giants beat New
York, 8-2, Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't looking forward to it," Rueter said. "He was my best
friend for the last five years. We've been through a lot together.
It's not easy to pitch against your best friend."</LD>
<TE>   Rueter (5-1) shut down the Mets with efficient ease, allowing only
one runner to reach third base until Jay Payton's RBI double in the
eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter gave up two runs, five hits and one walk in 72/3 innings.
Rueter, who was 0-5 in his last 12 starts against the Mets, has now
defeated every National League team as he improved to 100-61 in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to beat them for the first time because they pounded
me so many times," Rueter said.</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow homered and drove in four runs and Barry Bonds was
pitched around again as the Giants won their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went 0 for 2 with two walks and was hit by a pitch. He has
been walked 44 times this season and is on pace for 222, which would
smash the record of 177 he set last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets lost their fourth consecutive game. They've been
outscored, 28-5, in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Estes (1-4), traded to New York in December, got off to a shaky
start against his former team. He threw five consecutive balls to
open the game, prompting a visit from first baseman Mo Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a good rhythm," Estes said. "I had no tempo. I
didn't have a feel for any of my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   After hitting Bonds on his right elbow with one out, Estes allowed
an RBI single to Jeff Kent.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't sharp with his breaking ball early," Giant Manager
Dusty Baker said. "He might have been over-amped. He might have been
trying too hard."</TE>
<TE>   Estes got out of a bases-loaded jam in the second when he retired
Bonds on a routine fly to right field. Estes didn't allow another hit
until the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   After getting in front of Bonds 0-2, Estes walked him with one
out. After Kent hit into a forceout and stole second, Snow hit a
drive over Payton's head in center for an RBI double.</TE>

<LD>Two-time defending champion Woodland Hills El Camino Real High will
play Granada Hills for the City Championship in boys' tennis for the
third consecutive season after each won semifinal matches Wednesday
at Balboa Sports Complex in Encino.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Conquistadores (12-0) defeated No. 4 Eagle Rock
(12-1), 271/2-2, and the third-seeded Highlanders (11-2) beat No. 7
Taft (10-4), 201/2-9. The final is set for 1 p.m. Friday at Balboa
Sports Complex.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty hard to win it twice in a row, and three times would
be quite an accomplishment," said Marvin Jones, El Camino Real's
third-year coach.</LD>
<TE>   The Conquistadores, who are 44-1 the last three years, took an
insurmountable 15-0 lead in the round-robin format on No. 3 singles
player Dustin Lang's 6-2 victory over Jimmy Nguyen, Eagle Rock's No.
2 player. The Conquistadores' three doubles teams wound up sweeping
all nine of their sets. Eagle Rock's top player, T.J. Maarup,
recorded the Eagles' only victories--7-6 (6) over Lang and 7-5 over
Troy Aiken.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills (11-2), which hasn't won a City title despite
reaching six finals in the last seven years, lost 241/2-5 and
17-121/2 in the last two finals. El Camino Real defeated the
Highlanders twice by 4-3 scores in head-to-head West Valley League
play this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Third time lucky, I hope," said Granada Hills No. 1 player Nima
Roshan, who dropped only one game while leading the Highlanders'
sweep of singles sets.</TE>

<TE>   Southern Section preliminaries--The Newport Harbor boys and the
Irvine girls were the dominant Division I teams at Belmont Plaza in
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Anchored by world-record holder Aaron Peirsol, Newport Harbor was
the top qualifier in the 200 freestyle (1:27.86) and 400 freestyle
relays (3:13.15). Peirsol also had the fastest time in the 200

was the top qualifier in the 100 freestyle (46.39) and second in the
100 backstroke (51.02), and Ryan Lean was the second qualifier in the
500 freestyle (4:34.44). Both also swam on the freestyle relays.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's girls earned top qualifying honors in six of 11 events,
setting the stage for their sixth consecutive Division I title.
Courtney Cashion was the top qualifier in the 50 (23.73) and 100
freestyles (51,42) for the Vaqueros, Diana MacManus was the top
qualifier in the 100 backstroke (55.11) and second qualifier in the

<HD>Prior's Triple-A Debut Is Smashing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch and Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having mastered double-A hitters in only six starts, former USC
right-hander Mark Prior made his triple-A debut Tuesday night for the
Iowa Cubs and put on a pitching and hitting display that might
quickly propel him to the major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Prior, the second pick in last summer's amateur draft, gave up
three hits--all singles--two walks and one unearned run in 72/3
innings. He also hit two solo home runs, prompting curtain calls from
Cub fans who haven't anticipated a promotion this eagerly since Kerry
Wood rose to the majors in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Prior struck out 10 before being lifted when he reached his
110-pitch limit with nobody on and two out in the eighth inning of a
6-1 victory over the Tucson Sidewinders.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that he struck out the side in 10 pitches [in the first
inning] and hit two home runs, there isn't much more that we could
have expected," said Andy MacPhail, Chicago Cub president and general
manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We all feel like he has a bright major league future in front of
him, but his initial performance exceeded our expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Said Prior: "Going out and throwing well gave me the confidence
that if I do get called up, I have what it takes to pitch at the big
league level."</TE>
<TE>   MacPhail said the club promoted its star prospect to triple-A so
he could face "more disciplined, experienced hitters and umpires who
might shrink the strike zone a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Prior was 4-1 with a 2.60 earned-run average and 55 strikeouts in
342/3 innings with the double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be something I'll remember," said Prior, whose last
multihomer game came as a freshman at Vanderbilt. "It was just one of
those things where the wind was blowing out and I made good contact."</TE>

<HD>A Killer's Stealthy Advance</HD>
<DH>A new generation of victims, afflicted with a rare cancer
linked to asbestos, was exposed to the toxic fibers in the most
innocent settings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Victoria Pugh's first clue was a nosebleed. A few hours earlier, she
had walked in cap and gown across the stage at Stillman College in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., becoming the first member of her family to collect
a college diploma.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as she packed up to leave campus, her nose started to bleed
uncontrollably. That summer, a mysterious malaise set in.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen months later, Pugh learned that she had mesothelioma, a
rare, incurable form of cancer associated with asbestos. Pugh, 26,
didn't even know what asbestos was, much less where she might have
encountered it. Doctors told her she had three months to live.</LD>
<TE>   "They couldn't operate," she said. "I just had to pray to God."</TE>
<TE>   Pugh belongs to the third generation of mesothelioma victims. The
first were miners who dug the mineral out of the earth and workers
who sprayed heavy concentrations of asbestos insulation into ships,
buildings and homes. The second group included retired construction
workers, pipe fitters and others who worked with or near insulation
and other asbestos products.</TE>
<TE>   The third, which was largely unanticipated when asbestos
emerged as a health crisis in the 1970s, is made up of younger people,
some of whom are learning they have mesothelioma in their 50s, 40s, 30s
and even 20s. In contrast to previous victims, many have no idea how
they came in contact with asbestos and must go searching for answers.</TE>
<TE>   Often they learn that they inhaled the toxic fibers in the most
innocent and familiar of settings--on the lap of a father just home
from a construction site, or in a laundry room where dusty overalls
were washed. Others trace their illness to a long-forgotten summer
job or a do-it-yourself home improvement project.</TE>
<TE>   "Some die without knowing," said Randy Bono, a lawyer in Wood
River, Ill., who represents mesothelioma victims. "We try to hurry
without rushing. Most of the cases never get to trial before they
die."</TE>
<TE>   Slow-Motion Epidemic</TE>
<TE>   Mesothelioma is the most lethal legacy of the nation's embrace of
asbestos, which peaked in 1973 when annual U.S. consumption reached 1
million tons. Prized as a cheap fire retardant and filler material,
the "miracle fiber" was used in more than 3,500 products, from
insulation to floor tiles. Although its use in the U.S. has declined
steeply, the commercialization of asbestos has yet to loosen its grip
on public health.</TE>
<TE>   Because symptoms typically appear 15 to 40 years after the first
exposure to asbestos, mesothelioma has been described as an epidemic
in slow motion. Cases diagnosed today may reflect experiences from as
long ago as the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2,500 new cases are identified each year in the
United States. Epidemiological evidence is scant, but National Cancer
Institute surveys indicate that the incidence of mesothelioma doubled
between 1977 and 1990 to 1.2 cases per 100,000 people and has
remained near that level. But several specialists say they suspect
the incidence is rising.</TE>
<TE>   Explanations for the persistence of the disease vary. Some experts
believe it is primarily a result of heavy occupational exposure from
the 1960s through the early 1970s. Others believe that Americans are
continuing to be exposed to asbestos released from aging building
materials and from natural outcroppings of the mineral.</TE>
<TE>   Most mesothelioma victims die within 18 months of diagnosis.
Mortality is swift not because the cancer is fast-growing but because
it usually is far advanced by the time it is detected.</TE>
<TE>   It spreads like a thin sheet, rather than forming the lumps
associated with other cancers. Its host is the mesothelium, the
slick, thin membrane that lines the chest wall, abdominal cavity,
lungs and other organs. Because of its stealthy advance, by the time
a patient notices a shortness of breath, mesothelioma already may
have encased a lung like a rind.</TE>
<TE>   As if the bleak diagnosis were not enough, mesothelioma victims
also have poor prospects of recovering any money from the makers of
asbestos products. That's because a surge of asbestos lawsuits in
recent years has driven many of the companies into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, mesothelioma was identified with aging industrial
laborers. No longer.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1988, the mean [patient age] was in the low to mid-70s, and
it's steadily come down now to the mid-50s," said Dr. David
Sugarbaker, chief of thoracic surgery at Boston's Brigham and Women's
Hospital. "We've had a number of patients in their 30s and 40s, which
we hadn't seen until the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   Until 1994, almost all of Sugarbaker's patients knew where they
had been exposed to asbestos, many of them in Boston-area shipyards.
Of the patients he has seen in the last seven years, "30% do not know
where they were exposed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-year-old mesothelioma patient Sugarbaker saw a couple of
years ago was exposed as an infant. Her mother recalled that when she
did the laundry, she shook asbestos dust out of her husband's work
clothes while her baby daughter slept nearby in a cradle.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Victor L. Roggli, a pathology professor at Duke University
Medical Center in Durham, N.C., studied 1,445 mesothelioma victims
from the last 25 years and found that 86% were exposed on the job. In
6% of the cases, the source of exposure was uncertain. In the
remaining 8%, the victims inhaled fibers brought home on the clothing
of someone with whom they lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I see a case of mesothelioma in a person in his 30s or
40s," Roggli said, "the first thing I tell the doctors to ask is:
'What did Daddy do?'"</TE>
<TE>   A Dream Blown Away</TE>
<TE>   Under different circumstances, Victoria Pugh might have been in
law school. Now, if she sees the inside of a courtroom, it will be as
a plaintiff in a trial scheduled for this month against dozens of
companies whose products she believes exposed her to asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   By the time doctors at the University of Alabama hospital in
Birmingham discovered Pugh's mesothelioma in November 2000, it had
spread throughout her abdomen and wrapped around her heart.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors referred her to a local lawyer, who put her in touch with
Randy Bono's law firm, which specializes in mesothelioma cases.</TE>
<TE>   Her case was assigned to Jeff Cooper, who has represented aging
mesothelioma victims and watched his grandfather, a factory worker,
die of the disease. He thought the age listed on Pugh's file--25--was
a typographical error.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'There's no way,'" he said. "To see somebody younger than
I am passing away from this is very disheartening."</TE>
<TE>   Pugh's father, Sandy, who died of throat cancer in 1993 at 68,
held a variety of jobs--laying pipes, painting air conditioner parts
on an assembly line and fixing cars at a repair shop and at home.
Victoria Pugh recalled "snooping around" the yard of her Greenville,
Ala., home, watching her dad work on cars; she now believes she was
exposed to asbestos in the dust blown off old brakes.</TE>
<TE>   To reconstruct Pugh's early years, Cooper pumped family members
for information. They told him that in 1976, the year Victoria was
born, her father began building the family home with scrap lumber he
purchased from a congregation that had torn down an old church. For
nearly two years, Sandy Pugh worked all day and spent his evenings
and weekends building the house. So Bobbie Jean Pugh took her
daughter to visit him at the construction site--where asbestos in
joint compound presented another potential source of exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Pugh, who helped his brother, remembered spreading two
coats of joint compound in every drywall seam in the house, letting
each coat dry and sanding it smooth. The sanding kicked dust into the
air "just like it was snowing," Willie Pugh said in a deposition.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be all over us--in our head and in our mouth just like
somebody put flour on you," he said. "Your clothes would be full of
it."</TE>
<TE>   When Victoria came, Sandy Pugh would put down his tools and take
her in his lap. "She was all in that [dust] too," Willie Pugh said.
"It's all in his face, and she was hugging him."</TE>
<TE>   After college, Victoria returned home, where her mother and sister
care for her. "She was going to school to be a lawyer--and, poof, her
dream was blown away," Bobbie Jean Pugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria has lost 100 pounds since her diagnosis. The disease
and a round of chemotherapy last year have left her weak, often too weak
to bathe herself or to walk. She loses her balance easily and
sometimes gets confused. She suffers sharp pains in her stomach and
severe headaches. Sleep is difficult. Breathing is difficult. She
takes powerful medications for the pain and antidepressants to "keep
my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, she managed to go to church every Sunday and Bible
class every Wednesday nights.</TE>
<TE>   "On my bad days," she said, "I don't move around too much."</TE>
<TE>   'You Can't Go Easy'</TE>
<TE>   When Klaus Brauch received his diagnosis in June, he and his wife,
Susan, were dumbfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "When they said 'mesothelioma' and 'Have you ever been around
asbestos?' we said, 'Huh?'" recalled Brauch, 52.</TE>
<TE>   Brauch was born in Germany and grew up in Toronto. He and Susan
were high school sweethearts and married as undergraduates at the
University of Toronto. After graduating, Brauch went to work for IBM
as a systems engineer.</TE>
<TE>   The Brauchs were raising three daughters in Toronto when Klaus got
an offer to join a Swedish software company as an executive in its
Torrance-based U.S. unit. The family fell in love with the California
coast and moved to Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Searching his memory after the diagnosis, Brauch realized that he
had been exposed to asbestos on two occasions. The first time was
when, at 16, he spent the summer as a contractor's helper in Toronto,
cleaning up construction sites where asbestos products were used.</TE>
<TE>   "A summer job is a hell of a way to screw up a life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, Brauch believes, he was exposed again, this
time while making home improvements--nailing shingles on the roof,
laying vinyl flooring, patching plaster and installing a fireplace in
a basement recreation room.</TE>
<TE>   The year was 1976, and although he didn't know it at the time,
Brauch said, each phase of the renovation exposed him to products
that contained asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like you couldn't avoid it," he said. "It was in
everything."</TE>
<TE>   The exposures caught up with Brauch last summer, a few days after
he and Susan celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. Troubled by a
shortness of breath, Brauch checked into a hospital for tests. The
couple did not anticipate anything serious. The diagnosis was the
first time they had heard the word "mesothelioma."</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't seem that sick at all," Susan said. "We were totally
blown away."</TE>
<TE>   Susan searched the Internet. What little she found about the
disease was overwhelmingly fatalistic.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister had breast and uterine cancer, and she's still here,"
she said. "There's hope now with most cancers. With mesothelioma,
some doctors will just tell you, 'Write your will.' That's the hard
part. If it's untreatable, how do you have hope?"</TE>
<TE>   However, Klaus considers himself lucky because his mesothelioma
was discovered at an early stage, making him a prime candidate for
experimental treatments, and he has thrown himself into the fight.</TE>
<TE>   The Brauchs heard about a radical surgery Dr. Sugarbaker and his
partners perform in Boston, and Klaus had a consultation within a
month of his diagnosis. He was accepted for the surgery, and on Oct.
11, Brauch had what he calls his "amputation"--the removal of his
right lung, his diaphragm and his sixth rib.</TE>
<TE>   Brauch also was approved for a clinical trial. So before closing
him up, surgeons took aim at any stray mesothelioma cells the scalpel
might have missed by flushing his body for an hour with a high dose
of an aggressive chemotherapy agent, a heated liquid that contains
platinum. The therapy appears to have held the disease in check.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go easy with this cancer," Brauch said. "Did I think
losing a lung was a swell idea? No. But anything that has a chance to
save your life you will do."</TE>
<TE>   'Nothing Can Be Done'</TE>
<TE>   Research into mesothelioma is slow because it is an "orphan
disease," receiving less funding than more prevalent cancers, said
Dr. Harvey Pass, a professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State
University in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing question for the small circle of doctors
concerned with mesothelioma is why it strikes some people and not
others. The answers, they believe, may lead to early-detection
methods, better treatment or even a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most heavily exposed asbestos workers, such as
insulation sprayers, mesothelioma is believed to strike less than
15%, said Dr. Robert B. Cameron, a thoracic surgeon at UCLA Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "So why is it that the other 85% don't get mesothelioma? There may
be some kind of genetic susceptibility, and that's what we're really
curious about now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron is setting up a registry in association with the
Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation in Santa Barbara that will
cull case histories and tissue samples from across the country. It
will log details about who is getting the disease, their course of
treatment and its effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "A few of us are trying to figure out what to do," he said. "Most
patients die within a very short period of time, so most physicians
don't even want to bother treating them. The average person is just
told, 'There is nothing that can be done,' and they just go home and
die."</TE>
<TE>   That was the attitude Linda Seiler first encountered. The Mission
Viejo woman was pursuing a professional singing and theater career
two years ago when she was unable to shake a nagging cough and kept
losing her breath. After she canceled a few singing lessons, her
voice coach persuaded her to see a doctor. Her doctor sent her for a
lung biopsy.</TE>
<TE>   The surgeon discovered mesothelioma. He told Seiler she had maybe
three months to live.</TE>
<TE>   Seiler, who was 50, knew she had been exposed to asbestos as a
child--every time her father, an insulation worker, came home from
work and gave her a hug.</TE>
<TE>   "He was dusty," she said in a videotaped deposition. "He had very
black hair, so you [could] see the dust in his hair and on his neck,
his clothes."</TE>
<TE>   When Seiler was a child, the family lived in a trailer, moving as
often as once a month to follow insulation jobs at refineries and
other plants. The family settled in a house in Fontana when Seiler
was in fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   That was the year the laundry became her chore. She sorted the
family's clothes into piles--shaking the dust out of the coveralls
her father wore to work--before feeding them by hand through a
washing machine ringer.</TE>
<TE>   When Seiler and her husband, Jim, started looking for treatment
options, one doctor recommended she have her lung removed.</TE>
<TE>   Seiler could not bear to contemplate it. Singing was her life. Two
months before her diagnosis, a talent agent had signed her and she
was preparing to audition for musicals.</TE>
<TE>   She chose another operation that would spare her lung--a 10-hour
procedure in May 2000 in which the lining of her lung was scraped off
and her diaphragm was replaced with tissue from a cow. The recovery
was difficult and slow. It was four months before she could drive to
the grocery. Then came five weeks of radiation treatments, five days
a week.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Seiler took a year off from work to care for his wife, and her
mother helped as well. They went through the shock, denial and anger
together.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the bargaining: "It was: 'All right, God, if I eat right
and do my treatments right and do everything the doctor tells me,
I'll be all right,'" Jim said, recalling his wife's attitude. "We
believed God would take care of us and make her well."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Seiler appeared to be cancer-free for several months. Then
she noticed a lump on her back. On her next visit to the doctor in
January 2001, eight months after the surgery, she learned that the
cancer was back.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," she said in her deposition. "I was shocked. I
really thought that I had beat it. I was so positive."</TE>
<TE>   Seiler flew to a cancer research center in San Antonio for
twice-monthly chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   The cancer appeared to shrink--only to grow back. She got into a
clinical trial at UCLA, where researchers were attacking cancer with
immunotherapy. That also failed.</TE>
<TE>   In late September, 18 months after her diagnosis, Seiler's
oncologist told her she had run out of options.</TE>
<TE>   In the car on the way home, Seiler looked at her husband and her
mother and said, "I'll save a spot for you guys in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, on Oct. 2, she died.</TE>

<HD>How Enron Manipulated State's Power Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Enron Corp.'s favorite trading strategies during the
California electricity crisis was like booking an airline ticket for
a flight you don't intend to board.</LD>
<LD>   It's a waste of time and money unless you're sure the flight will
be overbooked and the airline will have to dish out rewards to
passengers who agree to stay home.</LD>
<LD>   Enron--and, possibly, other energy traders--worked variations on
this theme to collect special fees from the California Independent
System Operator, the embattled traffic cop for the state's power grid
following deregulation.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes Cal-ISO would pay Enron premiums not to use power that
the firm didn't really need in the first place. Sometimes Enron would
exploit California's emergency price caps, buying power at the capped
price and then selling it at huge profit out of state, where there
were no price caps.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's trading strategies were described in memos released Monday
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The memos, written by
lawyers for Enron, detailed an array of trading methods that went by
such swashbuckling nicknames as Death Star, Wheel Out, Fat Boy and
Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   California officials have pounced on the Enron memos as proof that
energy traders and freelance power generators--mainly from out of
state--were manipulating California's energy markets, raising prices
and even triggering blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   But the senior member of Cal-ISO's market surveillance committee,
Stanford University economist Frank A. Wolak, said Wednesday that
most of the schemes described in the memos were garden-variety
trading strategies common to any market--whether for stocks, natural
gas or used cars.</TE>
<TE>   Power trading came into being in California with the advent of
energy deregulation in 1998. Before that, regulated utilities with
state-granted monopoly territories generated the power and
distributed it directly to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Under deregulation, utilities sold many of their generating plants
and became giant consumers, bidding for electricity from power
producers, some from out of state, some running the same California
plants that used to belong to the utilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the new market, traders--often pure middlemen who did not own
power plants--began to ply their trade. One of their functions, which
Wall Streeters call arbitrage, was to try to buy power at a low price
in one place and sell it at a higher price somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest and arguably the savviest of the traders was Enron.
Here, according to the memos released Monday and interviews with
trading experts, are some of the methods it used to try to profit
from the unique characteristics of the California market:</TE>
<TE>   * In one specialized part of the market, Cal-ISO required
participants to submit daily schedules stating how much power they
intended to supply the next day and how much they intended to use.
The two components were supposed to be in balance.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that California's utilities, for reasons of their own,
were habitually understating their "load," or the amount of
electricity they needed to use, Enron saw a profit opportunity in
overstating its load. Traders called the technique "inc-ing the
load," meaning increasing the load. When supplies were tight, Cal-ISO
paid participants a premium when they provided more power than they
required.</TE>
<TE>   Since the utilities often needed more power than they had
scheduled, Cal-ISO often found itself having to offer premiums, and
Enron, which did not need all the power it had scheduled, was ready
to scoop up the premiums.</TE>
<TE>   * When prices started to soar in 2000, officials responded by
capping electricity prices in the California market. In December
2000, as the crisis intensified, the capped price was $250 a
megawatt-hour. However, the crisis had spilled over to other states,
where there was no state-mandated price ceiling. Enron realized that
it could reap easy profit by buying power at the capped price in
California and selling it out of state.</TE>
<TE>   A Dec. 6, 2000, Enron memo provides a powerful example: "Yesterday
... prices at Mid-C [near Portland, Ore.] peaked at $1,200, while
California was capped at $250. Thus, traders could buy power at $250
and sell it for $1,200."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the memo acknowledged, exporting power at a time when
Californians were screaming for it posed "a public relations risk
arising from the fact that such exports may have contributed to
California's declaration of a Stage 2 Emergency yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   * Sometimes, the amount of power scheduled for delivery into
California exceeded the capacity of some of the system's transmission
lines. At such times, Cal-ISO would make "congestion payments" to
market participants that would either schedule transmission in the
opposite direction of the clog or would reduce their generation-load
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Enron would sometimes file schedules for power for which it had no
need, simply to collect congestion fees when Cal-ISO asked it to
decrease its power use. This technique was analogous to booking an
airplane ticket when you have no intention of flying.</TE>
<TE>   A parallel technique, nicknamed Death Star, involved arranging to
route power around Cal-ISO's system, sometimes via out-of-state
lines, just to get in position to send power in the opposite
direction of a traffic jam--and, once again, to collect congestion
fees.</TE>

<HD>School Accountability Is a High Priority, Bush Says in Wis.
Visit</HD>
<DH>Politics: 'Shoving kids through the system's got to end,'
he says, focusing on issue as elections near.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LA CROSSE, Wis.</DL>
<LD>President Bush brought his campaign for school and teacher
accountability to Wisconsin on Wednesday, part of a broader
Republican push to shore up public confidence in the party's handling
of education.</LD>
<LD>   The effort underscores the importance many GOP strategists attach
to education as a topic crucial to shaping the party's image with
voters now that domestic issues are beginning to reemerge from the
shadow of the nation's post-Sept. 11 focus on national security.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's visit to Wisconsin was his seventh stop devoted to
education in recent months, with more envisioned as the November
elections near. The tour aims to highlight the landmark education
reform law he signed in January, which requires greater
accountability through new annual reading and math tests in the third
through eighth grades.</LD>
<TE>   "We must have high expectations and high standards," Bush said at
Logan High School in La Crosse. "This business of shoving kids
through the system's got to end."</TE>
<TE>   Even as Bush visited three public schools, House Republican
leaders encouraged their members to emphasize GOP accomplishments and
plans on education. Their hope is to maintain and build on a
significant shift in the public's view of which party has the edge on
education policy.</TE>
<TE>   Education traditionally has been solid Democratic territory. In
May 1999, for example, GOP pollster David Winston found that voters
preferred Democrats' handling of education policy over Republicans'
by 50% to 29%.</TE>
<TE>   But Winston and other pollsters of both parties have seen that gap
close since Bush became president and began lobbying for the school
reform initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys found the GOP ranked even with the Democrats on the issue
when Bush signed the education bill.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he marked the event with a multi-state tour by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who helped steer the bill through
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But GOP standing on education has begun to erode--in part,
Winston's polls indicate, because Republicans have stopped talking
about the issue. That's why GOP congressional leaders last week began
touting a new wave of education initiatives including greater efforts
to promote early childhood literacy.</TE>
<TE>   They also urged each House Republican to hold at least one
education-oriented event a week in their home districts.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been talking about it as much as we should," said
Kevin Schweers, spokesman for the House Republican Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, concerned about the erosion of their traditional
advantage on the issue, have responded with their own drive to
persuade voters that the Republican Party's commitment to the
nation's schools is based more on talk than substance.</TE>
<TE>   They have focused their attacks on Bush's proposed budget for
2003, charging it would inadequately fund the education reform law he
is touting. To press the Democratic case, Kennedy is holding hearings
to scrutinize implementation of the new education policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's enormously frustrating to a lot of Democrats that George
Bush has been able to capture some credibility on this issue," said
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "What's especially frustrating is
the fact he's been able to capture come credibility without
delivering the goods."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks on education in Wisconsin, Bush emphasized not
dollars but accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to several hundred high schoolers at one end of the packed
Logan High gymnasium, the president said, "I know you don't like to
take tests. Too bad. It's important."</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is we're not educating every child right
now. We're letting a lot of them just go on through--the
tough-to-educate.... That's going to quit, as far as I'm concerned.
That's not the America I know."</TE>
<TE>   Before the speech in La Crosse, Bush stopped in Milwaukee, where
he visited Rufus King High School and Clarke Street Elementary
School.</TE>
<TE>   At every stop, Bush urged young people to consider a career in
teaching, hailing it as a noble profession.</TE>
<TE>   Chen reported from Wisconsin, Hook from Washington.</TE>

abs.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent months, a chiseled gut has been dangled in front of
even couch potatoes. A no-pain, no-effort "six-pack" is just a credit
card purchase and an electrical outlet away--or so promised the buff
infomercial hawkers of electronic abdominal belts.</LD>
<LD>   It sounded too good to be true. And it was, federal regulators
said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   They filed lawsuits in California and Nevada this week against the
makers and distributors of three highly popular devices--the AB
Energizer, AbTronic and Fast Abs--alleging that the companies had
engaged in false and deceptive advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the pitch: With the touch of a button you'll go from
flabby abs to rock-hard abs without breaking a sweat," Federal Trade
Commission Chairman Timothy J. Muris said at a news conference, where
he was flanked by boxes of the belts labeled "As seen on TV."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, though, these electronic ab gadgets don't do a
thing to turn a bulging beer belly into a sleek six-pack muscled
stomach," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The government is seeking a permanent injunction to halt
advertisements that include claims it alleges are false. In addition,
FTC officials are asking for an unspecified sum of money to reimburse
consumers hurt by the companies' alleged violations.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Abs considers the charges inaccurate, a lawyer for the
company said. A spokeswoman for AB Energizer said the firm will work
with the FTC to resolve the charges. AbTronic officials could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The belts, which promise to electronically contract muscles, have
been purchased by more than 3 million Americans to the tune of well
over $100 million, federal officials estimate. They cost between $40
and $120 each.</TE>
<TE>   The cable TV ads for each of the three devices were among the 10
most frequently broadcast infomercials of last year, federal
regulators said. The ubiquitous 30-minute testimonials featured
fitness professionals making claims that are not backed up by
research or science, they added.</TE>
<TE>   Some months ago, the "siren call" of a Fast Abs infomercial sucked
in John Iwaniszek, a 42-year-old statistical consultant in Raleigh,
N.C., who said he's in "reasonable shape."</TE>
<TE>   "I was hypnotized," he said, "and I'm not usually susceptible to
that kind of stuff. But I thought, you know, I have some money; let's
see if it works. There was probably more than a little midlife crisis
going on too."</TE>
<TE>   Iwaniszek says he is "not disappointed" in his machine.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't use it long enough to see profound results," he said.
"It's uncomfortable. You have to smooth on this jelly and it hurts,
but as far as I'm concerned it does what they told me it would: It
stimulates the muscles."</TE>
<TE>   Food and Drug Administration officials said the muscle stimulation
felt by ab-belt users might help tone the muscles of people unable to
exercise, such as stroke victims, but it won't produce the desired
washboard stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "A claim they might be able to make would be along the lines that
[using their device] would increase your ability to do sit-ups," said
David Feigal, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and
Radiological Health.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of one of the products disputed the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Knowles, an attorney representing Fast Abs, said his
clients believe that the charges are inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think consumers are sophisticated enough to know that pressing
a single button won't get them these results," said Knowles, adding
that Fast Abs was marketed as a weight-loss system that included
other steps.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles said Fast Abs, which sold for about $40, has been off the
market for about two months, forced out by cheaper,
off-the-drugstore-shelf products that made similar claims.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Hutchins, a spokeswoman for AB Energizer, said the suit
marked the first request the company had received from the FTC for
substantiation. "We look forward to presenting the merits of the AB
Energizer to the FTC and working with them to resolve their
concerns," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Muris said the FTC's decision to go after ab-belt companies marks
the first step in what will be an aggressive campaign to halt false
and deceptive claims made by the multibillion-dollar diet and
exercise industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We are attacking these products as fraud and deception. They
don't work," Muris said.</TE>
<TE>   Fitness professionals say shortcut solutions have always had a big
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of diet programs say 'Lose 10 pounds in 24 hours,' " said
Larry Krug, a fitness trainer at Crunch Los Angeles, a Sunset
Boulevard gym. "If someone tells you that if you invest $100 today
you could make $1 million tomorrow, no one would believe it. But when
it comes to diet and fitness, people are so desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do ab exercises all day as hard as you like, and unless
you eat correctly they will never show," said Krug, 33. "Look at it
this way: The average man has 18% body fat. At 12% body fat he might
have some definition in his stomach. At 10% it would really show."</TE>
<TE>   And, he pointed out, "55% of Americans are obese."</TE>

<HD>FBI Cites Inadequacies Over Terrorist Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI's failure to follow up on an agent's pre-Sept. 11 warning
about Islamic militants attending U.S. flight schools highlights
inadequacies in the bureau's counter-terrorism efforts, senior bureau
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The agent was investigating what he described as several highly
suspicious Middle Easterners who were training at an aviation school
in Arizona and warned that the FBI should launch a full-scale
investigation and contact flight schools nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   And while the memo was sent to FBI headquarters in Washington and
a special New York FBI unit hunting Osama bin Laden, that full-scale
investigation was not launched until after the Sept. 11 suicide
hijackings. Those attacks were carried out by several Middle Eastern
pilots who trained at flight schools in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "Could it have been followed up more aggressively? Sure, it could
have," said a senior FBI official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Even though most counter-terrorism agents were involved in the
investigation of the October 2000 bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole
in Yemen and other terrorist plots in Europe and elsewhere, that was
not the reason for the failure to follow through, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It highlighted the need for us to put in place a much more robust
analytical capacity," the official said. "We can't afford to have our
analytical capacity overwhelmed by current events."</TE>
<TE>   In an unusually blunt assessment, FBI Director Robert Mueller
acknowledged Wednesday that the bureau could have responded more
aggressively to the memo, adding that ''in the future we have to be
more proactive.''</TE>
<TE>   At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, several senators grilled
Mueller about what he and other top bureau officials knew about the
memo. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) gave Mueller a list of more
than a dozen questions, seeking detailed answers about the bureau's
response.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had seen that [memo], I would have sent it right to the
president," Feinstein told Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said FBI officials should have taken the memo as a dire
warning, particularly when accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias
Moussaoui was arrested a month later after acting suspiciously at a
Minnesota flight school. Feinstein, a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, also noted the CIA had issued a warning last
summer that there was a heightened risk of a terrorist attack on
Americans, possibly on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   "So there were two things out there that should have alerted" the
FBI, Feinstein said. "I think if it did drop between the cracks, I
think there is a serious problem, because if one thing drops, others
probably have as well."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, Feinstein said, should have at least attempted to see how
many Middle Eastern men had come into the country seeking flight
training, "to see where the visas came from, see how many visas are
out and where they are to people in similar circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators said Wednesday that the memo--and the
bureau's apparent failure to act on it--could become significant in
the ongoing effort to determine whether the FBI and the CIA failed in
not preventing the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who took over the agency a week before the attacks, said
it has used such "shortcomings" to revamp the bureau's
counter-terrorism operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we had followed those suggestions at that time, it would
not, given what we know since Sept. 11, have enabled us to prevent
the attacks of Sept. 11," Mueller said. "But in the same breath, I
should say that what we learned from instances such as that is much
about the weaknesses of our approach to counter-terrorism prior to
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   "In the future we have to be more proactive," Mueller said. "We
cannot wait until we have evidence of a crime having been committed,
but have to take what evidence we have and make predictive
observations to avoid the next attack."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said none of the Middle Eastern men under investigation in
Arizona who prompted the memo have been linked to the Sept. 11
attacks or to Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. But he said the bureau's
failure to respond to the memo underscored how the FBI needs to do a
better job of analyzing intelligence from its 56 U.S. field offices
and overseas and then acting on it.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Testifies He Knew of Abuse by Priest in '84</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bernard Law, in an extraordinary deposition for a
civil suit by alleged victims, says doctors told him cleric was not a
threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law testified Wednesday that he knew as early as
1984 that John J. Geoghan, then a priest in the Boston Archdiocese,
was having sexual encounters with young boys.</LD>
<LD>   "I was aware that there was involvement because ... of having
removed him out of one parish and putting him between assignments
before sending him back to another," Law said in an extraordinary
daylong deposition at Suffolk County courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying in a civil lawsuit brought by 86 alleged victims, Law
conceded that he recognized his signature on an attachment to a 1984
letter from a woman who said Geoghan had abused her sons and nephews.</LD>
<TE>   But again and again Wednesday, the cardinal said that he had no
recollection of the actual letter from Marge Gallant.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that to be absolutely amazing," said Mitchell Garabedian,
an attorney for the 86 alleged Geoghan victims.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't recall the letter even though the envelope said:
'Urgent,'" Garabedian said after Wednesday's questioning concluded.
"He just didn't recall Marge Gallant stating that her children were
being abused."</TE>
<TE>   It was Garabedian who forced the unusual interrogation of the
nation's senior Roman Catholic prelate. After the Boston Archdiocese
pulled out of a $15-million to $30-million settlement with his
clients last week, Garabedian demanded an immediate opportunity to
depose the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Law, who on at least four other occasions has failed to appear for
scheduled depositions, arrived by police escort Wednesday in a silver
limousine with darkened windows. A small crowd waited outside the
courthouse in the city's financial district, some carrying protest
signs aimed at the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan lawyer Wilson D. Rogers Jr., one of several attorneys who
accompanied Law on Wednesday, declined to comment on the day's
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In his black suit and clerical collar, Law looked grim as he
entered the courtroom. The cardinal has rebuffed calls for his
resignation in the face of a clerical sexual abuse scandal that has
shaken the Roman Catholic Church in the United States and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis erupted in January when the Boston Globe published
documents showing that church officials knew of Geoghan's long
pattern of molesting children. Rather than removing him from the
priesthood, the records revealed, church leaders simply placed
Geoghan in new parishes--where he continued to work with children.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan was convicted in January of a single count of child
molestation. He is serving a nine- to 10-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal escalated in April when other records were made
public, showing that the church also had protected Father Paul
Shanley, an alleged pedophile. Shanley, arrested last week in San
Diego, was arraigned here Monday on three counts of child rape.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, the Boston Archdiocese has provided prosecutors
with the names of close to 100 priests accused of sexual abuse over a
40-year period. More than 200 priests in the U.S. have resigned or
been suspended since the scandal surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 people have accused Geoghan of molesting them over a
30-year period in a series of Boston-area parishes. Garabedian spent
111/2 months crafting a settlement for 86 of those people, who agreed
to negotiate as a group.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms set by Superior Court Judge Constance M. Sweeney, one
of the alleged victims was permitted to attend Wednesday's deposition
of the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that the cardinal had some selective amnesia,"
33-year-old Mark Keane said. "He rattled off the names of streets
where he lived many years ago. But he could not remember receiving a
draft of a letter about Father Geoghan molesting young boys. I find
that hard to believe."</TE>
<TE>   The deposition was closed to the public. A videotape was made for
possible use at trial if Law were not available.</TE>
<TE>   A transcript of the day's testimony showed that the hearing began
with an objection from Rogers, who called "the inquiry into the inner
workings of the church" inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the ensuing testimony focused on what Law knew about
Geoghan--and when.</TE>
<TE>   Law became bishop of Boston, the nation's fourth-largest
archdiocese, in 1984. Although he said he did not recall reading
warning letters about Geoghan, Law did say that doctors told him the
priest was not a threat. Law also said he relied on advice from
subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that medical assurance was given," Law said. "Whether it
was subsequently put in writing and in an earlier form given orally,
I cannot say."</TE>
<TE>   But referring to correspondence about one of Geoghan's
reassignments, the cardinal said: "I can say, without a shadow of a
doubt, that this letter would never have been put before me for a
signature had we not had the assurance of someone competent ... that
this assignment was safe."</TE>
<TE>   Law also did not remember reading a letter from Bishop John
d'Arcy, his own secretary, who cautioned that Geoghan should not be
reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Garabedian said after the session ended, "he didn't
recall a whole lot about Father Geoghan."</TE>
<TE>   However, the cardinal acknowledged under oath that he recognized
pedophilia as both a sin and a serious problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I viewed this as a pathology, as a psychological pathology, as an
illness," he said. "Obviously I viewed it as something that had a
moral component. It was, objectively speaking, a gravely sinful act."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's deposition also probed into the workings of the
cardinal's finance council, a group of advisors from Boston's
business community. The cardinal said at Mass on Sunday that the
council had overruled him in voting to back out of the
multimillion-dollar lawsuit settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said that he had been informed that several of the 86
alleged victims had suicidal tendencies. "He said he knew this bad
news had hurt them," Garabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   The day's testimony also revealed that Law is simultaneously a
citizen of the United States, Vatican City and possibly Mexico, where
he was born.</TE>
<TE>   His status as a Vatican citizen means he could be protected there
if he were to leave the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Since today is a holy day of obligation, Ascension Thursday, Law
asked to be excused from continuing the deposition until Friday.
Sweeney agreed to extend the deposition at least until Monday, as
well. Future sessions will be held at the chancery.</TE>
<TE>   Keane, who said he made eye contact with the cardinal about 10
minutes into the deposition, said at first he found it intimidating
to be seated opposite the man who oversaw his alleged abuser.</TE>
<TE>   But Law, Keane said, "came off very soft-spoken. He's a good
talker."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Keane said he was skeptical. "Not to compare him to Father
Geoghan, but I have experienced a soft-spoken, good talker before,
and look where it got me."</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Decides to Kill Artillery System</HD>
<DH>Defense: Despite stiff opposition, the Pentagon chief
sticks to his drive to streamline the military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, confident that he has the
clout to overcome congressional opposition, said Wednesday that the
Pentagon would kill the $11-billion Crusader artillery system,
whether its supporters--who include key Republicans--like it or not.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing his decision to stop development of the 40-ton
howitzer, which critics say is emblematic of lumbering Cold War
weaponry, Rumsfeld insisted that it represents a critical step in his
efforts to streamline and modernize the military.</LD>
<LD>   "What's going to happen is we are going to do exactly what I said:
We're going to cancel the Crusader; we're going to make our case
persuasively with the Congress," Rumsfeld told reporters at the
Pentagon. "We will persuade as many people as we need, but not all,
given the nature of life. And it will end up being canceled."</LD>
<TE>   But by drawing public battle lines over the fate of the big gun,
Rumsfeld has set the stage for a pitched fight on Capitol Hill. The
artillery system has been an Army procurement priority--and a
potential boon to defense contractors in a number of states.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the House Armed Services Committee has ordered the
Pentagon not to cancel the Crusader before the program undergoes a
formal review next spring. Republicans on the Senate Armed Services
Committee plan to try to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that Rumsfeld win this, because it will set
the precedent on other tough decisions," said Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader announcement marked Rumsfeld's first cancellation of
a major weapon program, although others, including the Marine Corps'
V-22 Osprey hybrid helicopter-airplane, are said to be in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader is a heavy, self-propelled, rapid-fire cannon that
was to have entered service by 2008. The Army argued that it was
badly needed to replace the existing Paladin artillery system, which
is more than 40 years old and is inferior to heavy artillery used by
China, North Korea and others.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that the Crusader, in development since 1994, is too
heavy for the more nimble and mobile forces the administration is
seeking to craft in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   But the artillery system's fate has become emblematic of the
broader tensions between the military and the Pentagon's civilian
leadership on how the nation's armed forces should adapt to meet
post-Cold War challenges. Army Secretary Thomas E. White, a retired
general already under fire for his ties to Enron Corp. and for his
use of Pentagon planes while on personal business, drew Rumsfeld's
ire by pushing relentlessly to save the system from the ax.</TE>
<TE>   The unusually public battle between the Army and Rumsfeld's office
had appeared to place White's job in jeopardy this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, White sat near Rumsfeld at a news conference,
looking pained, as the Defense secretary made clear that White's
efforts had been in vain.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary has come to a decision, and the Army will work hard
to implement that decision. Full stop. Period," White said.</TE>
<TE>   The public announcement, and the appearance of White at his side
as he made it, appeared to be a move to reassert Rumsfeld's authority
within the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumsfeld being public about the Crusader means the issue has
expanded beyond the merits of Crusader itself and really begins to
involve the credibility of Rumsfeld and his team," said Andrew F.
Krepinevitch, executive director of the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, a nonpartisan defense think tank in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can't make this decision stick, it will be to some extent
because there was this public fight by the Army early on. So ... this
decision about the Crusader becomes about not just artillery but
about who's in charge at the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's leadership in the war against terrorism--and his
emergence as a Defense secretary so popular that giggling college
students jockey to have photos taken with him--has earned him a
formidable amount of political capital for his push to cancel the
Crusader.</TE>
<TE>   Conflicts loom over how many fighter jets and warships to buy, and
over the fate of other weapon systems that are in development.</TE>
<TE>   But despite his public bravado, Rumsfeld faces some formidable
foes.</TE>
<TE>   The cannon would be assembled in Elgin, Okla., a state whose
congressional delegation includes Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of
the House GOP conference, and Sen. Don Nickles, the assistant
Republican leader.</TE>
<TE>   And a White House lobbyist said he assumed that the fight for the
Crusader would extend beyond the Oklahoma delegation because parts of
the system would be built in dozens of states.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's announcement came just as the Senate Armed Services
Committee was drafting the year's defense authorization bill. Two
committee members said they expected to debate and vote on the issue
today.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) predicted a "big fight" over
the issue but said he was inclined to support the administration. He
wanted to "show some respect to the decision the secretary of Defense
has made."</TE>
<TE>   "He has made a tough decision," Lieberman said. "This is the first
gutsy decision made by Rumsfeld."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "it's difficult to stop any program that's
started."</TE>
<TE>   He said the timing was terrible--right in the middle of committee
debate--but "there are many innings left" in the legislative process.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if defeat on this would make it impossible for Rumsfeld to
get any military reform, Lieberman said, "I worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.), a Crusader supporter, predicted that
the artillery system would continue to be funded. "I think the votes
are going to be there to support the program."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld was unshaken about the opposition to his plan.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Panel Is Stymied in Missing Girl Case</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The head of the child welfare agency that lost track of a 5-year-old
girl refused Wednesday to discuss case details with a panel
investigating her department, citing confidentiality laws and the
criminal probe.</LD>
<LD>   Kathleen Kearney, head of Florida's Department of Children &amp;
Families, said the panel members could sign a confidentiality
agreement to view case files privately.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like nothing better than to have the records open to the
media, but I am also incredibly mindful of the confidentiality and
that we have a missing child," she said at the panel's first meeting.</LD>
<TE>   The governor's office and the state attorney general were trying
to work out how the panel could then discuss the case in private
without violating state laws governing open meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are trying to determine how Rilya Wilson vanished 15
months ago while in state custody. Detectives are treating her
disappearance as a possible homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Jeb Bush appointed the blue-ribbon panel Monday to assess
Kearney's department, its accountability and adequacy of agency
oversight. Bush wants their interim report May 20 and a final report
June 3 but panel members were all but stalled Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like every piece of information, but the privacy and
confidentiality issues and so on, we must respect," said David
Lawrence Jr., the panel's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney's department reported Rilya missing April 25, long after
losing contact with the girl. She was placed in state custody in
1996.</TE>

<HD>House to Back Nuclear Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House is poised to lend its support to the Bush administration's
revised nuclear arms strategy, which includes controversial proposals
to build smaller "battlefield" nuclear bombs and to consider the
development of nuclear-tipped missile defense interceptors.</LD>
<LD>   A vote is expected today on a defense authorization bill that
urges the administration to proceed with these plans, to accelerate
preparations for the resumption of nuclear testing and to develop a
broad plan for designing a new generation of nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The bill also urges the administration not to shrink its offensive
nuclear arsenal below the level of 1,700 operational warheads that is
the target of current U.S.-Russian arms discussions.</LD>
<TE>   While today's House vote is not binding, critics view it as
another part of a long-term campaign to build support for an agenda
they fear will make the use of nuclear weapons more likely.</TE>
<TE>   John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, a
Washington-based arms control organization, said the step is "another
building block in the effort toward revamping and building up nuclear
forces." House Armed Services Committee members who wrote the
language are trying to "move the most destructive weapons ever
invented back into the mainstream of security policy," he contended.</TE>
<TE>   A supporter of the new policy, Jack Spencer of the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, said he is pleased to see that
lawmakers "understand that it is important to make [nuclear policy]
more consistent with the international environment."</TE>
<TE>   In unveiling their approach in March, administration officials
argued that new threats from potential Third World adversaries made
it necessary to consider developing nuclear arms that would be more
effective in deterring the use of weapons of mass destruction,
including chemical or biological agents, against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the administration favor developing "bunker
busters"--smaller nuclear weapons that can reach the deeply buried
and hardened targets that regimes are increasingly using to shield
weapon stores and command posts.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals for such weapons have been controversial because of
critics' contentions that nuclear arms would no longer be viewed only
as weapons of last resort. This could cause other countries to
develop and use the nuclear weapons, they argue.</TE>
<TE>   Another lightning rod is the proposal to explore the use of
nuclear-tipped interceptor missiles as part of a missile defense
system.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say one advantage of such a system is that, unlike "hit
to kill" alternatives, it could destroy an incoming missile from
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion of an explosion that disperses radioactive material
through space is unsettling to many people, as well as politically
problematic. There are also technical issues, including whether the
electromagnetic pulse set off by such an explosion would destroy
radar and other electronic equipment on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has signaled that he would
like to at least explore the possible development of such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But some influential Republicans already have objected, including
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the ranking member of the defense
appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is planning to build a test complex in Alaska that
could be converted to use as an emergency missile defense system.</TE>

<LD>A man accused of killing a priest and a parishioner in a shooting
rampage at a Long Island church was arraigned Wednesday on a murder
charge that could bring the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Troy, 34, was charged with first-degree murder and with
attempted murder in the stabbing of a police officer during his
arrest. Prosecutors have four months to decide whether to seek the
death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Denis Dillon said prosecutors have yet to establish a
motive for the March 12 shootings of Father Lawrence Penzes, 50, and
Eileen Tosner, 73.</LD>

<HD>Ridge's Room With a View--of All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Dogged by questions about its readiness to meet the next terrorist
threat, the Office of Homeland Security opened its doors Wednesday to
showcase its new high-tech headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   The pulse of homeland security is housed inside a 38-acre naval
base on Nebraska Avenue in suburban Washington. Once a girls' school
that was taken over by the U.S. government during World War II, the
leafy complex is now home to 100 staffers from dozens of federal and
state agencies who are monitoring intelligence and standing by to
coordinate responses to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Within the compound, one facility beats the White House Situation
Room for equipment and space. With 10 50-inch television screens
lining the walls and dozens of burgundy leather chairs surrounding a
conference table, the Incident Management Room can handle a
videoconference among officials from as many as 40 federal, state and
local agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Like a movie set awaiting the actors, the Threat Monitoring Center
one floor up features desks set up in a grid, with signs overhead
designating each of the dozen agencies represented, from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Central Intelligence
Agency. The so-called bullpen is designed to operate 24/7, but during
the tour for a small group of reporters, the staff was said to be in
an "all hands" meeting. Nine clocks line the back wall; two are on
standby to track the time as staffers monitor any terrorist
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the Coordination Center, with four more
wide-screen wall televisions and a huge map of the United States.
Staffers sat in front of flat-screen computer monitors Wednesday as
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge discussed his job.</TE>
<TE>   "The response of governors and mayors and state legislators and
the League of Cities and the public sector, I think, has been
positive, supportive and encouraging," said Ridge, whose blueprint
for the office is due at the White House by July 1.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington has been a tougher sell than the rest of the
country, one reason is Congress. Concerned that the homeland security
director has control over a sizable budget, Congress has repeatedly
asked Ridge to testify. The White House does not want him to, arguing
that he is a confidential advisor to the president, not a Cabinet
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Then too there's the problem of access. In Washington, proximity
to power is counted in geographic units; an office next to the
president is better than one down the block. By some accounts, savvy
federal employees are hesitant to leave their offices in downtown
Washington to move 4.3 miles to a naval base. Officials admit they
are still 60 staffers short.</TE>
<TE>   Still, 4.3 miles is well within attack range of the White House,
and Ridge was asked why his agency did not choose instead to locate
in a secure bunker. Ridge explained that the government was in a
hurry. "There's a sense of urgency about this.... This was the best
and most immediate solution."</TE>
<TE>   Officials gave Wednesday's tour before, as one staff member put
it, "the curtain will fall" on public access. Staffers briefed on
background, leaving Ridge to go public with answers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the Incident Management Group was not activated last
week, when pipe bombs began showing up in Midwest mailboxes, Ridge
explained: "We didn't need to lead. The FBI did a phenomenal job."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the frustrations that have visited his effort-- such
as ridicule of its color-coded system of warning Americans about the
terrorist risk level from green (low alert) to red (severe)--Ridge,
sporting a purple tie, gritted his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not authorized to be frustrated," Ridge said. "I'm authorized
to be patient, and persistent. I'm both."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration signaled on Wednesday that it will help
school districts overcome legal obstacles that discouraged them from
creating single-sex public schools.</LD>
<LD>   Education Secretary Rod Paige said he wants to revise federal
regulations on single-sex education, giving the public 60 days to
comment on what sorts of programs should be allowed.</LD>
<LD>   Paige's move could pave the way for more single-sex schools and
classes, while removing the legal cloud that hangs over existing
ones.</LD>
<TE>   Only 10 single-sex public schools exist, with two more expected to
open this fall, according to Dr. Leonard Sax, a psychologist and
physician who heads the National Assn. for the Advancement of Single
Sex Public Education.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1972, Title IX has forbidden public school districts from
discriminating against any student on the basis of sex.</TE>
<TE>   Congress' education bill, approved last year and signed by
President Bush in January, clarified federal law on single-sex
schooling, saying school districts could receive federal funding for
single-sex schools if comparable coursework and facilities are
available to girls and boys.</TE>

<HD>House Backs Nuclear Dump Site</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The 306-117 vote is a victory for the nuclear
industry and a defeat for Nevada. Easy Senate approval of the Bush
plan is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Wednesday backed President Bush's decision to create a
national nuclear waste burial ground at Yucca Mountain, a major
victory for the nuclear power industry and a stinging defeat for
Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The 306-117 vote brought the federal government one critical step
closer to overriding Nevada's objections to placing up to 77,000 tons
of high-level nuclear waste in permanent storage at the proposed site
90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, one of the nation's fastest-growing
areas.</LD>
<LD>   The issue now moves to the Senate, where opponents of the Bush
plan face steep odds in trying to stop it.</LD>
<TE>   Though the outcome in the House was expected, the vote's margin
was significant. Almost half of the House Democrats joined most
Republicans in support of the administration.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, in a vote in early 2000, most Democrats opposed a
GOP-led effort to store nuclear waste temporarily at Yucca Mountain.
Then-President Clinton opposed the plan, and few House Democrats were
willing to break with his administration on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   But now a Republican is president--absorbing political brickbats
from Nevadans--and the nuclear energy industry is waging an all-out
campaign for the storage plan. Many Democrats say they agree that
highly radioactive waste piling up at 131 sites throughout the
country must be shipped somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately we have to address the problem," said Rep. John D.
Dingell of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce
Committee and one of those who switched to the industry position.</TE>
<TE>   Dingell noted that the vote is not the final step. If the Senate
approves the resolution, the Bush administration will then apply for
a site license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nevada also
will mount a legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, after the vote Nevadans vowed to keep fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue our battle in the U.S. Senate and on a parallel
track in the courts," said Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican. He said
Wednesday's vote was "by no means the end."</TE>
<TE>   Bush chose to move forward with the Yucca Mountain plan in
February on the recommendation of his Energy Department. In April,
Guinn reversed Bush's decision, using power the governor holds under
federal law. The House resolution, if also approved by the Senate,
would overturn Guinn's veto.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Yucca Mountain plan have a powerful leader, Sen.
Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the chamber's assistant majority leader. But
Reid and freshman Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) acknowledge that they
remain short of the votes they need to block the plan.</TE>
<TE>   A Senate vote is expected in June or July.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's House debate, Nevada lawmakers, as they have
before, complained bitterly that their state is being unfairly
targeted for nuclear waste. Congress first voted to focus federal
studies of nuclear storage on Yucca Mountain in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevadans noted that the state has no nuclear power plants.
"Nevada does not produce one ounce of nuclear waste," said Democratic
Rep. Shelley Berkley, who represents much of Las Vegas. "Yet Nevada
is being asked to carry the burdens of a problem it had no part in
creating."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also claimed that transcontinental shipments of nuclear
waste by truck or rail would be vulnerable to accidents or terrorist
attacks, a scenario they dub "mobile Chernobyl."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, said that aside from Nevada's home-state
concerns, the opposition "basically comes from those folks who oppose
nuclear energy."</TE>
<TE>   He ridiculed that line of argument, suggesting that opponents were
also opposed to expanding coal mining and oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder what sort of energy supplies do these folks
support," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   Many environmental groups lamented Wednesday's vote, while the
nuclear industry hailed it. The industry has spent millions of
dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions in recent years in an
effort to shed long-standing political constraints on its growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats and Republicans alike voted for this sensible approach
to centralizing the nuclear byproducts of our U.S. defense
applications, like nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines,
research programs, and nuclear power plants that produce electricity
for 20% of Americans," said Joe F. Colvin, president of the Nuclear
Energy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 102 Democrats joined 203 Republicans and one independent
in supporting the storage plan.</TE>
<TE>   Voting against it were 103 Democrats--including Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco--13 Republicans and one independent.</TE>
<TE>   Of California's 20 House Republicans, five broke with party ranks
to vote against the plan: Reps. Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley, Jerry
Lewis of Redlands, Howard P. "Buck" McKeon of Santa Clarita, Richard
W. Pombo of Tracy, and George P. Radanovich of Mariposa. Reps. Doug
Ose (R-Sacramento) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) did not vote.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the state's 32 House Democrats voted for the plan:
Reps. Calvin M. Dooley of Visalia and Ellen O. Tauscher of Alamo.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Tom Gorman in Las Vegas contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>No Raining on Buehrle's Parade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rain cost Mark Buehrle a shot at his first complete game of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Buehrle pitched seven sharp innings to become the American
League's first six-game winner, and Kenny Lofton hit a two-run double
as the Chicago White Sox defeated the Texas Rangers, 5-3, Wednesday
night at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Buehrle (6-2) gave up one run and four hits, striking out three
and walking two before rain interrupted play in the top of the eighth
for 61 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   White Sox Manager Jerry Manuel went to reliever Bob Howry when
play resumed because Buehrle's arm stiffened during the delay.</TE>
<TE>   "He had command of the strike zone," Manuel said. "He hits his
spots, studies the hitters, knows hitters' weaknesses, and makes him
hit his pitch. He had it rolling pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   After starting the season 4-0 with a 1.33 earned-run average in
his first four starts, Buehrle went 1-2 with a 7.31 ERA over his last
three starts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the best I've felt," Buehrle said. "I had
confidence in all my pitches. Maybe it was the best I've felt even
all of last year."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers had runners at first and second with one out in the
fifth, but Buehrle got Rusty Greer to ground into a double play.
Buehrle was perfect over his last two innings.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez and Tony Graffanino had two hits each for the
White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Perry hit a two-run homer off Keith Foulke in the ninth,
but Foulke struck out pinch-hitter Hank Blalock with a runner on to
end it.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago's three-run fifth, Ranger starter Doug Davis walked
Jose Valentin and Sandy Alomar to start the inning, then bobbled
Royce Clayton's bunt and threw late to second for an error. That
loaded the bases for Lofton's two-run double, and Graffanino followed
with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel has a lot of confidence in Lofton at the top of the order.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy that every at-bat is a good one," Manuel said. "And
when they have to come in on him, he has a great chance at a good
swing at it."</TE>
<TE>   Davis (3-3) gave up three runs and five hits in five-plus innings,
his shortest outing of the season. He struck out two and walked
three.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 12, Oakland 6--The streaking Red Sox won their season-high
eighth consecutive game while a streaker of another sort briefly
delayed their victory over the Athletics at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   A naked man ran onto the field with two outs in the bottom of the
ninth inning. The fan streaked from the third-base seats to right
field, where he was apprehended by a half-dozen security officers as
players on both teams laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Varitek homered and drove in five runs and Nomar Garciaparra
drove in four runs as the Red Sox improved to 16-2 on the road, the
best such start in the majors since the Detroit Tigers began 17-0 in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox finished with a season-high 19 hits.</TE>
<TE>   John Burkett (3-0), off to his best start in 10 years, gave up
three runs on four hits over six innings. He struck out five and
walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Johnny Damon tripled in the seventh inning to extend his
career-high hitting streak to 18 games, matching Chicago White Sox
first baseman Paul Konerko for the longest such streak in the majors
this season.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Tampa Bay 2--Alfonso Soriano homered twice at St.
Petersburg, Fla., as Roger Clemens and the Yankees extended the Devil
Rays' losing streak to 13 games--longest in the majors in more than
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens (5-2) earned his 285th career victory, moving ahead of
Ferguson Jenkins and into a tie for 24th place on the all-time list
with Tony Mullane.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's losing streak is the longest in the majors since the
Chicago Cubs dropped 14 in a row April 1-20, 1997. It's the longest
skid in the American League since the Milwaukee Brewers--no longer in
the AL--dropped 14 in a row in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Kansas City 1--Brad Radke pitched a five-hitter at
Minneapolis for the Twins' first complete game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Radke (4-2) held the Royals hitless before Neifi Perez's bloop
single with one out in the fifth inning. He was one out from his
seventh career shutout before Mike Sweeney doubled and Carlos Beltran
hit an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Affeldt (1-1), making his second big league start, gave up
one run and two hits in four innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Baltimore 2--Russell Branyan homered for the third
consecutive game and Jim Thome hit a three-run shot to lead the
Indians at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Danys Baez (4-3) gave up six hits in seven innings for the
Indians, who lost five consecutive series before taking two of three
against the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Toronto 4--John Olerud's fielder's choice in the bottom
of the 10th inning scored Ichiro Suzuki with the winning run as the
Mariners won at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Wells' sacrifice fly in the top of the ninth inning,
scoring Raul Mondesi, had tied the game at 4-4.</TE>

<HD>Glaus Homer Draws Final Conclusion</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His leadoff home run in the ninth gives Angels a
3-2 victory over the Tigers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels and Detroit Tigers played eight innings Wednesday and
settled nothing, so the Angels played their Troy cards as trump cards
in the ninth.</LD>
<LD>   Game over.</LD>
<LD>   Troy Percival struck out the side in the top of the inning, and
Troy Glaus hit the walkoff home run in the bottom of the inning,
powering the Angels to a 3-2 victory at Edison Field. As the Angels
rushed from their dugout to mob Glaus at home plate, their season
took on at least a hint of a championship glow.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels cannot fulfill October dreams without finishing ahead
of either the Seattle Mariners or the Oakland Athletics. For all the
talk about how far ahead the Mariners are in the American League
West, the Angels used their 10th victory in 12 games to climb within
a half-game of the A's for second place in the division.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were sitting at 6-14, we were just trying to scratch out
of a hole," Percival said. "We've scratched ourselves out of it, and
now it's time to move on."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers will get better, but for now the difference between the
teams is this: In the ninth inning of a 2-2 tie, the Angels used
Percival, a four-time All-Star who struck out the side on a 96-mph
fastball, a 97-mph fastball and an 81-mph curve.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the inning, the Tigers used Fernando Rodney, 21,
making his second major league appearance. Glaus, leading off the
inning, worked the count full, then fouled off an off-speed pitch and
appeared disgusted with himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obviously ball four, and I didn't lay off of it," Glaus
said. "I was trying to get on base and cause some kind of havoc."</TE>
<TE>   Havoc ensued, on the next pitch. Why settle for a walk when you
can hit a game-winning home run? Glaus hit it, circled the bases and
returned to a rowdy welcoming committee led by the on-deck hitter,
Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to the plate and made sure he touched it," Spiezio said.
"Then I mashed him on the helmet."</TE>
<TE>   Said Glaus: "I was trying to get up so I could take my helmet off.
When you take your helmet off, they're not going to hit you any
more."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' home run, his sixth of the season and first at home, capped
an Angel evening that included sterling pitching, errorless defense
and clutch hitting in the late innings.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to blow everybody out every day," starter Kevin
Appier said. "You have to find ways to win the games that can go
either way. That's what you see with the great teams."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got a home run from Garret Anderson and another
terrific start from Appier, who limited the Tigers to two runs over
seven innings and lowered his earned-run average to 2.83. He extended
his streak of consecutive scoreless innings to 172/3--the longest by
an Angel starter since Chuck Finley in 1998--before the Tigers nicked
him for single runs in the sixth and seventh innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' sluggish offense prompted discussion of a statistical
anomaly. For the most part, the Angels have pitched pretty well home
and away this season, with an ERA of 3.91 at Edison Field and 4.19 on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   But the disparity on offense is gaping.</TE>
<TE>   In 17 home games, the Angels are batting .230 and scoring 3.6 runs
per game. In 15 road games, they're batting .298 and scoring 6.5 runs
per game.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia regarded the disparity as nothing more
than a blip, not only because the season is in its sixth week but
because of how unmercifully the Angels pounded pitching in Cleveland
and Toronto last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we were swinging the bats on the road trip, we could have
been playing on the moon and we still would have been scoring runs,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably more, because there's no gravity on the moon."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' home run barely cleared the fence. Detroit's Bobby
Higginson leaped for the ball and insisted it glanced off his glove
before landing in the left-field pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   On the moon, of course, the ball would have gone a lot farther.</TE>
<TE>   "Easily into the Mars pavilion," Scioscia said.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Salmon's Pace Is Worse Than Even Last Year's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon passed the 100 at-bat milepost Wednesday, and his
statistics are no better this season than they were last season.</LD>
<LD>   He hit .180 in his first 100 at-bats this year, with three home
runs, 15 runs batted in and 18 walks. He hit .240 in his first 100
at-bats last year, with four homers, 12 RBI and 22 walks, en route to
the worst season of his career. He and the team attributed that
miserable season largely to injuries, but he says he is sound this
season, and Manager Mike Scioscia insists Salmon's strength and bat
speed are much improved.</LD>
<LD>   "Confidence is a big part of the equation with Tim," Scioscia
said. "But it's a Catch-22: You need the hits to get confidence, and
you need the confidence to get hits."</LD>
<TE>   Said General Manager Bill Stoneman: "I think it will happen for
him. But baseball is a production business, and players are there to
produce. We're looking for that from Tim as well as from everybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon's contract makes him virtually impossible to trade, even
for a minor leaguer. The Angels owe him $9.25 million this year and
$28.75 million over the next three years, so their only hope would be
to trade the 33-year-old for a similarly paid and similarly
unproductive player.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be Darren Oliver for Carl Everett. If he goes, it would
be that kind of deal," said an executive from another major league
club, referring to the mutual salary dump between the Boston Red Sox
and Texas Rangers last December.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said the Angels can't afford to add to a player payroll
already at a team-record $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent beyond what we thought we were going to spend early on,
to get [Brad] Fullmer and [Aaron] Sele," Stoneman said. "We're
probably as high as we're going to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are not presently trying to trade Salmon, several
sources said. Scioscia dropped him back to seventh in the batting
order Wednesday and again removed him from right field and used him
as the designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say I'm getting used to it," Salmon said, "but from an
approach standpoint it's not going to mess me up. It's not like I'm
hitting great either way."</TE>

<LD>New York Met reliever John Franco will miss at least the rest of the
season with an injury to his left elbow that could end his 18-year
career.</LD>
<LD>   Franco, who has not pitched since undergoing surgery on the elbow
in December, had an MRI exam Wednesday that revealed the ligament and
tendon injury.</LD>
<LD>   Franco, 41, was brought to tears when he was given the news before

<HD>Perez Keeps Ball Rolling</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Left-hander goes eight strong innings against his
former team and Gagne shuts the door on 3-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves can only hope history does not judge them poorly
for trading Odalis Perez to the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   The present certainly isn't shaping up well for them.</LD>
<LD>   The young left-hander showed the Braves what they're missing
Wednesday night in another masterful performance, dominating his
former club in a 3-1 victory to help the Dodgers take the first two
games of a three-game series.</LD>
<TE>   Perez (4-1) made a triumphant return to Turner Field a night after
left fielder Brian Jordan--traded with Perez for Gary Sheffield in
January--hit two home runs in a 6-5, 16-inning victory.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up five hits and the one run in eight innings while
earning his fourth consecutive victory, frustrating the Braves and a
crowd of 22,163 after overcoming uncharacteristic control problems in
the first inning. Atlanta starter Kevin Millwood (2-4) pitched seven
solid innings, but he needed to be much better with his former
teammate on a roll.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves were impressed--Sheffield in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "The only differences I see are that he uses his fastball more,
and he uses it inside more," the former Dodger said. "I think that
when he was here, [management] wanted him to pitch away more like Tom
Glavine. As good of a changeup as he has, it just makes his fastball
even more effective."</TE>
<TE>   Perez continued his impressive streak in the place his career
began, prompting some to wonder: Do the Braves already rue the day
they let Perez get away?</TE>
<TE>   "I won't answer that question," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.
"We're very happy to have him, obviously, and we're also very happy
to have our left fielder, but they got a hell of a baseball player
from us too."</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly eager to face his first team, Perez walked two in the
first before regaining his composure with the help of pitching coach
Jim Colborn and catcher Paul Lo Duca. Perez set the tone from that
point with pinpoint accuracy, controlling both sides of the plate and
the Braves in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne also had a good night, rebounding from his first
blown save Tuesday by blowing away the Braves in the ninth. Gagne
struck out the side for his 11th save in 12 chances, getting Wes
Helms for the Dodgers' fifth consecutive road victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who lead the league in hitting into double plays, hit
into three more Wednesday, including two by Shawn Green. However,
Green also increased the Dodgers' 1-0 lead to 3-0 in the fifth with a
two-out, two-run, bases-loaded single.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek staked Perez to a lead in the second, extending
his season-high hitting streak to seven games, and Perez and Gagne
gave the tired bullpen a break after Tracy used six pitchers in
Tuesday's 5-hour 19-minute game. Of course, it all started with
Perez, and that's a familiar theme these days.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid has been unbelievable," Lo Duca said. "Realistically, he
could be [7-0]. He's thrown well every start, he should have had a
perfect game and you can't say enough about him--especially today.
After a 16-inning game, for him to go eight innings and give our
bullpen a rest makes it even better.</TE>
<TE>   "The first inning, he was a little excited. He was too pumped up
because he's throwing against his former team and he wants to show
them what they're missing. He settled down after he got through that
inning. He's been phenomenal all year and he's only 23. Incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who threw 62 strikes in 96 pitches, had only three walks in
461/3 innings spanning his first six starts. He doubled his total
Wednesday and knew the reason.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw the way I've been pitching since the beginning of the
season, my approach was the same, but I was excited to be facing my
ex-team in the first inning," he said. "But after that I was OK."</TE>
<TE>   That's as far as Perez would go about his first encounter with the
Braves, preferring to take the high road.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say nothing bad about the Braves," he said. "They're a
great team and they gave me the opportunity to be in the big leagues.
I'm comfortable [with the Dodgers] and I just want to keep doing what
I'm doing."</TE>

<HD>Mulholland Going Through 'Rough Spell'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Manager Jim Tracy and pitching Jim Colborn said they still have
confidence in struggling left-hander Terry Mulholland, who did not
pitch in Tuesday's 6-5, 16-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers used six pitchers in the 5-hour 19-minute marathon.
Right-hander Giovanni Carrara worked five scoreless innings, giving
up two hits, and Jesse Orosco pitched the final inning to nail down
his first save since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   And Mulholland?</LD>
<TE>   "Trace and I have real confidence in him, and [Tuesday's game]
wasn't an indication of anything," Colborn said. "The fact that
Giovanni had so few pitches allowed him to pitch five innings and
keep potentially our most effective pitcher in the game longer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we would have used Terry, say we would have pinch-hit for Gio,
and then we've got to pinch-hit hit for Terry, then you've got one
inning left from Jesse Orosco. We had to keep the possibility of
playing even more innings. ... We had to be prepared if that
happened."</TE>
<TE>   However, Mulholland's shaky performance has affected the bullpen
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-year veteran has a 10.80 earned-run average without a
decision. Mulholland has given up 21 hits--including seven home
runs--and 14 earned runs in 112/3 innings, and opponents are batting
.382 against him.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland had a 5.83 ERA in 19 games for the Dodgers last season
after being acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 31. He has a
salary of $3 million this season in the final year of a two-year,
$6-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a rough spell," Colborn said. "But our attitude is,
based on his career, that we know what to expect from him [over an
entire season]. Now the rest is up to us to give him enough chances
for him to find himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll get his time. It's been hard now, but he's going to play an
important part before we're done. He'll be a hero before it's all
over."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One night after suffering his first blown save, closer Eric Gagne
rebounded by striking out the side swinging to nail down his 11th in
a 3-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne gave up a two-out solo home run to Gary Sheffield in the
ninth Tuesday on a 96-mph fastball, and has fastball was clocked at
97 mph Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he's still a very young guy, and he got a lesson
taught to him by a premier player in this league," Tracy said of the
Gagne-Sheffield battle. "He rebounded very nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gagne: "You can't throw a pitch hard enough that Sheff can't
catch up with."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Has Fun in Exhibition</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Schmid is able to play youngsters in 2-1 victory
over CSD Municipal at Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid expected an exciting game in his team's
exhibition against CSD Municipal of Guatemala, the kind of contest in
which "artistry" takes precedence over thuggery.</LD>
<LD>   He also looked forward to getting his younger players some quality
playing time.</LD>
<LD>   Schmid got it all Wednesday night in the Galaxy's 2-1 victory over
the Rojos in front of 8,524 at the Rose Bowl, improving the Galaxy's
record to 19-8-10 in international play.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just happy we won in regulation," said Schmid, whose team
had played 10 consecutive overtime games. "But I wasn't pleased with
our finishing. I thought we had chances again early that we didn't
take advantage of."</TE>
<TE>   In a rough-and-tumble match that had one red card ejection and
five yellow card warnings, Galaxy rookie forward Carlos Ruiz, who
spent six of his previous seven seasons with Municipal, played only
the first half and did not score. He was, however, involved in the
most physical play of the night.</TE>
<TE>   In the 12th minute, Municipal forward Sergio Guevara was issued a
red card by referee Kevin Stott after Guevara took Ruiz down with a
vicious slide tackle from behind.</TE>
<TE>   The Rojos, an 18-time league champion that is dominating its
Torneo Clausura (closing tournament) at 12-0-2 with 52 goals, took a
1-0 lead in the 30th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Following a free kick by Guillermo Ramirez that was passed from
Isreal Donis to Mario Acevedo, Municipal forward Juan Carlos Plata
converted the header pass from Acevedo. Plata's short, left-footed
kick from just outside of the keeper's box eluded Galaxy goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy tied it up in the 51st minute.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Farrell, who was called up from the Galaxy's A-league
affiliate, the Seattle Sounders, for the exhibition, headed in a long
pass from Adam Frye for the score from about 12 yards out. Farrell
entered the game as a substitute at the start of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Moreno, 22, made the most of a rare start when he
emerged from the pack to head in a free kick by Alex Bengard, 23, in
the 70th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Jesus Ochoa, 21, also started for the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy announced that it would play another international
exhibition on May 29 at the Rose Bowl against Aguila of El Salvador.
Aguila is a 10-time national champion.</TE>

<HD>Woods' Advantage Is an Open Secret</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What is 7,214 yards long and eats golfers? Yes, it's Bethpage Black
at Farmingdale, N.Y., where the 101st U.S. Open will be played
beginning June 13. It's a public course, which means that depending
on the conditions, there may be some players publicly embarrassed out
there.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to be hitting more than wedges in there," said Rees
Jones, who restored the course and beefed it up to normal USGA
specifications. That would be narrow fairways, rock-hard greens and
very long par fours.</LD>
<LD>   With Tiger Woods going for the second leg of a potential Grand
Slam, Jones says Bethpage Black might play right into Tiger's paws.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, he hasn't been there, but I know he's aware of the course,"
Jones said. "It sets up very well for him, I think. It's got lots of
par fours and he can hit driver when he wants to, not like last year
at Southern Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me just say this: It won't be a course where he has to fall
back a lot. So I think it favors the long hitters, Tiger chief among
them."</TE>
<TE>   Two of Bethpage Black's par-four holes will be the two longest in
the history of the U.S. Open: the 499-yard 12th is No. 1 and the
492-yard 10th is No. 2. There's also the 489-yard par-four seventh,
which used to be a par five, but is now the fifth-longest par four
the Open has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   The fairways will be only 26 to 28 yards wide, said Jones, who
also said the greens don't have a lot of contour and that may
actually make them play tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "The pros can read the severe contours easy, but these greens are
going to be so fast, I think they're going to have to try to hit it
through the hole. But if you miss, you're going to have a lot of
three- or four-footers coming back."</TE>
<TE>   All right, that's the bad news. The good news, according to Jones,
is that long hitters are probably going to be able to hit driver on
10 of the 14 holes where driver is an option. The exceptions are the
430-yard first, the 389-yard second, the 408-yard sixth and the
411-yard 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is an expert in remodeling courses to stage the U.S. Open
and Bethpage Black is his sixth. The others are Brookline, Baltusrol,
Congressional, Pinehurst No. 2 and Hazeltine.</TE>
<TE>   "Bethpage is definitely a long golf course, so the modern
equipment will not overwhelm it," he said. "The back nine has four
really quite difficult par fours."</TE>
<TE>   The 10th has bunkers on both sides of the fairways and a small,
elevated green with a swale in front and bunkers protecting entry.</TE>
<TE>   The 12th is a sharp dogleg left with a 235-yard carry over a huge
cross bunker and a two-tiered green.</TE>
<TE>   The 15th is a 459-yard par four and it may be the toughest hole,
with a second shot to a small green on a hillside 50 feet above the
fairway that slopes from the back left to the front right and
protected by bunkers in front.</TE>
<TE>   The 16th is a 479-yard par four with an elevated tee and a narrow
fairway that angles to the right, although the best entrance to the
green is on the left. The green has deep bunkers in front and beside
it, and it slopes right to left.</TE>
<TE>   Unless it rains and the course gets softened, Jones says the
scores may be high.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like five over," he said. "But eight or nine under if
it's wet."</TE>
<TE>   David Fay, the USGA's executive director, believes it would be
wise for the players to see the course before they tackle it at the
Open.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to decide to come in a little early or
prove to be quick studies," Fay said. "For the most part, it's
unknown to all these players. No one is going in there with a
home-court advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Open, 2008 Style</TE>
<TE>   The USGA is expected to announce the 2008 U.S. Open site June 12
at Bethpage Black, and Riviera Country Club and Torrey Pines at La
Jolla are regarded in most circles as the prime candidates, although
Pumpkin Ridge near Portland, Ore., also is mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the USGA has fallen in love with the idea of staging
the Open on a public course, which it is doing at Bethpage, so Torrey
Pines would fit into its new of-the-people philosophy. If Riviera is
chosen, it would make sense, at least historically, because 2008
marks the 60th anniversary of Ben Hogan's victory in the 1948
Open--the only time it was staged at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   However, weighting the significance of such a factor, Fay isn't
impressed by the merits of the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't buy into the importance of anniversaries," he said. "It's
like you say, 'That's nice,' then you move on. It doesn't have any
lasting effect. Now, if it's the 100th anniversary of something, then
you try to do something special."</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the Riviera people are hopeful. Michael Yamaki,
corporate officer in the office of the president at Riviera, says he
is relaxed and confident after a series of visits by USGA
championship committee officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Logistics issues have been resolved and I have not heard any
questions about the condition of the course," he said. "One of the
real issues is whether L.A. is too laid back for a championship.
Well, we've hosted the Olympics, Super Bowls, NBA championships. When
we're hosting the Big Show, L.A. is really the place. But it has to
be the main event."</TE>
<TE>   Fay emphasized that there is no front-runner and said the loser in
2008 could end up a winner eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever club doesn't get it, it doesn't mean we won't go there
in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Open</TE>
<TE>   As long as we're on the subject of majors, the British Open is
coming up in only eight weeks at Muirfield in Scotland. The 131st
Open will be the first since 1992 at Muirfield, where only two holes
have been lengthened since Nick Faldo's victory 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The main features of the course, which is expected to play 7,034
yards, is that the fairways and greens may be a shade on the brown
side and that the rough is going to be a very bad place to hit a
ball.</TE>
<TE>   According to officials, the first cut of rough will be three
yards, then three more yards of long grass that hasn't been cut in
two months but you can still see your ball, and then the hay, where
you can't see much of anything below your waist.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Woods will make about $61.5million from his endorsements this
year, including $20million from Nike, according to an estimate by
Newsday.</TE>
<TE>   More Tiger</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, a winning bidder on eBay paid $425,000 to play
a round of golf with Woods. Last month, Charles Barkley paid $200,000
to play a round with Woods. Now, there are four chances to play with
Woods for free.</TE>
<TE>   Two "magic tickets" are hidden in packs of Upper Deck golf trading
cards and two more winners will be randomly selected from online
entries.</TE>
<TE>   One More Tiger</TE>
<TE>   News item: American Express puts Woods' image on a credit card in
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Fuzzy thinking. People don't want Woods' image on a
credit card; they want Woods' credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Golf Digest's announcement of plans to distribute
25,000 "Be Nice to Monty" buttons comes two days after Colin
Montgomerie fired Alastair McLean, his caddie for the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: There's probably going to be one extra.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Daly</TE>
<TE>   News item: John Daly said he was hospitalized briefly last week
because of an allergic reaction to diet pills after his left leg went
numb for six hours and he lost some feeling in his left hand. Doctors
tell him he should quit smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Daly is playing the Benson &amp; Hedges International Open
this week in England.</TE>
<TE>   Blooming Rose</TE>
<TE>   Remember Justin Rose, who was fourth as a 17-year-old at the 1998
British Open, then turned pro and nearly fell off the map? Rose made
23 cuts in 28 European Tour events last year and was second twice,
but after last week's victory in the Chunichi Crowns tournament at
Aichi, Japan, he has already won three times this year--on three
tours.</TE>
<TE>   Verplunked</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the worst driver on the PGA Tour was Scott Verplank when
he hit fairways 42.1% of the time. Verplank was injured and diagnosed
with diabetes. The most accurate driver on the PGA Tour this year is
Verplank, wearing an insulin pump, hitting 81.4% of the fairways,
proving that good health is never overrated.</TE>
<TE>   Business News</TE>
<TE>   Delta Airlines says that after Wednesday, it won't allow
passengers to check clubs in soft golf bag travel covers unless it
boxes them for a $10 fee. That was interesting news, because Delta is
the first airline with such a policy, but for Club Glove of
Huntington Beach, there was more. Delta also named the company's
soft-sided cases with reinforced bases as the only exception to the
rule.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely been raising a lot of eyebrows," said Jeff
Herold, president of West Coast Trend's Club Glove, which makes bags
for an estimated 95% of the PGA Tour pros.</TE>
<TE>   More Business News</TE>
<TE>   In cost-cutting moves with far-reaching implications, Acushnet
Company (with Titleist, FootJoy and Cobra brands) pulled out of the
2003 PGA Merchandise Show and announced it will not renew endorsement

<HD>TVG Handle Increases 254% From a Year Ago</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The start of Hollywood Park's spring-summer meet combined with the
Kentucky Derby, an advertising blitz and increased exposure on cable
television has led to a surge in business for the Television Games
Network.</LD>
<LD>   Between April 25 and May 4, TVG, which services bettors who prefer
to wager over the phone or on-line from home, signed up more than
7,500 new subscribers and handled more than $8 million--a 254%
increase from the same time period last year, when account wagering
was not legal in California.</LD>
<LD>   Last Saturday, when War Emblem posted his 20-1 surprise in the
Kentucky Derby, TVG handled $2.8 million in bets, 200% more than it
had a year earlier when Monarchos won the Derby.</LD>
<TE>   "We actually did better than we imagined," said Mark Wilson,
president and chief executive officer of TVG. "We're happy that our
customer service and wagering systems successfully handled the major
spike in our business.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get any complaints from our fan base and the average
wait time on Derby day to speak to a live operator was about two
minutes, and that's quite good."</TE>
<TE>   Available regularly only on the DISH Network and Adelphia digital
cable systems, TVG has been seen more widely since the beginning of
Hollywood Park on Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2. There are at
least two hours of coverage on the cable network each racing day.</TE>
<TE>   "The response has been terrific," Wilson said. "It's worked as we
hoped it would and it's been quite a helpful tool for attracting
subscribers."</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of the meet, TVG's handle on the races from
Hollywood Park has been increasing. The lowest handle was $161,158 on
April 24, the second day of the meet. But even that was higher than
what was bet at all of California's inter-track sites other than
Santa Anita, Del Mar and Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   On Derby Day, $345,926 was handled on the Hollywood Park races,
compared to $24,761 a year ago. The average through the first nine
days of the meet was a little more than $284,000. A year ago, the
average during the corresponding period was a little more than
$21,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on our way to the best quarter in the short history of this
company," Wilson said. "The numbers illustrate the remarkable growth
that TVG is capable of delivering and reflect a number of very
positive developments for the company this year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, fourth in the Kentucky Derby, will have a new
rider in the Preakness on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, the nation's leading jockey, will take over for
Laffit Pincay Jr. in the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico.</TE>
<TE>   An upset winner of the San Felipe Stakes in his first start for
trainer Bobby Frankel and owner Ed Gann, Medaglia d'Oro was second in
the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct last month, then broke slowly and had
traffic trouble in the 18-horse Derby five days ago. At the wire, he
was really the only horse showing some late interest as he checked in
eight lengths behind wire-to-wire winner War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Bailey replaced Victor Espinoza on Congaree in the
Preakness after the colt finished third in the Kentucky Derby.
Congaree again finished third in the Preakness, beaten by stablemate
Point Given and A P Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Danthebluegrassman, a surprise entrant then a late scratch from
the Kentucky Derby, won't be running in the $500,000 Lone Star Derby
on Saturday at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Scratched from the Derby because of muscle cramps,
Danthebluegrassman apparently hasn't recovered to the satisfaction of
trainer Bob Baffert, so he will not run in the Grade III, which is
expected to have a large field.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mike Pegram, Danthebluegrassman has won three of eight.
In his most recent race, he was last at nearly 13-1 in the Santa
Anita Derby.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Snowflake arrived in the United States late last year, the
Irish-bred filly was a maiden with 11 losses.</LD>
<LD>   One of the defeats, however, came in a Group I. She was second in
the Nassau Stakes on Aug. 4 at Goodwood in England, beaten 11/2
lengths by Lailani at 25-1. Lailani later came to this country, won a
Grade I at Belmont Park, then was the beaten favorite in the
Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf.</LD>
<LD>   Three races into her U.S. career, Snowflake is no longer a maiden.
She hasn't lost since joining the Ron McAnally barn.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Robert and Janice McNair's Stonerside Stable, the
4-year-old Caerleon filly will seek her fourth consecutive victory in
today's seventh at Hollywood Park. An optional claimer at 11/16 miles
on the turf, the $58,000 race is part of a pick six that has a
carryover of $102,812.</TE>
<TE>   Snowflake made her American debut Feb. 10, winning a sprint down
the Santa Anita hillside by 21/2 lengths. She returned in March to
win an allowance at a mile by a neck at 17-10, then overcame trouble
to win at a mile as the 7-10 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Thunderello, a 3-year-old son of Montbrook, will
make his first start this year in today's seventh at Belmont Park. In
his two races in 2001, Thunderello was a close second to Mayakovsky,
then broke his maiden by 141/4 lengths Sept. 1 at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Steve Specht. The trainer has won with eight of 22
starters at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's 10th at Churchill Downs. The 13
original entrants are a combined 0 for 47.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Heavenly Reign and
Discover Me in the first, singling Continental Miss in the second and
using Topaz Jewel, the entry of Star Nine-Elite Nine, Alpine Singer,
America's Princess and Legend In Disguise.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/26. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $4.80/$137.40. Total money bet: $190.</TE>

<DH>Saku Koivu Came Back From Abdominal Cancer to Lead the
Montreal Canadiens Into the Second Round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs,
Making Him This Season's...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Saku Koivu's handshake is firm, the grip of a vital, confident
athlete in his prime. The Finnish center's grip on life is strong
too, a gift he will never again take for granted.</LD>
<LD>   What he thought was food poisoning when he became ill during a
transatlantic flight last September was diagnosed as intra-abdominal
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma--cancerous cells in his abdomen. With
frightening suddenness, the Montreal Canadiens' captain was thrown
into a life of needle sticks, hospital beds and chemotherapy
treatments. Days he lost his hair and was too weak to sit up.</LD>
<LD>   Days he wondered on which side of the 50-50 survival equation he'd
fall.</LD>
<TE>   "When the doctor told me, it was kind of like everything stopped,"
he said. "I felt like I was by myself for a moment. When you find out
something like that, it's a shocking moment. It takes time to go
through it and get used to the idea you have something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Although his teammates rallied around him, the ultimate team
player had to take this journey alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he tries to relate it to other guys because other
guys can't relate to what he's gone through," defenseman Sheldon
Souray said. "But when he speaks, people listen, because he's been
through a lot.</TE>
<TE>   "The courage and the character he has, all of us wish we have what
he has."</TE>
<TE>   In September, Koivu was wondering if he would die. Hockey was an
afterthought. Today he leads the Canadiens in playoff scoring with 10
points and Montreal leads the Carolina Hurricanes, 2-1, in an Eastern
Conference semifinal series which resumes tonight at the Molson
Centre. "It's just magical," Souray said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Koivu, the Canadiens have become sentimental favorites
this spring. A late-season surge got them the last conference playoff
berth, and a gritty, relentless effort enabled them to upset the
top-seeded Boston Bruins in the first round. But no playoff victory
can match Koivu's triumph in returning to the lineup April 9, seven
months after his world turned upside down.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always times when you're by yourself and you think, 'Is
he doing OK?'" defenseman Craig Rivet said. "Once you have cancer, I
think you're always going to be concerned. But right now, he looks
great. He looks strong physically and mentally, and we're happy to
have him back. He's a big inspiration to a lot of people, especially
to our hockey club."</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't have come back to be a cheerleader. He has been
aggressive, involved, spirited, as always. In the first round, his
three-point performance and fiery speech during a timeout rallied the
Canadiens from a two-goal deficit in the third period of Game 3 to a
5-3 victory, and he assisted on both goals in Montreal's 2-1
series-clinching victory. He never ceases to amaze his teammates,
especially those who saw him at his lowest ebb.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," Rivet said. "Right from the first chemo
session, when he was violently, violently ill. For the first one, he
basically had to lie in a room with the lights off because it hurt
his eyes and had headaches that were so strong.</TE>
<TE>   "To where he is now, strong, fit, you look at him and he's back to
his old self. He's kidding, joking, wrestling, the whole works. It's
really a wonderful story."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, Koivu blends in with the throng in the Canadiens'
locker room. Like most, he has a scraggly playoff beard. He wears
showy, high-tech athletic shoes. Even his bristly blond hair, growing
back rapidly after the chemotherapy, doesn't look odd among an array
of hairstyles.</TE>
<TE>   But he is not like his teammates, as much as he wants to be.</TE>
<TE>   He joked that surviving cancer means "I can say whatever I want
now and they're just going to listen. They can't say anything bad."
In truth, he wants respect, not pity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they see me differently now, and it's normal," said
Koivu, a 1993 Montreal draft pick who has been a fan favorite since
his 1995 NHL debut.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time, I hope they see me as a teammate, as one of
the players, and as a friend, and not as a person that had cancer. I
want to get back to a normal life. I want to get back to the things I
used to do and be treated the way I used to be."</TE>
<TE>   That he would be playing hockey again so soon seemed impossible
after he heard his diagnosis and began the debilitating treatments.
"I don't think you can pick one thing that was the worst," he said.
"I was really sick at the beginning, and those days were physically
the toughest. Some days you just don't feel good. It's a long
battle."</TE>
<TE>   When he visited the Molson Centre for the Canadiens' home opener
in October "he was pretty fragile," Souray said. When he began to
feel better and got doctors' approval to work out, teammates were
delighted to see him but didn't dare hope he would return this
season. He had always been upbeat, but they knew he'd have to regain
the muscle tone, stamina and 20 pounds he had lost.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was going through it, I just thought of him being happy
and healthy and not worrying about if he was ever going to play for
us again," Rivet said. "I just wanted him to live a long and happy
life....</TE>
<TE>   "When you sat at home alone at night and you're thinking, you're
very nervous and scared. But when you were with him, you just knew
the guy was going to get through it. You couldn't see it go any other
way."</TE>
<TE>   Being at the rink accelerated Koivu's psychological healing. For
the physical aspects, he worked with trainer Chris Carmichael, who
helped Tour de France cycling champion Lance Armstrong regain his
fitness after testicular cancer.</TE>
<TE>   When the chemo ended and he was told he was in remission, he was
afraid to tempt fate and pinpoint a date for his return. "You never
know what you might face the next day," said Koivu, who has blood
tests every few weeks and will undergo comprehensive tests after the
season. "You don't want to get your hopes too high."</TE>
<TE>   His hopes were realized, and he returned to a roaring ovation with
three games left in the season. Although his strength hasn't fully
returned and he lost some of the adrenaline that carried him through
his first few games, he takes hits and gives them, asking no favors
and getting none. "I know they're not going to treat me any different
than the other guys," he said of opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he is different. Unlike them, he wonders if cancer will
bedevil him again.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you do think about it. Sometimes when things are going
really good," he said. "I'm sure when time goes on, you learn to live
with that....</TE>
<TE>   "I have a huge experience in my life, which, if you haven't gone
through it, you don't know what it means. You have to go through it
and see what it is. It's something I'm going to have with me the rest
of my life. It made me a different person. I do appreciate small
things more. Small adversity or one bad game is not going to ruin my
day.... Every game is special to me right now."</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS : SERIES REPORT/ LAKER
REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jackson Has an Official View on Calls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers did not approve of the officiating over parts of Game 2 by
referees Dan Crawford, Bill Spooner and Ted Bernhardt.</LD>
<LD>   While that's a tired NBA story seemingly told by every losing
team, Coach Phil Jackson has developed a method to it.</LD>
<LD>   Take Wednesday's observations, given over the course of 10 to 15
minutes:</LD>
<TE>   On another atrocious first half by the Lakers: "We came out
aggressive and the referees wouldn't let us play that way and [we]
got ourselves in trouble to start the game."</TE>
<TE>   On San Antonio's defense: "The second quarter, there were three
blocked shots by [Tim] Duncan. Two of them might have been fouls, but
he is the MVP player, so he is going to get a few leniencies here and
there.... The second momentum burst was when they got their phony
timeout play. That was a violation, but they got away with it.''</TE>
<TE>   On the end-of-game traveling call against Kobe Bryant: "I don't
think that's a violation that Kobe was called for. You can't grab
your own shot, but that's a fumble. They let guys do that all the
time in the NBA.... I'm very confused with that call.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the night went I'm not amazed by it, but I'm surprised
they made that call as many things as they let go on.''</TE>
<TE>   On Bryant shooting two free throws in Game 2, and the Spurs
getting five more free-throws in the series: "Some of it is taking it
to the basket and being more productive at the basket. Not that I
didn't think [Bryant] was fouled. I know he was fouled. But, getting
to the line is a different thing.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to not only get fouled but get recognized for getting
fouled and get to the line because of that."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on his opinion of the officiating in Game 2: "I don't
want to comment on that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That being said, and despite the perceived pending doom after the
L.A. split, the Lakers were in decent spirits on Wednesday afternoon.
They practiced and watched film in El Segundo, and will again today
before their chartered flight to San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's right knee, which was bruised in Game 1, was sore but not
limiting. Shaquille O'Neal took his usual treatment, then released
everyone by shouting, "1-2-3," and they shouted back, "Lakes."</TE>
<TE>   By the time reporters were allowed into the gym, assistant coach
Kurt Rambis and everyone else who didn't play a lot of minutes the
night before were playing four-on-four, full court.</TE>
<TE>   The day wasn't without introspection, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, I've always favored poor sleep and restlessness,"
Jackson said with a grin. "That's always good for a person. But,
raccoon eyes I can stay away from. I've got big bags under my eyes
for a reason, and that's the way we played."</TE>

middle penetration like that, I can always find somebody on the
three-point line. We just had a breakdown getting to our spots. But,

<DH>As the Lakers Suddenly Find Themselves in a Tied Series
With the Spurs, Jackson Has 'Conversation' With Hobbled O'Neal About
Increasing His Activity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers aren't in real trouble yet. That would come Friday if they
don't start doing the things they didn't often do in the regular
season either.</LD>
<LD>   As Laker nation mulled exactly what a home playoff loss Tuesday to
the San Antonio Spurs meant, along with on which car window the Laker
flag should be properly mounted, the coach decided where the
potential for improvement lies.</LD>
<LD>   After the 88-85 loss that sent the Lakers to Texas with a two-game
split in the Western Conference semifinals, Phil Jackson said he
tapped the mammoth Shaquille O'Neal on the shoulder.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a heated conversation with Shaq, actually, about getting
actively involved in chasing the ball down," he said. "Shaq is, you
know, I wanted to stimulate him and I wanted to motivate him to the
fact we need him to play at a really active level. If it's 30
minutes, I want a more active 30 minutes. If in a 40-minute game he's
going to get seven rebounds, I'd rather have him play 30 minutes and
get 12 or 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, basically, his toe [hurts]. He doesn't feel he's tired,
he doesn't feel it's a matter of conditioning. He feels it's a matter
of activity ... allowed him by the movement of his foot."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't exactly Larry Brown versus Allen Iverson. It wasn't even
George Karl versus The Big Three. How heated, though, was difficult
to gauge. Teammates said they knew nothing of the conversation, and
Jackson hardly seemed angered by it, though O'Neal was in no mood for
another discussion about his limitations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll leave the motivation to Phil," forward Rick Fox
said. "I know that Shaquille has always been big when needed. I don't
expect anything less. We'd definitely like to see him lead this team
like he has, which he will. Over the last few years he has. He'll do
it again this year. If Phil feels that way, that something needs to
be said, Phil usually says what needs to be said. So, I just know
that my money's on Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal dragged an arthritic toe through the regular season. He
slashed his forefinger in Sunday's Game 1, and reopened the wound
during Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   He left Staples Center on Tuesday night without expansive comment,
and pushed silently through reporters Wednesday afternoon in El
Segundo, but that does not necessarily reflect his demeanor. He
periodically ignores the media in the best of times, as well.</TE>
<TE>   He scored 23 points in a six-point victory Sunday, 19 in the
three-point loss two nights later. He has made 16 of 38 shots in the
series, that 42.1% shooting percentage well off his regular-season
57.9%, which led the league. Poor shooting numbers--particularly in
the absence of Spur center David Robinson--suggest his finger is numb
from medication, or sore from being stitched and restitched, or that
the bandage won't allow him to feel the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Poor rebounding numbers--seven in 40 minutes--suggest his toe has
fouled him again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a game-to-game detail," Jackson said. "At the end of
the game I thought he moved great. I was telling him I thought the
activity level increased as the game wore on and the energy
increased. That was the thing I liked to see. Maybe the urgency level
has to come up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's on to San Antonio, where O'Neal played his high school
basketball and has rarely played well as a pro. He averaged 22 points
and 11.3 rebounds in three regular-season games against the Spurs,
and had 17 points and 10 rebounds in his only game this season at the
Alamodome, where he made two of 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant did much of the scoring against the Spurs in last
year's conference finals, particularly in San Antonio, where he
averaged 36.5 points in Games 1 and 2. O'Neal was healthy then.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make up a lot of excuses, and Shaq's never been one to do
that," Fox said. "I don't suspect he's going to tell you his toe
hurts or his finger with the stitches bothers him, I'm sure it does."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he spoke briefly with his friend Wednesday, and got a
look at the finger that has become such a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems upset that we split," Bryant said. "I think we all are.
But he's going to be ready to play come Friday. His finger looks
terrible. But, you know, he's going to have to play through that and
he's going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   It is not all about O'Neal, clearly. He did brilliant things
despite his injuries in Game 1, and his mobility appeared to lag when
allowed a rest of only 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "[Tim] Duncan took the ball right out of his hands a couple times
during the course of the game," Jackson said. "But he got the one
back that counted [in the late-game steal]. Unfortunately it didn't
count for us at the end of the game. You could see that it was
bothering him. He didn't have the hand strength he normally has.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can play well enough with Shaq playing at the level
he's playing right now. It's the rest of the team that has to step
into the vacuum and provide some help."</TE>

Last year, Shaquille O'Neal
had his way against David
Robinson in the Lakers' sweep
of the Spurs. This year, Mark
Bryant and Malik Rose have
done an admirable job filling
in for the injured Robinson
and defending O'Neal. A

<LD>Because of his performance in a trial Saturday night, Lonely Moon
Sign is the 2-year-old to beat in the $361,000 Kindergarten
FuturityMay 18 at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Jesus and Sandra Soto and trained by Donna McArthur, the
son of Royal Quick Dash proved his debut win last month was no fluke
by winning his trial by 13/4 lengths in 15.44 seconds for 300 yards,
making him the fastest of 10 qualifiers for the Kindergarten.</LD>
<LD>   Ridden by Sam Thompson, Lonely Moon Sign won his first start by
three-quarters of a length without being asked for his best.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Greek Gus. 2. Wired To Win. 3. Dashnlitia. 4.
Isolation. 5. Leaving The Fire. 6. Chili Palmer. 7. Serenity Dash. 8.
Bys Bug.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the first, use Greek Gus and Brisco Lamb, single Wired To
Win in the second, use Dashnlitia, Per Pritzi and Takin On A Dream in
the third and Isolation, Hey Cuz, Cee A Dash, Poke Money and Radium
Rays in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Pattons Pistol, who will break from the outside
in the sixth, needed 14 starts to earn his first victory, but two
horses who chased him (Lanes Fortune and Crocodile Hunter) won Sunday
night.</TE>

<HD>Celtics Make It Even With Balanced Attack</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Pierce leads five teammates in double figures
with 22 points and Boston stops errant Detroit, 85-77.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics showed there's more to their team than Paul Pierce
and Antoine Walker.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce led five Celtics in double figures with 22 points in an
85-77 victory over Detroit on Wednesday night that evened the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series at 1-1 and was
their first road win of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We're tough to guard," said Eric Williams, who scored 18 points
on six-of-nine shooting. "We can put five guys out there who can
shoot the three, and if they try to take that away from us, we can
attack the inside. We play from the inside out, and that's how teams
win championships.</LD>
<TE>   "When you've got two All-Stars, like Antoine Walker and Paul
Pierce, you can do lot of different things."</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is Friday night at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Walker scored 15 points for the Celtics, Rodney Rogers had 13 and
Kenny Anderson 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I would definitely hate to play us because we provide so many
problems defensively," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons had a hard time matching up with several
Celtics--outside, inside and off the dribble.</TE>
<TE>   "When you combine their three-point ability with their post
ability and their one-on-one ability, it's a hard team to play,"
Detroit Coach Rick Carlisle said.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Coach Jim O'Brien believes that's especially true because
Pierce and Walker are focused on the right things.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think either guy cares as much about scoring as they do
about winning," O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse led Detroit with 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston held Detroit to 32.9% shooting, its worst performance of
the season, and outrebounded the Pistons, 53-35.</TE>
<TE>   "They outworked us and outplayed us," Carlisle said.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson was held to two points in the first half, after
scoring 30 in Game 1, but he helped the Pistons get back into the
game briefly in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He scored five consecutive points to cap a 16-4 run which cut
Detroit's deficit to 56-54 with 4:10 left in the quarter. Robinson
finished with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston regained control of the game by outscoring the Pistons,
16-7, to take a 72-61 lead early in the final quarter on a
three-pointer by Walker--his first points since late in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics' cushion was never threatened.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, tempers flared as Robinson and Walker engaged in
face-to-face trash-talking and had to be separated.</TE>
<TE>   "Antoine was just running his mouth like he likes to do," Robinson
said. "He's a front-runner, so he was talking tonight. That's the
kind of guy he has always been."</TE>
<TE>   Walker refused to discuss the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce said: "It gets frustrating when you lose on your home
court."</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of Boston's 20 field goals in the first half were layups
or dunks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Detroit set a team playoff record with 29 three-point
shots and tied a Piston mark by making 12.</TE>

<LD>Allen Iverson doesn't have to worry about trade rumors. Coach Larry
Brown plans to keep him in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   One day after the star guard expressed displeasure with Brown for
indicating that he could be traded, the 76ers' coach said Wednesday
that last year's NBA most valuable player isn't going anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him, 'You can tell your daughter not to worry about it.
Daddy's going to be living in Philadelphia,'" Brown said.</LD>
<TE>   In a 30-minute news conference Tuesday, an emotional Iverson
lashed out against questions about his practice habits, said he was
bothered by criticism from Brown and hurt that his 7-year-old
daughter, Tiaura, had to endure questions about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to me that was a young kid reaching out for help. His
feelings were obviously hurt," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and General Manager Billy King had a long meeting Tuesday
with Iverson in which Brown assured Iverson he wouldn't be traded.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he wants to do what's right," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been with him five years, and every day hasn't been great.
But I've seen tremendous growth, I've seen him improve as a player
and I've seen him accomplish a great deal and I'm hopeful with me
being here I can continue to see him getting better."</TE>

<LD>If it has been unusual for the Atlanta Braves, during their streak of
10 consecutive division titles, to trade one of their own pitching
prospects, as they did in dealing Odalis Perez to the Dodgers in
January, it has not been unusual to find them operating a revolving
door behind their rotation cornerstones, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.</LD>
<LD>   Denny Neagle, Andy Ashby, Jason Schmidt, John Burkett and Steve
Avery are only a few of the well-known pitchers who have provided a
measure of stability behind Maddux and Glavine.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why now, as the Braves hope home-grown Jason Marquis and
Damian Moss are ready to start full time and Kevin Millwood can
overcome a siege of physical problems and regain his 18-win form of
1999, that General Manager John Schuerholz said the transition
process never really ends and that roster management is his most
complex and critical job, a balancing act between soaring economics
and the attempt to maintain a championship team.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can keep the more talented player and sometimes you
are forced to keep the more affordable player," Schuerholz said.
"You're always trying to keep the right balance. It's very difficult,
but I think we've been very successful."</TE>
<TE>   It will get only more difficult, however.</TE>
<TE>   As the Braves try to sustain their dominance in the National
League East, a division with depth and talent that stretches from
Montreal to Florida, as they go the more affordable route at the back
end of a rotation that has long been the foundation of their success,
they are aware that the ultimate transition could be only a calendar
away.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux and Glavine, the twin towers, are eligible for free agency
at the end of a season in which they have already turned 36.</TE>
<TE>   Schuerholz simply calls it "the next in a series of challenges,"
and is reluctant to say much more.</TE>
<TE>   For Glavine and Maddux, both desiring to stay and confident they
can maintain their high level for another three years at least, no
one has to explain the reality of a business in which loyalty carries
a price tag. Of Atlanta's $90-million payroll, Maddux is receiving
$12 million this year and Glavine $9 million. How an attendance
decline of about 5,000 per night and the precipitous fall of AOL
Time-Warner stock affect their future is difficult to determine in
May, but there's the potential that 2002 could be the last hurrah for
both in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really look that far down the road or worry about what's
ahead," said Maddux, who has worked through his lower back problems,
is 2-2 this season, 259-148 overall and has a shot at 300 wins, as
does Glavine, who is 5-1 and 229-133 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "I only worry about what I'm doing now," Maddux continued. "If
this is our last hurrah [in Atlanta], I'm sure there'll be a day that
I'll look back on it and appreciate it more than I do now, but right
now I'm trying to keep it simple--locating and changing speeds,
enjoying friendships and watching a game that never</TE>
<TE>   bores me. I wasn't even bored during those 16 innings [Tuesday]
night.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'd love to stay, but the game has given me so much
for so long that I don't feel it's right of me to expect more [in the
form of a multiyear extension]. If it comes, I'll be glad to take it,
but I don't ever expect anything more than what I ask of myself when
I'm pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Glavine said he can only live "in the here and now,"
but then he suggested that the window on the future is never
completely closed.</TE>
<TE>   "By nature we all think about the future and certainly more so in
a free-agent year ... [but] all I can do is continue to pitch and
assess other clubs as we play them to decide if I want to pitch for
them next year."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of Glavine and Maddux, of course, is intertwined with
that of their team, economically and artistically.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta has its rotation in place now after April injuries to
Maddux, Marquis and Millwood.</TE>
<TE>   The staff earned-run average before Wednesday's game was the major
league's fourth best, and the Braves were only 21/2 games out of the
division lead despite their inconsistent and injury-marred start.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still trying to figure out where we're at and how much
we have, but personally I think our pitching is fine," Glavine said.
"We may be in a little bit of transition, but it's a transition that
has a chance to be successful. It's not a transition where we're
throwing out a couple young pitchers to see what they can do and hope
they improve. We're throwing out quality young pitchers who can help
us win now."</TE>
<TE>   Maddux agreed, but what's his choice? At this point, the Braves
have to hope Moss and Marquis can do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no age limit to good pitching," he said. "These guys have
good enough stuff to get people out.</TE>
<TE>   "We had three of our five starters go down in April. Now hopefully
we have our rotation set up and in a groove to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves face a difficult test in a tough division, but the
competitive balance, Schuerholz said, has worked to his team's
advantage in that no one has been strong enough to run away and hide,
giving the Braves time to recuperate physically and find a rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but it is not the rattling rhythm of the tomahawk chop.</TE>
<TE>   The middle of the infield has struggled defensively, and the
addition of Gary Sheffield, battling a sore wrist, has failed to
invigorate an offense that ranks near the league bottom in most
categories.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, after Brian Jordan returned to collect two home runs
and four hits in Tuesday night's 16-inning Dodger victory, Perez came
back to haunt them Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   He pitched a 3-1 victory in which he defeated Millwood--the
pitcher whom the Braves would have preferred to package with
Jordan--and he did it by pitching hard inside rather than try to
emulate the outside styling of Glavine, as he claims to have been
instructed in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   All of that represented a transition of the type the Braves
weren't and aren't accustomed to, but they face the possibility of a
deeper, darker transition when free agents file in November.</TE>

<HD>Carson Getting Charger Camp</HD>
<DH>NFL: Five-year deal will be announced today, with team
moving preseason training to new complex in 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers will announce today a five-year deal to move
their training camp in 2003 to a sports complex being built in Carson
by billionaire Philip Anschutz, NFL sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, rumored for weeks, is sure to fuel speculation that the
Chargers are poised to move their franchise to Los Angeles, possibly
to play in a stadium that Anschutz wants to build in the South Park
area near Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted to adopt a
redevelopment plan that has provisions that could be used for the
complex land acquisition and financial arrangements required to build
a football stadium. Anschutz has said he is interested in a privately
financed stadium, which would be a rarity among modern sports venues.</LD>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has met with representatives of
Anschutz's group about the stadium proposal and said he is encouraged
it would help bring the NFL back to Los Angeles. Tim Leiweke,
president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, and Casey Wasserman, owner
of the Arena Football's L.A. Avengers, were scheduled to meet in New
York today with NFL executives for further discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz broke ground in February on a $120-million sports
facility at Cal State Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Although they are free to leave their training facility at UC San
Diego at any time, the Chargers have a contract to play their games
at publicly owned Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego through 2020. But the
contract has a clause that would allow owner Alex Spanos to "shop"
for a new city in 2004 if the team exceeds certain salary
restrictions imposed by the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the team and City Hall has been rocky,
largely over a ticket-guarantee deal that has cost taxpayers $25.3
million since 1997. Politicians have pleaded with the Chargers
without success to renegotiate. The team's 6-26 record the last two
seasons has sapped fan support.</TE>
<TE>   If the Chargers opt to move the franchise from San Diego, they
will be required to pay 60% of the outstanding bond debt left from an
expansion project undertaken by the city to make Qualcomm Stadium
suitable for next year's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now that's $40 million," Deputy City Manager Bruce Herring
said. "That's a fairly big incentive for the Chargers to remain in
San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   But $40 million might not be as daunting a hurdle if
Anschutz--majority owner of the NHL's Kings and four Major League
Soccer teams, including the Galaxy--were involved in the ownership of
the team.</TE>
<TE>   There has never been a suggestion that the Chargers' training
facility at UC San Diego is inadequate, and players recently acquired
by the team joked with reporters at a mini-camp that they had heard
the Chargers' camp is the cushiest in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   But Charger General Manager John Butler has said he would like to
get the team away from the distractions of San Diego's beaches and
night life for their preseason training. New Coach Marty
Schottenheimer is known for running one of the toughest training
camps in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine and UC Riverside were considered as possibilities before
the Carson deal was struck.</TE>
<TE>   Charger President Dean Spanos has had preliminary discussions with
San Diego officials about the need to replace Qualcomm, one of the
oldest stadiums in the NFL. But in the wake of a five-year
controversy over building a ballpark for the Padres, San Diego
officials have shown little interest in replacing Qualcomm to placate
the Chargers.</TE>

<HD>Avalanche Takes a Bite Out of Sharks and Evens Series</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were no offensive fireworks or defensive blunders for the
Colorado Avalanche--only a workmanlike victory.</LD>
<LD>   Captain Joe Sakic scored two goals and Patrick Roy stopped 19
shots as the Avalanche defeated the San Jose Sharks, 4-1, Wednesday
night at San Jose, evening their Western Conference semifinal series
at two games apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Blake opened the scoring with his fifth goal in three games
for the Avalanche, which won with a defensive tenacity lacking during
San Jose's two victories. Roy was rarely tested in winning his 143rd
playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   Game 5 of the best-of-seven series is Friday night in Denver and
Game 6 is Monday in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche's defensemen, who provided little support for Roy in
Game 3, were rock-solid, while its offensive stars got the big points
expected of them.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Forsberg, the playoffs' leading scorer, had two assists as
Colorado won at San Jose for the sixth time in seven games since
January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Selanne scored his fourth goal in four games for the Sharks.
A breakaway goal in the first period by Patrick Marleau was
disallowed, and Colorado ended Marleau's eight-game points streak.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3, Colorado blew a lead entering the third period for the
first time this season, as San Jose scored three unanswered goals in
its 6-4 victory. This time, the Avalanche fixed every problem that
led to 29 combined goals in the first three games.</TE>
<TE>   Roy improved to 8-0 in playoff games after giving up more than six
goals with the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   His counterpart, Evgeni Nabokov, stopped 21 shots but was left
helpless by San Jose's defensive mistakes on Colorado's first two
goals.</TE>
<TE>   For the second game in a row, Blake gave the Avalanche an early
lead, this time on a breakaway goal 5:26 of the first period. Blake
sat out Game 1 of the series because of an injury, but scored two
goals in each of the next two games.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Ottawa 1--After spending most of the playoffs
complaining about calls that went against them, the Maple Leafs got a
critical one in their favor, allowing them to hang on for a victory
over the Senators at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   A video review with 25.4 seconds remaining disallowed what had
initially been ruled a Senator goal, and the Maple Leafs held on to
tie their Eastern Conference semifinal series at 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only call they could've made," Toronto's Shayne Corson
said. "The puck didn't go into the net. Obviously, we're happy with
that call."</TE>
<TE>   The play began when Ottawa's Chris Phillips checked Bryan McCabe
off the puck behind the Toronto net. Goaltender Curtis Joseph stopped
Phillips' wraparound attempt, but couldn't find the puck, which was
under him. Ottawa's Marian Hossa dived headfirst into the crease and
pushed Joseph into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Kevin Pollock, standing behind the net, ruled it a goal. A
video review showed the puck did not cross the line, and what Pollock
saw was the black nob of a stick.</TE>
<TE>   "I was standing right there and I thought there was no way the
puck went in," McCabe said. "I really didn't have a doubt in my mind.
He pointed, but there was no puck in the net. I really wasn't too
worried."</TE>
<TE>   The Senators refused to make the ruling an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much that we can do now," captain Daniel Alfredsson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alyn McCauley scored twice, both times converting rebounds off
shots by Gary Roberts, as the Maple Leafs won their first road game
of the postseason after four losses.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Redden scored for the Senators, who squandered a lead for the
first time this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   The Senators managed only three shots in the first 20 minutes,
tying a franchise playoff low, set twice, most recently in a 2000
first-round game against Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   That start--not how the game ended--is what discouraged the
Senators most.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do a good enough job getting good dump-ins, where we
could forecheck hard," Alfredsson said. "We made it a lot easy for
their defensemen tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Senators lost defenseman Sami Salo to an undisclosed upper
body injury, after he crashed heavily into the boards going after a
loose puck two minutes into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Game 5 of the series is Friday at Toronto.</TE>

<LD>Montreal can thank goalie Jose Theodore for its 2-1 series lead
against Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   Theodore has given up only four goals in 118 shots in the first
three games of the series, which resumes tonight in Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   "We just have to find a way to get it by him," said the
Hurricanes' Jeff O'Neill, who had a game-high six shots Tuesday night
in a 2-1 loss. "If we keep creating chances, we will."</LD>
<TE>   O'Neill and linemate Sami Kapanen have not scored, and they
combined for 58 goals in the regular season. Kapanen, coming off his
best season--a career-high 69 points that included 27 goals--has one
assist in nine playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't start scoring, we're going to start beating each
other up," joked O'Neill, who returned for Game 3 after a one-game
suspension for hitting Montreal defenseman Sheldon Souray from
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, when things aren't going your way you don't want to
think about it.... You've still got to make good shots to beat him.
We have to find a way. We don't want him to be the X factor. He
doesn't seem to get real agitated. He just seems to do everything
right. Right now, he has no visible weaknesses."</TE>

<TE>   St. Louis center Doug Weight is battling an injured pelvis, which
limits his mobility and acceleration, but he hopes to contribute to
the Blues' cause tonight when they play host to Detroit in Game 4 of
the series, which the Red Wings lead, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   "If I come out flying in Game 4, hopefully I can get a little more
ice time," he said.</TE>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of international soccer's most influential leaders will take
Joseph "Sepp" Blatter to court in Switzerland this week, alleging
"misuse of funds" by FIFA's beleaguered president.</LD>
<LD>   "Steps will be taken to prove what has taken place is illegal,"
Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of UEFA, European soccer's
governing body, said Wednesday. "Blatter caused this situation
himself. We have no choice but to go to the Swiss legal authorities.</LD>
<LD>   "Under Swiss law, you are obliged to go to court if you are aware
of a criminal act. If you withhold that information, you can be
charged yourself."</LD>
<TE>   Allegations that Blatter, 66, had mismanaged FIFA funds, made
illegal payments and deceived executive committee members were made
last week by Michael Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's general secretary, at an
emergency meeting called after Blatter unilaterally blocked an
internal audit of FIFA finances ordered by the executive committee.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it is a tragic situation," Johansson said. "Something
must be rotten when the president does his utmost to stop an
investigation that was only internal and only for the executive
committee. It can only mean one thing: There is something that is
being hidden."</TE>
<TE>   Johansson, who lost to Blatter in the 1998 FIFA presidential
election, said 11 of FIFA's 24 executive committee members had agreed
to take legal action against Blatter. Among them is Issa Hayatou of
Cameroon, who is running against Blatter in the May 29 FIFA
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, South Korea, meanwhile, Chung Mong Joon, a FIFA vice
president, said Blatter had "overstepped his authority" and needed to
answer for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "He has acted without the mandate of the FIFA executive committee,
doling out personal favors at FIFA's expense," Chung said. "Such
abuse of authority and misuse of FIFA funds may require criminal
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, longtime Blatter supporter and FIFA
Vice President Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine soccer
federation, ridiculed Zen-Ruffinen's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "Zen-Ruffinen isn't fit to run a troop of boy scouts--no
disrespect intended to boy scouts," he said. "We debated the
allegations of corruption for 11 hours last Friday, and we rejected
the accusations."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's action shows that FIFA executives did nothing of the
sort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feyenoord of the Netherlands salvaged some pride for Dutch fans
Wednesday when it defeated German champion Borussia Dortmund, 3-2, in
Rotterdam to win the UEFA Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands failed to qualify for the World Cup, but it was
national team striker Pierre van Hooijdonk who sparked Feyenoord's
victory with two goals in a seven-minute span in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the final appearance of Dortmund defender Jurgen
Kohler, who played 105 games for Germany, helping it win the World
Cup in 1990. Kohler, 36, is retiring to become a youth coach with the
German soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A goal by France's Sylvain Wiltord earned Arsenal a 1-0 victory
over Manchester United on Wednesday and clinched the English Premier
League championship for the London club, which thus completed "the
double" after earlier having won the English F.A. Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The victory also made Arsenal the first club in more than a
century--since Preston North End in the 1888-89 season--not to lose
on the road for the entire league season. "The Gunners" were not shut
out in any of their 38 league games, and Wednesday's victory ended
Manchester United's string of three consecutive championships.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2002</TE>
<TE>   Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni did as expected Wednesday and left
1994 World Cup star Roberto Baggio off the roster he will take to
Korea/Japan '02, seeking a fourth World Cup triumph.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica Coach Alexandre Guimaraes on Wednesday selected the 23
players he will take to the World Cup. Included on the roster are
forwards Paolo Wanchope, sidelined since February after a knee
operation but apparently fit again, and veteran Hernan Medford, who
played on the Costa Rica team that reached the second round of the
Italia '90 World Cup.</TE>

<HD>It's More Than a Game When These Rivals Meet</HD>
<DH>Softball: No. 1 UCLA and No. 2 Arizona represent the
preeminent programs in the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Candrea recalls that on his first trip to Westwood, back when he
was a junior college coach, he soaked up the sunshine, looked over
the sprawling UCLA campus, considered the Bruins' long-standing place
at the top of college softball, and wondered, "Why would someone not
want to come here?"</LD>
<LD>   Now the coach at Arizona, UCLA's softball nemesis, part of
Candrea's job each year is making sure he can answer that question if
a top recruit asks.</LD>
<LD>   Under Candrea, 46, Arizona has its own impressive set of
credentials. The Wildcats have won six NCAA titles in his 17 years as
coach, including a 1-0 victory over UCLA in the championship game
last season.</LD>
<TE>   Between them, UCLA and Arizona have won 15 national championships
since 1978, and don't be surprised if there is another title added to
that at the end of this season.</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked UCLA (47-6, 15-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference) and No.
2 Arizona (48-7, 15-3) meet at 2 p.m. Friday at UCLA's Easton
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   A factor in Candrea's ability to build Arizona into a perennial
championship contender has been his ability to recruit and develop
players from Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "It took some time obviously," he said. "There was a time where if
UCLA wanted the kid, they got the kid. We got a few breaks. We got
some key kids."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting Debbie Day, an All-American pitcher in the early 1990s,
out of Burbank marked a big step.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the first dominating pitcher in our program," Candrea
said. "With championship teams, pitching is the backbone. At UCLA, it
was Lisa Longaker, Lisa Fernandez, Debbie Doom. Eventually, we got
Nancy Evans and then that led to getting Susie Parra and Jenny
Dalton."</TE>
<TE>   This season, Arizona has eight players from Southern California,
including senior Jennie Finch, an All-American pitcher and last
year's Honda Award winner as amateur softball's top player.</TE>
<TE>   Finch, from La Mirada, has a 29-2 record and 15 home runs this
season. Last season, she was 32-0 as a pitcher, capping off the
season with a three-hit shutout in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Although Finch attended UCLA games as a child and dreamed of being
the next Lisa Fernandez, she chose to attend Arizona because she
liked Tucson's small, college-town atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a softball player, the whole city of Tucson knows who
you are," Finch said. "You're on the cover of the newspaper. It seems
so unrealistic at times. I'll be in a mall and asked for autographs."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting works both ways, though. One of UCLA's top players,
first baseman Tairia Mims, is from Tucson and grew up attending
Wildcat games. Mims' mother, Jaqueline, is an Arizona graduate and
lifelong fan.</TE>
<TE>   "They still root for Arizona even though I'm here," Mims said of
her family. "[But] for me, the decision was easy. I loved the type of
education you can get at UCLA. That's not to say I didn't love U of
A."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and Arizona have split two games this season, both in Tucson.
Arizona won the opener, 3-2, on April 6, but UCLA bounced back the
following day, winning 6-5 to end the Wildcats' 70-game home winning
streak and Finch's NCAA-record 60-game unbeaten streak that spanned
three years.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Sue Enquist, who has always focused most on winning
over Memorial Day weekend--during the final rounds of the NCAA
playoffs--took some satisfaction in that regular-season win.</TE>
<TE>   "It removed the mystery that we were not able to get it done down
there," said Enquist, a former Bruin center fielder who was the first
softball player elected to the school's Hall of Fame. "It was a good
win but at the end of the day, it's still just [one] win."</TE>
<TE>   Enquist and Candrea credit each other for fostering what Candrea
describes as "a classy rivalry." The relationship between coaches
hasn't grown contentious despite their well-known competitiveness. It
has stayed friendly, even when they are recruiting the same players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both programs that are very competitive yet we both respect
one another," Candrea said. "I think we're so similar. Both of us
have high expectations every year. I mean, how many programs have
finished second at the College World Series and you come back home
and people say, 'What happened?'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Enquist: "I love that our friendship has been unscathed. I'd
do anything to beat his club and he would do the same to beat us. But
I think we've shown that you can have it all and still be a good
person.</TE>
<TE>   "When we shake hands at the end of each game, the first thing he
says to me is, 'How's your mom and dad?'"</TE>
<TE>   The admiration will end when the lineups are announced Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the hour and 45 minutes that we're out there, there's
not a lot of good-natured feeling happening," said Stacey Nuveman,
UCLA's All-American catcher. "We respect each other, you'd be stupid
not to. But you definitely want it more than any other game of the
regular season."</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS : SERIES REPORT/ SPUR
NOTES</KH>
<HD>Popovich Stays Ever Cautious</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Antonio Spurs have at least two more reasons to be optimistic
before Friday night's Game 3 against the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Spur forward Tim Duncan is expected to be officially announced
today as the NBA's most valuable player, giving the 30,000-plus fans
reason to be extra loud at the Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   And the chances are improving that center David Robinson, seen
only in street clothes so far, may finally be back to defend Laker
counterpart Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be huge," Duncan said. "When Dave comes back, it will be
an incredible boost for us."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates agree, but Spur Coach Gregg Popovich offers a different
viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it would be that big a deal," Popovich said. "We've
been without him for a month, and we've gotten used to being without
him."</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot-1 Robinson aggravated a disk in his lower back late in
the regular season, and played only a few minutes in the first-round
series against the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials say his back feels better, and that he's
strengthening his right leg to overcome nerve irritation caused by
the back injury.</TE>
<TE>   Popovich also downplayed any lift that comes from playing at home.</TE>
<TE>   "In the playoffs, all of the teams are so good now," he said.
"They've all done well on the road, so people are prepared no matter
where they play."</TE>
<TE>   Laker guard Kobe Bryant, however, said crowds count.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have 36,000 fans hollering and screaming,
Duncan's going to get the MVP award," he said. "There's going to be a
lot of emotion in that game.... We have to go up to San Antonio and
play well in Game 3."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though not in uniform for the Spurs' Game 2 victory, teammates say
Robinson used his savvy and experience to contribute to the win.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like Nostradamus out there," forward Malik Rose said. "He
was predicting runs, 'They're going to make a run, this is going to
happen, that is going to happen, we have to do this, we have to do
that,' and it happened. We took heed to what he was saying."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers didn't squeeze out a victory in Game 2, thanks to a
playoff-career-high 13 points from small forward Bruce Bowen, 14
points off the bench from guard Antonio Daniels and another strong
performance from Rose, who pulled down three of his 11 rebounds in
the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker forward Samaki Walker, a member of the Spurs' team swept by
the Lakers in last year's Western Conference finals, gave his old
team credit for holding on in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to be pretty scared being up 20 points and having us
come back the way we did," Walker said. "This definitely breaks down
the mental wall. They have beaten Goliath."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, when asked by a reporter if the Spurs had proved the
Lakers were beatable, said: "They're only immortal to you guys."</TE>

<LD>The chemistry and charisma created by the high level of competition
between the U.S. and Australian Olympic swimming teams at Sydney in
2000 did not go unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, a new event has been created by USA Swimming to take
advantage of the natural rivalry between the two countries: On April
6, 2003, the U.S. will take on Australia in the "Duel in the Pool," a
dual-meet format at the Natatorium in Indianapolis. It will be
broadcast by NBC.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no better rivalry in Olympic sports today than the
U.S.A. vs. Australia in swimming," said Chuck Wielgus, executive
director of USA Swimming.</LD>
<TE>   At the last two Olympics, the U.S. led the overall and gold medal
count. Of the 34 long course world records, 19 are held by either
Americans or Australians. Australia boasts the best-known swimmer in
the world, multiple-world record holder Ian Thorpe, and the U.S.
counters with world-record holders Lenny Krayzelburg, Aaron Peirsol,
Michael Phelps and Tom Dolan.</TE>
<TE>   The special event follows the U.S. Spring Nationals by one day,
which is also scheduled for Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   World-record swims at this one-day meet will earn a payday of
$25,000, and Krayzelburg believes the head-to-head format between the
two countries will bring out the best in the swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most definitely," said Krayzelburg, who won three gold medals in
Sydney and is nearly recovered from shoulder surgery. "We're always
fighting for the No. 1 spot. To bring a meet like this to this
country is very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Qualification for American swimmers will come from, in part, the
Summer Nationals in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Aug. 12-17. Each country's
entry list will be a minimum of 26 men and 26 women, featuring 2003
World Championship qualifiers and other discretionary selections.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After mastering the art of winning ugly in going unbeaten over their
first four games of the postseason, the Lakers' lethargic play
finally caught up with them in a three-point loss to San Antonio in
Game 2 on Tuesday. The Lakers' challenge is to regain their rhythm on
the road and take back home-court advantage from the Spurs. And it
will not be easy, based on how they played in the opening two games
of a series where strategy is often as important as talent. A
breakdown of Friday's Game 3:</LD>
<LD>   LAKERS' MOVE--Center Shaquille O'Neal and swingman Kobe Bryant
have to get their acts together and play a full four-quarter game.
They didn't in Game 1, and the Lakers escaped with a win. They didn't
in Game 2, and the Lakers lost.</LD>
<LD>   Although he will not admit it, O'Neal's toe and hand injuries are
affecting his play. He's unable to burst into the lane as he used to
and the Spurs are taking advantage of that by beating him to his
favorite shooting spots. When O'Neal is sound, he not only powers
over his defenders but also jumps over them. That didn't happen often
in the first two games. O'Neal normally has great hands, but his
inability to handle the ball cleanly because of his injured finger
also has been a problem.</LD>
<TE>   If O'Neal continues to struggle, the Lakers may be better off by
having him adjust his game and take a page from the Spurs' Malik
Rose. By positioning himself better to grab every rebound on both
ends of the floor, O'Neal can still dominate and his points will
come.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio's Bruce Bowen has done a solid job defending Bryant by
moving his feet and playing physically. Bryant can't afford to take
the matchup personally and force more shots. His teammates need him
to set the table in the Lakers' triangle offense and they have to
step up when they have the chance. Unless role players such as Rick
Fox, Robert Horry, Derek Fisher and Brian Shaw move more without the
ball, the offense will continue to struggle against the Spurs'
collapsing defense.</TE>
<TE>   SPURS' MOVE--Tim Duncan will always be the focal point of San
Antonio's attack, but his supporting cast, headed by Tony Parker,
Rose, Antonio Daniels and Bowen, won Game 2 for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Parker's ability to break down defenders and the Spurs' overall
aggressiveness made the Lakers scramble a lot more than usual.
Although the Lakers played much better defense in the second half
Tuesday, Rose's ability to get key offensive rebounds late in the
fourth quarter kept the Spurs in control. Daniels and Bowen are not
the most consistent shooters in the world, but they knocked down
perimeter shots when needed.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Gregg Popovich may have been outcoached by the Lakers' Phil
Jackson in last season's playoffs, but he came up with an effective
wrinkle Tuesday. Whenever Jackson had O'Neal defending Rose and
double teaming Duncan, Popovich had Duncan look for Rose cutting to
the basket. Look for more of the same if the Lakers continue this
tactic in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Another strategy the Spurs will stay with is fouling O'Neal hard
on his moves to the rim. Mark Bryant and Rose may give up size but
they know how to play rough. It's not O'Neal's game to be fancy, but
he has tried more finesse moves in this series than he did throughout
last season's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--San Antonio is hoping that center David Robinson is
sound enough to play in Game 3 after sitting out the first two games
of the series because of a back injury. Robinson may be soft, but he
can give the Lakers problems if he focuses on rebounding and knocking
down open mid-range jumpers. Because of the quickness of Parker and
the defensive ability of Bowen, Robinson should be more effective
against the Lakers than he was in last season's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson also gives Popovich an extra big man to bang inside
against O'Neal and that has to be a plus.</TE>
<TE>   If he's sound enough to get a couple of weak-side blocks on
defense, Robinson also would help the Spurs' transition game. Getting
easy baskets was one reason behind San Antonio's success in Game 2.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS : SERIES REPORT / OTHER
VIEWS</KH>
<HD>Duncan Puts on an MVP Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS-NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaq was in a foul mood Tuesday night, and I'm not just talking about
Spurs 88, Lakers 85.</LD>
<LD>   Shaq was in a foul mood before the Lakers lost Game 2. You thought
he had an issue with injured Spur center David Robinson?</LD>
<LD>   He now appears to have one with Tim Duncan, and I'm not talking
about an autograph slight.</LD>
<TE>   It's about the MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan won it, Shaq's mad about it, and there was something to
settle at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Before Shaq swatted a Duncan shot into the Spurs bench, before he
rejected a Tony Parker jumper, Shaq took aim at San Antonio's star
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Before tipoff.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq said, "Congratulations." Then he said, "In the state of
California, there's no justification when a 211 occurs. Once again,
I've been robbed."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that was Shaq speaking as Spider-Man.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe that was Shaq climbing up the wrong wall. Robbed?</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson doesn't think Shaq was robbed. "I think
Tim Duncan is the MVP," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shaq played like a man cheated. And Duncan played like a
man backed into a corner.</TE>
<TE>   Down 1-0 in this series, Duncan scored like an MVP (27 points),
rebounded like an MVP (17) and blocked shots like an MVP (five). But
he didn't hold on to the ball like an MVP.</TE>
<TE>   He committed 10 turnovers, three down the stretch, including one
in the final seconds that gave the Lakers a chance to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Up by two, Duncan wanted to give San Antonio a four-point lead. He
held the ball in front of Shaq as the game clock ticked down to less
than 10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq knocked the ball loose, and both players tumbled to the floor
as the ball rolled into Lakers hands.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio held its breath until Kobe Bryant's game-ending
travel. The series is tied. The momentum shifts.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs got the victory they needed in Los Angeles, and their
confidence soars.</TE>
<TE>   Most Valuable Player?</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, with the Lakers mounting a charge, Shaq got the
ball in his hands, his team down by three.</TE>
<TE>   He shot and missed.</TE>
<TE>   He won't be spinning any more Spider-Man stories. He won't be
talking about phone calls from his stepfather, and why he was robbed
of a trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Spurs should feel cheated. If they hadn't thrown away
Game 1, they'd be up 2-0 heading back to San Antonio.</TE>

<HD>Courtney Is the Lion That Roars in Goal</HD>
<DH>Water polo: The senior has helped Loyola Marymount return
to the Final Four, where it faces UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's been the voice and last line of defense for the last four
years.</LD>
<LD>   Yelling, directing, encouraging--and stopping a few hundred
shots--Loyola Marymount senior Devon Courtney has helped her team win
the Western Water Polo Assn. championship and qualify for the NCAA's
Final Four for the second consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   The Lions (20-7) meet UCLA (21-3) Saturday at 5 p.m. in one
semifinal, and Stanford (21-2) plays Michigan (25-11) in the other at
3:30. Both games are at USC's McDonald's Swim Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Coming out of Soquel High, near Santa Cruz, Courtney was not
heavily recruited. But Lion Coach John Loughran saw enough potential
in the 5-foot-9 goalie to bring her in as a foundation for the
school's second-year team.</TE>
<TE>   She has been all that and more. Courtney has 853 career saves,
including 210 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming in, she was going to have this position right away, I knew
she could handle that responsibility. Our program is based on
defensive philosophy, and with her as our backbone, we've been able
to develop our defense around her," Loughran said. "As the program
has grown, she's been a big part of it. Defense is why we've been
able to be competitive with better teams. She's led us each step of
the way to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney's strength shows not only in her ability to stop shots,
but also in the way she motivates her teammates. She dominates the
net, and when she is not directly involved in the action, Courtney
can be heard guiding her teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney came to Loyola in the fall of 1998, a few months after
the school's women's water polo team completed its first season. At
the time, there were no expectations of winning a championship and
there wasn't much pressure. Courtney found that an attractive
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola was 18-13 and 18-16 in Courtney's first two seasons. With
the introduction of more stringent weight training and conditioning
programs, the Lions were 23-7 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney, who made six saves in the Lions' conference-winning 8-4
victory over ninth-ranked UC San Diego on April 28, has played a
major part in the program's progression.</TE>
<TE>   "She's like a drill sergeant, but not in a bad way," said Meredith
Bellotti, a senior two-meter defender. "She rarely has a bad game,
and when we lose a game, she still played well. When we beat teams
that we shouldn't have beaten, it's because of her. She's the most
consistent player I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney, Loyola's student athlete of the year for 2001-2002 and
the 2002 most valuable player of the WWPA, says she doesn't play for
personal recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job to make that save because everyone has worked so hard
to get [the shot] to come from that place," Courtney said. "Everyone
has just played their role so well on this team. We're like a
machine, and when it comes together like that we're unstoppable."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney has seen her team improve, but the Lions face tough
competition in top-ranked UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins defeated Loyola, 11-1, in a semifinal last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we got there and it was like all we had to do was be
there and I think that reflected in our first game," Courtney said.
"But this year we're more focused on going in there and working
[hard] to get respect that we deserve and show how hard we've
worked."</TE>

<HD>New Deadline Set for Ahmanson Ranch Input</HD>
<DH>Development: County panel delays action on the project's
environmental review until June. State agencies sought the extension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to pressure from state agencies, an advisory panel
considering the Ahmanson Ranch housing development agreed Wednesday
to extend through mid-June its deadline for receiving public
comments.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-1 vote by the Ventura County Environmental Report Review
Committee followed a three-hour hearing during which opponents
continued to raise long-standing concerns about how traffic, water
and wildlife would be affected by the 3,050-home project planned at
the county's eastern edge north of Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   The extension of the May 1 deadline gives the Regional Water
Quality Control Board and other agencies until June 19 to weigh in on
whether a supplemental environmental report released by the county
earlier this year sufficiently addresses the concerns.</LD>
<TE>   The regional water board, the state Department of Fish and Game
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all have told county officials
they needed the additional time to analyze the document and comment.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Washington Mutual, the developer of Ahmanson
Ranch, said the extension would not throw the project off schedule
because they had expected the panel would take several weeks to issue
an opinion on whether the report meets state environmental
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Project attorney Steve Weston said it is still possible county
planning commissioners could take up the report sometime in July and
have it to the Board of Supervisors in September for a final vote.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors approved the project in 1992, but it has been slowed
by a series of lawsuits and the discovery three years ago of a rare
frog and a species of flower previously thought extinct. The board
must now decide whether the supplemental environmental review is
sufficient or whether further study is needed.</TE>
<TE>   But additional delays could jeopardize the project. Thousand Oaks
Councilwoman Linda Parks, an ardent critic of Ahmanson Ranch, joins
the board next year, replacing Supervisor Frank Schillo, who is
retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's hearing was continued from last week because such a
large number of critics and supporters signed up to speak. A title
insurance executive from Simi Valley, who supports the project, and
13 opponents returned to make their comments.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Mintz, an attorney for the environmental group Heal the
Bay, said the supplemental environmental review relies too heavily on
data provided by the developer. John Buse, an attorney for the
Environmental Defense Center office in Ventura, said the review falls
short of state requirements that the project be consistent with the
county's General Plan and that a broad range of environmental effects
be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   One critic said the county should devote more research to the
effect of the project's proposed golf courses on the California
red-legged frog found on site. Another called for an updated traffic
study.</TE>
<TE>   Another dismissed the developer's assurances that the water supply
could not be contaminated by Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field
Laboratory, a former nuclear test site located miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard 'We took samples. It's clean,' " said Liz Crawford of
Encino. "But the tests that were done were private ... and
laughable."</TE>
<TE>   Project consultants, scientists and lawyers defended their
research.</TE>
<TE>   "Our opinions cannot be bought, and I resent any implications to
that effect," said Marie Campbell, a consultant with Sapphos
Environmental Inc., which is contracted by the developer.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hayden, another consultant who oversaw testing for any
contaminants on the Ahmanson site, said small levels of pollution
were at normal levels and suggested no link to Rocketdyne. "There are
contaminants in my backyard, in your backyard and under this
building," he told panel members.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Officer Held in Rapes</HD>
<DH>Police: Authorities say the suspect forced two prostitutes
to have sex with him by implying they would be arrested if they
refused.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT and SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer has been arrested for allegedly sexually
assaulting two women while he was on duty, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Joseph Evan Robinson, a three-year LAPD member assigned to
the 77th Division, was booked on suspicion of "rape by force or fear"
and is being held on $1-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   According to LAPD sources familiar with the case, two admitted
prostitutes independently claimed that Robinson forced them to have
sex with him by implying that they would be arrested if they didn't
do so.</LD>
<TE>   The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
alleged assaults took place in inconspicuous areas near the Harbor
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD opened an internal affairs investigation Jan. 30, the day
the first victim alleged that she was assaulted by an on-duty LAPD
officer.</TE>
<TE>   By April 16, the department had developed "sufficient credible
information to suspect" that Robinson committed the assault,
according to an LAPD statement outlining the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   That information, said Police Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, came from an
undercover operation conducted by internal affairs detectives who
tested Robinson's behavior with female suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We caught him in behavior that we believe is predatory," said
Lorenzen, who declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was ordered to relinquish his gun and badge and was
relieved of duty with pay pending the outcome of the investigation,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, on April 21, police interviewed a second woman who
alleged that she also had been sexually assaulted by a police
officer. Investigators say Robinson was that officer.</TE>
<TE>   After Robinson was relieved of duty, investigators secretly
followed him when he left his home. On May 7, police allegedly caught
Robinson engaging in consensual sex with another prostitute in the
same area where the previous assaults took place, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was arrested, police said. He was carrying a loaded
handgun at the time, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Commission President Rick Caruso praised the
department's swift response to allegations that one of its own was
committing crimes on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that the LAPD can indeed police its own," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen, head of the department's internal affairs division, said
the investigation of Robinson continues.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fear is that there are other victims," Lorenzen said. "We are
out there looking for other victims. We hope they come forward."</TE>
<TE>   Though no other LAPD officers have been implicated in the
assaults, Robinson was working with a partner on both nights that the
alleged assaults took place.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen said those two partners are the subject of an
administrative investigation aimed at determining whether they were
aware of Robinson's alleged activities. On Wednesday, detectives
served a search warrant on Robinson's locker at the 77th Street
station. Police declined to comment on what, if anything, was found.</TE>
<TE>   A case against Robinson will be presented to the district
attorney's office today for the filing of criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 26, is the second Southern California police officer in
recent weeks to be arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting women
while on duty.</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, a San Bernardino patrol officer was arrested on
suspicion of sexually assaulting 11 women he encountered on the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said that anyone with information regarding the
Robinson case can contact LAPD internal affairs at (213) 485-4152.</TE>

<HD>In Artist's Freeway Prank, Form Followed Function</HD>
<DH>Transit: Unauthorized addition to sign went unnoticed for
months. No charges planned.</DH>

<LD>What more could an artist want?</LD>
<LD>   An unusual medium. A chance to take a jab at the establishment. An
almost endless audience, speeding to see the work.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Ankrom created that enviable milieu above an unlikely
canvas--the Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   For two years, the rail-thin artist planned and prepared for his
most ambitious project, a piece that would be seen by more than
150,000 motorists every day on the freeway near 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   With friends documenting his every move on camera, Ankrom
clandestinely installed the finished product on a gray August
morning. For nine months, no one noticed. It even failed to catch the
eye of California Department of Transportation officials</TE>
<TE>   And that is exactly what Ankrom hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old Los Angeles artist designed, built and installed
an addition to an overhead freeway sign--to exact state
specifications--to help guide motorists on the sometimes confusing
transition to the northbound Golden State Freeway a couple miles
farther north.</TE>
<TE>   He installed his handiwork in broad daylight, dressed in a hard
hat and orange reflective vest to avoid raising suspicion. He even
chopped off his shoulder-length blond hair to fit the role of a
blue-collar freeway worker.</TE>
<TE>   The point of the project, said Ankrom, was to show that art has a
place in modern society--even on a busy, impersonal freeway. He also
wanted to prove that one highly disciplined individual can make a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Embarrassed Caltrans officials, who learned of the bogus sign from
a local newspaper column, concede that the sign could be a help. They
will leave it in place, for now. The transportation agency doesn't
plan to press charges for trespassing or tampering with state
property.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't the counterfeit sign get noticed?</TE>
<TE>   "The experts are saying that Mr. Ankrom did a fantastic job,"
conceded Caltrans spokeswoman Jeanne Bonfilio. "They thought it was
an internal job."</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom's work has also won praise from some in the art world.</TE>
<TE>   Mat Gleason, publisher of the Los Angeles art magazine Coagula,
learned about the project a few months ago. He calls it "terrific"
because it shows that art can "benefit people and at the same time
tweak the bureaucracy a little."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the sign came to Ankrom back in 1999, when he found
himself repeatedly getting lost trying to find the ramp to the north
Golden State after the Harbor becomes the Pasadena Freeway. (The
sharp left-lane exit sneaks up on drivers at the end of a series of
four tunnels.)</TE>
<TE>   He thought about complaining to Caltrans. But he figured his
suggestion would get lost in the huge state bureaucracy. Instead,
Ankrom decided to take matters into his own hands by adding a simple
"North 5" to an existing sign.</TE>
<TE>   "It needed to be done," he said from his downtown loft. "It's not
like it was something that was intentionally wrong."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that his work is displayed before 150,000 people
daily. On an average day, even the Louvre gets only one-tenth that
many visitors. He also didn't mind that his "guerrilla public
service" made Caltrans look a bit foolish. "They are left with egg on
their faces," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom had planned to wait until August--a year after the
installation--to reveal his forgery via video at an art show. But a
photographer friend leaked the story.</TE>
<TE>   From his tiny Brewery Art Complex loft, Ankrom said he tries to
use his work to comment on current trends. The Seattle native
fabricates hatchets embedded with roses and produces neon-illuminated
laser guns. To pay the bills, he is also a freelance sign maker.</TE>
<TE>   The expertise he gained in both fields helped him pull off the
perfect counterfeit job.</TE>
<TE>   He closely studied existing freeway signs, matching color swatches
and downloading specifications from the Federal Highway
Administration's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest challenge was finding reflective buttons resembling
those on Interstate signs--a dilemma finally resolved when he
discovered a replica sold by a company in Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   The video he made of the entire process shows Ankrom snapping
digital photos of existing Golden State Freeway signs and projecting
the images onto paper, before tracing them onto a sheet of aluminum.
He cut and painted the aluminum sign and even "aged" it with a layer
of gray.</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom affixed a contractor-style logo on the side of his pickup
truck to add authenticity during the project. But closer examination
might have raised suspicions. It read: Aesthetic De Construction.</TE>
<TE>   He even printed up a bogus work order, just in case he was stopped
by police. "I tried to make this airtight, because I didn't want
anything to go wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In early August, Ankrom launched the final phase of his project.
After friends were in place with video and still cameras, one gave
the all-clear signal via walkie-talkie: "Move in, rubber ducky."</TE>
<TE>   He made short work of the final installation--climbing up the sign
and hanging over speeding traffic to install his addition. The main
challenge was avoiding the razor wire on the way up.</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom said he's not surprised that Caltrans isn't pressing
charges, adding, "It wasn't straight-out vandalism."</TE>
<TE>   For now, department officials say they will merely inspect the
elements of Ankrom's sign to make sure they are securely fastened.
They may be replaced in a few months as part of a program to retrofit
all freeway signs with new, highly reflective models.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials had discussed adding more directional signs,
but the agency spokeswoman said she is not sure why the department
never followed through.</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom said he would like Caltrans to return the work. "If they
want to keep it up there, that is fine too," he said. "Hopefully it
will help people out, which was the whole point."</TE>

<HD>Schools Are Discouraged by Shortage of Incentive Funds</HD>
<DH>Education: Deficit woes prompt state officials to cut back
on academic performance rewards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Celebration is slowly giving way to disappointment at many schools
across Southern California and the rest of the state as budget woes
in Sacramento force education officials to slash millions of dollars
in academic performance awards.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators and the governor's office are discussing how much to
cut from the $157 million in rewards once promised to schools that
met their academic targets last year.</LD>
<LD>   The amount has already been trimmed to $144.3 million, but as the
state tries to control a growing deficit, the California Department
of Education says it cannot guarantee even that amount.</LD>
<TE>   The department eliminated the entire $100 million from another
incentive program this year. The Certificated Staff Performance
Incentive was meant to reward employees--from librarians to teachers
and principals--of low-performing schools that significantly raise
their Academic Performance Index scores.</TE>
<TE>   The index, based largely on how well students score on
standardized tests such as the Stanford 9s, is part of a 3-year-old
carrot-and-stick program designed to make schools more accountable.
Those that consistently fail to improve could face state and federal
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   But the budget deficit--$20 billion and growing--has taken a big
bite out of the carrot.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we're disappointed," said Carolyn Williams, principal
at Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, which qualified for nearly
$160,000 in Governor's Performance Awards. The prize has been cut to
about $145,000 so far.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the staff awards, the governor's awards are open to any
school that meets API growth targets, and the money goes to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said she started celebrating and congratulating students
and teachers last fall when the scores were announced. Dana Hills, a
high-performing school, had earned its first cash prize. Now,
Williams worries about how much money will be left, especially when
the budget crisis is hurting school funding in other areas.</TE>
<TE>   The money, she said, "is certainly an incentive. We should be
working every day to do well and to excel [regardless of awards], but
it is motivating to know that your hard work will be rewarded."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Francis Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills,
qualified to receive about $97,000 in awards, had hoped to use the
money to bolster tutoring programs for low-performing students.</TE>
<TE>   "This money is like a shot in the arm for us," Principal James
Avallone said. "We have a difficult time finding the funds to do the
things we need to do to boost our kids. But at this point, we can't
plan too much because we don't even know if we're going to get the
money."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 285 schools in Orange County and 894 in Los Angeles
County qualified for the Governor's Performance Award based on API
scores announced in October.</TE>
<TE>   State officials were unable to say how many schools earned staff
awards since the program was eliminated. Last year, more than 12,000
teachers, principals, librarians and others at 304 schoolsreceived
bonuses between $5,000 and $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   For this year, only the governor's award remains. Roughly 3,500
schools raised their scores enough to qualify this year, down from
4,502 last year. As schools raise their scores, it becomes harder to
make further gains.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it looks as though the state is having a tough time
maintaining the incentive program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pretty profound budget crisis we are going through,"
said Bill Padia, California Department of Education's policy and
evaluation director, who has fielded concerned calls from school
officials. "But the awards are not going away permanently."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Padia said, there should still be plenty of
motivation to keep raising scores because parents will be looking at
the API and rating their schools.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Davis, principal of Clinton-Mendenhall Elementary in
Garden Grove, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "No one goes into this profession for the money," Davis said. "The
reason we get so excited [about the scores] is not the monetary
awards. It is truly just because we are working as hard as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis' school won $45,000 in Governor's awards.
Combined with other grants, the money was used to upgrade the campus
Internet connection and to fund field trips among other things. This
year the school will receive $37,000, perhaps less.</TE>
<TE>   Cash is always needed at schools, the winners say, but the prizes
make some feel uncomfortable. Education is a tough job regardless of
where you teach, they say, and to recognize the work of some and not
others seems unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "The money muddies the water," said Debbie Schroeder, principal of
Thomas Edison Elementary School in Anaheim, which qualified for
awards two years in a row. "It is like watching your brothers and
sisters working like crazy and then you get the money and they don't.
It is awkward."</TE>

<HD>Take Baby's Custody, Court Urged</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Social worker testifies that neither parent is fit
to care for comatose Cypress infant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A social worker testified Wednesday that she wants an Orange County
court to take custody of a brain-damaged baby whose parents can't
agree whether to turn off life-support machines.</LD>
<LD>   If the Superior Court takes custody of 8-month-old Christopher
Ibarra of Cypress, Judge Richard E. Behn might be asked to make the
life-or-death decision.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher's father, charged with felony child abuse for
allegedly beating the boy, has refused to authorize removal of the
machines that are keeping his son alive. If the child dies,
prosecutors say, they will charge his father, Moises Ibarra, with
homicide.</LD>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Tamara Sepulveda, 23, has asked doctors to let
her son die.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Behn started hearing Family Court testimony this week in
Orange to determine who should have custody of the child.</TE>
<TE>   Social worker Birute Bruzas-Ranes testified that neither parent is
fit to care for Christopher. She said she believes the father injured
Christopher by shaking him and that the mother failed to protect him
from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   She also said Sepulveda is not capable of caring for the child,
who requires around-the-clock medical attention. She said the
prognosis for Christopher is grim.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't see. He doesn't hear. He doesn't walk. He doesn't
talk," Bruzas-Ranes said. "He has no responses to life, basically."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father was called to testify Wednesday but invoked his
5th Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony could end as early as next week. If the court takes
custody, Sepulveda said, she will ask that Behn order doctors to turn
off life support. But the judge would need to schedule another
hearing to make that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Ibarra, 23, faces up to nine years in prison if convicted of
abusing the baby. He would face a potential life sentence if the
child dies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of Southern California's longest environmental battles, the
Orange County Planning Commission on Wednesday approved a
dramatically scaled-back housing development on the upper mesa of the
Bolsa Chica wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote, taken after a heated public hearing dominated
by the plan's opponents, marked the fourth time the county has
approved development of the coastal wetlands area in Huntington
Beach. It also set the stage for what developers hope will be the
final showdown on the matter before the California Coastal Commission
early next year.</LD>
<LD>   "I am amazed that all of you ... don't understand the history [of
this] and the right of property owners to develop their property,"
Commissioner Shirley Commons Long said in moving for approval. "The
wetlands are saved--this project has gone to amazing extremes to do
it right and do it well."</LD>
<TE>   Flossie Horgan of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which has long
opposed any development on or near the wetlands, said the group will
appeal the Planning Commission's decision to the county Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's action "was predictable," she said, "because the
county has consistently supported the developer. We weren't surprised
by this, but it doesn't mean we're just going to accept their
findings."</TE>
<TE>   Under the latest plan, Hearthside Homes would build 388 homes on
about 106 acres in the upper-level area of the mesa. Lucy Dunn,
executive vice president of the company, said after Wednesday's vote:
"We know the commissioners took a long, hard look at this plan.
They've been studying this for more than 30 years, so clearly they
are very knowledgeable on the issue. We believe it's a good plan, and
we hope the Coastal Commission will find it consistent with the
Coastal Act."</TE>
<TE>   Many earlier development plans have been thwarted by the
commission, however.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Hearthside's sister company, Signal Landmark, acquired
the property and proposed building as many as 5,700 homes and a
marina on about 1,700 acres. That plan was eventually approved by
both the county and the Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed by an environmental group led to the project's
being scaled back to about 3,300 homes. A series of legal and
political skirmishes led to further reductions in the plan's scope.
Two years ago the Coastal Commission prohibited the company, which
was then proposing 1,235 homes, from building anywhere but on the
upper mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "They made a modification so substantial that it made the plan
unfeasible," Dunn said. The company filed a lawsuit challenging that
decision. In the meantime, Dunn said, the company drew up the more
modest plan approved Wednesday. "We believe it's a balanced project
for both people and the environment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics speaking at the hearing disagreed vociferously.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the kind of housing we need," said Armida H.
Brashears, a longtime Huntington Beach resident. "The wetlands is a
precious, irreplaceable asset. Our children and grandchildren will
hold us responsible if we don't protect it."</TE>
<TE>   Joey Racano voiced similar objections. "Building more huge,
decadent homes," he said, "will not solve our housing problem. A wind
of change is coming over Orange County. The community is crying out
to save this land."</TE>

<HD>Two Sides of Catalina Revealed</HD>
<DH>Crime: Fisherman is accused of tossing a bomb, and
islanders rally to help his family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Night after night, Steve Quarnstrom returned to a patch of deep,
choppy water on the back side of Santa Catalina Island that he
claimed as "my fishing hole."</LD>
<LD>   Guzzling beer to mute a methamphetamine rush, he prowled the
swells in a skiff, authorities said, screaming insults at other
boaters and shooting at sea gulls and sea lions that chased his bait
and catch.</LD>
<LD>   Locals shrugged it off as an extreme but tolerable example of an
independent spirit they call "the islander mentality." That is, until
he allegedly tossed a bomb at a competing fishing boat.</LD>
<TE>   The "Bully of Church Rock," as some locals call him, was arrested
April 12 in Avalon on felony charges, including use of an explosive
to intimidate, assault with a deadly weapon, making terrorist
threats, possession of a controlled substance and discharging a
firearm in a grossly negligent manner.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also allege that several times after the bomb
incident, Quarnstrom--who is 6 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds and
sports a mustache--approached other fishermen in town and warned, "If
I catch you out there again, you're dead."</TE>
<TE>   Bail was set at $1.1 million--a record for Catalina--in a case
that has exposed two faces of Avalon, known to most people as a sunny
seaside tourist town.</TE>
<TE>   About 22 miles off the mainland, it is a close-knit town of 5,000
permanent residents who get by on tourism, self-reliance and mutual
aid. It also harbors shadowy nonconformists who deal in drugs, poach
fish and game, and are wary of anyone not born and raised on the
island, particularly law officers. Even island residents of a
quarter-century refer to themselves as newcomers if they hailed from
the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody messed with Corny [Quarnstrom]," said one acquaintance,
who asked that her name not be used. "Even on this island of misfits,
he stuck out."</TE>
<TE>   Since Quarnstrom's arrest by Los Angeles County Sheriff's
detectives, the chatter in Avalon's restaurants and boutiques has
been divided. Some defend the 47-year-old fisherman as a model of
self-reliance who only wanted to be left alone to support his family.
Others express relief that, as one of them put it, "Corny is finally
off the island."</TE>
<TE>   The case also has revealed what some call "our best side." Almost
immediately after Quarnstrom was arrested, residents began raising
funds for his wife, Judy, a teacher's aide at the local public school
and, by all accounts, an ideal mother and neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "That's life in Avalon," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher
Frisco, who specializes in Catalina criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of people in Avalon are good, hard-working
people, who rush to help their own," he said. "Troublemakers who go
too far are eventually rooted out and driven off the island."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Quarnstrom's San Fernando Valley attorney, Alex
Baum, said he has yet to fully investigate the merits of the charges
against the fisherman.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he believes the bail is excessive, given that no one was
hurt in the alleged incidents. He also suggested that Quarnstrom's
troubles may stem from old blood feuds with competing fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   But lifelong islanders said Quarnstrom has always had a notably
contentious disposition. "In school, he was a loudmouthed punk who
got beat up a lot," one man said. "Then he grew up."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, they said, he withdrew into a kind of furious
isolation over cultural changes that challenged his way of life:
growing tourist hordes, greedy gill netters, law enforcement
crackdowns on land and on the water.</TE>
<TE>   To hear some tell it, his alleged drug abuse only made an already
intimidating man meaner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bummer, a sad thing that's happened to Corny," said Avalon
hardware store owner Mike Cassidy, a lifelong friend. "A lot of us
have been concerned about him for some time. We'd say, 'Hey, man,
what are you doing?' He'd just shrug it off."</TE>
<TE>   "People were scared for him, and of him," said one acquaintance
who, like some other islanders, feared reprisal and asked that her
name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Said another: "The tensions were just building and building. You
could see it on his face."</TE>
<TE>   Quarnstrom's wife declined to comment. But many Avalon residents
said she had helped them in the past--as a baby-sitter and in various
emergencies--and now it was their turn to return the favors.</TE>
<TE>   Friends Plan Events to Help Suspect's Family</TE>
<TE>   Filling a glass with draft beer for a customer at J.L.'s Locker
Room saloon, bartender Margie Wahl said, "We're planning a bake sale
for Judy, who is a beautiful person. We want to help pay her bills,
and buy tickets for her to shuttle back and forth between the
mainland while her husband is gone."</TE>
<TE>   A few doors down from Quarnstrom's rented home--a small,
wood-framed cottage painted blue with white trim--the staff at
Avalon's Beach Realty was planning a dance benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "Judy is a real trouper, but right now she's overwhelmed with this
case--and her daughter's high school graduation," said broker Ray
Jayne Flores. "We brainstormed and decided a dance would give her an
opportunity to cut loose a little."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Catalina's nine sheriff's deputies are struggling
to deal with rising sales and use of crystal meth on the island.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years ago, we issued maybe one drug-related search warrant a
year in Avalon," said Sheriff's Det. Dan Coon. "Last year, we issued
10."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of Quarnstrom's arrest, Coon confiscated from his
backpack roughly three grams of what he described as "the
highest-quality crystal meth I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Avalon authorities believe the powerful stimulant is typically
imported from Orange County sources and sold for about $60 a gram. It
is popular, they say, among some commercial fishermen who want to
stay awake all night.</TE>
<TE>   Quarnstrom specialized in stalking white sea bass, a prized food
fish with high resale value that is usually caught at night with live
squid bait.</TE>
<TE>   Drifting in the cold blackness below Church Rock, he sat for hours
on end in his skiff huddled beneath a blue plastic tarp. When the
bass were biting, acquaintances said, he was as protective of his hot
spot on the gusty southern end of the island as a sourdough of a gold
strike.</TE>
<TE>   According to police reports, Robert Ronald Vickers was fishing
there in the early morning hours of March 28 when Quarnstrom motored
up and yelled, "If you don't leave and I catch you alone out here,
you're dead."</TE>
<TE>   Quarnstrom allegedly then grabbed a "seal bomb," lighted the fuse
and hurled it in Vickers' direction.</TE>
<TE>   Seal bombs are about 31/4 inches long, thick as a man's thumb, and
packed with black powder. They carry the explosive force of a
quarter-stick of dynamite and are used to scare seals and sea lions
away from fishing grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning hard on the wheel, Vickers managed to steer clear of the
bomb. He told authorities that it exploded about seven feet from his
vessel, which was loaded with extra gasoline in the bow.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Avalon resident Scott Costa was fishing near
Church Rock when he overheard Quarnstrom alerting a friend on VHF
marine radio's channel 65 that the white sea bass were biting there.</TE>
<TE>   Fisherman Recalls Recent Altercation</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Costa recalled dropping a line into the water
about 100 yards from Quarnstrom's 15-foot skiff. Suddenly, Quarnstrom
was back on the radio screaming, "Scotty, you stupid punk. This is my
fishing spot!"</TE>
<TE>   By the time their boats drifted to within 50 yards of each other,
Quarnstrom allegedly pulled out a pistol and shot at a seal that was
eating a bass caught by a third fisherman in the area. Costa said at
least one bullet ricocheted off the water, barely missing his boat.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy is scary--and I'm just fed up with it," said Costa, who
works for a glass-bottom boat business in Avalon Harbor. "Something
had to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives are now investigating the alleged shootings
of seals and sea lions, which could lead to federal charges against
Quarnstrom. Authorities have asked anyone finding any bullet-riddled
carcasses to keep them so forensic experts can study them for
possible links to Quarnstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Coon said Quarnstrom admitted catching more than his legal limit
of bass in order to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   He also admitted throwing the bomb in the water, but only to scare
bass away from Vickers, whom he suspected of slashing his tires
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The meth, Quarnstrom maintained, must have been planted in his
backpack by some enemy. Quarnstrom and Steve Vien, his attorney
before Baum took the case, suggested that Quarnstrom was the victim
of a vendetta.</TE>
<TE>   "If Quarnstrom was such a horrible person," Vien said, "why didn't
people call police?"</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they did, often.</TE>
<TE>   A California Department of Fish and Game official, who suspected
Quarnstrom of poaching white sea bass, said his agency already was
planning to "have a detail watch him day and night."</TE>
<TE>   But then, Fish and Game Lt. Dan Sforza, who is assigned to the
island, pointed out that "it's tough to make cases over there."</TE>
<TE>   "When our big patrol boat leaves Long Beach Harbor, the islanders
know about it," he said. "Undercover officers can't walk two streets
in Avalon without being recognized."</TE>
<TE>   "In this case," he said, "people got fed up with a guy, then
mustered the courage to file a complaint."</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver Accused of Molestation</HD>
<DH>Crime: Girl, 6, alleges the incident occurred on the way
home from a Tustin school.</DH>

<LD>A bus driver for the Tustin Unified School District has been arrested
after a 6-year-old girl told her mother he had molested her on the
way home from school, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Marcos Moreno Leon, 42, of Stanton was booked into Orange County
Jail on Tuesday night. He faces two counts of child molestation.</LD>
<LD>   Police and school district officials interviewed 40 children who
ride the same bus from Helen Estock Elementary School, said Tustin
Police Lt. Brent Zicarelli.</LD>
<TE>   "So far, we haven't gotten any other victims, and we might not
find any others. But there may be witnesses," Zicarelli said. "She
wasn't alone with him--there were other students on the bus."</TE>
<TE>   Notices informing parents of the allegations were sent home with
students Wednesday, said Mark Eliot, a school district spokesman.
"We'll have some community liaisons on campus in case parents have
questions."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother notified police Monday evening after the girl
told her Leon molested her as she was getting on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Leon has been placed on suspension pending the outcome of the
police investigation, said Susan Retter, a vice president of First
Student, the Tustin-based company hired by the school district to
handle transportation. He has been employed by the company since
1986, Retter said.</TE>
<TE>   Retter said drivers undergo extensive testing and background
checks with the California Highway Patrol, the Department of Justice
and the Department of Motor Vehicles before hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not find previous convictions against Leon, Zicarelli
said.</TE>

<HD>Task Force Nets Bumper Crop of Pot Amid Avocado Groves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A narcotics task force seized about 30,000 marijuana plants hidden
amid avocado groves nestled near the Cleveland National Forest in
Riverside County during a weeklong operation, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Vianey Medrano, 31, was arrested Friday on suspicion of
cultivating marijuana, said Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. Shelley
Kennedy-Smith. Medrano allegedly grew more than 4,600 plants.
Medrano's connection to other marijuana locations raided, if any, is
unclear, Deputy John Kaiser said. The seizures began May 1. Seventeen
locations were raided during the week by a task force, which included
officers from San Diego, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration,
the Customs Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the state National
Guard.</LD>
<LD>   The pot, which the task force said was worth more than $170
million, was being grown in heavily vegetated parts of Murrieta, the
La Cresta area and Temecula, Kennedy-Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very easy area to hide, and to hide things," she said.
"All you see are groves, and rows and rows of oranges and avocados."
Authorities were tipped off to the pot by avocado growers concerned
that water was being diverted.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers Won't Let Government Go Soft on Software Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   There's a lesson for private enterprise in the software scandal.
It's the same lesson taught by the energy rip-off: Don't get too
greedy dealing with state government. The deal later can blow up,
even blacken your eye.</LD>
<LD>   Business sharpies may bamboozle bureaucrats or grease political
hacks, but if the gain is too gross, consumers and taxpayers won't
stand for it.</LD>
<TE>   Even more than corporate culprits, the protesters--voters-- have
important contacts at the Capitol, their elected representatives.</TE>
<TE>   When one company cons another company, the victim may never again
deal with the offender. But the victim probably will be too
embarrassed to tell everybody it got taken. By contrast, a victimized
government shouts its plight to the planet. That's because while a
business operates as a united team, a government is in a constant
state of rebellion. One group is always attempting a hostile
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   State government is two adversarial branches (excluding courts,
which are less influential on policy than the court of public
opinion). More to the point, state government is composed of two
political parties, each trying to capitalize on the other's missteps,
perpetually playing gotcha.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that volatile mix in Sacramento a large Capitol press
corps, ready to pounce on any whiff of scandal.</TE>
<TE>   At every turn there are checks and balances. And unlike at a
business, there also are megaphones.</TE>
<TE>   So for Oracle Corp. and Logicon Inc., their fat deal with the
Davis administration was literally too good to be true. It was a
six-year, $95-million "volume discount" software buy that figures to
cost the state $41 million more than if it had never happened. That's
according to state Auditor Elaine Howle.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and Logicon dispute the auditor's numbers, but nobody's
listening. Not even Republicans, who ordinarily would be expected to
hear out "the private sector." In this case, Gov. Gray Davis is an
irresistible, legitimate target.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fair to say, this was a bad deal for the state of
California," says Sen. Chuck Poochigian (R-Fresno), a member of the
investigating Joint Legislative Audit Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "You know there's a problem when the principals involved [Oracle
and Logicon] are saying they're perfectly willing to undo the deal.
It looks very, very bad."</TE>
<TE>   The world got wind of this deal's stench because Oracle and
Logicon dealt with state government. All the checks and balances
worked, partly because the state must share records with the public.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was signed last May 31, and by summer, the San Jose
Mercury News ran an investigative story. A legislative committee then
held a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Computer-savvy Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) watched two
administration officials-- department directors Elias Cortez of
Information Technology and Barry Keene of General Services (recently
bounced)-- enthusiastically defend the contract. "It made me mad,"
she says. "It didn't smell right."</TE>
<TE>   Bowen asked for an audit by Howle, who works for the Legislature.
The audit--precise and written in plain English--was delivered April
16, sparking the furor and creating a steady stream of news stories.</TE>
<TE>   The joint audit committee jumped on the scandal and is holding
hearings, putting witnesses under oath.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is chaired by an ambitious Democrat-- Assemblyman Dean
Florez of Shafter--who'd like to make a name for himself. But that's
how it's supposed to work. This is not a private corporation of toady
VPs, after all. And it's taxpayers' money that's being spent.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get our money back," Florez says, "and come to some
conclusion about how we got to this point."</TE>
<TE>   Says Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), a former prosecutor:
"The more questions we ask, the more rocks we uncover. And nothing
good can be found under a rock."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist, says this scandal has caught
the public's attention because "everybody's frustrated by computers.
They get mad when a computer crashes. They end up buying a whole
bunch of stuff they don't need because the salesman tells them it's
important. People can completely identify with what the state's going
through."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Wilson, who manages a corporate PR firm, says Oracle and
Logicon "are wise to want to get out of this contract quickly. It
hurts their ability to communicate a positive message. And who wants
to have your employees dragged up before some investigative committee
looking for scapegoats?"</TE>
<TE>   Companies love government contracts because they're long-term and
lucrative. Governments also don't do Chapter 11s.</TE>
<TE>   But beware of the dream deals. They can become nightmares.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Vows to Fight Cuts in His Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said the county has
proposed to cut his budget by $8.4 million, which he said would
hamper his ability to fight welfare fraud and prosecute high-profile
cases like the Rampart scandal.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting with aides to the five county supervisors, Cooley
said next year's budget plan relies too heavily on state grants
dedicated to specific programs and staff.</LD>
<LD>   Without more county funds, he said, he would lack flexibility to
handle major cases that might arise.</LD>
<TE>   The D.A.'s office is facing its first budget cuts since the
1993-94 fiscal year. The county proposes to contribute $115 million
to his $240.4-million budget next year. The rest would come from
state and federal grants.</TE>
<TE>   Among the county's proposed cuts is $2.4 million earmarked for
investigating and prosecuting welfare fraud. "We are inviting huge
fraud that will embarrass this county," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to fight for an additional $20 million to make up for
the $8.4-million cut and the loss of state grants and to fund new
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors will hold a hearing June 17 on the
district attorney's budget.</TE>

<LD>A man was fatally stabbed in Northridge, another man was shot and
killed in Granada Hills, and an unidentified body was found in the
trunk of a car in San Fernando in unrelated cases, police said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Angry words between two roommates led to the fatal stabbing about
5:30 p.m. Tuesday at a Northridge apartment, said LAPD Det. Mike
Oppelt of the Devonshire Division.</LD>
<LD>   George Meadors, 52, was being held in lieu of $1-million bail at
the Van Nuys jail after he allegedly stabbed Daren Carter, 41, at an
apartment that belonged to an acquaintance of the two men in the 8700
block of Canby Avenue in Northridge, Oppelt said.</LD>
<TE>   Carter was pronounced dead a short time later at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center. Meadors fled shortly after the stabbing, but
police found him at the apartment that he shared with Carter in the
15900 block of Victory Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, LAPD Devonshire
Division detectives were called to investigate the killing of a
23-year-old man found at Balboa Boulevard and San Jose Street in
Granada Hills, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The man, identified as Jacob Misrachi, 23, had been shot once in
the head near his apartment. Police said they had no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, L.A. County Sheriff's Department detectives were
investigating whether the person whose body was found in the trunk of
an abandoned car in a grocery store parking lot in San Fernando died
as a result of foul play. The body was found about 7 a.m. Wednesday
in the 2000 block of Glenoaks Boulevard, said Sheriff's Deputy Steve
Jauch.</TE>

<HD>Detention Puzzles Doctor's Family</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Supporters press for the release of the Anaheim
physician held by Israel on terrorism charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the family and friends of Riad Abdelkarim, these days of waiting
are filled with questions and dread, questions and fear, questions
and more questions.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Anaheim physician was detained Sunday in Israel and
subsequently arrested on suspicion of terrorist activities,
Abdelkarim's supporters have heard nothing about what he has
allegedly done wrong. David Douek of the Israel Consulate in Los
Angeles said Wednesday that authorities have "pretty much closed the
case" to further public disclosures because of national security
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The silence has magnified the puzzling character of the doctor's
case. Abdelkarim, 34, was a board member of the Holy Land Foundation,
a Dallas-based Islamic charity that was shut down in December by the
U.S. government on charges that it funneled funds to the militant
group Hamas. But Abdelkarim was found to be clean by the FBI after
questioning last fall and had frequently traveled to Israel without
incident, as recently as January.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the shadowy men of the terrorist network Al Qaeda,
Abdelkarim was a highly public figure who wrote more than 200
articles, spoke at community forums and volunteered for medical
relief missions. In his most recent trip, he had traveled to Israel
at the invitation of the International Medical Corps, a Los
Angeles-based global humanitarian organization, to assess health
needs in the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   His family says this Santa Monica native of Palestinian descent
was a quintessential American who played Little League baseball,
favored hamburgers over hummus, made high school valedictorian and
led his class in the Pledge of Allegiance. He was also a typical
Californian, his family says, who swam and bodysurfed growing up
around his father's market in Hermosa Beach and considered himself a
die-hard Los Angeles Lakers fan.</TE>
<TE>   "Riad is as American as they come," said his brother Basil, a
Bellflower physician. "This is almost like a smear campaign to
present him as a terrorist. The most important thing to understand
about Riad is that he is a humanitarian, and this should not be a
crime."</TE>
<TE>   The physician's supporters have engaged in a flurry of activity to
win his freedom. On Wednesday, the Muslim Public Affairs Council in
Los Angeles and the Anaheim office of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations asked Abdelkarim's congressional representative, U.S. Rep.
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), to appeal for his immediate
release. Lacking essential facts about the case, Cox said it was "not
my role" to press for Abdelkarim's release. But Cox said he was
working to ensure that Abdelkarim was afforded due process and other
legal rights.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, Najee Ali said he would represent the Muslim American
Society, the nation's leading organization of African American
Muslims, in traveling to Israel next week to make a religious appeal
for Abdelkarim's freedom.</TE>
<TE>   And in Orange County, a retired Christian minister who credits
Abdelkarim with saving her husband's life said she intends to raise
the issue of how to help the doctor and his family at an interfaith
meeting today. Connie Regener of Irvine said the man she knows only
as a compassionate healer had cared for her husband's diabetes, heart
irregularities and other problems a few years ago. Now, she said, it
was time to return the kindness.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so very supportive and kind to us in our emergency, and
now I'd like to see the same treatment extended to him," said
Regener, a member of a Christian-Muslim women's group that meets
monthly at the Crystal Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   As the activities mount, so do questions about what might have
triggered Abdelkarim's detention.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said Wednesday that he was told by the State Department that
Abdelkarim was being held on charges of being "a member of a
terrorist group" and "funneling funds to a terrorist group." If true,
that would likely pinpoint the physician's association with the Holy
Land Foundation, which Israel and the U.S. government have outlawed
on charges that it was a leading source of funds for Hamas suicide
bombings and other terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim joined the group's board last spring, arguing like
other Muslims that actions against Holy Land were primarily aimed at
demoralizing the Palestinian people. Foundation members deny the
terrorist charges and are suing the federal government for freezing
its funds.</TE>
<TE>   After U.S. authorities shut down the foundation, Abdelkarim
started a new charity, KinderUSA, in March aimed at helping children
in the West Bank and Gaza. The new charity sent out its first e-mail
appeal last month for $1 million to buy food, household items and
medical supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In an April 10 e-mail to The Times, Abdelkarim said founders of
the new charity included such prominent U.S. Muslim physicians as
Laila Al-Marayati of Glendale, a former member of the U.S. religious
freedom commission. The charity was in no way involved with Holy Land
members who were under the most scrutiny by investigators, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "They have their own problems to deal with," he wrote. "As for me,
I'm 'clean' as far as I'm concerned, and I couldn't sit by and watch
as the situation in Palestine worsened, with nobody there to help the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Others wonder if an impassioned letter Abdelkarim wrote from the
Jenin refugee camp displeased the Israelis. His April 29 letter spoke
of the stench of death, stories of executions and destruction, and
his shame at being a U.S. taxpayer subsidizing the Israeli military
arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to silence him," said Ibrahim Hooper of the
American-Islamic council in Washington. "To use the bogeyman of
terrorism is to keep people from assisting the Palestinians and
making their lives so miserable that they will buckle under."</TE>
<TE>   His four young children's questions are more immediate. Is Dad
going to make the Angels baseball game and the "Star Wars" film
opening, as he had promised?</TE>
<TE>   As the long days turn into sleepless nights, the children have
stayed out of school and the family has secluded itself. During a
visit to his Orange County home this week, the children described how
they had decorated the home with balloons for his homecoming, and
were looking forward to visits to Disneyland and the park with him.
Now, says his wife, Wijdan, no one has been able to eat or sleep
much.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want him home," said Wijdan as her eyes filled with
tears. "His children need him."</TE>

<HD>Man Pleads Not Guilty to Charges in Death of Police Dog</HD>
<DH>Crime: Defense attorney says his client is distraught.
Canine was fatally stabbed while subduing a suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man accused of fatally stabbing a police dog pleaded not
guilty in Ventura County Superior Court on Wednesday to charges
related to the animal's death.</LD>
<LD>   Through his attorney, 20-year-old Timothy Knight denied exhibiting
a weapon while resisting arrest, violating probation and harming a
police dog. Knight hid behind a partition to avoid being photographed
by the media during his brief court appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Robert Sandbach said after the hearing that his
client is distraught over the death of Rudy, a 4-year-old Belgian
Malinois, who brought Knight down during a confrontation with Oxnard
police April 19.</LD>
<TE>   "He is very upset," Sandbach said. "Everyone in the community is
upset by Rudy's death."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, the stabbing occurred after Officer J.R.
Perez, who was on patrol with Rudy and looking for a suspect, stopped
a car in which Knight was riding to determine if he was the same man.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who has been in and out of jail for various misdemeanor
crimes in recent years, allegedly brandished a double-edged diving
knife at the officer, authorities said. As Knight began to run away,
Perez ordered Rudy to subdue him.</TE>
<TE>   The dog was stabbed once in the left lower chest, said Senior
Deputy Dist. Atty. Cheryl Temple. Rudy was taken to a pet emergency
hospital in Ventura, but could not be saved.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy was the first Oxnard Police Department dog to die in the line
of duty. A memorial service last week at the Oxnard Performing Arts
Center drew several hundred uniformed officers and residents who were
touched by accounts of the dog's death.</TE>
<TE>   While Sandbach expressed remorse for the dog, he also urged the
public not to jump to conclusions about his client's role in the
incident. He noted that Oxnard police have been criticized for a
spate of officer-involved shootings in the past year and questioned
whether officers acted properly in Knight's arrest. If they didn't,
he said, there could be self-defense issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we would be remiss if we didn't look at whether the
officer's use of force was appropriate," said Sandbach, who plans to
review the police dispatch tapes to determine what happened before
Perez set Rudy on his client. .</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the criminal charges, Knight faces allegations that
he wielded a knife. If convicted on all counts, Knight faces up to
six years, eight months in state prison and two felony strikes on his
criminal record. A preliminary hearing is set for June 10. Knight
remains in jail in lieu of $510,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Beach to Stay Open to Off-Roaders</HD>
<DH>Parks: Coastal panel says rules for Oceano Dunes won't
change until a study is done. An at-risk bird is at issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Coastal Commission on Wednesday agreed to keep open
the only beach in Southern and Central California where off-road
vehicles can race along the water's edge, despite objections from
environmentalists that the traffic threatens the survival of an
endangered shorebird.</LD>
<LD>   Before adopting any more restrictions, the commission will wait
for a panel of advisors to study the dunes near Pismo Beach and
recommend how to better separate dune buggies and off-road bikes from
the western snowy plover that nests on the beach.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission decided to go with the status quo," said
Chairwoman Sara Wan. "We decided to give it a couple of more years
and see if it can work."</LD>
<TE>   The commission's decision comes as the Oceano Dunes State
Recreation Area, formerly called Pismo Dunes, is preparing for the
Memorial Day invasion of dirt bikes, sand rails, Jeeps and trucks
that congregate there every three-day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 47,500 people showed up for the long weekend that kicks
off the summer, and state park rangers expect a similar showing.</TE>
<TE>   Off-roaders from throughout California prefer the magnificent
seaside dunes in the summer, when other popular off-road destinations
in the desert get too hot.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Coastal Commission's permit, the state beach limits
traffic to 4,300 vehicles a day. But the limit is lifted for the
weekends attached to Memorial and Labor days, July 4 and
Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, the Sierra Club sued the California Department of
Parks and Recreation on grounds that by permitting the beach traffic,
state officials are causing the deaths of federally protected species
and destroying their habitat.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the snowy plover, Oceano Dunes is home to another
endangered shorebird, the least tern. A creek that off-road vehicles
must cross to get to the beach has been known to harbor endangered
steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shameful embarrassment for the state to allow the imminent
extinction of the snowy plover," said Mark Massara, director of the
Sierra Club's coastal program. "Our actions may be too late, but we
couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't try."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Pacific Legal Foundation and a group of off-road
enthusiasts called Friends of the Oceano Dunes sued the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, arguing that it illegally designated the dunes and
miles of other coastal areas as "critical habitat" for the plovers by
failing to consider economic impacts.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to force the government to adhere to Congress' intent,
and the intent was to consider the effect on people," said Russell
Brooks, attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that designating the
area as plover habitat did not result in any economic impact, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But his clients maintain that if the beach is closed, it will
result in the loss of $110 million to the area's economy contributed
by the more than 1 million off-road enthusiasts who visit San Luis
Obispo County every year.</TE>
<TE>   "The handwriting is pretty well on the wall for the final order
shutting down the beach and the dunes," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed this week, in advance of the Coastal
Commission's annual review of the permit for off-road vehicles to use
the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Busloads of off-roaders packed the commission hearing in Santa
Rosa, drawn by e-mail alerts saying the commission would place more
of the beach off limits or close it to vehicles altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Although the commission has the power to do so, such an action was
not on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the board kept the same restrictions as last year, which
limits off-road vehicles to about a third of the 3,500-acre state
park.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 1,000 plovers, a once-abundant shorebird, remain in
California. A biologist found nests of 33 pairs in 2001 at Oceano
Dunes, one of the few nesting grounds in the state not lost to
development.</TE>

<LD>Several thousand dollars was missing from a Hollywood Hills home
intentionally set afire Saturday and where four people were found
dead, the family's attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Pierpont Laidley, an attorney for Harish "Harry" Kumar, said
$3,000 to $4,000 that Kumar's wife, who died along with her two
children and Kumar's mother, should have been counting on Saturday
night is unaccounted for. The money was in small bills and coins
taken in by motels the family owns.</LD>
<LD>   Laidley, the family business' attorney, said Gita Kumar had
returned from India on Friday and was catching up on bookkeeping.</LD>
<TE>   "The money is missing," Laidley said, suggesting that it may be
tied to the crime. "It is a substantial sum of money for some
people."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD robbery-homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau would not comment on the
case, but he said police have no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Gita Kumar, 43, Paras Kumar, 18, Tulsi Kumar, 16, and Sitaben
Patel, 63, died in the Lakeridge Drive home.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the fire started in two bedrooms and that a
flammable liquid was detected in more than one location.</TE>
<TE>   Harish Kumar, 47, told investigators he returned home from a trip
to Bakersfield with friends about 11:15 p.m. Saturday to discover the
house on fire and immediately called 911. He was interviewed by
detectives for several hours on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The county coroner's office examined the bodies Tuesday, but more
tests will be conducted to determine the cause of death, said Craig
Harvey, the coroner's chief of operations. The tests could take up to
eight weeks, he said.</TE>

<LD>A Palmdale man convicted of fatally shooting three men at an Arleta
birthday party last year was sentenced to life in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Charles Peven on Wednesday sentenced Juan
Guillen, 26, to three life sentences without the possibility of
parole for the murders, and three sentences of 25 years to life for
discharging a firearm.</LD>
<LD>   Guillen was found guilty in March of first-degree murder in the
Jan. 14, 2001, shooting deaths of Joel Gonzalez, 27, of Arleta; Jesse
Abel, 24, of Pacoima; and Jack Loutsios, 17, of North Hills. Before
the sentencing Wednesday, Loutsios' mother, Donna Loutsios, read a
statement in the San Fernando courtroom.</LD>
<TE>   "Jack was a nice young man that deserved to live his life, not to
die at the hands of an animal," she said, her voice quivering.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up a framed photo of her son taken on his 17th birthday,
she continued: "I want you to see his photo. This is Jack. He was
handsome and had a small little smile."</TE>
<TE>   Peven said Guillen, who had been convicted of attempted murder in
the wounding of 21-year-old German Lopez at the Arleta party, should
be retried on that charge. The judge ruled that, despite the jury's
decision, insufficient evidence was presented at trial to warrant a
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Guillen's attorney, Nancy Mazza, said she
had hoped that Guillen would be eligible for parole. The convictions
will be appealed, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know in my heart he didn't do this," Mazza said.Guillen's wife,
Maria, 26, said his family and friends are raising money for an
appeal. She maintained her husband's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have faith in God," she said. "That's what's keeping us
going through all of this."</TE>

<HD>Money Woes Forecast for Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Secession: California controller's report, to be released
today, asserts an independent city would start off with a debt of
$9.2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An independent Hollywood city would not be financially viable because
it would begin life with a $9.2-million deficit that could swell to
about $26 million within three years, according to a state
controller's report to be issued today.</LD>
<LD>   The report could deliver a blow to the Hollywood secession
movement if its findings are embraced by a state commission studying
the cityhood proposal. To place the secession measure on the ballot,
the commission must determine that a Hollywood city would be
financially healthy.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the number of dollars coming in and the number of dollars
that would have to be spent, we do not feel that there is a positive
outlook for the fiscal viability of any new Hollywood city," said
state Controller Kathleen Connell.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn asked Connell to review an initial analysis by
the Local Agency Formation Commission, which found Hollywood could
survive economically if it left Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not be surprised that the report would show that
[Hollywood] would be operating with a deficit," Hahn spokeswoman
Julie Wong said. She said the mayor had not seen the report.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the Hollywood secession movement brushed off
Connell's dire conclusions, saying that any forecasted deficit could
easily be erased. A new Hollywood would be a far more efficient place
than the city it parted with, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of spending your money wisely that's going to make
the difference," said Gene LaPietra, president of the secessionist
group Hollywood VOTE. "We're not going to cut services at all. All
services will be enhanced because we'll have plenty more money to do
it with."</TE>
<TE>   In two other secession reports last month, Connell said that an
independent San Fernando Valley would need to build up its budget
reserves and that a breakaway harbor area could not survive
financially, a conclusion hotly contested by secessionists. On
Wednesday, she said Hollywood, with annual revenue of about $148
million, would be in a worse situation than the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO, which is determining whether the three secession proposals
will go on the ballot, is poised to release its final report on the
harbor area's viability. The harbor secession plan might be on shaky
ground, because the commission appears to be having trouble finding
enough revenue to declare the area's finances solid.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Calemine, LAFCO's executive director, said the harbor area
report likely would be finished Friday. He said he would not comment
on Connell's Hollywood report before reading it.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO is free to accept Connell's findings in whole or in part, or
to dismiss them entirely. The commission will decide during the next
several weeks whether to place the secession proposals on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a LAFCO report said a Hollywood city would be
financially viable. Connell said LAFCO had incorrectly factored in a
$10-million loan to the proposed city and a $10-million cut in

<TE>   Connell said she compared Hollywood's prospective budget reserve
with those of 38 cities with populations between 160,000 and 203,000.
The average city in that group has a reserve of 14%, she said.
Hollywood's population would be 185,000 to 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   LaPietra said the Hollywood figures provided to Connell by Los
Angeles were inflated, outdated, and based on a larger secession
area. Hollywood VOTE, the secession group, originally proposed
borders as far south as the Beverly Center. Several boundary
proposals are still on the table, but none goes farther south than
Melrose Avenue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   LaPietra cited the city's $40-million budget for police in
Hollywood as one of many inflated figures. The estimate was based on
a staff of 397 officers, whereas Hollywood now only has 223, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "From the very first day, we're going with the Sheriff's
Department," he said. "We're going to save millions, and we're not
going to be billed for things we don't get."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) said he
is exploring whether to run for mayor of a new Valley city, joining
state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), who had previously said he
likely will seek the post.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been talking to a number of people about the possibility of
running," Richman said, adding that he supports secession because he
believes that City Hall has neglected the Valley for years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for the Valley to take control of its own destiny," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Bill on Schools Watchdog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State lawmakers scaled back legislation to expand the powers of L.A.
Unified Inspector General Don Mullinax Wednesday night after
passionate opposition from school Supt. Roy Romer, but agreed to
ensure that the watchdog post continues to exist well into the
future.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly Education Committee ultimately approved the bill by
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) on an 11-0 vote. But first,
it watered down the enhanced authority Richman originally had called
for and essentially turned it into a measure guaranteeing that the
inspector general job will continue until 2015. The position's
state-granted subpoena powers are set to expire in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Unified's inspector general rose to public prominence in the
imbroglio over the Belmont Learning Center, a massive high school
complex west of downtown that has been stalled for years because of
environmental concerns.</LD>
<TE>   But to critics, that controversy only highlighted the post's
limited authority. Supporters of Richman's bill, which include United
Teachers-Los Angeles, believe the inspector general needs to be
better funded--and more independent of the school district--to better
do the job.</TE>
<TE>   Richman had argued that given L.A. Unified's checkered history on
construction projects, the mammoth school district and its $9-billion
budget should be more closely scrutinized. His measure would have
encoded the inspector general position directly into state law,
taking it out of the control of local school officials, and would
have required the school board to provide whatever money the
inspector general needed to perform his duties.</TE>
<TE>   But Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns after
testimony by Romer that the measure would create an inspector general
so powerful that he would "not be accountable to anybody." L.A.
Unified, Romer argued, would have a hard time finding anyone to be a
superintendent if the bill became law.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified projects that it will have to build 85 schools this
decade, a massive undertaking that will require the district to hire
scores of construction companies and environmental consultants. But
Mullinax has a budget of only $6.2 million--less, Richman noted, than
the budget of the inspector general at another massive Los Angeles
bureaucracy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is a
fraction of the size of L.A. Unified. But lawmakers questioned the
need to add broader powers after Mullinax noted that he "can do
everything" he needs to fight waste "without the legislation," and is
not seeking to enhance his budget. Rather, he said, he was mainly
concerned with ensuring that future school boards could not eliminate
his position.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers went only that far. "I don't have a problem saying, we
need it," said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), a
former L.A. Unified board member. "In a district this size, we will
forever need it."</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Input Deadline Is Pushed Back</HD>
<DH>Development: County panel delays action on the project's
environmental review until June. State agencies sought the extension.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to pressure from state agencies, an advisory panel
considering the Ahmanson Ranch housing development agreed Wednesday
to extend through mid-June its deadline for receiving public
comments.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-1 vote by the Ventura County Environmental Report Review
Committee followed a three-hour hearing during which opponents
continued to raise long-standing concerns. Among the questions are
how traffic, water and wildlife would be affected by the 3,050-home
project planned at the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties.</LD>
<LD>   The extension of the May 1 deadline gives the regional water
board, state Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service until June 19 to weigh in.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors approved the project in 1992, but it has been slowed
by lawsuits and the discovery of a rare frog and a species of flower
previously thought to be extinct.</TE>

<HD>A Latino Census Recount</HD>
<DH>Population: Tally failed to identify 200,000 Central
Americans in area, an analysis finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of people of Central American ancestry residing in the
Greater Los Angeles area is almost 50% greater than reported in
Census 2000, according to an analysis of census data to be released
today.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Latino think tank, found
that residents in the region with Central America origins approached
645,000, with Salvadorans as the largest group. That compares to a
Census 2000 count of fewer than 437,000 Central Americans in Los
Angeles and three neighboring counties.</LD>
<LD>   The study tends to back complaints from representatives of
fast-growing Central American, Dominican and South American
communities nationwide that the census severely underreported their
numbers by grouping them into a category with other Latinos.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew all along there were a lot more of us than the census
counted," said Carlos H. Vaquerano, executive director of the
Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Since details about Census 2000 began emerging last year, some
activists and scholars have argued that the count failed to capture
the growing diversity of national backgrounds among the nation's more
than 35 million Latinos. Some fear far-reaching consequences in such
areas as public funding, political representation and immigration
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The study dampens speculation generated by Census 2000 that
growing ranks of U.S. Latinos were eschewing national labels and
instead gravitating toward a "pan-Latino" identity. Rather, the
report cites a change in the questionnaire as the likely reason so
many Latinos failed to specify national roots.</TE>
<TE>   In asking about Latinos' origins, the 2000 census form included
check boxes for respondents of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban
backgrounds--the three largest groups. Anyone not fitting into those
categories was asked to check the "other Spanish/Hispanic, Latino"
box and write in their groups.</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike the 1990 form, which provided write-in
examples--such as "Salvadoran" and "Colombian"--the Census 2000
questionnaire included no such guides. A census bureau review has
already concluded that this and other changes in the question may
have altered results.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you change a word or a phrase in a question it can lead
to different responses," said Roberto Ramirez, a census survey
statistician.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, almost 18% of Latino respondents did not
specify a national origin in Census 2000 and instead ended up in the
generic "other" Latino category. That number is well above the 10% or
so of Latinos who traditionally place themselves in the "other" group
on government surveys.</TE>
<TE>   Since the new study does not attempt to count people missed by
Census 2000, it does not change the tally of the overall Latino
population.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the report redistributes almost 3 million "other" Latinos
nationwide among national origin groups. That brings the "other"
Latino category closer to the historical 10% level.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were counted, but they were put in the wrong box,"
said Roberto Suro, executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center,
which is based in Washington but is a project of USC.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the statistical reshuffling, the study found that
more than 340,000 people of Salvadoran backgrounds were living in the
Los Angeles area--60% more than the 213,000 officially reported in
Census 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the study counted 186,500 residents of Guatemalan
ancestry here, 58% more than the census number of 118,000.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers here correspond to residents of the federally
designated Los Angeles metropolitan area, a vast swath that includes
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The
region is home to the nation's largest Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   Central Americans began to arrive in great numbers during the
1970s, as civil strife overtook the isthmus.</TE>
<TE>   While growing briskly, their numbers are still dwarfed by a
population of 5.3 million people of Mexican origin in and around Los
Angeles, the new study shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that Mexicans are the majority here, but they are
not the only Latinos anymore," said Vaquerano, of the Central
American assistance organization. "Politicians have to recognize that
we are here too and we have our own needs and deserve to be paid
attention to."</TE>
<TE>   The new numbers, like census counts, include immigrants and
U.S.-born Latinos--who, in some cases, have lived here for
generations. Neither the study nor the census distinguishes between
legal and illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the study found that the more than 22 million people
of Mexican ancestry account for more than 62% of all Latinos, a
slight increase compared to Census 2000 calculations.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 10% of the nation's Latinos have Puerto Rican
origins, 6.6% cite Central America as their ancestral home, almost 5%
South America and 3.6% Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In the New York City area, with the nation's second-largest
metropolitan Latino population, the Pew study found that people who
trace their ancestry to the Dominican Republic were underreported by
almost 25%, and now number more than half a million. The Pew study is
the latest to quell enthusiasm for a popular post-Census 2000 theory:
that that the big jump in "other Hispanic" respondents may signal a
turn away from national identifications among Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there is no question that some Latinos do embrace a
pan-Latino identity--a trend that many expect to accelerate,
especially as intermarriage across national origins increases and
Latinos are more removed from their roots.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Promotes L.A. Zoo Director</HD>
<DH>Recreation: With appointment, Hahn hopes to spruce up
parks, calm seccesionists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo, who is credited with
revamping the once-blighted city zoo, was promoted Wednesday to
general manager of the city's Department of Recreation and Parks as
part of Mayor James K. Hahn's efforts to clean up urban parks and
stave off secession.</LD>
<LD>   "He has done a terrific job running the L.A. Zoo," Hahn said of
his new parks manager, who joined the mayor at a news conference at a
park in Boyle Heights, where Mollinedo, 56, grew up.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking forward to him continuing to work with us to provide
the city with safe and clean places," Hahn said. "We think those
people who are talking about breaking up this great city of Los
Angeles could jeopardize our efforts to improve these park spaces."</LD>
<TE>   Zoo staffers reacted quickly to the news by naming a newborn
mountain tapir--which looks like a furry striped piglet--Manuel in
honor of their departing director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of bittersweet, but the mayor didn't give me much
choice," Mollinedo said, laughing, shortly after his announcement.
Later, he posed with his new namesake, then washed baby tapir slobber
off his hands before grabbing budget books and hurrying off to a
meeting at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The high-profile position may be even more visible as Hahn seeks
to make the refurbishment of existing parks and the creation of new
ones an important part of his campaign to persuade disgruntled
residents not to secede. Hahn hopes residents will see that being
part of sprawling Los Angeles means more financial resources--not
fewer--to clean up neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Since February 1995, when Mollinedo became director, the L.A. Zoo
has gone from a cramped, disease-ridden facility that almost lost its
accreditation to a critically praised zoo with expanded spaces for
some animals, state-of-the-art quarters for chimpanzees and
orangutans, and a new animal hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo also refurbished the fine mesh coverings over big
exhibits. Years of wear had allowed skunks to get through the mesh
and pass infection to animals.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Mollinedo became as skilled at nurturing
languishing animals as he did at handling city politicians, eccentric
zoo donors and prickly celebrities. He had to negotiate the line
between accommodating movie stars and donors wanting
behind-the-scenes tours and keeping people away from essentially wild
animals.</TE>
<TE>   The line got crossed last summer when a Komodo dragon took a bite
out of the foot of actress Sharon Stone's husband, newspaper
publisher Phil Bronstein. Mollinedo coped well with inquisitive media
members and an angry Stone, and restricted up-close visits with zoo
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has no degrees in zoology or veterinary medicine,
Mollinedo turned himself into a student of animals, able to converse
easily on obscure species and fly to Colombia to discuss mountain
tapir breeding programs with wildlife experts. Since he took over,
the zoo has received two accreditations from the American Zoo and
Aquarium Assn., most recently in March. But the association said the
zoo's animals were geriatric and criticized the zoo's powerful
fund-raising arm, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., for having too
much authority.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo said the animals have become aged because he and his
staff more aggressively care for elderly animals these days.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, we have some gibbons with diabetes," he said. "In
the old days, we used to euthanize them. Now, we train the gibbons to
come up to the back of the exhibit and put an arm up against the
chain-link fence so they can get a shot of insulin."</TE>
<TE>   But the director added that the zoo is already preparing for the
inevitable death of its older male giraffe, Kito, by considering how
to bring in a younger male.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo, who holds a master's degree in public administration
from Cal State L.A., is a more likely director of parks than zoos.</TE>
<TE>   He had run the city Parks and Recreation Department in Austin,
Texas, and was an assistant general manager with L.A.'s Recreation
and Parks Department before taking on the L.A. Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mollinedo won't take over the stewardship of the city's
parks and recreation centers until July 1--an appointment which still
must be confirmed by the City Council--he already has some ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "This city is so park-poor," he lamented.</TE>
<TE>   As a child in the city, he played at Pecan Playground at the Aliso
Pico Recreation Center and loved the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to play in the L.A. River," he said, and chuckled about
how he would get into trouble for it. "I really would like to see the
department involved in turning the river into a long linear park that
could connect a lot of parks.</TE>
<TE>   "It could connect the Sepulveda basin, Elysian Park, Griffith
Park. It could be this link that connects the city."</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo, who makes $164,000 a year at the zoo and could make as
much as $223,000 annually--the upper salary level for the Recreation
and Parks manager--turned down the same job three years ago when
Mayor Richard Riordan offered it.</TE>
<TE>   "There was still a lot more to do at the zoo," said Mollinedo, who
is so devoted to the zoo that he only wears ties adorned with
animals.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he says, Hahn was convinced Mollinedo was the only man
for the job. "I guess what I see myself bringing is a sensitivity to
urban parks," he says.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mollinedo added, he would like to see Griffith Park,
where the zoo is located, managed not just as an urban park but also
as an environmentally sensitive area.</TE>
<TE>   "How many other cities can boast that they have a 4,200-acre
park?" says Mollinedo, showing that he is already beginning to master
the factoids of his new job.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Eric Garcetti says Mollinedo has a "proven track
record.... We've put a big burden on our parks department. People are
hungry for parks. We have passed bonds that have allowed us to build
things and now we have to maintain them."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's effort is a continuation of the Clean and Safe Spaces
Program, started by Riordan in November 2000, which has refurbished
47 parks. At least 10 recent renovations--parks and centers in Watts,
Echo Park, North Hollywood and South L.A.--have been completed under
Hahn's administration. The mayor wants to overhaul additional 50
parks over the next 12 months.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Trooper Found Guilty in Theft of Impounded Cocaine</HD>

<LD>A former California Highway Patrol officer was convicted Wednesday of
taking part in what authorities described as the largest theft of
drugs from any law enforcement agency in the state.</LD>
<LD>   George Michael Ruelas, 43, faces a possible life prison term for
his role in the disappearance of nearly 650 pounds of cocaine from an
evidence locker at the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement in
Riverside over the Fourth of July holiday weekend in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   After deliberating less than two hours, a Los Angeles federal
court jury found Ruelas guilty of conspiracy and possession of
narcotics intended for distribution. U.S. District Judge Christina A.
Snyder set sentencing for Aug. 26.</LD>
<TE>   Ruelas, a 13-year CHP veteran, was one of three rogue law
enforcement officers who staged a fake burglary at the narcotic
bureau office and then peddled the drugs through a Manhattan Beach
dealer, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The other officers were Ruelas' half brother, Richard Wayne
Parker, 47, a veteran narcotics agent assigned to the Riverside
office; and Michael Wilcox, 42, Ruelas' former CHP partner.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Attys. Beverly Reid O'Connell and Lisabeth Rhodes
said the three netted about $1.8 million from the cache.</TE>
<TE>   Parker was convicted of the cocaine theft in 1999. He is serving a
life prison term. Wilcox was later indicted on charges of structuring
cash bank deposits to avoid federal reporting requirements. Under
questioning, he implicated himself and Ruelas in the theft.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, he said, came up with the idea to steal the cocaine while
the office was closed over the holiday. Wilcox said he served as a
lookout as Ruelas entered the evidence vault, using a key and an
access code provided by Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said Ruelas left behind a mechanical door spreader and a
set of alligator clips attached to the alarm box to make it look as
if the office had been burglarized.</TE>
<TE>   Because Parker was expected to come under scrutiny, it was decided
that he would stay away that night so he could establish an alibi,
according to Wilcox.</TE>
<TE>   After loading several duffel bags filled with cocaine into his
sport utility vehicle, Wilcox said, he drove to his home near Fresno.
Periodically over the next year, he said, Ruelas would drive there to
pick up consignments of cocaine intended for sale in the Southern
California area.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid for leniency, Wilcox agreed to wear a concealed recording
device and met with Ruelas before Thanksgiving in 1999 at an East
L.A. restaurant. Portions of the tape were played for the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ruelas never directly admitted taking part in the heist,
his comments proved damaging.</TE>
<TE>   "I always made sure you got yours," he told Wilcox, an apparent
reference to an agreement to split the proceeds, O'Connell told the
jury. Wilcox, the prosecution's star witness, testified that he
received about $600,000 from drug sales handled by Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the stand in his defense, Ruelas said he was driving to
Tucson on the night of July 4, 1997, when prosecutors say the locker
was raided. He said he left California about 3 p.m. and arrived in
Tucson about 10:30 p.m. at his mother-in-law's home.</TE>
<TE>   To back up his account, defense lawyers introduced a billing
statement showing that Ruelas' credit card was used to buy gas in
Tucson on July 4, 1997. Prosecutors countered with records showing
that the Ruelas credit card was used in Tucson at 10:58 that morning,
when, by all accounts, he was still in California.</TE>
<TE>   Ruelas' defense team was caught off guard by the disclosure.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Sisters Discussing Dispute</HD>
<DH>Feud: The women have begun trying to resolve the handling
of a bequest to their father's library.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chilly relationship between former President Richard M. Nixon's
estranged daughters appears to be thawing.</LD>
<LD>   Two months after their dispute over a $19-million bequest to
Nixon's presidential library became public, Julie Nixon Eisenhower
and Tricia Nixon Cox talked by telephone Friday and over the weekend
in hopes of reconciling their differences, a library spokeswoman
said.</LD>
<LD>   Family friend and library board member Robert Abplanalp has been
working behind the scenes to broker a deal that would settle the
dispute. The bequest was made by the former president's longtime
friend Charles "Bebe" Rebozo.</LD>
<TE>   "We're delighted that conversations are going on between Mrs.
Eisenhower and Mrs. Cox and [are] hopeful of an outcome that will
take both Mr. Rebozo's wishes and the Nixon Foundation's interests
into account," said Arianna Barrios, a spokeswoman for the Richard M.
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo's bequest was announced shortly after his death four years
ago. But the money has been bottled up in Probate Court because of a
dispute between the president's daughters over how the money should
be spent.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower wants the funds to be controlled by the library's board
of directors, saying that that's the most professional way to manage
the money. Cox wants a three-person committee comprising the sisters
and Abplanalp to oversee the foundation's gift, as she says Rebozo's
will instructs.</TE>
<TE>   With Eisenhower's blessing, the Nixon Library filed a lawsuit this
year against Cox, demanding that the bequest be handed over to the
foundation immediately. In April, the Orange County judge handling
the case urged the women to work out their differences and settle the
dispute without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the conversations between Cox and Eisenhower wasn't
revealed, but library officials expressed optimism that the battle
might be nearing an end.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're talking, so we're hopeful," Barrios said.</TE>
<TE>   Inseparable as youngsters and close-knit during their father's
political triumphs and ultimate downfall in the White House,
Eisenhower and Cox became estranged shortly after their father's
death when differences over how to preserve Nixon's legacy surfaced.
For some time, they were not on speaking terms, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before May 1996, the sisters disagreed over how the
library should be managed and whether library director John Taylor
exerted too much control over the institution.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and her husband, New York attorney Edward Cox, wanted the
Nixon family to control the library's major decisions, including
budget matters.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower and her husband, David, however, favored having a
professional staff and independent board of directors. The
Eisenhowers split with the Coxes and worked with Taylor to adopt such
a structure.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the sisters worsened when it came time to decide
how Rebozo's bequest should be managed. Under the terms of Rebozo's
will, expenditures were to be approved by Nixon's daughters and
Abplanalp.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon Foundation attorney Robert Landon said that Abplanalp, a New
York industrialist, is trying to help the sisters settle the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand he is trying to promote some consensus among the
three," Landon said Wednesday. "He's trying to work directly with the
daughters."</TE>
<TE>   Landon said he didn't know the details of Abplanalp's proposal or
how close the parties are to an agreement.</TE>

<HD>Reaction to State Stamp From Angelenos: What Are We,
Chopped Liver?</HD>

<LD>"Greetings from California," says the new state stamp. Shouldn't that
be "Greetings from Northern California?" Or more accurately,
"Greetings from San Francisco?" The stamp is dominated by the Bay
Bridge, lighted at dusk, with the Transamerica pyramid and the rest
of the snooty San Francisco skyline in the background.</LD>
<LD>   A tourism spokeswoman up there told the Chronicle she was "honored
that San Francisco is selected to be represented in the majority of
images." But why was L.A. snubbed? The City of Angels has plenty of
landmarks. What about the famous Big Donut stand? The
frankfurter-shaped Tail of the Pup? The sculpture of the bearded
clown in a tutu on Main Street in Venice?</LD>
<LD>   An L.A. tourism spokesman denied L.A. was overlooked, pointing
out, "We got the palm trees." Well, I'm not even sure those are ours.
None of them resemble my favorite: the microwave tower disguised as a
palm along the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   But L.A.'s No. 1 in this category: Or so Britain's Economist seems
to think. Jack Ramsey of Glendale noticed that the magazine has an
article about gangs in south London with the headline, "Not Quite Los
Angeles, Yet."</TE>
<TE>   Escaping L.A.: On an overseas vacation, Bob Dickie of La Canada
Flintridge came upon an Irish company with two specialties that are
related, if you think about it .</TE>
<TE>   It's the best combination business I've heard of since Linda
Wright of Norco and other readers alerted me to a store for camping
honeymooners (see photos). The latter company, by the way, came about
through a merger of two stores.</TE>
<TE>   What a way to go: Frank Huff of Huntington Beach received a letter
from a funeral home with a unique service: a bit of jazz singing on
the waters (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Names that fit the business: Introducing Pasadena real estate
agent Meg Middleman....</TE>
<TE>   Annals of miscommunication: Anaheim contractor Scott Gannon
dispatched a worker to pick up a set of plans that had been left on
his project manager's porch.</TE>
<TE>   The worker phoned from the location later and asked which one he
should pick up. "Pick them all up," a somewhat puzzled Gannon said.
"How many are there?"</TE>
<TE>   "About 15," the worker said.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, he showed up in his pickup truck, carrying no
plans but a spectacular collection of plants.</TE>

<HD>San Pedro Tells the Mayor It's Nothing Personal</HD>
<DH>Government: Hahn might have to move if his neighbors
abandon L.A. through secession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He could have lived in a three-story, city-owned Tudor mansion just
minutes from his downtown office.</LD>
<LD>   But when James K. Hahn became mayor of Los Angeles last year, he
chose to stay in his snug tract house a few blocks from a sprawling
oil refinery in San Pedro. It's a 24-mile commute up the Harbor
Freeway to work, but that's not the worst of it.</LD>
<LD>   San Pedro has been seized by secession fever, leaving Hahn to
watch his own neighborhood try to escape the city he governs.</LD>
<TE>   And if that happens, he could be forced to move to keep L.A.
residency, a requirement for holding office. His sister, Los Angeles
City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who represents San Pedro, might have
to decamp with him to keep her seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jim Hahn would do well to learn a lesson from Al Gore,"
advised John Shallman, a Democratic political strategist. "Don't
forget your home. I mean, Al Gore lost Tennessee. If he had actually
paid attention to his own backyard, he would be president of the
United States right now."</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area's fate is far from certain. The head of the state
agency studying secession will decide later this week whether the
proposed municipality could survive financially, a precursor to a
citywide election on a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   It's nothing personal, Hahn's secessionist neighbors say. The
mayor's a good guy. He shows up for the annual Fourth of July parties
and chips in for burgers. He stops to chat when he's walking his dog
and sometimes hangs out with other parents at his 9-year-old son's
baseball games.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew him long before he was mayor," said Mary Bruno, 53.
"We're not running from Jim Hahn. But this is a chance for us to see
what we can do. Being as Los Angeles is just so huge, we can't
implement our ideas right here. The bureaucracy just seems to get
bigger and bigger."</TE>
<TE>   The push for San Fernando Valley cityhood is better known.
Hollywood's breakaway bid offers show-business sizzle. But the harbor
secession movement--a drive to split San Pedro and Wilmington off
from Los Angeles--is unfolding under the mayor's nose.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Mardesich, leader of the breakup crusade, lives right around
the corner from Hahn. Dave Rivera, a retired mail carrier who wants
to serve on a harbor city council, lives one street away.</TE>
<TE>   Even Hahn's next-door neighbor, air-conditioning repair student
Alfonso Nuno, supports secession because the harbor area could "just
do good on its own."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists gathered the signatures of 13,470 registered voters,
25% of the harbor area's total, to get the cityhood study underway.
They hope to place the proposal on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   It has all proved a bit awkward for the mayor, who has lived in
San Pedro for 16 years. His roots are in South Los Angeles, where
voters revered his late father, 10-term county Supervisor Kenneth
Hahn. The son relied on his dad's devoted African American base to
help propel him into the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   So why does he live in San Pedro, a working-class neighborhood
built by generations of Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing
families beside a bustling port? He married a "Pedro girl," as the
locals say.</TE>
<TE>   The chief executive of the nation's second-largest city lives in a
house about as distinctive as a box of oatmeal. The gray,
three-bedroom abode, built in 1961, belonged to the parents of Hahn's
wife, Monica, who gave it to her.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor insists that he gives plenty of attention to the harbor
area, home to about 140,000. He helped launch a community advisory
group to grapple with port problems. Three of the five harbor
commissioners he appointed are from the area. He's trying to develop
the waterfront with a promenade and clean up storage tanks of
hazardous materials.</TE>
<TE>   Many neighbors say they don't discuss politics with Hahn. Who
wants to bug him while he's taking out his trash? But Mardesich
relishes the confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while there, when he'd see me downtown, he'd yell, 'Hi,
neighbor!' I'd just say hi and then I'd [complain] about Los
Angeles," Mardesich said. "He'd say, 'It's your town!' and I'd say,
'Not for long!'"</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's younger sister, who was elected to the council last
year, says she's determined to show San Pedrans that Los Angeles
provides better services than a harbor city.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a political system that's extremely favorable to them
right now," she said. "The mayor lives here, his kids go to local
schools, the councilwoman lives here. Even our mom lives here! This
is the opportunity to have the kind of clout and get the ear of the
politicians like we've never had before. I think a lot of people are
thinking this may be a bad time to break away."</TE>
<TE>   The true depth of Pedro pain may never be known. If state analysts
decide the harbor city would outspend its revenue, secession won't
even make the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   City lawyers haven't determined for certain whether the residency
rules would require Hahn to leave San Pedro if the area quits L.A.</TE>
<TE>   If so, would he head to Getty House, the official mayoral mansion
in Windsor Square?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I guess," Hahn said. "But that's not going to happen if I
have anything to say about it."</TE>

<HD>Coastline Project May Finally Surface</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: Firm says it will break ground on a
long-awaited retail and entertainment complex next to Aquarium of the
Pacific. A pending suit may hamper plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of delays and controversy, an Ohio-based developer on
Wednesday announced plans to break ground next week on a $130-million
waterfront project billed as the cornerstone of Long Beach's effort
to remake itself into a West Coast Coney Island.</LD>
<LD>   But word of impending construction on the last stretch of
undeveloped land left on the Long Beach coastline drew mixed
responses in a city that has grown weary of broken promises.</LD>
<LD>   "I can recall at least three previous groundbreaking
announcements," said Vice Mayor Dan Baker, whose district includes
the site. "I'll believe it when I see bulldozers moving dirt."</LD>
<TE>   The 380,000-square-foot project, dubbed Pike at Rainbow Harbor,
formerly was known as the Queensway Bay Project. It is to include
restaurants and retail shops, a movie theater, an antique carousel
and a suspended footbridge on 18 acres of city-owned land south of
Ocean Boulevard between the Long Beach Convention Center and the
Aquarium of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for this along time," said Long Beach Mayor
Beverly O'Neil. "This is the linchpin that will bring the dredging of
the harbor, the building of the aquarium and enlargement of our
convention center together."</TE>
<TE>   Developers Diversified Realty Corp., which already has invested
more than $15 million in planning and preliminary studies on the
project, hopes to have it finished by August 2003, more than two
years behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach officials predict the Pike will eventually generate
$100 million a year in sales, and about $1 million a year in tax
revenues for the city, which is committed to building an adjacent
2,200-car parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   "We and the city have worked tirelessly to bring this project to
fruition," said Developers Diversified official Rod Chisessi. "It
completes the Queensway Bay master plan and will generate
significantly more visitors, and about 1,000 full- and part-time
local construction jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The Pike, which will be about 70,000 square feet smaller than
originally envisioned, is the centerpiece of a waterfront revival
proposed in 1992 as a way to attract visitors back to
once-beleaguered downtown Long Beach. Many other elements of that
plan have been built.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern with the Pike project is its impact on the
struggling $120-million aquarium, which has suffered a steady decline
in attendance and revenues since its robust opening in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Just a week ago, Aquarium of the Pacific President and Chief
Executive Warren Iliff announced he will retire in June. The
announcement came the same day that the city provided $700,000 to
help the aquarium make a $3.3-million bond payment.</TE>
<TE>   Iliff will be replaced by Jerry Schubel, former head of Boston's
New England Aquarium, who has plans to reverse the aquarium's
fortunes with a variety of improvements.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the aquarium is counting on its newest
attraction, Shark Lagoon, and the Pike's roughly 50 tenants to draw
more paying customers. The project's tenant roster will be announced
at the ceremonial groundbreaking next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Pike, which was named after a bustling amusement zone that
existed at the same location from 1905 to 1979, has had a tortured
history. Twice in recent years, the developer has been granted
last-minute extensions by the city after missing deadlines to begin
construction on the project, which is opposed by downtown merchants
and environmentalists who would prefer to see the site become a
seaside park.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the project was put on hold after two major movie
chains that were considered anchor tenants, Edwards Theaters and
later Resort Theaters of America Inc., filed for bankruptcy
protection. The firm found a third operator, Crown Theaters, to
commit to opening a 14-screen cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, the state Lands Commission removed an obstacle by
allowing construction of a multi-screen theater on public tidelands.
In exchange, the state will get 10 acres of land close to the Los
Angeles River in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some local officials fear that a pending lawsuit filed by
California Earth Corps, which claims the city and Lands Commission
failed to perform adequate environmental reviews, could hamper the
city's plans to sell $43 million in bonds to support the project.</TE>
<TE>   "This project will create a critical mass for us on the
waterfront," City Manager Henry Taboada said. "But I'm not going to
shout victory," he added, "until I see a shovel in the ground."</TE>

<HD>Third Trial Begins in Slaying of Teen Who Stole Pumpkin</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor says a Buena Park grandfather shot a
neighbor in anger. Defense attorney says the gun fired accidentally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Peter Solomona fatally shot a teenage neighbor who had stolen a
Halloween decoration from outside his home three years ago, it made
national headlines.</LD>
<LD>   To some, it was an example of a neighborhood feud turned deadly by
easy access to guns. To others, it was a tragic accident.</LD>
<LD>   But deciding what punishment Solomona should receive has proved
difficult.</LD>
<TE>   In his first trial, a jury convicted him of second-degree murder,
but the judge threw the verdict out because he said he gave the panel
improper instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona's second trial ended when a deeply divided jury could not
render a verdict. On Wednesday, a third jury was presented the task
of passing judgment on the Buena Park grandfather's actions.</TE>
<TE>   In opening arguments, prosecutor Carolyn Carlisle-Raines told the
jury of eight women and four men that Solomona was an angry man who
shot and killed Brandon Ketsdever on Oct. 18, 1999, because the teen
stole his plastic Halloween pumpkin. She said that Solomona's
accounts of what happened are inconsistent and that he lied under
oath in his previous trial.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Solomona testified that he had hid a gun under
the armrest of his car so he could take it to the store and sell it,
the prosecutor said. But in November 2001 Solomona testified he went
to grab his gun from inside his night stand when he heard rattling
noises at his doorstep the night of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona insists that the gun went off by mistake and that the
trigger was faulty. But Carlisle-Raines said the gun was in excellent
working condition.</TE>
<TE>   "That gun will not fire no matter if you hit it or strike it,
unless it is fired," she said. "The gun was held in the hand of a man
who was angry and wanted his pumpkin back."</TE>
<TE>   Solomona's attorney, Milton Grimes, said the shooting was an
accident because the gun discharged when Solomona bumped his hand
against Ketsdever's car.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes said Solomona was frightened when he heard noises outside
his home and saw his pumpkin was gone.</TE>
<TE>   When he confronted Ketsdever and his friends, Grimes said,
Solomona "was scared and nervous. He doesn't know what's going on,
but these are the people who have violated him."</TE>
<TE>   When the gun was fired, Solomona was "in shock, surprise,
stunned," the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that this was an unintentional shooting by
this man, that it was an unfortunate accident," Grimes told the jury.</TE>

<LD>An 82-year-old man was killed Wednesday evening when he drove his car
around a railroad crossing arm in Simi Valley and was struck by a
Metrolink passenger train traveling at nearly 80 mph, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The collision occurred at 5:24 p.m. at Los Angeles Avenue and
Sycamore Drive, about four miles west of the Simi Valley train
station, where several dozen passengers had gotten off moments
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The train, which was carrying 150 people, had originated at Los
Angeles' Union Station and was headed to Moorpark before continuing
on to Camarillo and Oxnard, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   None of the passengers on the commuter train was injured, but Jean
Potter, 56, of Simi Valley suffered minor cuts when her Ford Mustang
was struck by the victim's car, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who died in the collision was identified as Francisco
Aranda of Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   According to police and train officials, Aranda was driving a
white Chevrolet Lumina north on Sycamore Drive when he attempted to
drive across the tracks on Los Angeles Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears he went around or under a crossing gate that was down
and was struck," said Sharon Gavin, a Metrolink spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the collision, arms on both sides of the tracks
were down, red warning lights were flashing, and the train's horn had
sounded, Gavin said. .</TE>
<TE>   The injured woman was treated and released from Simi Valley
Hospital, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>An 82-year-old man was killed Wednesday evening when he drove his car
around a railroad crossing arm in Simi Valley and was struck by a
Metrolink passenger train traveling at nearly 80 mph, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The collision occurred at 5:24 p.m. at Los Angeles Avenue and
Sycamore Drive, about four miles west of the Simi Valley train
station, where several dozen passengers had debarked moments earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The train, which was carrying 150 people, had originated at Los
Angeles' Union Station and was headed to Moorpark before continuing
on to Camarillo and Oxnard, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This was horrendous," said Keith Futterman, 43, who was cooking
dinner in his house on Galena Avenue, adjacent to the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a boom and I knew something bad had happened," he said.
"It shook my house."</TE>
<TE>   None of the passengers on the commuter train was injured, but a
56-year-old Simi Valley woman, identified as Jean Potter, suffered
minor cuts when her Ford Mustang was struck by the victim's car,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who was killed was identified by authorities as Francisco
Aranda of Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   According to police and train officials, Aranda was driving a
white Chevrolet Lumina north on Sycamore Drive when he attempted to
drive across the tracks on Los Angeles Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears he went around or under a crossing gate that was down
and was struck," said Sharon Gavin, a Metrolink spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the collision, arms on both sides of the tracks
were down, red warning lights were flashing, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Gavin said, an operator on the train sounded the train's
horn as it approached the crossing.</TE>
<TE>   The impact tossed the Lumina from the middle of the track to the
north side of Sycamore Drive, where the vehicle crashed into the
front end of the Mustang before slamming into a crossing signal
sign.Aranda was in full cardiac arrest when he was transported to
Simi Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival,
according to authorities. The injured woman was treated and released.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred less than two weeks after a major accident in
Orange County, where a freight train failed to stop at a warning
light on April 23 and collided head-on with a Metrolink commuter
train. Two Amtrak passengers were killed and more than 260 were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Based on initial reports of the Simi Valley crash, county fire
officials dispatched nearly three dozen firefighters and a dozen
pieces of equipment, preparing for what they thought could be a major
disaster. American Red Cross officials also responded.</TE>
<TE>   The train left the crash site at 6:44 p.m., Gavin said.Police
closed the intersection for several hours to clear the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley police and officials with the National Transportation
Safety Board will conduct investigations. The accident Wednesday was
the latest of several fatal train accidents in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year-old Camarillo woman died April 12 when her car was
struck by an Amtrak train in Somis at an unguarded railroad crossing.</TE>
<TE>   A 27-year-old Ventura man died in December when he stopped to
repair his bike on the tracks near Emma Wood State Beach and was
struck by a freight train.</TE>
<TE>   And the month before, a 65-year-old Oxnard farm worker died when
an Amtrak train slammed into his tractor near Camarillo.</TE>

<CX>   Train crash-A story in some Thursday editions about a Metrolink
train crash in Simi Valley incorrectly stated that two Amtrak passengers

Metrolink passengers were killed April 23 when their passenger train
collided with a freight train that failed to stop at a warning light.</CX>

<HD>Calabasas Tree Cutter Is Sought</HD>
<DH>Crime: Oaks and willows are among those felled or damaged.

<LD>Termites aren't the only worry for trees in Calabasas. The city on
the western edge of Los Angeles County has been plagued by a serial
tree chopper, who, since March, has cut down five trees and damaged
others in an area protected by state wildlife officials.</LD>
<LD>   This week, residents along McCoy Canyon Creek next to Calabasas
Park found two oaks that had been cut down.</LD>
<LD>   The damage tally is more than $100,000, city officials say.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies at the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station said they are
investigating, but no arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   "There is obviously someone here who does not care about the
environment," said Helene Regen, president of the Calabasas Park
Homeowners Assn. and a 12-year resident.</TE>
<TE>   "All they care about is themselves and their view," Regen said.</TE>
<TE>   Three willows--valued at more than $60,000--were chopped down in
early March. An aspen was pruned of most of its lower branches, said
Regen, who serves on the city's tree board.</TE>
<TE>   The vandal could face a hefty fine. Recently, a family was fined
$10,000 for removing just one branch of an oak, Regen said.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy Canyon Creek, a tributary to the Los Angeles River,
separates housing from the park and is designated a protected natural
habitat by the state Department of Fish and Game because of its
importance to the area's wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Regan said the trees were damaged late on weekend nights over
several weeks. In addition to the trees that were felled, others were
hacked, causing residents to fear that more trees may be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Game agents have received reports on the damaged trees
but have yet to visit the sites, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners' group is offering a $2,500 reward to help catch
the person responsible, Regen said.</TE>

<TE>   Alonzo Guzman, head groundskeeper at the Oak Park condominiums,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Residents will sometimes ask me to cut branches so they can have
a better view outside," said Guzman, who found the three dead willow
trees. "I have to tell them that I can't and that these trees are not
mine or theirs to be cutting."</TE>
<TE>   The McCoy Canyon Creek area is normally full of wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to birds in the treetops, ducks, beavers and
salamanders can be found in the shallow creek, and squirrels scurry
about the canyon's rocks and bushes.</TE>
<TE>   The newly fallen trees, which won't be cleared until Fish and Game
agents can investigate, are causing roadblocks for the animals,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew when I woke up one morning that something was wrong," said
Wendy Henderson, 39, who lives near where the first trees were cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I just looked out and they were gone," Henderson said. "It's
disgusting every time I look at it."</TE>

<HD>Local United Way Tops $5-Million Fund-Raising Goal</HD>
<DH>Charities: The agency, like other nonprofit groups across
the nation, has struggled to get pledges in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite homeland terrorism and an uncertain economy, United Way of
Ventura County topped its $5-million pledge goal during the agency's
annual fund-raising campaign, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   With its achievement, the agency did what many United Way
organizations across the country could not do in the wake of a flurry
of donations to Sept. 11 funds, a local official said.</LD>
<LD>   "I find this significant because we set a conservative goal and
surpassed it at a time when fund-raising by nonprofits locally and
nationally has been extremely difficult," said David M. Smith,
president of the county's United Way.</LD>
<TE>   The $5 million was considerably more modest than last year's goal,
which started at $5.7 million, then was revised down to $5.3 million.
The charity ultimately collected $4.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 27, when the campaign began, Smith said agency workers
spent hundreds of hours soliciting pledges from more than 600
companies and 4,000 individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint Health Networks and its employees
have promised nearly $600,000 in contributions, the highest amount
offered. Ventura County employees raised nearly $225,000.</TE>
<TE>   Smith announced a final tally of $5.2 million at an awards dinner
Wednesday at an Oxnard hotel. Other area United Way agencies, such as
one in Riverside County, finished below their goals despite
aggressive campaigning, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked very hard at it by talking to local organizations and
community leaders and really tried to promote the message that local
agencies need support," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the pledges have been made, a volunteer committee from
the agency will review funding applications from 51 member agencies
that are seeking money for specific projects.</TE>
<TE>   Member agencies include nonprofit organizations offering physical
and mental health treatment, legal services, and programs for youths
and the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the member agencies that have submitted applications this
year are Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Interface Children Family Services and
FoodShare.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of money that will go to each member agency should be
decided by early next month, Smith said. Volunteers also are tallying
and organizing donations that were made specifically to member and
nonmember groups.</TE>
<TE>   This season's successful campaign was welcome news to agency
officials, who said some past years had been a struggle for
fund-raisers. For example, three years ago the agency suffered a
shortfall in donations, which forced it to cut by more than 30% the
amounts given to its members, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased with our final result after falling short of our
goal last year," said Tina Dahlenburg, this year's campaign
chairwoman. "We knew that reaching our target was going to be a
challenge, but we were prepared."</TE>

<HD>Nuke Waste Route Sparks Local Outrage</HD>
<DH>Safety: Southland lawmakers and activists fear shipments
from Diablo Canyon to Nevada would pose a threat to area residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radioactive waste from a San Luis Obispo nuclear plant could one day
be shipped by rail, truck or barge through Santa Barbara and Ventura
county communities, a prospect that has enraged local lawmakers and
environmentalists.</LD>
<LD>   "There are too many unanswered questions, on security and safety,
for my constituents and for people across the country," said Rep.
Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), one of 117 House members who voted
against a plan to permanently store 77,000 tons of high-level
radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada. "Pure and
simple, it's an accident waiting to happen."</LD>
<LD>   Capps is among a growing number of Southern California lawmakers
who are concerned not only about burying the waste in Yucca Mountain
but also about getting it there from 131 power plants and research
labs across the country. Nine of those sites are in California,
including the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo
County, about 210 miles north of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "The idea of putting radioactive waste on trucks or rail cars,
then on a barge, then on trucks or rail cars again all through my
district is a problem for me," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi
Valley), who also voted against the Bush administration's
nuclear-waste burial plan Wednesday--one of only 14 Republicans to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the plan are worried about spills, but also about
terrorism--a threat that became a bigger concern for the nation's
nuclear facilities after the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we launch an armada of trucks, barges and trains carrying
extremely toxic nuclear waste, we need a strategy to protect them
against possible terrorist attacks," said Rep. Jane Harman
(D-Venice), a member of the House Intelligence Subcommittee on
Terrorism and Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Davis, a Department of Energy spokesman, said safeguards are
in place to protect radioactive waste shipments, which have occurred
for 30 years: Transports are accompanied by armed guards and
monitored 24 hours a day by escorts and by satellite, and shipment
schedules are classified under federal security rules.</TE>
<TE>   By 2006, the Diablo Canyon plant will have built up about 2,150
tons of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel that, eventually,
will need to be transported to a secure storage facility.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Energy officials say they want to move the material
to Yucca Mountain through Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, using trains and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   However, another option that the department studied calls for
shipping the waste on barges through the Santa Barbara Channel and
into the Port of Hueneme before transporting it by rail and trucks to
the Nevada repository.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a rather frightening thought," said Ventura County
Supervisor John Flynn, who represents south Oxnard. "I would not want
that coming into our county--period--and I would fight it all the
way."</TE>
<TE>   The Yucca Mountain project, which must still receive Senate
approval, requires that radioactive waste from around the country be
sent, in 4,300 shipments over 24 years, to the burial site about 215
miles northeast of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The waste, now temporarily stored at sites in 39 states, comes
from nuclear power plants and aircraft carriers, bomb factories and
university research labs. Over time, it will emit millions of times
more radioactivity than the Hiroshima bomb.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the Yucca Mountain site would open in 2010, but
shipments probably would not begin for years after that, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, he said, those routes would not be decided without
plenty of input from state governments and the public.</TE>
<TE>   Transporting radioactive waste is safe, Davis maintained. In the
department's 30-year history of moving waste over 1.6 million miles,
he said, there have been eight accidents. None of those resulted in
the release of radioactive material that was harmful. "The
environmental community is trying to use scare tactics, but the fact
is there are 300 million hazardous-waste shipments right now," he
said.</TE>

<TE>   Arguments for not moving the waste to Yucca Mountain defy logic,
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would a terrorist ... try and figure out where a shipment is
going and when versus blowing up Diablo Canyon where waste is
currently located?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   By 2006, the Diablo Canyon plant will have built up about 2,150

will need to be transported to a secure storage facility. Department

<TE>   Still, opponents say the consequences of a nuclear waste spill,
particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel, are not worth any risk.</TE>
<TE>   "While a spill on land would be horrendous, a spill on water,
where it would be much more easily transported, would be
catastrophic," said Drew Bohanpresident of Santa Barbara
ChannelKeeper. "The risk of it happening may be low, but it's just
such a huge risk to take."</TE>

<HD>Mountain Shifts Slowly From Stone to Cement</HD>
<DH>The same firm has mined Mt. Slover for its limestone since
1891, helping to build much of the Southland's sprawl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's great peaks--Whitney, Shasta, Mammoth Mountain--dwarf
tiny Mt. Slover.</LD>
<LD>   Even a century ago, before miners blasted so much of it away, Mt.
Slover was scarcely more than a molehill. It stood 700 feet tall,
base to summit, on an arid plain in what is now Colton.</LD>
<LD>   The mountain's size and shape have been vastly altered. Nearly 100
million tons of rock have been carved away, leaving a steep, conical
mound gouged with terraces.</LD>
<TE>   The flattened summit is now 300 feet high. A giant American flag
stands on top, often stiffened by winds funneling through the Cajon
Pass. From the pole, you can look south and east and see quarrying
pits where sections of the mountain have been removed. Miners tapped
all of the limestone from the slopes and are still boring after it
deep below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Limestone is what raises Mt. Slover to an important geographic
feature. It is the site of what is believed to be the oldest
continuously operating cement plant west of the Mississippi River.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to think we've transferred the mountain to the L.A.
Coliseum... the San Diego Convention Center... [and] the Bonaventure
Hotel," said Mike Robertson, plant manager for California Portland
Cement Co., which has owned and mined the mountain since 1891.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on its crest, gazing down at the pits and the rugged
machinery of the cement plant beyond, Robertson recited a list of
roads, churches and other structures created from Mt. Slover.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover Dam is one. The first freeway, from Los Angeles to
Pasadena, is another. Thousands of other, nameless projects account
for much of Southern California's sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Today the limestone comes out of the pits, from the rich mineral
deposits that once formed the mountain's deep base. The visible
remnant of Mt. Slover is useless for cement--a granite spire valuable
only as a Colton landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Millions see it each year from the San Bernardino Freeway, which
skirts the north flank. Treeless and barren, a mottled gray and
white, the mountain has the odd look of sculpted ash. A gravel road
winds its way to the top, along berms of piled rocks and boulders.
When America entered World War I in 1917, cement company officials
won special approval from Congress to fly a flag on the mountain day
and night--one of only three places in the country granted the
privilege. The flag came down in the 1950s but was raised again,
permanently, a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Workers Take Pride in Their Small Mountain</TE>
<TE>   The flag shows the pride many workers feel about their diminutive
mountain. Quarry foreman Jim Hardin is one of 130 employees who help
mine the 560-acre site. Like many, he has been around a long time: 39
years come July. "Next year," he quipped, "I'm going to look for
something steady."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin has an idea for when he is dead and gone. "I want to be
bronzed and put up at the flag pole," he said. "When people ask,
'Where do you work?' I say, 'The hill with the flag,' and they know
exactly where I mean."</TE>
<TE>   A hunter and trapper named Isaac Slover settled at the foot of the
mountain more than 150 years ago. He was in his 70s when he died in
1854, after being mauled by a bear in the Cajon Pass. The incident is
legendary in Colton, a rough-hewn railroad town of 40,000, but is
less relevant now than the more distant story of the origins of
cement.</TE>
<TE>   Ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who experimented with lime-based
mortars to bond building stones, began the long chain of events that
led to the mining of Mt. Slover.</TE>
<TE>   Romans perfected the process during pre-Christian times. The
volcanic cinders of Mt. Vesuvius were rich in the necessary minerals.
The cinders were crushed and mixed with sand and water to create a
cement sufficiently strong and water resistant to build the empire's
famed aqueducts.</TE>
<TE>   The art was lost in the Dark Ages. An engineer named John Smeaton,
intent on rebuilding a lighthouse in Cornwall, England, succeeded in
1756 in re-creating a cement that could set in the presence of water.</TE>
<TE>   Many years of refinement followed before another Englishman,
Joseph Aspdin, earned a patent in 1924 for "artificial stone." The
material--a composite of limestone, sand and other compounds,
slurried and heated to nearly 3,000 degrees--also came to be known as
Portland cement, after the Isle of Portland off the English coast.
The product created by the cement was said to resemble the white
building stones quarried there.</TE>
<TE>   Limestone accounts for about two-thirds of cement's raw materials.
Mt. Slover's deposits are exceptionally pure. Miners extract it with
carefully planned explosions.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, crews spent five hours filling 137 drill holes
with 20,000 pounds of ammonia nitrate and diesel.</TE>
<TE>   Blasts Loosen 45,000 Tons of Rock</TE>
<TE>   A cry went up--"Fire in the hole!"--and an entire ridge burst in a
quick series of blasts, loosening 45,000 tons of rock.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-ton trucks move the limestone--some boulders are 5 feet in
diameter--to crushing equipment extending three stories below ground.
The machinery roars. The sulfuric smell of limestone boils through
massive conveyors that carry broken rock to other crushers and
filters. By the process' end, the rock will be crushed finer than
baking powder.</TE>
<TE>   Two gargantuan kilns chemically fuse the raw materials--limestone,
silica, aluminum and iron ore--into clinker, a rock-like substance
combined with gypsum to create the finished cement.</TE>
<TE>   The kilns, which work side by side, are the most impressive thing.
Each is 13 feet wide and long enough to span the field at Dodger
Stadium, from home plate to deep in the outfield bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling sewer pipes suspended within elaborate scaffolding, the
kilns are held at a tilt and slowly rotate to cause raw material to
tumble into the 3,000-degree "burn zone." Cameras with sapphire
lenses monitor the interior, displaying it on screens in a control
booth. The tongue of flame is mind-boggling. It is fed by coal and,
of all things, used tires--a million of them a year. They actually
burn cleaner than coal and are required as part of new
emission-control regulations. Around the clock, seven days a week,
tires are lifted by tall conveyors to a tiny rack above the middle of
each kiln. With every rotation, a trap door kicks open and two tires
at a time drop into the inferno. They are consumed in 30 seconds.
Finished cement is stored in silos that hold up to 70,000 tons. Two
hundred trucks a day haul it to building sites such as the new
Catholic cathedral in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. Slover figures to produce for 30 more years. By that time,
much of what used to be the mountain will be a deep chasm. Even the
schist separating the two quarries will be mined to produce asphalt,
Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get all the squeal out of the pig."</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: Mt. Slover has lost most of its height and mass in
the decades that it's been mined. The cement it produces has created
many Southern California landmarks. It fills 200 trucks a day on
their way to building sites such as the new Catholic cathedral in Los
Angeles.</CP>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Our public schools are plagued with serious problems. Crowded
classrooms. Inadequate textbooks. Untrained teachers. Plummeting test
scores. Inappropriate mascots.</LD>
<LD>   I say if we fix the mascot problem right, the rest will take care
of itself. It's not enough to ban team names such as Braves and
Chiefs or even Spartans and Saxons. Get rid of animal mascots too.
Why reinforce narrow stereotypes like the ferocious tiger or fearsome
bear? Let's give our schools nicknames with mascots our kids can
admire!</LD>
<LD>   Team name: Monrovia Mathematicians. Mascot: Sir Isaac Newton.
Fight song: Two, four, six, eight / Who knows how to calculate? /
Nine, seven, five, three / We'll whip you in geometry! / We're not
frightened, we're not scared / We know e is mc squared!</LD>
<TE>   Team name: Cucamonga Cubists. Mascot: Marcel Duchamp's "Nude
Descending a Staircase." Fight song: Hey hey, ho ho / We're more
complex than Vince van Gogh / Ho ho, hee hee / Can two dimensions
look like three? / Hee hee, ha ha / We scoff at impressionists like
Degas / Ha ha, hey hey / We'll paint the town and win the day!</TE>
<TE>   Team name: Fullerton Philosophers. Mascot: Rodin's "The Thinker."
Fight song: Who needs fullbacks packed with power / We've got Arthur
Schopenhauer! / You may block us wham and bam / But we can think,
therefore we am / You may have a winning season / But we've got
Kant's critique of reason.</TE>
<TE>   Team name: Venice Vegans. Mascot: Romaine lettuce. Fight song: We
don't eat meat / we don't eat eggs / We don't wear leather shoes /
We're big and strong on soy-based milk / Hey meatheads--get a clue!</TE>
<TE>   Team name: Pomona Premeds. Mascot: Tongue depressor. Fight song:
Chemistry, calculus, we're no fools / We're gonna go to medical
school / Shut us out and dance with glee / But someday you'll need
surgery / Then we'll rejoice and sing and dance / And put your money
in our pants.</TE>

Hill, 2001). Web site and e-mail: www.peter .navarro.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Absolute market power corrupts absolutely. That's the important
subtext of Enron's stunning "smoking gun" memos.</LD>
<LD>   For Californians, the memos remove any doubt whether last year's
electricity meltdown was the result of market manipulation. The state
now has strong legal grounds to successfully void--forget
renegotiating--$43 billion in overpriced contracts signed as a result
of the manipulation.</LD>
<LD>   California ratepayers also should recover almost $10 billion in
overcharges based on a pending claim before the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. This refund is due not just from Texas bandits
like Enron, Dynegy and Reliant but also home-grown pirates such as
Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<TE>   To focus narrowly on Enron and California, however, is to miss
this much larger point: Our nation's energy markets cannot function
properly without strong regulatory oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike highly competitive markets in commodities like wheat and
pork bellies, energy markets are vulnerable to monopoly. The high
capital requirements of this industry pose a formidable barrier to
entry.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this barrier--and decades of lax antitrust
enforcement--every key energy sector has settled into a comfortable
oligopoly structure where a few large players call the shots. They
are quite willing to provide electricity, natural gas and gasoline at
reasonable prices most of the time but are all too capable of
engaging in an orgy of price-gouging whenever the opportunity
arises--from the winter heating season to the summer driving season.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this structural problem in our energy markets is further
exacerbated by a breakdown in corporate ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Item: Under the "Fat Boy" gambit revealed in a secret Enron memo,
traders bought regulated power in California and sold it to the
Pacific Northwest for five times the price. They knew this would lead
to brownouts and blackouts in California but saw no human or economic
suffering, only a "public relations risk."</TE>
<TE>   Item: British Petroleum executives cooked up a scheme to dump
Alaskan crude on Japan at bargain prices to deny supplies to
California refineries and drive up gasoline prices. They figured they
would make more money gouging Californians than they would lose
selling Japan our cheap oil--motorists be damned.</TE>
<TE>   Item: El Paso Natural Gas executives thwarted the expansion of the
Southwest's pipeline system by buying a key rival and scuttling its
plans to build. Last winter, natural gas prices spiked far above the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   Item: Major oil companies in California bought up refinery
capacity and independent gas stations and closed some of them to
reduce competition. Prices now spike every summer.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the ability to exert market power coupled with an
unethical willingness to do so is a lethal combination. But this is
hardly a zero-sum game between greedy energy producers and victimized
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, low-cost and reliable electricity, natural gas and
gasoline supplies are three of the most important ingredients of
strong and stable national economic growth. That's why it would be a
serious mistake to misread the message of the latest Enron outrage as
a story about a particular company or even California.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the memos should be a powerful catalyst for a national
reflection on the direction of our energy future.</TE>
<TE>   In this regard, we must reinvigorate rather than continue to
eviscerate our antitrust laws. Such laws must be used to promote
competition rather than create cartels.</TE>
<TE>   We also must reevaluate the arguments in favor of energy
deregulation. What looks wonderful in principle in the economic
textbooks and conservative playbooks is failing miserably in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Most specifically, we must insist that our most important energy
regulatory agency, FERC, start protecting the public rather than
merely the companies it regulates. In the short run, this means doing
little things like extending electricity price caps in California and
giving Californians their refunds. Over the long run, however, it
also means crafting a coherent set of regulatory laws and procedures
that protects the integrity of the country's energy markets and
imposing a much tougher set of sanctions for wayward executives who
knowingly manipulate those markets.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Fights the Good Fight in Bid to Derail Artillery
System</HD>
<DH>The Crusader howitzer is unneeded and at $11 billion is too
expensive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD>Michael O'Hanlon, who is the author of "Defense Policy
Choices for the Bush Administration" (Brookings, 2002), is a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld should stick to his guns
regarding the Army's proposed Crusader howitzer, which he vowed
Wednesday to kill.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Crusader has capabilities that existing weapons do
not, it is not the only weapon that can do the job. It is not worth
the $11-billion price tag.</LD>
<LD>   That said, Rumsfeld is likely to lose this round in Congress,
given the support for the Crusader among legislators and in the
Pentagon. If that happens, he should try again next year as part of a
broader plan that includes reductions in other, even more expensive,
weapons programs.</LD>
<TE>   That's the only real way to create the spirit of shared sacrifice
and political unity that Rumsfeld will need if he is to reshape the
military within reasonable budgetary constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Why, given the shortcomings and cost of the Crusader, is the Army
so passionate about the weapon? The Army claims that Paladin, its
existing artillery weapons system--that is, cannons designed for
firing on targets beyond immediate visual range, sometimes 10 or more
miles away--has insufficient range and battlefield speed.</TE>
<TE>   These are shortcomings that, in theory, could hamper U.S. military
efforts in the future. The Army says that should war break out in
Korea, for example, the United States and South Korea would face a
North Korean foe with 10,000 artillery weapons, many of which would
be capable of longer-range strikes than the Paladin.</TE>
<TE>   In such a situation, the United States might not be able to
conduct a protracted and patient aerial attack. That would make U.S.
ground forces vulnerable to enemy fire from day one of hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader could help in a situation like that. True, as its
critics contend, it is something of a Cold War relic in that it was
designed for slugging it out with the Soviets in Central Europe. And,
true, it is too heavy to easily be deployed for the kinds of missions
we have witnessed in recent years in places such as Kosovo and
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But many weapons designed during the Cold War have since proved
very useful, such as F-15s, F-16s, laser-guided bombs, aircraft
carriers, M1 tanks, B-1s and B-2s.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Crusader program, although expensive, would cost much
less than current Pentagon programs for fighter aircraft, submarines,
the tilt-rotor Osprey plane and several missile defense systems, each
of which typically has a price tag of $20 billion to $60 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Secretary Rumsfeld is still right. The problem with the
Crusader is not that it is useless on the modern battlefield but that
it is not particularly needed.</TE>
<TE>   That is because the United States today has many other systems,
including long-range rockets and attack helicopters and jets, capable
of striking deep behind enemy lines. All of them can carry precision
weapons. And the military's progress in building real-time
information networks means that targeting data can be passed along to
these aircraft and rocket launchers from soldiers on the ground who
may be the first to detect the location of enemy artillery.</TE>
<TE>   But no secretary of Defense, even a popular wartime leader like
Rumsfeld, can easily kill weapons that a military service and
Congress strongly support. Just ask Dick Cheney, who tried to kill
the Marine Corps Osprey aircraft a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   While secretaries of Defense and presidents do run wars, they have
no greater control over the Pentagon budget than Congress, which has
the constitutional responsibility to raise and equip armies and
navies.</TE>
<TE>   Largely for these reasons, the Clinton administration did not seek
to cancel large weapons programs, and, until the Crusader, Secretary
Rumsfeld had not tried to do so himself.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld contends that we need to radically transform the United
States military and justifies his opposition to the Crusader in those
terms.</TE>
<TE>   But going after a single weapon system halfway through the annual
congressional budget cycle falls short of boldness and makes his
proposal seem underhanded to some.</TE>
<TE>   The House Armed Services Committee is scheduled to vote on the
matter as soon as today, and the Senate Armed Services Committee also
must take up the matter.</TE>
<TE>   We should wish Rumsfeld well in this Crusader endeavor, even
though he may fail.</TE>

the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I heard a joke the other day that confirmed my suspicions about the
insidious grip anti-Semitism is gaining, not just on the minds of
voting French people but on the jocular mindlessness of dopey
Americans.</LD>
<LD>   What do you call six Jews in turbans? Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Not funny, right? But it is indicative of a scary sentiment, one
you may have thought was confined to the dankest corners of the Arab
world. The meaning, as far as I can ferret it out, is this: Because
it has collaborated with the United States in the war on terror and
because President Pervez Musharraf, whose newly "reelected" military
dictatorship stays in power by the strong arms of a few trusted
advisors, Pakistan is clearly being run by a cabal of Jews.</LD>
<TE>   How else to explain the defection of a Muslim state from the Arab
world's solidarity with Al Qaeda and the Palestinians? How else to
explain Pakistan's willingness to join forces with America, the great
Satan, which, as Arab conspiracy theorists are always telling us, is
itself run by powerful Jews and is thereby merely an extension of
Israel?</TE>
<TE>   The implication is clear. Anyone who opposes terrorism or the
Islamist agenda is, by proxy, a Jew or a puppet of the Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency. As the conflict in Israel escalates, the
world is separating quickly into two reductive and hostile camps:
Jews and anti-Semites.</TE>
<TE>   Because we support Israel, Americans increasingly are seen as
surrogate Jews. We should accept our new moniker with pride, partly
because being a Jew is nothing to be ashamed of, but mostly because
our alliance with Israel is meritorious in principle.</TE>
<TE>   We support Israel because it is a democracy and because Israelis
share our belief in liberal politics. Its press is free, as are its
elections and society. These are values worth fighting for; they are
why we went to war in Afghanistan, after all. And defending Israel
against Palestinian suicide bombing is nothing less than a defense of
Enlightenment ideals against medieval tyranny.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian cause (against oppression and for a state) is
another matter, one that all fair-minded people recognize as
legitimate. But the present Palestinian leadership and its loudest
supporters in the Arab world are hopelessly tainted by their
toleration and even covert fostering of appalling Jew-hating,
jingoistic rants that appear regularly in the Arab press.</TE>
<TE>   Take columnist Fatma Abdallah Mahmoud's recent piece in the
Egyptian government daily Al Akhbar complaining to Hitler about the
"fabrication" of the Holocaust: "If only you had done it, brother, if
only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief
[without] their evil and sin."</TE>
<TE>   The Middle East Media Research Institute documented that, along
with this screed from a weekly column in the London-based Arabic
newspaper Al Sharq al Awsat by Yasser Arafat aide Bassam Abu Sharif.
Accusing Israel of shooting at the statue of the Virgin Mary in
Bethlehem, he wrote: "This, of course, was a failed attempt to murder
peace, love and tolerance, just as their forefathers tried to murder
the prophetic message when they hammered their nails and iron stakes
through the body of Jesus into the wooden cross."</TE>
<TE>   Even Christians gave that one up long ago when they remembered
that Jesus was a Jew.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of this kind of filth are enemies of fairness, sanity
and liberalism. So, pick a side, folks; there are only two.</TE>

<HD>Keep Westside Rail Alive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the tens of thousands of commuters who grimly head to and from
the Westside daily, the Santa Monica Freeway is usually a sea of red
taillights. Dreams of a rail line to downtown have danced at the edge
of commuters' vision, recently drawing a little closer. Now, however,
federal transit officials say they may give to other projects the
funds earmarked for the so-called Exposition Line. They never
specifically promised to fund this line, but weary road warriors will
get no comfort from that logic.</LD>
<LD>   As the light rail line linking Pasadena nears a 2003 completion
date, and with engineering for the Eastside line well underway, the
Exposition Line still exists only on the glossy color slides that
transit planners and local advocates carry around to community
meetings.</LD>
<LD>   First conceived more than a decade ago to run from Santa Monica to
downtown, the light rail line has long been held hostage by
obstructionist homeowners along the proposed Exposition Boulevard
route and local politicians who believe that affluent Westsiders
won't use and don't deserve mass transit. Never mind that the
Westside has the highest population and employment density of any
Southern California area, drawing workers who commute in daily from
poorer communities to the east and south.</LD>
<TE>   The political stalemate broke only last year when the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority formally adopted the Exposition Line plan,
largely the result of pressure from smaller cities along the route
that want the project and Friends 4 Expo Transit, a group of citizen
proponents. MTA approval was supposed to free up state, local and
federal funds for the project, which is estimated at $429 million.
Engineering and design work was to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   Now the $155-million federal share may be off the table. The news
from the Federal Transit Administration came as a surprise to MTA
officials, who are scrambling to line up support in Congress to make
sure this money is there when they need it starting next year. That
goal should be a top priority for the California delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the lesson for transit planners is clear: The endless
equivocation of local leaders on this key rail project has already
cost commuters dearly. Further delay could kill the Expo line
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   And anyone who simply shrugs at that prospect ought to be forced
to sit behind the wheel on the Santa Monica Freeway at 5:30 every
afternoon for at least the next 10 years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon broke off his visit to Washington
by essentially saying "forget it" to diplomacy after a Palestinian
suicide bomber killed 15 Israelis near Tel Aviv. No matter how
reprehensible such bombings are--and they are terrorism--the Bush
administration cannot allow itself Sharon's spiteful luxury. Only a
sustained effort by other nations will force Israelis and
Palestinians to the conference table.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is at a crossroads. His administration is feuding internally,
with the Defense Department and the National Security Council
fighting to give Sharon a free hand and the State Department
insisting on negotiations. Bush's attempt to tiptoe between these
positions has exposed him to fierce criticism from both the Arab
states and backers of Israel. His policies have sometimes seemed
schizophrenic.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, even this represents progress from the military green
light Bush originally offered to Sharon. Since Bush met with Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah two weeks ago, he has realized that the
stability of moderate Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan is imperiled by continuing pictures of corpses and razed homes
in the West Bank. That message was only reinforced by Jordan's King
Abdullah II in his Wednesday meeting with Bush. The Jordanian king is
asking for a concrete timeline for Palestinian statehood and Arab
recognition of Israel, rather than endless negotiations over
"process."</TE>
<TE>   Bush needs to explore and support proposals that offer a way out
of the current impasse. The president already has taken some helpful
steps. He announced in his meeting with Sharon that he continued to
support the creation of a Palestinian state and that the director of
central intelligence, George J. Tenet, would return to the Middle
East to rebuild the Palestinian security force. Bush also is upping
relief assistance to the Palestinians by $30 million, to $110 million
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Bush, together with the European Union, the United
Nations and Russia, is pushing for an international conference that
would decide the outlines of a territorial compromise in exchange for
Arab recognition of Israel. Today, the foreign ministers of the
leading Arab states will meet to discuss preparing for such a
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Sharon wants only a paltry conference on regional
security and adamantly resists one that would speed the establishment
of a Palestinian state. At the White House, Sharon declared Israel
would "uproot the terrorist structure" and condemned the Palestinian
Authority. Such declarations may be emotionally satisfying but they
will not create a secure Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the humanitarian and political reasons for pushing
Yasser Arafat and Sharon away from violence, the Bush administration
has longer-term strategic aims. No moderate Arab state will acquiesce
to an invasion of Iraq until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has
cooled off. That is a discussion for another time, however.</TE>
<TE>   Bush must make it clear that Israel cannot avoid dealing with
Arafat and that an international conference is unavoidable. An
administration that prides itself on speaking with one voice must
start to do so on the Middle East.</TE>

<LD>The state's $95-million computer software fiasco--software that few
workers needed or wanted--could stem from bureaucratic bungling,
conflict of interest, a campaign contribution payoff or all of the
above. The attorney general and the Joint Legislative Audit Committee
are investigating.</LD>
<LD>   Computer systems have always caused the state grief. The
Department of Information Technology was created presumably to
develop the expertise to deal with computer and software systems.
Even so, the state auditor says no one had the experience or ability
to adequately evaluate the Oracle contract because the deal was
unique.</LD>
<LD>   The auditor says it will cost the state millions, yet it was
rushed through various departments and approved with little challenge
or analysis. Some officials raised red flags but never yelled,
"Stop!" Some say the contract had to be signed by May 31, 2001, or
the cost would go up. That should have been a stop sign in itself.</LD>
<TE>   The governor's Republican critics say Davis should have reviewed
the contract himself. In truth, although a governor cannot totally
divorce himself from any action his administration takes, reading
contracts is the sort of detail that should be left to competent
aides.</TE>
<TE>   Another question is whether a $25,000 contribution from Oracle to
Davis' campaign had any influence on the computer contract decision.
Davis and his aides insist the governor did not know about the
contract before it was signed and was not aware of the contribution
until after the pact was concluded. But considering the governor's
slavish fund-raising among groups with economic interests at stake in
Sacramento, Davis must convince investigators there was no
connection. The probers also need to determine why the check was
drafted in March but not delivered until May, after the contract was
approved.</TE>
<TE>   More basically, why was a contract of this size awarded without
bids from other firms? The auditor said the deal was not legally
exempt from competitive bidding rules. This alone should have been
cause for canceling it.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers need to find a way to guarantee that employees of the
Department of Information Technology have no conflicts of interest
and then make the department solely responsible for these sorts of
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Barring dramatic new revelations, the Oracle imbroglio is not
likely to be the scandal the Republicans are salivating for in this
election year. There is no sign of a crime, perhaps because state
conflict-of-interest laws governing contracting of this kind are so
loose. The various probes will take months, but the state should take
quick action to avoid any shameful bureaucratic breakdown and
boondoggle in the future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Vote Rejects Hemings Claim," May 6: Once again racism rears its
ugly head. I personally believe that the vote to reject the relatives
of Sally Hemings, a slave of Thomas Jefferson's, into the Monticello
Assn. has absolutely nothing to do with insufficient evidence, DNA or
historical facts and has everything to do with the white Jefferson
descendants not wanting to acknowledge any nonwhite descendants of
Thomas Jefferson.</LD>
<LD>   John Works made the racism involved in the vote very clear by the
e-mail he sent to Lucian Truscott IV: a face of a black man with a
zipper in place of a mouth. God forbid if someone were to go down the
list of ex-presidents who have owned slaves and start checking DNA.
There would probably be a flood of black descendants of presidents
all over these United States.</LD>
<LD>   For that matter, let's go down the list of all who have owned
slaves and start checking some DNA. That would probably bring on a
tsunami of black descendants of slave owners. Now, wouldn't that be
something to see?</LD>
<TE>   Kenya Glover</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Given the stupidity of the Monticello Assn.'s decision to deny
admission to the Hemings descendants to their esteemed
organization--despite the DNA evidence linking Hemings' relatives to
Jefferson--these relatives of Sally Hemings can take heart, since
they obviously got the better Jefferson genes.</TE>

<TE>   Researchers have estimated that up to 10% of children born in
wedlock are not the husband's biological child. It has been several
generations since Jefferson's day. I wonder how many of the
Monticello Assn.'s members have been DNA-tested, as the Hemings
descendants have?</TE>

<LD>"Slain Deputy Is Mourned," March 5: L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy
David William March was laid to rest on Saturday. David was a close
friend to my family. I've spent 32 years as a member of the L.A.
County Sheriff's Department. I've attended many funerals under such
circumstances in the past, but something I've never seen before
developed during the procession to the cemetery through the streets
of Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds and hundreds of residents of the city lined the streets
holding American flags and signs reading "hero" and "God bless our
men and women in law enforcement." Mothers, fathers, teenagers and
very young children were saluting and showing the peace sign to the
line of passing police and private cars as they traveled seven miles
to the cemetery. Many of them were wiping away their tears.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to express my thanks and, I know, the thanks of all
of those in uniform for your support. God bless.</LD>

<LD>Re "Hospital Choice Grows Costlier," May 5: Yes, hospital costs will
be greater, not because of consumer choice but lack thereof. As
usual, the insurance industry falls into that familiar trap, so well
known to the wise consumer, of being penny-wise but dollar-foolish.
Where in their equation is the question of quality and outcomes?</LD>
<LD>   The greatest expense to any employer is the absence from work for
medical reasons--often far greater than the cost itself. Where is the
cost of misdiagnosis by inferior providers or botched procedures that
must be redone? Or lack of proper bedside manner to ensure compliance
with medical regimens? Buying health care is no different from any
other purchase of high-end quality products, such as cars or home
additions/remodeling: You choose merely on price at your peril.</LD>

<LD>Re "Memo Shows Enron Role in Hiking Prices," May 7: This story is
sexy and, certainly, greed attracts a lot of attention, but like a
red herring it draws everyone away from the real problem in the
California energy market. The price is not connected to the demand.
The people buying the power, the utilities (or the state government,
right now), must buy all the power that customers want at any price
the producers ask for it. Consumers, who determine the electric
demand one person at a time, are not given the price when they make
the decision to buy. Indeed, during the crisis period, consumers were
buying electricity at a much lower price than the utilities were
paying for it.</LD>
<LD>   Until we connect the dots of energy price to energy demand, the
system will not work and California will be open to another crisis.</LD>

<TE>   Well, well, well. So federal energy regulators have uncovered
documents that affirmatively demonstrate that Enron and other energy
companies engaged in market manipulation that caused soaring power
prices and statewide blackouts in 2001. Interesting. I distinctly
recall being assured by this same gaggle of energy companies and
their political minions that the "energy crisis" was the predictable
result of extremist policies advocated by the left and the
environmental community. There is a very important lesson to be
learned from this whole sordid affair. Is anybody paying attention?</TE>

<TE>   Now that we know that California's "energy crisis" was
manufactured by Enron, and because of this company's close
relationship with the present administration, two nagging questions
remain: Was that punishment for Dubya losing in our state? Or simply
that Texas can't stand being No. 2?</TE>

<TE>   The May 7 Times contains articles on just about every possible
form of corporate corruption. First, we learn there are "smoking gun"
documents proving that Enron was manipulating the market during
California's energy crisis. We learn that Archer Daniels Midland, the
nation's largest producer of ethanol, is under investigation for
price fixing. Then we read that Peregrine Systems has launched an
internal investigation of accounting inaccuracies involving up to
$100 million in revenue. And, of course, there is the ongoing
investigation into Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing missing in your coverage is the Bush
administration's proposed remedy for this massive fraud and
corruption: more corporate self-regulation.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court to Nike: 'Just Tell the Truth'</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a bunch of crocodile tears! In "Nike Can't Just Say It, Court
Rules" (May 3), about Nike being prohibited by the California Supreme
Court from making misleading statements, a Los Angeles corporate
lawyer is quoted as saying, "This case has the potential to place a
chill on the rights of an employer to defend itself in the court of
public opinion." Except, of course, if the business is telling the
truth.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, Nike was caught lying about its onerous overseas
labor practices; but if a corporation is telling the truth, why
should it worry about lawsuits? Exoneration in a court of law would
only bolster a corporation's image in the "court of public opinion."
Even if unfair lawsuits against corporations start to pile up
(something I doubt), businesses could easily punish their adversaries
by countersuing for frivolous and malicious harassment--if they are
telling the truth.</LD>

<LD>The American public appears to be almost completely in the dark
concerning a worldwide problem: slavery. "Smuggling by Airline Guards
Feared" (May 6) states, "In one LAX case two years ago, two employees
of a security firm pleaded guilty to federal charges for trying to
smuggle in three Thai women who arrived as transit passengers on a
Korean Air flight from Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   "The scheme, foiled by the employees' supervisor, involved
swapping the women--allegedly destined for employment at a massage
parlor--with three impostors who were to take their outbound seats."</LD>
<LD>   That these three women were almost without doubt indentured
servants--prostitutes, slaves intended for the U.S. market--should be
noted by all, authors and public.</LD>

<LD>Re "They, Like, Just Can't Stop Saying That Word," Commentary, May 5:
It's easy, and maybe even fun, to criticize the rather juvenile habit
of lacing conversation with a heavy dose of "like." But I don't think
that it is always as superfluous as Matt Johanson feels it to be. I
do think the unstated purpose of the user is often to avoid making
definite statements that he or she could be criticized for.</LD>
<LD>   "Like" can be synonymous with "sort of." The equally pervasive
"you know" also serves to ward off contradiction. The quotation,
"It's, like, impossible," could be equally well expressed as, "It's
sorta impossible" or "Y'know, it's impossible" or even "It's probably
impossible."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, "like" is a habit that gets carried too far, and a
broader vocabulary would help. If there is a lesson for the students
in speaking habits, it's not only about the choice of words but also
how to cultivate confidence in thought as well as in what is said.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Scott</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like, wait a minute, Johanson has, like, missed the true threat.
His extragrammatical "like" is about the same as the better
established "um" or "well." A better example of creeping "like"-ness
is as a substitute for "said"; e.g., "My father was like, 'Why are
you home so late?' and I'm like, 'Yo, I was studying with the guys.'"
For the more sophisticated, see also "all": "I'm all 'what?' and he's
all 'whoa!' and I'm all like 'Dude!'" Can you dig it, Mr. Jo?</TE>

<LD>Jeff Daar (Commentary, May 6) seems to want to deny the people of the
proposed new city of San Fernando Valley the right to vote on elected
council members and a mayor in the November election. For those of us
still trying to objectively evaluate cityhood, this would not be
helpful.</LD>
<LD>   Since we will live in the new city, we will be relying on its
newly elected leadership. We have a right to select our
representatives going in. After election day we will need leadership
through the transition. Imagine the chaos of a leaderless Valley,
trying to deal with the city of L.A. and going through an election
campaign at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   As one who has been involved in these issues for over 25 years, I
would appreciate it if the Johnny-come-latelies would try to be a bit
more constructive. The public interest is not served by threatening
lawsuits and trying to confuse the fundamental issues of democracy. I
think the voters can handle voting for several issues at the same
time. They've done it before.</LD>

<LD>Regarding Michael Ramirez's cartoon on mental health coverage
(Commentary, May 7), let's hope he never has to watch a loved one
suffer through the system as my family has. My stepfather has
vascular dementia, an Alzheimer's-like condition that falls into a
great black hole of noncoverage for him, regardless of how many years
he spent working, saving and paying his dues. After many
heartbreaking months of deterioration, his home is now the Washington
state mental hospital, as my mother quickly depleted her savings by
paying out of pocket for a succession of care facilities. I could go
on, but Ramirez is hardly worth more than a few moments of my time.</LD>

<HD>Russell Knott, 86; Former Partner in Berry Farm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell H. Knott, a former general partner of the Buena Park
amusement park that bears a family name that is synonymous with
Orange County, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Knott, one of four children of Knott's Berry Farm founders Walter
and Cordelia Knott and a longtime philanthropist and community
supporter, died Tuesday in a Santa Ana hospital after a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Knott's Berry Farm is the oldest theme amusement park in the
nation, drawing 3.7 million visitors a year. It was valued at $300
million when the family sold it in 1997 to Ohio-based Cedar Fair.</LD>
<TE>   Knott served as a general partner of Knott's Berry Farm, along
with his sisters--Virginia Knott Bender, Rachel "Toni" Knott Oliphant
and Marion Knott Montapert--until the park changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   The tightknit Knotts always worked together. As children growing
up in Buena Park in the 1920s, they sold the berries and vegetables
grown on the family farm to motorists on the dirt road that became
Beach Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   And, friends say, Russell Knott never lost that down-on-the-farm
quality. "He was a very quiet, private, unassuming man who
contributed greatly to the city of Buena Park, not only as a general
partner at Knott's Berry Farm but as a generous contributor to a
variety of organizations and charitable causes," said Buena Park
Mayor Patsy Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   The list of philanthropic contributions Russell Knott and his
wife, Mildred "Milly" Knott, have made over the years is
wide-ranging. Most recently, in March, they made a $1.3-million
donation to St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton to help finance an
endoscopy center.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, a longtime family friend who managed community relations
for Knott's Berry Farm for many years, recalled that during the
holidays, Knott "would give me the money and I'd shop and buy shoes,
clothes, toys and food for 20 needy kids at a local day-care center.
They never knew where the money came from."</TE>
<TE>   When the Women's Club in Buena Park needed new specially made
windows for its historic building, Knott donated the money to buy
them. Knott also gave to the Boy Scouts of America, Goodwill
Industries of Orange County, the Salvation Army and the Boys &amp; Girls
Club of Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   "He just felt you should give something back to the community,"
said Marshall, adding that Knott typically would turn down offers of
commemorative plaques and ceremonies honoring his and his wife's
charitable contributions,</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't like to take credit for anything that he did," she
said. "He just didn't like publicity."</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate how unassuming Knott was, Marshall recalled that he
always joined paying customers in line at Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner
Restaurant rather than duck in the back to get priority seating.</TE>
<TE>   "You could never tell he owned the place," said Marshall.
"Everybody always called Walter Knott Mr. Knott, but Russell was
always Russell. If people called him Mr. Knott, he'd say, 'That's my
dad. Just call me Russell.'"</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Walter Knott, who was known as "Mr. Republican" throughout
Orange County and whose blessing--and financial support--was often
crucial to potential Republican candidates, Russell Knott had a more
politically independent streak.</TE>
<TE>   "In later years, he registered as an independent," Marshall said.
"I think he probably voted mostly Republican, but he did vote for a
Democrat or two."</TE>
<TE>   Walter Knott, said Dean Davisson, the park's first public
relations director, "was really an extreme conservative and Russell
tried to balance the scale because so many people in the public would
say, 'We're not going out to that Republican place.' He bent over
backward to maintain a persona of an independent."</TE>
<TE>   Davisson remembers his former boss being "well-read and
well-informed, but you would not get a sense of that unless you asked
not one question but two or three questions and he would determine,
yes, you really want to know about this and we'll talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Knott's area of responsibility at the amusement park was
administration, including personnel and security. Even after he and
his sisters were no longer involved in the park's day-to-day
operation, beginning in the early '80s, Knott continued to put in a
few hours a week in his unpretentious office where he'd open mail,
return phone calls and chat with employees.</TE>
<TE>   Knott was born in Pomona in 1916, when his parents were attempting
to homestead in the Mojave Desert. In 1920, after three years of
farming near San Luis Obispo, Walter Knott and a cousin in Buena Park
formed a partnership on a rented berry farm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, the landowner decided to sell. Knott's cousin left the
partnership and Knott managed to buy his 10-acre share.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, with the family barely surviving the Depression, Walter
Knott learned that a local farmer named Ralph Boysen had crossed a
loganberry, a blackberry and a raspberry to produce a new kind of
berry. Knott convinced Boysen to have his six abandoned, scraggly
hybrids replanted on Knott's land. The new strain of berries, which
Knott dubbed the boysenberry, flourished on Knott's farm.</TE>
<TE>   To make extra money for the family, Knott's wife began using the
boysenberries for jams, jellies and pies, which she and her daughters
sold from a roadside stand.</TE>
<TE>   Cordelia Knott's pies were such a hit that customers began trying
to persuade her to cook full meals. In 1934, she served her first
homemade chicken dinners--at 65 cents a plate--to eight guests who
ate off her wedding china.</TE>
<TE>   By 1940, the Knotts were serving 400,000 chicken dinners a year,
and to keep customers occupied while waiting in line at the roadside
restaurant, Walter Knott built the Calico Ghost Town attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Knott met his wife when she worked as a waitress in the
family's restaurant one summer while attending Fullerton Junior
College. They were married in 1937 and had two sons.</TE>
<TE>   Knott is survived by his wife; sons Kenneth of Cove, Ore., and
Stephen of Fullerton; his sisters, all of Newport Beach; five
grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. Funeral services are
private.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to
the Americanism Education League, P.O. Box 5986, Buena Park, CA
90621; the Buena Park Boys &amp; Girls Club; or the St. Jude Medical
Center Memorial Foundation, 101 E. Valencia Drive, Fullerton, CA

<HD>Lockyer to Return Oracle's Donations</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Attorney general says he'll give back $50,000 from
firm that is the subject of hearings over its no-bid, $95-million
contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Five days after quipping, "I was wishing there was more," about
campaign donations from Oracle Corp., Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said he
would return the $50,000 he has taken from the company since 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer said Wednesday that the donations would not influence his
investigation of the company's $95-million software licensing
contract with the state, but returning the money will help "assure"
the public that his investigation is "fair, nonpartisan and
nonpolitical."</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Lockyer began investigating whether any civil or
criminal laws were broken in the state's signing of the contract with
Oracle a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans have questioned whether Lockyer, a Democrat, can be
aggressive and unbiased in his investigation.</TE>
<TE>   State auditors say the no-bid contract--touted by Oracle and its
business partner, Logicon, as a way to save the state more than
$100million over 10 years--could cost the state $6 million to $41
million more than it would spend otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was signed, the auditor concluded, in spite of
surveys that showed little demand for Oracle products within
California's bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Two top administration officials have resigned in the fallout over
the contract and a third has been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Republican candidate for governor Bill Simon Jr. has made an issue
of the $25,000 donation Oracle gave Gov. Gray Davis several days
after the contract was signed.</TE>
<TE>   The check was passed from an Oracle lobbyist to Davis' chief of
e-government in a Sacramento restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis on Wednesday said he had not decided whether to return
some or all of the $45,000 in campaign donations he has received from
Oracle in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to wait until all the facts are in on Oracle," Davis
said. "I've asked [Lockyer] to give me his recommendations on what
can be done differently in the future. I don't rule it in and I don't
rule it out."</TE>
<TE>   A joint legislative audit committee has held two days of hearings
to determine how and why the contract moved through the state
bureaucracy. It will resume Tuesday with witnesses from the
departments of Finance and General Services. After that, the hearings
are to continue May 21.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really interested in, how did this deal get pushed?" said
Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter). "Who pushed it? And who were the
decision makers who relied on their information almost blindly?"</TE>

<CX>   Oracle money: A story in Thursday's California section said Gov.
Gray Davis' reelection campaign had returned a $20,000 contribution from
Oracle Corp. because the company stopped payment on the check. In fact,
the campaign had no money to return because Oracle stopped payment,
according to Davis campaign officials.</CX>

<HD>Otis Blackwell, 70; Noted Songwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Otis Blackwell, a songwriter who transformed such slang phrases as
"all shook up" and "great balls of fire" into exuberant anthems of
the 1950s rock 'n' roll revolution, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwell died Monday in Nashville of an apparent heart attack, a
spokesman for St. Thomas Hospital said.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwell's contributions to the songbooks of Elvis Presley
("Don't Be Cruel," "All Shook Up," "Return to Sender"), Jerry Lee
Lewis ("Great Balls of Fire," "Breathless") and other singers in the
'50s and early '60s rank him high in the pantheon of rock and R&amp;B
songwriters who captured the experience of the American teenager,
which was emerging as a major social force.</LD>
<TE>   Blackwell's best-known hits may have less sociological substance
than Leiber &amp; Stoller's high school sitcoms or Chuck Berry's acutely
observed rituals of adolescence. But they make up for it with their
unmatched energy and enduring craft.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun records who discovered Presley and
produced his first recordings, once called "Don't Be Cruel" his
favorite Presley song because of the way it matched a sad lyric to a
happy beat. "Great Balls of Fire" provided the volatile Lewis with
his signature tune, a salacious explosion whose opening line--"You
shake my nerves and you rattle my brain"--embodied youthful lust.
(See accompanying lyric.)</TE>
<TE>   Another Lewis hit from Blackwell, "Breathless," revisited the
theme, and "All Shook Up" let Presley describe how love could turn a
healthy male into a quivering mess: "My hands are shakin' and my
knees are weak/I can't seem to stand on my own two feet ... "</TE>
<TE>   Hit Songs Reflected a Sense of the Era</TE>
<TE>   "He was so on top of what people were listening to, what
performers were performing, the musical tempo of the era," Dan Del
Fiorentino, curator of the Museum of Making Music in Carlsbad, said
Wednesday. The nonprofit institution, affiliated with the National
Assn. of Music Manufacturers, chronicles the last 100 years of
American music.</TE>
<TE>   "He really did have a great sense of the time," added Del
Fiorentino, who interviewed Blackwell several times in the 1980s. "It
wasn't just Elvis Presley that was recording his songs; everybody was
recording his songs.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't get the acclaim that a lot of folks think that he
should have received in terms of name recognition, but I don't think
there was a wannabe garage band in the 1950s that didn't play at
least 10 of his songs."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of his most widely heard songs, co-written with Eddie
Cooley under the pseudonym John Davenport, was poles apart from those
high-energy hits--"Fever," originally recorded by R&amp;B singer Little
Willie John and later transformed into a sultry classic by Peggy Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Other Blackwell-written hits include "Handy Man" (Jimmy Jones and
later James Taylor) and "Hey Little Girl" (Dee Clark). The list of
artists who have recorded his songs includes the Who, Billy Joel, Ray
Charles and Otis Redding. It's estimated that more than 185 million
recordings of his songs have been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell was born and raised in Brooklyn and became a fan of the
movies' singing cowboys, particularly Tex Ritter, as well as such
blues singers as Chuck Willis. He began performing in the early '50s
and made some records for the RCA and Jay-Dee labels, but he wasn't
fond of the performer's life, and he began to concentrate on writing.</TE>
<TE>   He hooked up with the publishing company Shalamar Music and, in
late 1955, submitted seven songs. One of them, "Don't Be Cruel," was
picked up by Presley, whom Blackwell had never heard of at the time
and whom he would never meet. Paired on a single with Leiber &amp;
Stoller's "Hound Dog," it became the biggest record of 1956 and a
defining feature in the Elvis image.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell and Presley (who received co-writer credit on several of
Blackwell's songs, reportedly as a condition of his recording them)
continued their long-distance partnership for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Some pop historians have maintained that Presley patterned many of
his vocals on the demonstration recordings that Blackwell made of his
own and other writers' songs, though clearly Presley had defined his
style years earlier in such Sun recordings as "Baby Let's Play House"
and "Mystery Train."</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell was well compensated for his compositions, and he was
known to spend his royalty checks quickly and lavishly. His style of
music faded in the 1960s, and he struggled with alcoholism and tax
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell released some albums in the late '70s and later did some
touring backed by the rock band the Smithereens. He moved to
Nashville in 1990 with plans to start a record label with Presley's
former manager, Col. Tom Parker, but in 1991 he had a debilitating
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame the same
year, and, in 1994, a group of rock and country artists, including
Chrissie Hynde, Kris Kristofferson, Graham Parker and Deborah Harry,
collaborated on "Brace Yourself," a tribute album of Blackwell's
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Information on Blackwell's survivors was not immediately
available.</TE>

<HD>Capitol Paint Job Leads to Picket Lines</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union leaders visiting Sacramento for conference
react angrily after learning nonunion workers were hired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Trouble is, they've got labor trouble right here at the state Capitol
in River City, the political heart of the union movement in
California.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble became a public spectacle Wednesday when union members
from throughout the state came to Sacramento, which calls itself
River City, for their annual lobbying conference.</LD>
<LD>   They immediately discovered that the north side of the
golden-domed Capitol was getting a fresh coat of paint from nonunion
painters of River City Painting Co.</LD>
<TE>   A picket line was thrown up at a north entrance to the
127-year-old building, an unheard-of action in the nearly four years
that labor-friendly Democrat Gray Davis has occupied the governor's
office and Democrats expanded their majorities in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The line, whose picketers numbered several hundred Tuesday but
diminished to two dozen Wednesday, shut down the project when union
employees of scaffolding and iron installers refused to cross it, a
company executive said.</TE>
<TE>   To lengthen their picket line, the plumbers union easily drew
recruits from labor delegates to the lobbying conference. The line
seemed to stop few people from entering the building, especially
hundreds of energetic schoolchildren who paid more attention to the
Capitol Park squirrels than to the picketers.</TE>
<TE>   But a few committee hearings were canceled or delayed Wednesday in
the Assembly. In the Senate, a Labor Committee hearing was postponed
until next week.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco), a familiar figure on picket lines across California,
joined the marchers to protest the award of the $2.45-million
painting contract to River City Painting Co.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he opposed hiring a nonunion contractor, contending
that there was a "grave question" about whether the company was
complying with health and safety laws. Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City) said through a spokeswoman that he would have
preferred the hiring of a union contractor.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Department of General Services, which oversees
the project, said the contractor submitted the "lowest responsible"
bid of two received. The second was $3.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The state spokesman said River City employees, who were giving the
building its first paint job since its restoration in 1981, were
being paid the equivalent of union wages under the state's
"prevailing" wage law. The law requires government entities to pay
nonunion workers the prevailing rates they would have received if
they had been union members.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Chairman Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) postponed a
scheduled hearing of his Labor and Industrial Relations Committee. He
said he called off the session when he and two other committee
Democrats decided not to attend and more than 50 witnesses from out
of town refused to cross the picket line.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon's action triggered a tongue-lashing on the Senate floor
from Republican Sen. Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, who accused him
of capitulating to a "special interest."</TE>
<TE>   "No private special interest should ever be permitted to disrupt
the public's business," McClintock said later. "This is an
unprecedented act. The central question is whether committees of the
Legislature are meeting only at the sufferance of private special
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon moved his committee staff to an office building across the
street so it could work, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By day's end, however, Wesson's office announced that District
Council 6 of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades,
had agreed to disband the picket line at the Capitol for a week while
negotiators attempted to work out a settlement.</TE>

<HD>2 Santa Barbara Officers Awarded $3.2 Million in Gender
Bias Suit</HD>
<DH>Police: The women accused the department of discrimination.
After a two-year legal battle, officials vow improvements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Santa Barbara police officers have won $3.2 million in damages in
their two-year legal battle charging harassment and systematic
discrimination against female officers.</LD>
<LD>   The case, which included charges that plaintiffs Juanita Smith and
Margaret Hause had received warnings to "watch their back" on patrol,
had become an increasing embarrassment to city officials. The
officials said Wednesday that changes have begun.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the significance of the jury award was that jurors
couldn't believe how hard the city dug its heels in on this," said
attorney David Nye, one of two lawyers representing the officers.
"The case was filed two years ago, and they were just trying to bring
the department into the modern age."</LD>
<TE>   A jury awarded the damages on Tuesday after a 19-day trial.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the trial began, according to Nye and attorney
Janean Acavedo Daniels, Smith was promoted to sergeant, but was given
the job of supervising parking checkers. That made her the first
female sergeant in the department's 102-history.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Michael Apland, a police spokesman, said Wednesday that Police
Chief Cam Sanchez was not in office when the suit was filed and plans
to improve the department's dealings with women officers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that we got sued, but good things can come out
of this," Apland said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara force has 154 sworn officers, including 10
women, Apland said. He said Sanchez will meet with the entire
department next week and will hold a separate meeting with women
officers.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing its decision, the jury specified $1.85 million in
damages for Smith and $1.35 million for Hause, a community relations
officer. Nye said both officers will ask Superior Court Judge James
Brown to order the city to pay their court costs, which are expected
to run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they have not decided whether to appeal the
decision or challenge the jury award.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by city officials to fight the lawsuit for two years
was similar to a stance taken by city officials in another case that
had embarrassing racial overtones for Santa Barbara almost two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Three members of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team had been
held by police at gunpoint and forced to lie spread-eagled on the
ground on a busy Santa Barbara street because they appeared to match
the general description of suspected bank robbers.</TE>
<TE>   The Globetrotters, in Santa Barbara for an exhibition game against
UC Santa Barbara, filed a $3-million federal lawsuit against the
city, contending that they were arrested because of their race.</TE>
<TE>   They settled the suit for $75,000 after about a year of
negotiation, saying that they had made their point.</TE>

<LD>An ex-convict who spent eight years as the editor of a Sacramento
magazine was arrested on charges of stealing the magazine owner's
identity.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Mathias, 39, was editor of Outward magazine, a bimonthly
publication on gay and lesbian issues. He is accused of taking owner
Fred Palmer's identity, as well as mail and credit card fraud, said
Assistant U.S. Atty. Laura Schwartz.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer said he fired Mathias, who once served time in federal
prison for fraud, in December when he discovered that the magazine

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a rise in recent years in the number of gray whales found dead
along the California coast, scientists say the trend now is
reversing.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, only five gray whales floated ashore, down from 58 the
previous year, said wildlife biologist Joe Cordaro of the National
Marine Fisheries Service.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-seven whales were found dead on California shores in 1999,
and 30 were found in 1998. During a regular year, state officials
find about 10 of the 700 to 1,000 that die offshore annually.</LD>
<TE>   Though the increase initially appeared alarming, many scientists
now believe that it may just have been the natural process of keeping
the gray whale population in check, Cordaro said Monday.</TE>

<LD>City officials are trying to find ways to save the city's zoo, which
is in dire need of funding for operations, animal birth control and

<LD>   The city allocates $1.2 million a year to the zoo, but it takes $3
million to operate, and there has been no money for improvements in
three decades, Director Ralph Waterhouse said.</LD>
<LD>   Without cash to expand exhibits, large animals must be put on
birth control because there is no room for their offspring,
Waterhouse said.</LD>

<HD>San Diego Student Allegedly Knew 3 of Sept. 11 Skyjackers</HD>
<DH>Court: He faces charges of lying on immigration forms. His
lawyer denies the claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN and H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Diego college student held on false document charges knew three
of the Sept. 11 skyjackers and helped them acclimate to the U.S. by
obtaining Social Security cards, driver's licenses and information
about student visas that could be used for flight schools in Florida,
according to federal court papers filed this week.</LD>
<LD>   Mohdar Abdallah, indicted last fall on charges of lying on U.S.
immigration forms, "regularly dined, worked and prayed with the
hijackers" who crashed an American Airlines jet into the Pentagon,
the federal court documents say.</LD>
<LD>   Abdallah, 21, is also described as a "close associate" of the
terrorists by a San Diego man who himself has been accused by
authorities of providing financial assistance to two of the
hijackers, the 18-page court filing says.</LD>
<TE>   The papers were filed as a response to a request by defense
attorneys that the immigration charges against the San Diego State
University student be dismissed. Abdallah is being held in federal
custody in San Diego on $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also asks that a notebook found in Abdallah's car,
which prosecutors say contains references to "planes falling from the
sky, mass killings and hijacking," should not be entered into
evidence because it was improperly discovered. The defense also says
the entries were written after Sept. 11 by someone other than
Abdallah.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution papers say Abdallah made himself available without a
lawyer present for interviews by FBI agents within days after the
East Coast attacks--including sessions held at two San Diego
restaurants--but that "he was neither truthful nor candid."</TE>
<TE>   As such, authorities allege, the agents "did not believe
Abdallah's denial of knowledge of the attacks or the plans of his
friends," Hani Hanjour, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid al-Midhar.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Kerry Steigerwalt, defending Abdallah in the documents
case, dismissed the allegations as unfair and unfounded, noting that
his client has been charged only with making false statements on
immigration forms.</TE>
<TE>   "If these [new] allegations were true, the government would have
indicted him a long time ago," Steigerwalt said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Randy Hamud, who represents Abdallah in connection with
deportation proceedings, added that the government's filing "has
absolutely nothing to do with the immigration counts" filed against
Abdallah.</TE>
<TE>   "These are nothing more than inflammatory statements by the
government to demonize my client," said Hamud. He also challenged a
prosecution contention that Abdallah failed to show up as promised
for a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   "When he told a community leader that agents wanted to administer
a polygraph, this person advised my client to talk to a lawyer
first," Hamud said. "Abdallah told the FBI he wanted to talk to a
lawyer first before agreeing to the test. That was his right."</TE>
<TE>   Hamud said Abdallah was arrested about 2 p.m. Sept. 21, though he
had agreed to meet with FBI agents again at 9 p.m. that day. He was
arrested while dropping off a friend at work.</TE>
<TE>   Abdallah is scheduled to be in court Monday, when attorneys will
argue over his lawyer's motion to dismiss the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   If he's convicted, Steigerwalt said, Abdallah would serve no more
than the time he already has spent in custody since he was arrested
by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also plan to press deportation proceedings against
Abdallah, regardless of the outcome of the criminal case.</TE>

<HD>Michael Todd Jr., 72; Producer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Todd Jr., son of the legendary producer of "Around the World
in 80 Days," who worked on the first Cinerama movie and later
produced the only feature film ever shot in Smell-o-Vision, has died.
He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Todd died of lung cancer Sunday at his home in County Carlow,
Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   After his flamboyant father died in a plane crash in 1958, the
soft-spoken Todd took over the reins of his motion picture production
company. The 28-year-old Todd inherited half of his father's
multimillion-dollar estate, which he shared with his 26-year-old
stepmother, Elizabeth Taylor, who had married Michael Todd Sr. only
13 months before his death.</LD>
<TE>   Although Todd never rivaled his father's success as a producer, he
made history with "Scent of Mystery," a 1960 film about a vacationing
Englishman who discovers a plot to kill a young American tourist in
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, which starred Denholm Elliott and Peter Lorre, tapped
an invention created by a Swiss professor who discovered how to
reproduce odors in movie theaters. The process consisted of tiny
plastic tubes hidden under the theater seats, through which could be
pumped garlic, pipe smoke and other scents from a centralized "smell
brain."</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper advertisements for "Scent of Mystery" played up the
revolutionary process' place in film history, proclaiming, "First
They Moved (1895)! Then They Talked (1927)! Now They Smell!"</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most critics turned their noses up at the process.
Sniffed Time magazine: "Customers will probably agree that the smell
they liked best was the one they got during intermission: fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   As for the picture itself, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther
deemed it an "artless, loose-joined 'chase' picture set against some
of the scenic beauty of Spain."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles in 1929, Todd was the only son of the senior
Todd and his first wife, Bertha, who died in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Todd, who barely made it through high school, insisted
that his son receive a good education. After graduating from Amherst
College, where he majored in philosophy, Todd went to work with his
father, who was a producer on "This Is Cinerama," a travelogue that
demonstrated the process' 3-D effect.</TE>
<TE>   It was the younger Todd's suggestion to include what became the
film's most famous sequence: a stomach-churning roller-coaster ride
from the vantage point of the coaster's front car.</TE>
<TE>   After working on "This is Cinerama," Todd joined the Navy. After
his discharge in 1957, he joined his father's film company as vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of his father, who had produced attractions for
the 1939 New York World's Fair, Todd produced a racially integrated
minstrel show for the 1964 New York World's Fair. But whereas his
father became one of the earlier exposition's top impresarios, Todd
did not. His "America, Be Seated!" closed after two performances.</TE>
<TE>   With his first wife, Sarah, whom he married in 1953, Todd had six
children, Cyrus, Susan, Sarah, Eliza Haselton, Daniel and Oliver.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, after his first wife's death, Todd married Susan
McCarthy, with whom he had two sons, Del and James. The family moved
to Ireland in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Todd and his wife co-wrote "A Valuable Property: The Life Story of
Michael Todd," in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and children, he is survived by a
half-sister, Liza.</TE>

<HD>Church Deal Is on Hold</HD>
<DH>Siege: Additional talks over the fate of 13 fighters sought
by Israel are needed, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A deal to end a 38-day standoff in Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity, one of Christianity's holiest sites, stalled early this
morning.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 Palestinians and international activists had been
set to leave the sacred grounds at daybreak, with the guarantee of
eventual safe passage abroad for 13 fighters on Israel's most-wanted
list.</LD>
<LD>   However, officials said today that additional negotiations over
the fighters would be needed before everyone could leave the church.
A negotiation session set for today was postponed, and buses parked
outside the shrine drove off.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, just as dawn was breaking, the Palestinian governor of
Bethlehem, Mohammed Madani, emerged, accompanied by two priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a real roller-coaster experience," said Andrew White,
special envoy for the archbishop of Canterbury and a member of the
negotiating team, referring to the past several days of talks.</TE>
<TE>   "From the inside, one minute everything looked so positive, the
next it looked like everything was lost," White said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that a suicide bombing that killed 15 Israelis near Tel
Aviv on Tuesday evening provided a strong incentive to resolve the
standoff quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms hammered out by Israel, the Palestinians, the
European Union and religious authorities in consultation with
Washington, 26 Palestinians viewed by Israel as a moderate security
threat were scheduled to leave the church first for transfer to the
Gaza Strip, a region largely under Palestinian control.</TE>
<TE>   They would be followed through the church's only exit, the
half-size Gate of Humility, by 85 Palestinian civilians. Finally, 10
members of the nongovernmental group International Solidarity
Movement would emerge, along with observers, including Los Angeles
Times photographer Carolyn Cole.</TE>
<TE>   The last group, the 13 Palestinian men viewed by Israel as a grave
security threat, would remain in the church for a short while until
deportation arrangements could be finalized.</TE>
<TE>   A key sticking point in the negotiations has been the fate of the
13 Palestinian fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Italy and Spain were considering taking some or all
of the men, negotiators said. The men would have a brief stop in
Egypt so that their families could say goodbye. The European Union
would safeguard the transfers.</TE>
<TE>   The men were required to sign documents declaring that they would
not engage in acts of terrorism. "I hope they will behave," Israeli
military spokesman Lt. Col. Olivier Rafowicz said, adding that it was
doubtful that the men would be let back into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also specifies that all weapons held by the members of
various Palestinian security and militia groups inside the church be
initially deposited in a small room of the shrine, Rafowicz added.
Other officials said that ultimately Israel will conduct ballistics
tests and confiscate any weapon linked to a crime or terrorist
attack. All legally held weapons will subsequently be returned to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal's memorandum of understanding, the Palestinian
civilians faced a maximum 30 minutes of questioning this morning by
Israeli authorities at the Gush Etzion military facility south of
Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement would offer several advantages. It would allow a deal
to proceed that has been all but done for days, pending a few
sticking points. For Israel, it would shift global attention away
from Manger Square, removing the potentially embarrassing images of a
handful of Palestinian fighters holding off the strongest army in the
Mideast for more than a month. And it would free up leaders in
several countries to focus their attention elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon could craft a response to
Tuesday's suicide bombing after cutting short his summit with
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat would be able to focus his energy on factional politics.
And the U.S. could concentrate on such issues as broader Mideast
policy and the continuation of its anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Vows to Combat Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader calls for U.S. protection as
Israel plans retaliation for a suicide bombing. Hamas says it will
continue attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>While Israelis debated how to dispose of him, Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, desperate to stave off another round of
military punishment, said Wednesday that he was ordering his forces
to put a halt to terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat announced the new orders in a brief, somber television
address even as a furious Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon planned
retaliation for a suicide bombing Tuesday night that killed 15
Israelis at a pool hall. Arafat called on the U.S. government for
protection.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon cut short a trip to the United States after news of the
latest Palestinian attack reached him, and rushed home to a
late-night emergency meeting of his security Cabinet. Early today,
the group gave Sharon and Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer power
to execute reprisals on "terrorist targets." No further details were
offered, but the two officials will have broad latitude to decide
what actions to take.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush declared that "whatever response
Israel decides to take, my hope, of course, is that the prime
minister keeps his vision of peace in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Among options discussed by the security Cabinet were expelling
Arafat and unleashing a massive assault on the Gaza Strip, which
remained relatively unscathed during Israel's recent invasion of
Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The densely populated Gaza is the home base of Hamas, the radical
Islamic organization that claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack
as well as dozens of others, including the Passover bombing in March
that was the deadliest yet. A Hamas leader vowed to continue the
carnage and, ominously, to defy Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Hamas will continue to resist occupation everywhere, any time,
regardless of the condemnation even from the Palestinian Authority,"
said Abdulaziz Rantisi.</TE>
<TE>   But in a hopeful sign, there were reports in Bethlehem that a
5-week-long siege of the Church of the Nativity was set to end today.
As outlined, a deal reached by negotiators would allow more than 100
Palestinians and international activists to leave the church
immediately, with safe passage abroad for 13 Palestinian fighters
wanted by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's bombing in Rishon Le Zion, a sprawling bedroom community
just south of Tel Aviv, shattered newly revived U.S. efforts to push
Israel and the Palestinians into negotiations and signaled another
escalation in bloodshed that has claimed more than 2,000 lives since
September 2000. The suicide bombing came as Israelis were beginning
to believe with relief that the army's offensive had succeeded in
impairing the Palestinian capacity to attack, and as Palestinians
were beginning to believe--also with relief--that perhaps the
devastating operation was over.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, another potential suicide bomber detonated his
explosives prematurely near an intersection in northern Israel,
injuring himself. Fearing that the man was still lethal, Israeli
sappers used a robot to drag him, writhing, across a road for
inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to the Israeli prime minister said Sharon would not order
Arafat's removal from the region just yet. Unable to bring the Bush
administration on board in a plan to expel Arafat, Sharon is instead
indicating that he would favor pushing the Palestinian leader out of
power and away from influence without necessarily removing him
physically.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has made the elimination of Arafat a condition to his
pursuit of a political settlement to the conflict and the negotiation
of an eventual Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration continues to view Arafat as the chosen
leader of the Palestinian people and does not want to see him harmed
physically, a likely outcome if Israeli forces try to seize him. At
the same time, Bush supports broad reforms to convert the Palestinian
Authority into a more democratic and transparent government. The
reforms, in theory, would eventually limit Arafat's power and usher
in a new generation of leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But pressure on Sharon to take fierce action was intense.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very possible that in the end, there will be no choice and
it will be necessary to expel Arafat," Education Minister Limor
Livnat, a conservative who was traveling with Sharon, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Cabinet Minister Shlomo Benizri of the Shas Party agreed. "Arafat
smells his end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the more moderate foreign minister, Shimon Peres, cautioned
against rash action that would bring more trouble. He said the idea
was foolish. Fellow Labor Party politician Yossi Beilin, a former
justice minister, said the plan would backfire by delivering Islamic
fundamentalists into power.</TE>
<TE>   "If Arafat is exiled, he will turn into a Dalai Lama," Beilin told
Israeli radio. "If he is killed, he will turn into a Che Guevara."</TE>
<TE>   At Arafat's compound in Ramallah on Wednesday, the mood was tense
and glum. Workers were still repairing the ruins after Israel's
34-day siege on the facility, which ended last week. They were adding
more sandbags to the windows in an attempt to fend off any invading
forces.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the Israelis] can do anything to us," Maj. Gen. Ribhi
Arafat, a top security official, said with a shrug. "All the doors
are open to them. Anything is possible."</TE>
<TE>   A group of Israeli and foreign political activists that arrived
said its members were there to "shield" the Palestinian leader from
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing what we can to protect him," said Uri Avnery, a
veteran left-wing Israeli activist who visited Arafat when the
Palestinian leader was under siege in Beirut in 1982. "We don't know
how effective" the action will be, Avnery said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's televised statement was directed at least in part to U.S.
and European officials, who have repeatedly demanded that he take a
tougher stand against militants who kill civilians. He is also under
growing pressure from Palestinians to streamline, rebuild and reform
his administration. Corruption, inefficiency and other long-standing
ills were only exacerbated in the current conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Arabic, Arafat asserted his position as leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the president of the
Palestinian Authority, and reiterated his "full commitment" to join
the "U.S. administration and the international community in their war
against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had ordered all Palestinian security forces to
"confront and prevent all terror attacks against Israeli civilians
from any Palestinian side or parties." At the same time, he ordered
the security forces to "confront any aggression or attack on
Palestinian civilians" by Israeli soldiers or Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   The words likely rang hollow for most Israelis because they don't
believe that Arafat has acted adequately to combat terrorism. Bush
labeled the statement "incredibly positive."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is unclear how effective Arafat's security services will
be at this stage. Many have been hit hard by Israeli attacks that
often target police or their stations. Israel has accused the police
of participating or fostering terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   "I call on the U.S. government, President Bush and the
international community to provide the support and needed protection
for the Palestinian security forces, whose infrastructure has been
destroyed by the Israeli occupation," Arafat said, "so that they can
carry out and implement their orders and their missions and duties to
completely stop any terror attempt targeting Israeli civilians or
Palestinian civilians and to prevent using terror as a political way
to achieve their goals."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Power Firms Are Ordered to Turn Over Trading Data</HD>
<DH>Energy: Regulators seek to determine if sellers tried to
manipulate the California market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Widening their probe of energy price manipulation, federal regulators
Wednesday ordered scores of electricity and natural gas sellers
across the nation to turn over documents related to trading
strategies.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order broadens the
scrutiny over fallen energy giant Enron Corp. to a large portion of
the industry, including private energy marketing firms, electric
utilities and generators owned by municipalities.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to demanding documents, the order asks energy sellers
to state whether they engaged in any of the market-manipulation
strategies outlined in Enron memos released Monday and to provide
supporting documentation.</LD>
<TE>   "It is hardball," said Roger Berliner, an energy lawyer
representing Los Angeles County before FERC. "It is unusual, but the
circumstances are unusual. Given the vociferous denials from
producers that they were engaged in any of these activities ... I
believe that FERC is properly concerned whether people have been
saying things that aren't true."</TE>
<TE>   As a large consumer of power, the county is supporting efforts by
Gov. Gray Davis to obtain billions of dollars in refunds.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC regulators demanded "copies of all communications or
correspondence, including e-mail messages, instant messages or
telephone logs, between your company and any other company ... with
respect to all of the trading strategies discussed in the Enron
memoranda."</TE>
<TE>   Officials also asked companies to state under oath whether they
attempted to manipulate California's energy market.</TE>
<TE>   "Your company's response is to be signed under oath, in the form
of an affidavit ... after the company ... has diligently conducted a
thorough investigation into the trading activities of the company's
employees and agents," said the FERC order, which was posted late
Wednesday on the agency's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The order covers transactions from 2000 and 2001. The firms were
given until May 22 to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, the commission is tired of this lingering issue
and wants to get beyond it," said one FERC official, who asked not to
be identified. "It's like a piece of bubble gum that sticks to the
bottom of your shoe."</TE>
<TE>   Power marketers offered guarded responses. "We just got the
e-mail, and we're trying to figure out what it says," said John
Stout, a vice president of Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Mirant Corp. spokesman Pat Dorant said his company "will continue
to cooperate with all inquiries so that we can try and resolve these
issues and move forward to the real question that we still haven't
answered in California: How are we going to have energy for our
future?"</TE>
<TE>   Though Enron is bankrupt, many other energy companies are quite
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can show similar behavior from other companies that aren't
bankrupt, that's money on the table," said Mark Cooper, an energy
policy analyst for the Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC order applies equally to sellers of electricity and
natural gas, the main fuel used to generate power. Electricity
sellers have long contended that the high cost of natural gas was one
of the main reasons they charged such high prices. But state
officials have maintained that gas marketers created artificial
shortages to drive up the fuel price.</TE>
<TE>   "When FERC goes looking for [electricity overcharges] the money
disappears into the gas price," Cooper said. "The gas price may have
been set on the basis of fictitious transactions."</TE>
<TE>   The FERC order describes each of the market manipulation
strategies outlined in the Enron memos. The complex schemes--given
such nicknames as Fat Boy, Death Star, Shorty and Ricochet by Enron
traders--generally involved taking advantage of loopholes in market
rules and oversight to increase profit and raise energy prices. The
Enron memos say other companies were doing similar things.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the description of each market maneuver, FERC officials
wrote a simple instruction for the energy firms: "Admit or deny."</TE>
<TE>   Enron, which is under new leadership and struggling to survive,
released the documents to the FERC on Monday but said it cannot say
whether they are accurate. During the energy crisis, its executives
denied manipulating energy prices in the wake of California's
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   The memos include two virtually identical documents prepared by
attorneys and dated Dec. 6 and 8 that were prepared in anticipation
of litigation or investigations involving Enron's trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   Although some California politicians said the Enron maneuvers
amount to fraud, it's unclear whether any of the actions described in
the memos were illegal. Some FERC staffers said it appears the
company merely took advantage of a poorly designed market structure
in California. However, one agency official said the California
market rules included ethics provisions approved by the FERC.
Violations of these provisions could be punishable by the federal
agency, this official said.</TE>
<TE>   California's Democrats in Congress applauded the agency's action.
In the past, lawmakers bitterly criticized the FERC for failing to
use its legal authority to ensure "just and reasonable" wholesale
energy prices. The FERC changed direction last summer, setting price
limits in the West. Chairman Patrick H. Wood III, an advocate of
deregulation, nonetheless promised to make the agency a tough cop on
the regulatory beat.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, FERC is fully carrying out its charge under
the law," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). "FERC's
investigation is critical for determining just what went wrong in
these energy markets and who was responsible for an energy crisis
that likely resulted in significant overcharges to consumers."</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly what FERC should be doing," said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo
(D-Atherton). "If we had been trying to pursue the truth and get to
the bottom of things a year and a half ago, California wouldn't be
holding the bag for billions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate request, the FERC asked the agency that runs
California's electric transmission grid for reams of data on power
transactions, which could give federal investigators another avenue
to identify companies that engaged in market abuses. The California
Independent System Operator said it would comply.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty extensive data request," said Stephanie McCorkle,
spokeswoman for the California ISO. "Obviously, [federal regulators]
are trying to track any manipulation of the market."</TE>
<TE>   The FERC request covers hour-by-hour transaction data from 2000
and 2001. The ISO plays a critical role in assuring there is enough
power available to meet consumer demand.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators will use the Enron memos as a road map for analyzing
the ISO information, another FERC official said. The goal is to see
whether the transactions reflect the market strategies outlined in
the memos.</TE>
<TE>   "What the memos say is 'these are the strategies,'" said the
official, who asked not to be identified. "They may help people who
have the data to analyze it. It may help to focus things."</TE>

<HD>First Humans to Receive ID Chips</HD>
<DH>Technology: Device injected under the skin will provide
identification and medical information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight people will be injected with silicon chips Friday, making them
scannable just like a jar of peanut butter in the supermarket
checkout line.</LD>
<LD>   The miniature devices, about the size of a grain of rice, were
developed by a Florida company. They will be targeted to families of
Alzheimer's patients--one of the fastest growing groups in American
society--as well as others who have complicated medical histories.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a safety precaution," explained Nate Isaacson. The retired
building contractor will enter his Fort Lauderdale doctor's office
Friday as an 83-year-old with Alzheimer's.</LD>
<TE>   He'll leave it a cyborg, a man who is also a little bit of a
computer.</TE>
<TE>   The chip will be put in Isaacson's upper back, effectively
invisible unless a hand-held scanner is waved over it. The scanner
uses a radio frequency to energize the dormant chip, which then
transmits a signal containing an identification number. Information
about Isaacson is cross-referenced under that number in a central
computer registry.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency room personnel, for instance, could find out who
Isaacson is and where he lives. They'd know that he is prone to
forgetfulness, that has a pacemaker and is allergic to penicillin.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what's going to happen when you go out the door,"
said Isaacson's wife, Micki. "Should something happen, he's never
going to remember those things."</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital Solutions Inc., the maker of what it calls the
VeriChip, says that it will soon have a prototype of a much more
complex device, one that is able to receive GPS satellite signals and
transmit a person's location.</TE>
<TE>   It's a prospect deeply unsettling to privacy advocates, no matter
how voluntary the process may initially appear.</TE>
<TE>   "Who gets to decide who gets chipped?" asked Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
"Parents will decide that their kids should be implanted, or maybe
their own aging parents. It's an easier way to manage someone, like
putting a leash on a pet."</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital, which says it has a waiting list of 4,000 to
5,000 people who want a VeriChip, plans to operate a "chipmobile"
that visits Florida senior citizen's centers. An estimated 4 million
people nationally have Alzheimer's, with more than 10% of them in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Not Just for Those</TE>
<TE>   With Alzheimer's</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey and Leslie Jacobs and their teenage son Derek, whose
"chipping" will be a national media event, don't have problems with
dementia. The Boca Raton, Fla., family has a mixture of ailments and
interests: Jeffrey has been treated for Hodgkin's disease and suffers
from other conditions for which he takes 16 medications, while Derek
is allergic to certain antibiotics. Mostly, though, he's a computer
buff who considers the procedure nifty. As for Leslie, she's merely
hoping to feel more secure in an insecure world.</TE>
<TE>   A third group readying themselves for the simple outpatient
procedure Friday are executives of Applied Digital, a publicly traded
company based in Palm Beach. Even their publicist is doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Getting chipped is easy. Making it more useful than a piece of
body art will be harder.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of practical issues here, as well as ethical and
privacy issues," said Mark Pafford, associate executive director of
the Alzheimer's Assn.'s Southeast Florida chapter. "If it were me, I
would use something tried and proven, like a ID bracelet or a
necklace that has an 800 number. This VeriChip seems like it would
inhibit someone being returned home in a timely fashion. Who knows
how to look under someone's skin?"</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital says nearly all the major hospitals in the West
Palm Beach area will be equipped with the scanners. Yet St. Mary's
Medical Center, a major trauma center approached at random by a
reporter, said no one had contacted that hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson's family says he has a bracelet. He also has a wallet
with an ID.</TE>
<TE>   "The VeriChip is more of a 'God forbid,'" said Sherry Gottlieb,
Isaacson's daughter. "You feel you have to have it, but hope you
never need it."</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital is charging $200 for a chip, plus a $10 monthly
fee to store the information. As the first patients, Isaacson and the
Jacobses are getting their VeriChips for free, but that's the only
financial consideration they are receiving.</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson's doctor, while agreeing to perform the insertion, has
some qualms about it. He consented to be interviewed but asked that
his name not be revealed until Friday. While protests against the
VeriChip have been minimal, neither the doctor nor Applied Digital
are eager to see demonstrations. A few religious groups say the chips
are "the mark of the Beast" referred to in the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is going to be the cutting edge of the future,
because quick information saves lives," Isaacson's doctor said. "I
get calls 24 hours a day informing me that a patient has had a stroke
or a heart attack and is in the hospital. I have to go to my office,
get the chart, and then go to the hospital. All that takes time,
while the patient is being treated with limited information."</TE>
<TE>   And yet this family practitioner doesn't see himself chipping any
youthful patients. While he believes the procedure is safe and the
chip can always be removed, he's worried about long-term liability.
"You do something to a young person, you may be responsible for years
afterwards. He may be carrying this chip for 70 or 80 years."</TE>
<TE>   Long before then--by the end of the year, in fact--the next
generation of devices will be tested.</TE>
<TE>   An embedded chip with GPS capabilities would be slightly larger
than a quarter and require actual surgery to implant. Unlike the
VeriChip, it also would require Food and Drug Administration
approval. That will slow down its U.S. introduction.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have solved the battery issue, which leaves the
question of an antenna that can transmit through skin tissue," said
Keith Bolton, Applied Digital's chief scientist. The devices will be
powered by lithium ion batteries, which can be charged remotely from
outside the body.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in Device</TE>
<TE>   in Brazil and Mexico</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital says it has already received considerable interest
in the VeriChip from both commercial and government sources in Brazil
and Mexico, and expects the embedded system to be big wherever there
is a big threat of kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of such sales is no doubt one reason Applied Digital
stock, which traded as low as 11 cents in the last year, recently
quadrupled to about $2.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate insiders were sellers of the stock before the recent
run-up, which might indicate a lack of faith in the company's
viability.</TE>
<TE>   The stock fell 6 cents to $2.01 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital is heavily indebted but says it will have actual
earnings this quarter before interest, taxes and depreciation are
accounted for.</TE>

<LD>With the prospect of a new NFL stadium hovering overhead like the
Goodyear blimp, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $2.4-billion
downtown redevelopment plan Wednesday that promises new housing, jobs
and social services in blighted sections of the city's historic core.</LD>
<LD>   Acting on a complex proposal that came together with
uncharacteristic swiftness, the council voted 12 to 3 to create a
special district that could bring nearly 13,000 new housing units
downtown and provide $150 million to improve life for the city's
homeless.</LD>
<LD>   It could also provide a mechanism to help Denver billionaire
Philip Anschutz build a downtown stadium for a relocated National
Football League team, most likely the San Diego Chargers, who have
agreed to move their training camp to a new, Anschutz-owned sports
complex in nearby Carson.</LD>
<TE>   Council members insisted that the stadium wasn't a driving force
behind their approval of the redevelopment plan, which they said was
aimed solely at giving a lift to beleaguered sections of the central
city. In fact, a stadium is not mentioned in the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some members acknowledged that Anschutz's proposed stadium
could play a role in the redevelopment, and others based their
dissent on concerns about the possibility of spending public money on
a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss said he joined council members Wendy Greuel
and Dennis Zine in voting against the measure because there were too
many unanswered questions, including whether the city would wind up
subsidizing private projects such as the stadium and a new downtown
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd sum it up as too many dollars, too many questions and not
enough public process," Weiss said. "My questions concern the
underlying necessity of spending what could be billions of government
dollars on the pursuit of redevelopment."</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz is heading a high-powered coalition of business leaders
who announced last week that they want to build a stadium near
Staples Center, another Anschutz project that involved a complicated
partnership with the city.</TE>
<TE>   The council's vote could make it easier to build a stadium because
the city's redevelopment agency has the power of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   The agency could exercise that power to purchase land for projects
that are deemed to be in the best interests of the city. That could
include a football stadium, assuming the agency believes that it will
help the downtown economy.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment proposal has caught some people by surprise.
Last year, the City Council ordered the agency to put the so-called
City Center project on a fast track. It typically takes 18 months to
create a redevelopment proposal, but the City Center plan was
formulated in less than half that time.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Goodheart, co-director of research for the Los Angeles
Alliance for a New Economy, complained that the plan came together a
little too quickly--and without sufficient public debate. Her
organization is an advocate for low-income housing and generally
keeps close watch on the council and redevelopment agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It took us by surprise," she said. "We read about it in the paper
just like everybody else. I didn't know it was moving so fast."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, renewed efforts to lure a pro football team are
apparently gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Key principals in the effort--Tim Leiweke, president of the
Anschutz Entertainment Group, and Casey Wasserman, owner of Arena
Football's L.A. Avengers--were scheduled to meet in New York today
with NFL executives.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions were expected to touch on a variety of issues that
must be dealt with before a team could move to Los Angeles, primarily
a $150-million NFL loan that could be used for the construction of a
stadium and guarantees that the city could host future Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Such discussions, however, are not necessarily an indication that
a deal is close to being struck. And even under the rosiest scenario,
the soonest a Super Bowl could be held in Los Angeles would be 2007.</TE>
<TE>   A franchise cannot be relocated to Los Angeles without the
approval of 24 of the league's current 32 owners.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Chargers are the leading candidates to move, there is
no obvious exit clause in their lease until after the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Other teams that could potentially move in a few years are the
Indianapolis Colts, Buffalo Bills, New Orleans Saints and Arizona
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, city officials went to pains to emphasize that
the redevelopment plan is not being driven by the proposed football
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything about this stadium," said Jerry Scharlin,
administrator of the Community Redevelopment Agency. "The only thing
I've heard about it is what I've read in the papers. It certainly
hasn't been in our plans."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti said football "is not what this is about
for us decision makers today. There is certainly no subsidy for any
football team, any football stadium or any billionaire involved in
this." He acknowledged that the council action could "theoretically"
make it easier to build a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "If people were convinced that it was a good idea--and that means
everyone--then the CRA redevelopment area could make it easier for
that to happen. But that's a long way down the road," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Center redevelopment district is intended to create up to
12,900 new units of housing, one-quarter of which would be classified
affordable, and up to 6.7 million square feet of commercial and
industrial development.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also dedicates $150 million over 30 years for the city's
estimated 11,000 homeless people. Some of that would pay to relocate
and modernize facilities that offer services for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Money would also go toward adult education and training, mental
health centers and funding of studies on how to reduce homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the plan allocates funds to rehabilitate historic
buildings in an 879-acre swath covering 180 city blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment district is bounded by 2nd and 3rd streets on
the north; San Pedro Street, Stanford Avenue and Griffith Avenue on
the east; the Santa Monica Freeway on the south, and Figueroa Street
and the Harbor Freeway on the west. It includes the South Park,
Historic Downtown and City Markets neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The plan relies on money from an expected increase in property
taxes, which would swell with an expected increase in property
values. Eighty percent of any new property taxes would be set aside
from the usual tax stream and be channeled instead into the CRA and a
housing trust fund. The rest would go to the usual recipients: the
city, county and Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment agency anticipates spending nearly $2.4 billion
to accomplish its goals over the next 30 to 45 years. The agency can
condemn land and displace residents and businesses, but it has to
create an affordable housing unit for each one it tears down and help
relocate involuntarily displaced people.</TE>
<TE>   A previous redevelopment district existed in the area, but the
agency hasn't received any money from it since November 2000, when it
hit a legal cap of $750 million. That plan, known as the Central
Business District, led to the creation of Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., was bullish about the latest redevelopment plan,
saying it could do for downtown Los Angeles what similar measures did
for the Gaslamp district in San Diego and the Flats in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with other projects, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall
and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, "it could all come
together really well, and we could have a very powerful downtown," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said such attractions and a major hotel near the Convention
Center would make downtown Los Angeles competitive for large shows.</TE>
<TE>   A stadium would add the possibility of Super Bowls to the mix.
Though a handful of preseason, regular-season and playoff games would
add a little to the local economy, Super Bowls can pour in hundreds
of millions of dollars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's checkered history with the NFL fed some skepticism of
any plan to use the redevelopment district to build a football
stadium. In 1999, the league awarded its 32nd team to Houston rather
than Los Angeles after receiving a $700 million check from a Houston
billionaire.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be no corporate welfare in that whole process," said
Tony Perez, a spokesman for Los Angeles Councilman Ed Reyes. "I think
we've shown as a city we don't need the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Tony Perry, Mitchell Landsberg and Sam Farmer
contributed to this report.</TE>
