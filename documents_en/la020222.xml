<HD>New Game Is Blowin' on the Web</HD>
<DH>Internet*  In an intricate pool, more than 1,000 Bob Dylan
fans bet on what the singer-songwriter will play in concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>He may not know it, but when Bob Dylan signals his band to start a
song onstage tonight in Dallas, more than 1,000 people far from the
arena are keenly interested in his choice.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of the veteran troubadour have launched an intricate Internet
pool built on their predictions of what Dylan sings in concert.</LD>
<LD>   The pool reflects both the obsessive interest Dylan still draws 40
years into his career and the way this road warrior has structured
his career. He generally plays more than 150 concerts a year.</LD>
<TE>   For the fans, it's mostly fun.</TE>
<TE>   "If I ever got a chance to meet him, I'd say 'thanks,'" said one
player, Becky Dalton, of Westminster, Calif. "I'm almost 49, and he
makes me feel 16 when I go to see him. He'd probably look at us and
say, 'get a life.'"</TE>
<TE>   Dylan is into the second decade of what is jokingly called his
"Never-Ending Tour." He's typically on the road for a month or two at
a time, rests for a few weeks, then starts anew.</TE>
<TE>   There are 1,054 people from 50 countries competing in the Internet
pool for his current set of dates, which ends Sunday in Austin. He
returns on April 5 in Stockholm for a five-week European swing.</TE>
<TE>   The pool was started a year ago by 24-year-old Canadian graduate
student and computer expert Arthur Louie, and has quickly grown.</TE>
<TE>   Participants pick a set of songs, which are given point values:
low for the songs Dylan plays most frequently, high for the songs he
plays rarely.</TE>
<TE>   It's a game that could be created around very few artists. For one
thing, not many perform as much as Dylan. For another, most acts are
so tightly choreographed that their set lists change very little, if
at all, from city to city.</TE>
<TE>   The Grateful Dead, while still active, could have probably done
it. Phish, now on hiatus, had a similar game going, Louie said.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan usually plays around 20 songs a night. During a 35-date
concert swing last fall, he played 92 different songs, Louie said.
The pool has exhaustively cataloged his current tour: "Blowin' in the
Wind," "Honest With Me" and "Summer Days" were played on each of the
first 14 dates.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve different songs, including "Visions of Johanna" and "Simple
Twist of Fate," were performed only once.</TE>
<TE>   Dylanologists study his set lists posted every morning after
concerts for tendencies. They've noticed he's begun most concerts
lately with an acoustic cover tune, and has been performing a lot of
songs from his Grammy-nominated album, "Love and Theft."</TE>
<TE>   That might be expected--artists usually try to promote their
latest albums on tour--but it hasn't always been the case with Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   His unpredictability is legendary. Larry Shapiro, 46, an
environmental attorney from New York City, says he's moved up to
149th place in the current competition mostly because he's given up
trying to stay a step ahead of the maestro.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a frightening thought to think that anybody can think like
Bob," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Winners of the game can actually win prizes, though Dylan might
not appreciate them. The grand prize for the current competition is a
CD boxed set of bootlegged Dylan concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Does Dylan himself know about the game? That's cause for
speculation on the Dylan pool; his spokesman, Elliott Mintz, thinks
not. Mintz wrote down the Web address (http://pool.dylantree.com)
when told about the game to check it out himself.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, he doesn't spend any time online," Mintz said.
"He's not a big computer guy."</TE>

<HD>'Wait Wait' Quiz Show Gives Dignified NPR a Chance to Cut
Loose</HD>
<DH>Panelists skewer the news on satiric, fast-paced program,
which travels to Pasadena on Thursday for a live-audience broadcast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its stuffy subtitle, "The NPR News Quiz," the game show "Wait
Wait ... Don't Tell Me!" may sound deadly dull but at least
educational and good for you--the radio equivalent of eating your
spinach.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, however, the name can be deceiving, as the
subversive program uses limericks, impressions, skits and jokes to
attack the news of the week, skewering everything from "the silly
things politicians do, to Britney Spears' latest bon mot," said host
Peter Sagal.</LD>
<LD>   "It's National Public Radio, without all that dignity," said the
actor, essayist and playwright, adding that he hates snobbish
listeners who believe "public radio shouldn't be for the masses, it
should be for the elite. Their ideal public radio show is so
abstruse, so good for you, the only person interested in listening to
it is the host.</LD>
<TE>   "We think public radio listeners are intelligent, but they also
like to be entertained," Sagal continued. "It's our news, dammit. We
ought to be able to make fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong program, heard locally on KPCC-FM (89.3) Saturdays
from 11 a.m. to noon, is entering its fifth year on the air. And this
Thursday, the troupe will record a live show at 7:30 p.m. for an
audience in Pasadena, at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-paced show features several segments with its regular
panelists answering questions and joking about the big or offbeat
news stories of the previous week, dissecting current events and
homing in on their most bizarre elements the way any group of
listeners might, Sagal said. "We try to generate the ideal
water-cooler conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Regular panelists include humorist Roy Blount Jr., BBC
correspondent Sue Ellicott, writer and comic Adam Felber, political
satirist P.J. O'Rourke, Esquire writer Charles Pierce and Washington
Post Style section writer Roxanne Roberts, while veteran NPR newsman
Carl Kassel serves as the show's official judge and scorekeeper.
They're joined by five listeners a week who call in to play the game,
finishing esoteric limericks based on a news item, or guessing who
Kassel is impersonating when he reads a quote from a newsmaker.</TE>
<TE>   The contestants are each vying for the grand (and only) prize:
Kassel will record the outgoing message on their home answering
machines.</TE>
<TE>   "We ain't 'Wheel of Fortune,'" noted Sagal, who instead welcomes
comparisons to the Groucho Marx game show of the 1950s and '60s, "You
Bet Your Life."</TE>
<TE>   "Wait Wait" senior producer Rod Abid compares the program to "To
Tell the Truth," the vintage game show that gathered bons vivants of
the day to chat and joke around. The game and prizes were almost
secondary to the show's conviviality. And unlike "Hollywood Squares,"
the "Wait Wait" personalities aren't given the questions ahead of
time to work on their quips.</TE>
<TE>   "We rely on our panelists to be fast and smart and funny, and they
come through for us," Abid said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the show's most popular segments is "Not My Job," in which
celebrity guests answer questions on behalf of listeners. On recent
shows, John Mahoney of "Frasier" was quizzed about ketchup, author
Salman Rushdie answered questions about Pez candy and former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was tested on people who died
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out she had a really great sense of humor," said Kassel,
the news reader on NPR's "Morning Edition," now in his 52nd year of
broadcasting and, one might think, too dignified to be mixed up in an
endeavor like this.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kassel said he relishes the chance to cut loose, even
reciting poetry or singing "What's New, Pussycat?" for game winners'
answering machines.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the old quiz programs, when radio was a big deal in
the '40s and '50s," he said. "I always loved those programs, and
always wanted to be a part of them."</TE>
<TE>   NPR created "Wait Wait" in 1998, when the network was trying to
diversify its weekend programming, and aimed to make an entertainment
show that would appeal to the listeners of NPR news.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're listening to NPR news all week, it might be nice to get
a little reward at the end," said Torey Malatia, president and
general manager of Chicago Public Radio, whose station WBEZ-FM
co-produces the show with NPR and serves as its home base.</TE>
<TE>   He said it took a couple of years of tinkering with the format and
the personalities to get the chemistry right. Sagal, originally a
panelist on the show, was made host a few months after it began in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "When the show started, it was laboring under the horrible
expectation we had to be funny," Sagal said. Then he and the others
realized that the show would work best if they simply concentrated on
the things that made them laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait Wait" is now one of the network's fastest-growing shows,
heard on 200 stations by about 1 million listeners per week. Those
figures are about double what they were two years ago, Abid said.</TE>
<TE>   When he first got the job, Sagal--who was literary manager of the
Los Angeles Theater Center when he lived here from 1987 to 1992--said
he was simply an NPR junkie who liked to critique the shows he was
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I listen to these people and think, 'I'm clever. They should give
me an hour a week to talk about whatever I want to,'" he said. "Be
careful what you wish for."</TE>
<TE>   And even though the show is based in Chicago, Sagal is the only
one on the air working there. Kassel is at NPR headquarters in
Washington, D.C., while the panelists are spread throughout the
country from Massachusetts to Los Angeles, brought together for their
Friday tapings by static-free phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the Chicago studio with his headphones on, Sagal said,
"I hear the voices in my head. It's a little bit like Joan of Arc,
but I never got to put on the armor."</TE>
<TE>   Kassel said he didn't even meet Sagal until a few months into the
program. But everyone gets together for the troupe's live shows, of
which they do about six to 10 a year. At those events, the program's
rabid fans clamor for Sagal, and especially Kassel, like rock stars.</TE>
<TE>   "People were screaming and yelling. I couldn't believe it," Kassel
said, recalling one show in which he and Sagal opened by running down
the aisle to the stage. "It really was like a rock concert."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's live show at Caltech will be taped and broadcast on
March 2. Tickets are $20, $25 and $35 per seat, with KPCC members
getting a $2 discount. And, yes, tour T-shirts will be sold.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like it when we get to see" the listeners, Sagal said.
"We habitually say tasteless things that never get on the air. And
it's nice to get a reaction to what we're doing."</TE>

<HD>Salonen's Contract Extended to 2006</HD>
<DH>Music* The conductor of the L.A. Philharmonic will be on
the podium for the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in the
fall of 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with unveiling the schedule for its 84th winter season, the Los
Angeles Philharmonic announced Thursday that the orchestra's
high-profile music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen, will be around to see
it through: Salonen's contract, which was set to expire in September,
has been extended three years, through the 2005-06 season.</LD>
<LD>   The new contract formally ensures what the orchestra has long
promised: that Salonen, 43, who has been courted by other major
orchestras, will be on the podium not only for 2002-03, the
Philharmonic's final season at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, but also for the opening of the orchestra's new home, Walt
Disney Concert Hall, in the fall of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "We're watching the Disney Hall architecture go up, but Salonen is
the cornerstone," said the Philharmonic's executive vice president
and managing director, Deborah Borda. "He's the key structural
element of the orchestra and our musical world." The new contract,
she added, also includes a provision for further extensions.</LD>
<TE>   Salonen's current contract had been expected to carry the
conductor through the opening of Disney Hall, but after it was
signed, construction delays caused the opening date of the concert
hall to be pushed back several times.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002-2003 season will open Oct. 3 and end May 25, 2003. Among
highlights announced at a luncheon press conference Thursday was the
continuation of the Philharmonic's artist-in-residency program,
featuring composer John Adams and violinist Midori.</TE>
<TE>   Midori will perform as a soloist in two weeks of concerts and
participate in education programs. Adams will have two major works
performed in 2002-2003 season: the Los Angeles premiere of "El Nino,"
a multimedia oratorio for orchestra, film, chorus and dancers
produced by Peter Sellars, which premiered in Paris in 2001; and the
reprise of a Los Angeles Philharmonic commission, "Naive and
Sentimental Music," which the orchestra premiered in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The works will be performed in L.A. and during the orchestra's
tour to New York, where the orchestra will be presented in the
Lincoln Center Great Performers series at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music and at Avery Fisher Hall. Adams is reported to be preparing a
commission for the opening of Disney Hall, but Borda would not
confirm the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Special programming for the 2002-2003 season includes an
exploration of Latin influence on U.S. culture in two weeks of
programs. The orchestra will perform works by Latin American
composers. In January 2003, Salonen leads the world premiere of
Mexican Gabriela Ortiz's Concerto for Percussion; Copland's "El salon
Mexico" and Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas' "Redes," performed
with a film by Paul Strand.</TE>
<TE>   The program is a collaboration with the Latin-American Cinemateca
of Los Angeles, which will arrange ancillary events. The March 2003
performances of Adams' "El Nino" in Los Angeles and a chamber music
concert series focusing on Latin American composers will be
surrounded by similar related community arts activities.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Ortiz concerto, other world premieres during the
season include William Kraft's English Horn Concerto, a Philharmonic
commission (Jan. 16, 18 and 19, 2003), and Augusta Read Thomas'
Trombone Concerto (March 29 and 30, 2003).</TE>
<TE>   U.S. premieres include "Le rovine di Palmira," a large-scale work
by Italian composer Alberto Colla, conducted by Roberto Abbado (Jan.
31 and Feb. 1 and 2, 2003); "Your Rockaby" by British composer
Mark-Anthony Turnage for solo saxophone and orchestra (Feb. 21
through 23, 2003); and Gerald Levinson's "Five Fires" (April 10
through 12, 2003).</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich Cycle Will Be Continued</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic will also continue the second year of its
five-year cycle of performing the complete symphonies and string
quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich with the composer's Symphony No. 6
(Oct. 16 through 18).</TE>
<TE>   Three Los Angeles music organizations--the Philharmonic, the Music
Center's Master Chorale and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra--will
collaborate during the season to explore various interpretations of
the Nativity, including the "El Nino" performances. The Philharmonic
and the Master Chorale will perform Berlioz's "L'enfance du Christ"
(Dec. 20 through 22), and the Master Chorale and Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra will perform Handel's "Messiah" (April 5 and 6, 2003).</TE>
<TE>   Conductors and artists making their debuts in the Phil's winter
season include Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski and Canadian Peter
Oundjian. Chinese pianist Lang Lang, who made his debut with the
Philharmonic at Hollywood Bowl in 2000, will perform for the first
time during the subscription season Dec. 5 through 8.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic has scheduled a Farewell to the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion Gala for mid-season, on Dec. 13, with the programming yet to
be announced.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra will end the 2002-03 season next spring with three
weeks of concerts conducted by Salonen and guest conductor Pierre
Boulez. As a finale, the last three season concerts, May 22 through
25, 2003, conducted by Boulez, will conclude with Haydn's Symphony
No. 45, "Farewell." The symphony calls for musicians to walk out, one
by one, until no one is left onstage.</TE>

<CX>   Salonen contract--In a story in Friday's Calendar about the Los
Angeles Philharmonic's plans, the dates of Esa-Pekka Salonen's new
contract were correct, but because the agreement goes into effect this
spring, it is actually a four-year contract, not a three-year contract as
the story indicated.</CX>

<LD>"Coloreds to the rear." That's what African American bus riders heard
in Alabama until the late 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Those words apply to an even wider archive of social injustice,
though, for blacks were confined to "the rear" not only on many buses
throughout much of the 20th century, but in nearly all aspects of
U.S. society.</LD>
<LD>   As black civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois asked, "Where do we
come in?"</LD>
<TE>   Every February, is television's answer.</TE>
<TE>   That's because, in addition to a ratings sweeps period, in the
U.S. this is Black History Month, a designation that seems to have
sprung from the Negro History Week that Harvard scholar Carter G.
Woodson began promoting in 1926 to celebrate positive contributions
of African Americans. And why not? They sure weren't being mentioned
in history books of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Where is TV in this scenario? As always, following along pliantly.</TE>
<TE>   February is when the small screen ghettoizes black-tinted TV
movies and documentaries the way white Americans once did an entire
race, and the way public transportation in Alabama was split by skin
color until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's segregated
busing law in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   This black blitz of February happens annually all across the
channel-scape. You name it, from the recent "Lumumba" and "The Middle
Passage" on HBO to "The Heroes of Black Comedy" on Comedy Central and
Sunday's "Homes of the Underground Railroad" on Home &amp; Garden
Television.</TE>
<TE>   "There are homes in America that provided more than just shelter,"
the latter begins on a cable channel whose deep digging usually comes
in flower beds. "They offered sanctuary."</TE>
<TE>   Only black programs stamped Important gain entry to February's
sanctuary. Among them are a pair of worthy Sunday offerings about
20th century rights struggles: "The Rosa Parks Story" on CBS and
"10,000 Black Men Named George" on Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Ably played here by Angela Bassett, Parks, now 89, is the quiet,
prim-looking former Alabaman whose heroic refusal to surrender her
seat to a white passenger sparked the pivotal 381-day boycott of
Montgomery buses by blacks that led to that 1956 high court decision.
As a bonus, it also revved up the civil rights movement and summoned
to center stage a charismatic young minister named Martin Luther King
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   TV's Parks shares the camera Sunday with her husband, Raymond
(Peter Francis James), whose bitter resistance here to the civil
rights crusade and his wife's spiny activism is never quite clarified
in Paris Qualles' script, making his ultimate change of heart all the
more awkward and abrupt. In recalling this odyssey of decisive black
resistance, moreover, "The Rosa Parks Story" falls well short of
"Boycott," HBO's superior documentary-style account (which premiered
last February).</TE>
<TE>   While centering mainly on Parks, though, it does flash back
strikingly to some of the humiliations suffered by Southern blacks
under white oppression in the '30s, '40s and '50s. There she is being
turned away repeatedly by a smug white dinosaur when trying to
register to vote. There she is being thrown off a bus in a rainstorm
when refusing to re-board through the back door, as required, after
paying her fare in the front and taking a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Director Julie Dash thickens the schmaltz a bit as Parks' story
winds down, and dramatic license clashes with history from time to
time in this movie and also in Showtime's, which was written by Cyrus
Nowrasteh, who earlier directed and wrote "The Day Reagan Was Shot,"
a Showtime work whose credibility was attacked in some circles.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Parks story, "10,000 Black Men Named George"
validates that Frederick Douglass refrain: "Power concedes nothing
without a demand." Power, in this case, was the Pullman Co., and its
demanding nemesis, captured persuasively by Andre Braugher, was A.
Philip Randolph. Pullman responded with brutality to Randolph's
12-year underdog campaign to unionize underpaid, abused black railway
porters whom whites addressed monolithically as "George."</TE>
<TE>   "This company will never sit down 'round a table with Randolph or
any colored," Pullman boss Barton Davis (Kenneth McGregor) snarls in
this interesting "Matewan" on rails, directed by Robert Townsend.
Despite being targeted by violence and other union-busting tactics,
though, the urbane Randolph, his street-fighter partner, Milton
Webster (Charles S. Dutton), and their Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters ultimately prevailed in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph would go on to become a noted civil rights leader. His
path later crossed, unpleasantly for him, with Adam Clayton Powell
Jr., the Harlem congressman and subject of last week's intriguing
"Keep the Faith, Baby" on Showtime that featured strong work by Harry
Lennix as this shrewd, swaggering demagogue.</TE>
<TE>   No sound-minded person would argue against TV programs defining
African Americans by their history, nor against stories relating the
histories of any other ethnic group. These black accounts, in fact,
are usually higher in quality than the norm of prime time, and better
to be clustered here than not appear at all.</TE>
<TE>   Yet why must the vast bulk be herded into a single month, as if
blacks and whites had no shared history? If they're valuable--and
they are--they should be assimilated, not quarantined in a way that,
in this case, forces many viewers to choose Sunday between "The Rosa
Parks Story" and "10,000 Black Men Named George."</TE>
<TE>   Making February Black History Month on TV implies that March
through January are exclusively white history months.</TE>
<TE>   If TV wants to observe a black history month, moreover, why not do
the same for Latinos and Asian Americans who also have not always
been treated honestly by mainstream white historians?</TE>
<TE>   It's true the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People
and its co-founder DuBois were born in February, by the way. Also in
February, the 15th Amendment was passed, giving blacks the right to
vote. The first black U.S. senator took his oath of office. The first
known black sit-in occurred at a segregated lunch counter, and
Malcolm X was assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Yet other months have also yielded a spate of seminal events in
African American annals, including November, when Alabama's Jim Crow
busing statute took that lethal hit from the Supreme Court, giving
Rosa Parks her lofty place in history.</TE>
<TE>   What a shame that she and 10,000 other black stories are crammed
into February.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of a City in Despair</HD>
<DH>In 'The Town Is Quiet,' Robert Guediguian returns to
Marseille for an unflinching look at human frailties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intimate and human yet deeply ambitious, a powerhouse of a film made
with a disturbing vision, Robert Guediguian's "The Town Is Quiet" has
a title that turns out to be savagely ironic. For if the town in
question is anything, it's anything but quiet.</LD>
<LD>   That would be Marseille, the birthplace of
writer-director-producer Guediguian, one of the most prominent of
France's new breed of regional filmmakers. Guediguian has lived in
Paris for 25 years, but each of his 10 films has been set in
Marseille. Although his earlier works, notably the sunny box-office
hit "Marius and Jeanette," have been well received, they give no hint
of the scope of what he has attempted here.</LD>
<LD>   "The Town Is Quiet" opens with a magisterial 360-degree pan of
Marseille, with the camera moving slowly around the city's harbor as
an unseen young pianist plays a classical medley. The effect is
simultaneously melancholy, lonely and also somewhat intimidating.
"The Town Is Quiet" is an X-ray of a city, an involving neo-realistic
look at how people on several strata of society try to cope with the
desperate circumstances of their lives. It's a pitiless film,
uncompromising in what it shows us.</LD>
<TE>   Yet it is precisely Guediguian's all-seeing dispassion, his
intimate knowledge and unblinking eye for human frailties that make
his film so effective. Despite its bleak nature, "The Town Is Quiet"
is honest and unexaggerated, never done for effect. And it is wise
enough not to offer answers, not to pretend to solutions to personal
and societal problems that are far from simple. As the director has
said, "I wanted to talk of everything that scares me."</TE>
<TE>   Although he is a former member of France's Communist Party,
Guediguian (who co-writes his scripts with Jean-Louis Milesi) is
anything but didactic. What is just as rare for a politically
committed filmmaker, his people are never merely symbolic, but always
completely believable and individual. The acting in the film is not
just a means to an end, but a satisfying end in itself. The overall
picture "Quiet" paints is of a culture that has lost its moorings and
a city that is flirting with decline and collapse. Once a workers'
citadel where class identification was strong, Marseille is now a
bastion of glib far-right politicians who say their "preference" for
native French citizens rather than the foreign-born is as simple as a
wife's preference for her husband.</TE>
<TE>   In this atmosphere, "Quiet" follows three main story lines and the
people in them, characters united by a frustrating sense of
entrapment. These are people who want their lives to be better but
whose options are inevitably limited, who don't know how to escape a
life where, as one of them says, "it's always the same time, always
the same beat."</TE>
<TE>   Guediguian has returned to the same performers repeatedly during
his career, starting with the actress who is his wife as well as
"Quiet's" star, the gifted and versatile Ariane Ascaride. Her hair
dyed blond for the role, Ascaride plays Michele, who does
back-breaking labor at a fish market to keep her family solvent. With
a husband who's been reduced to a sad drunk by three years on the
government dole, a daughter who sleeps around to support her heroine
habit and an infant granddaughter, this is not a simple task. For
help, Michele turns to the mysterious Gerard (Gerard Meylan), a
former beau whose current situation is decidedly shadowy.</TE>
<TE>   Also eventually associated with Michele is Paul (Jean-Pierre
Darroussin), a former dockworker who once knew "The Internationale"
in four languages but now has turned his back on his union colleagues
for a payout that enables him to put a down payment on a fancy taxi.
Although he is close to his parents, loneliness is Paul's main
characteristic, a loneliness that seems to seep through his every
pore.</TE>
<TE>   Although she is married, Viviane (Christine Brucher), who teaches
music to the disadvantaged, is lonely as well. She makes a connection
with one of her former students, a young North African ex-con named
Abderamane (Alexandre Ogou) who is troubled by prejudice no matter
which race it springs from.</TE>
<TE>   "The Town Is Quiet" perfectly captures the mood of a city where
personal contact is tenuous and uncertain at best. It's a film whose
verite feeling places it indelibly in Marseille but is also able to
make judicious use of outside influences, such as a pair of Janis
Joplin soundtrack songs ("Summertime" and "Cry Baby") that connect
exquisitely with its despondent mood.</TE>
<TE>   By its close, "The Town Is Quiet" has built to a more emotionally
potent conclusion than even its strengths would have you imagine,
despairing while holding out an unexpected kind of hope. If life does
find a reason to go on, this exceptional film says, it's on its own
terms and no one else's.</TE>

<HD>'Neighbor's Dog' Limps Along in an Emotional Vacuum</HD>
<DH>The film about a caustic L.A. playwright, played by Kenneth
Branagh, comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog" is a dreary title for an even
drearier picture, which stars Kenneth Branagh as a British expatriate
who has settled in Los Angeles to become its "most successful
playwright." Branagh's Peter McGowen is apparently in the tradition
of the Angry Young Men of the '60s who transformed the English
theater--"apparently" because his current project, in rehearsal but
deep in rewrites, seems merely vague and mediocre.</LD>
<LD>   In any event, McGowen is not so young anymore but plenty cranky,
especially since his last three plays have bombed. He is unbelievably
fortunate in having for the past 10 years a beautiful and sublimely
imperturbable wife, Melanie (Robin Wright Penn), who is as eager to
have a child as he is not. Her wishes, at least for the moment, are
beside the point, because McGowen is in the throes of his first
experience with impotence.</LD>
<TE>   He's not at all thrilled that Melanie has been so welcoming to
some new neighbors, Trina (Lucinda Jenney), freshly separated from
her husband, and her little daughter, Amy (Suzi Hofrichter). When his
theatrical colleagues point out that he has no idea of how children
talk, he abruptly starts to pay attention to Amy, which, we're given
to understand, improves the play-in-progress and most definitely
improves McGowen's spirits in spite of himself. He actually starts
pitching in, fixing up the derelict playhouse in his backyard for
Amy.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a homeless man (Jared Harris) has started hanging
around the neighborhood passing himself off as McGowen, an awkward
and artificial contrivance that allows yet further opportunity for
McGowen, when he finally meets his doppelganger, to sound off at
length. (Harris' phony McGowen also becomes the source of the film's
title.)</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Michael Kalesniko hasn't a clue about how to make
all of this come alive on the screen until the film shifts gears from
the caustic to the sentimental, when we receive the surprising news
that Amy suffers from cerebral palsy--it has to be the mildest case
on record--and her mother abruptly reveals herself to be an
excessively overly protective parent who's been harboring a great
deal of anger at Peter and Melanie for inspiring her daughter to
attempt to sing and dance and in general spread her wings. This
allows for some mild heart-tugging, which is a very slight
improvement on the emotional vacuum that precedes it.</TE>
<TE>   If Jenney's role sounds thankless, how about Lynn Redgrave having
to find humor in senility as Melanie's mother? Or David Krumholtz as
the flamboyantly gay director of McGowen's play who likes to cheer up
his actors (Johnathon Schaech, Kaitlin Hopkins) and producer (Peter
Riegert) with his renditions of the vintage Petula Clark hits
"Downtown" and "Don't Sleep in the Subway"? These stalwart supporting
players deserve special sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, McGowen's contrary behavior has its points and is
even amusing, but that is far from enough to make this movie work.
Not helping matters is that "How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog" has
been shot in Vancouver, Canada, in the blandest, most generic of
settings without a single palm tree in view. (The film was actually
shot in 1999 but not shown until last year.) It leaves one to wonder
what Robert Redford saw in this project to inspire him to sign on as
its key executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines. Along with the
four-letter words, the film is also unsuitable for impressionable
small children because it shows a dog dead from a gunshot wound.</TE>

<LD>   Feeling Forever Old, Stewart Jumps Labels</LD>
<LD>   Rod Stewart, who said he felt he was treated like "an old piece of
furniture" at Warner Music Group labels, has a new home with
celebrated record mogul Clive Davis and his upstart J Records, the
singer's manager said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, whose last album sold a meager 233,000 copies, parted
ways with Warner's Atlantic Records late last year after more than
two decades within the Warner family of labels.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is the former chief of Arista Records, where he was a key
architect of the revival of Carlos Santana's career, and now helms J
Records, which has a roster including Alicia Keys, Luther Vandross
and Busta Rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's manager, Arnold Stiefel, says working with Davis will
allow the singer to pursue a concept album project he has long hoped
to record. It should be in stores by October.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   ABC to Profile GIs on War Series 'Front Line'</TE>
<TE>   In case you haven't had your fill of footage on the war on
terrorism, ABC has made a 13-episode commitment to "Profiles From the
Front Line," a one-hour, prime-time series devoted to the subject
that will air later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which producers Jerry Bruckheimer ("Black Hawk Down")
and Bertram van Munster ("Cops") are turning out for Warner Bros.
Television, tracks American troops in such far-flung spots as
Afghanistan, South America and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Though the focus will be on the personal stories of those in the
U.S. military, others engaged in the antiterrorism effort will also
be recognized. Footage will come from the show's own team of
filmmakers and from material provided by the Department of Defense,
which is cooperating with the project.</TE>
<TE>   'Mystery!' Visits Hillerman Country</TE>
<TE>   PBS will start filming an adaptation of Tony Hillerman's
best-selling novel "Skinwalkers" outside Phoenix next week for its
venerable "Mystery!" series. The production, the first in the series
to be produced in the U.S., is part of the network's attempt to
broaden the focus beyond purely British fare.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Redford's Wildwood Enterprises will help produce the
two-hour film, which features Hillerman's Native American detective
characters Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, played by Adam Beach ("Smoke
Signals") and Wes Studi ("Dances With Wolves").</TE>
<TE>   A fall broadcast is planned. If audiences respond positively, the
characters could return, said Coby Atlas, PBS' co-chief program
executive.</TE>
<TE>   'Survivor' Challenge Not Immune to Errors</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "Survivor: Africa" was belatedly forced to declare three
second-place winners because of an error made during an immunity
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Contestants Lex van den Berghe of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Tom
Buchanan of Rich Valley, Va., were bumped up in the standings, CBS
said. They join the original runner-up, Kim Johnson of Oyster Bay,
N.Y., all receiving a second-place prize of $100,000. Ethan Zohn of
Lexington, Mass., remains the $1-million top winner.</TE>
<TE>   The problem occurred during one of the final immunity challenges,
in which contestants were asked to identify which of the female
players did not have any body piercings. The producers later
discovered there was more than one right answer.</TE>
<TE>   UPN to Replay CBS' 'Amazing Race' Series</TE>
<TE>   UPN will launch a new unscripted programming block that will
feature a repeat broadcast of CBS' series "The Amazing Race." It is

<HD>After a Star's Death, a Delicate Marketing Task</HD>
<DH>Movies* The makers of 'Queen of the Damned' try to honor
Aaliyah and cope with a backlash among Anne Rice fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you market a ghoulish movie about the Mother of All Vampires
who "takes pleasure in only one thing ... destroying life" when your
young star is herself dead?</LD>
<LD>   This was the dilemma confronting Warner Bros. with its horror
picture "Queen of the Damned," based on the Anne Rice novel. The
death last summer of the star, R&amp;B singer-turned-actress Aaliyah,
necessitated that the studio regroup and consult with the singer's
family on the appropriate marketing strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Aaliyah's death has had other unintended consequences. It has
brought two fan subcultures crashing together: one is obsessed with
an allegory about vampires, death and sexuality, and the other is
consumed with the actual death of a promisingly talented, beautiful
young woman. Neither camp particularly understands or likes the
other, and their war of words has been raging over the Internet for
months.</LD>
<TE>   "What could we do with [the marketing campaign]? Nothing but go
forward and hope for the best," producer Jorge Saralegui said. "Is it
ghoulish? It can certainly be seen that way. It's certainly tragic
and weird and upsetting to some people. The main thing was that her
family was comfortable with it." Aaliyah's family was not available
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Queen of the Damned" is the third installment in Anne Rice's
Vampire Chronicles and the second feature film based on those books.
The first, 1994's "Interview With the Vampire," received mixed
reviews. In "Queen of the Damned," the Vampire Lestat (played by
Irish newcomer Stuart Townsend) has risen from a decades-long slumber
determined to step out into the light. He reinvents himself as a rock
star of the 21st century. But his music awakens the sleeping ancient
Queen Akasha (Aaliyah) in her crypt beneath the Arctic ice. Akasha
rises and tries to rule the modern world with her malevolent power.</TE>
<TE>   That may seem like a strangely concocted tale to anyone who hasn't
read the novels, but it's faithful to what Rice wrote. Her followers
are as devoted and uncompromising to the story of these seductive
vampires as J.R.R. Tolkien's fans are to hobbits and elves and J.K.
Rowling's are to wizards and Muggles.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case with the murder of Tejano singer Selena, Aaliyah's
death on Aug. 25 in a plane crash catapulted her to near mythic
celebrity status. Her last album, "Aaliyah," had been released in
mid-July, debuting on the national pop chart at No. 2 according to
SoundScan. The album slid heavily in subsequent weeks, but the week
after her death, sales spiked 595%.</TE>
<TE>   Because Aaliyah played the crucial title character, the studio had
almost no choice but to play its marketing campaign straight as a
vampire-horror movie with the 22-year-old actress the biggest selling
point. Plans before she died had called for her to record a duet with
Jonathan Davis, lead singer of the rap-rock band Korn, who composed
the film's soundtrack. Although the studio tried to avoid exploiting
the star's death, the movie has undoubtedly benefited from the
ensuing publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "With her death, she became even more famous," Saralegui said.</TE>
<TE>   Not releasing the $35-million movie was never seriously
considered, Saralegui said, but marketing executives agreed not to
refer to her death in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Under the circumstances, marketing a movie about a 6,000-year-old
vampire who lives to slaughter mortals and drink their blood became a
tricky business.</TE>
<TE>   Theatrical trailers and television spots show Aaliyah's character,
Akasha, slinking seductively toward Lestat, coyly calling out to him.
The film also has some "Matrix"-style martial arts moves and fast
action cuts. But the cold reality of Aaliyah's death and the fantasy
death world of vampires seem to collide when a voice-over says Akasha
craves "hell on Earth" and sucking the life out of humans. Magazines
such as Fangoria have gone so far as to put Aaliyah on their cover,
promising a "sexy preview and pix." In the photo, she is wearing
fangs and blood is smeared over her mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to remain true to the movie and her character in the
movie," said Dawn Taubin, president of domestic marketing for Warner
Bros. "That would be the most respectful to her. It's basically a
horror film." But the marketing was only one in a series of
challenges with "Queen of the Damned."</TE>
<TE>   Adapting an Anne Rice novel to the big screen is a difficult task
particularly in getting the outspoken novelist to sign off on any
changes. Rice, who was consulted but did not write the screenplay,
did not approve of the first draft. She let the world know it by
putting her opinion on her Web site. That unleashed a torrent of
critical e-mails from loyal Rice fans.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid a major backlash among Rice fans, Saralegui decided to
engage in online discussions about the movie, the screenplay and the
decision to cast Aaliyah. He had no idea what he was getting into.
Since December, the bleary-eyed Saralegui has spent an average of two
to three hours every day, including weekends and holidays, answering
questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any producer in a Hollywood movie has done this,"
Saralegui said. "Her fans are very passionate and very possessive.
I'm doing it honestly just to generate goodwill. I wanted to give
them the opportunity to talk to me about it. I've been talked at a
lot, but that is the way it goes.... I had no idea it would be this
much work."</TE>
<TE>   As for her casting, since Akasha came from a mythological place in
ancient Egypt, studio executive Lorenzo di Bonaventura suggested that
Saralegui and director Michael Rymer consider Aaliyah, whose label
was Virgin Records. The role, they thought, could be perfect for an
actor of color. Aaliyah had made a big impression with her debut in
New Line Cinema's "Romeo Must Die." She had been cast in Warner
Bros.' "The Matrix Reloaded" but died before filming was completed.
Studio executives and Rymer were impressed with Aaliyah's reading and
took a gamble in casting her as the lead.</TE>
<TE>   This was a risk, considering the last time the studio dealt with
an Anne Rice novel it took a lot of heat for casting decisions. In
1994, Rice said stars Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's "mom and apple pie"
persona didn't mesh with the European, impish, proud,
semi-androgynous Vampire Lestat she created in "Interview with the
Vampire." Rice said Cruise was "no more my vampire Lestat than Edward
G. Robinson is Rhett Butler." When the movie was released, she
changed course and said Cruise and Pitt had done a decent job.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Rice has said she is pleased with "Queen of the
Damned," which she saw on DVD with Rymer in her New Orleans home. She
also praised Aaliyah.</TE>
<TE>   But the studio unwittingly angered some of her fans by casting an
African American. They maintain that in the novel, Akasha is
described as "white as marble." This has pitted some Anne Rice fans
against Aaliyah fans, each defending their side with equal ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   "Akasha ... is EGYPTIAN (in origin) ... not colored/African
American," declares one typical Rice fan on the Web site. "I know at
some point she stayed in the sun to tan herself, but she cannot go
from pearly white to a mocha color."</TE>
<TE>   Aaliyah's fans are quick to respond, charging that racism and
ignorance are causing some of the novel's devout fans to lose sight
of Aaliyah's performance. In fact, most of these people have not seen
the film because it opens today.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaliyah deserves the role more than everyone else," wrote one
fan. "She is #1. I can't express in words how much I miss her. She is
truly one in a million. I luv and miss u babygirl!! r.i.p."</TE>

<DH>Self-deception leads the parade of human folly in an uneven
bill of Moliere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From "Lysistrata" to "I Love Lucy" and beyond, the rebellion of women
against self-serving male power has fueled some of the most memorable
and improbable comedies of Western culture. It doesn't matter that
the men in question consider themselves loving husbands, fathers or
guardians: The fact that they regard women as property makes them
ripe for public ridicule.</LD>
<LD>   It's the special achievement of Brian Bedford's staging of a
two-play compendium titled "The Moliere Comedies" at the Mark Taper
Forum that the rights of women--including women every bit as silly as
their men--resonate so strongly in an evening anchored persuasively
in the look and style of the 1660s.</LD>
<LD>   You could argue that the second half of the bill sagged badly at
the Wednesday opening, but even here Bedford kept attention focused
on the key issue: how easily men become delusional about the women in
their lives.</LD>
<TE>   Both "The School for Husbands" and "The Imaginary Cuckold" turn on
the prevention of a forced, unhappy marriage and involve
self-infatuated characters named Sganarelle (one urban, one rural)
who become victims of their own misconceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Bedford plays the city Sganarelle in "Husbands" as a nasty
Parisian clone of the quasi-Puritan Malvolio in Shakespeare's
"Twelfth Night," a guardian convinced that by imprisoning a young
girl in a kind of secular convent, he can make her into the obedient
wife he desires. Instead, as deftly interpreted by Anna Belknap, we
watch her develop innate talents for deception and manipulation that
leave him far behind.</TE>
<TE>   As the country Sganarelle in "Cuckold," Bedford becomes vaguely
Falstaffian--appropriate for a character with a major speech on honor
that echoes Falstaff's--but too insistently ingratiating and low-key
to be convincingly vengeful toward a wife he suspects of infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Moliere makes sure the audience knows that the horns of
cuckoldry exist only in Sganarelle's mind--but for the play to play,
adultery should at least seem possible, and the playfully crusty
interaction between Bedford and Patricia Conolly makes it only a kind
of tease.</TE>
<TE>   Using sublime verse translations by Richard Wilbur, Bedford sets
both plays on plazas backed by architectural facades designed by Ming
Cho Lee. Besides actual doorways, six rectangular openings in the
back walls allow a variety of entrances and exits.</TE>
<TE>   But if farce often threatens to erupt, a voice of reason always
intervenes. And that's because Moliere's comedies are essentially
dissections of human folly that keep you laughing but inevitably end
not in action but elaborate and even didactic debriefings.</TE>
<TE>   So it rings false when Bedford accidentally slams into an opening
door in "The School for Husbands" or when the cast snakes across the
stage in a musical-comedy chain at the beginning of "The Imaginary
Cuckold." Moliere isn't Moliere because of shtick or diversionary
theatrics, but because he's as unyielding as any of his leading
characters in spotlighting people consumed by their illusions. And
those people include not only the two Sganarelles here but the two
young lovers in "Cuckold," so quick to believe that they belong in a
tragedy of betrayal instead of this comedy of misunderstandings.</TE>
<TE>   Although the same nine actors turn up in both plays, Bedford
doesn't plug them into the same kinds of roles.</TE>
<TE>   So after playing the endearingly deceitful ingenue in "Husbands,"
Belknap is virtually unrecognizable as the frumpy, sniffling but
clear-minded maid in "Cuckold."</TE>
<TE>   Ned Schmidtke starts the evening as Ariste, the soul of brotherly
moderation, and ends it as Gorgibus, the voice of fatherly
oppression. And Katie MacNichol manages to be equally credible as
Leonor, the embodiment of liberation, and Celie, a girl hopelessly
enslaved to mock-heroic bombast.</TE>
<TE>   A pining, handsome lover figures in each play, but Don Reilly
makes Valere dashing and charismatic in the first play, while Erik
Sorensen makes Lelie hopelessly fatuous in the second.</TE>
<TE>   You want comic servants? Choose between the wily Jeff Klein or the
whining Jerry Kernion. But there's no choice when it comes to
Bedford: "Cuckold" needs a more obsessive Sganarelle, but "Husbands"
offers an amazingly deep and detailed study of a man so maniacally
and destructively egocentric that every woman on stage shudders when
he mentions marriage and knows in her soul that he's born for horns.</TE>

<LD>One brilliant, sunny, cloudless fall morning in Warsaw a few years
ago, an announcement came over the loudspeakers at the airport. The
Lot Airlines flight to Newark could not depart until the fog lifted.
Five hours later, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, which was booked
on the flight, arrived; we were quickly hustled onto the plane and it
took right off.</LD>
<LD>   But not before the party began.</LD>
<LD>   Once on the plane, the Russian musicians immediately brought out
bottles of vodka and lighted up cigarettes, ignoring seat belt signs
and warnings from crew.</LD>
<TE>   Food soon followed; the players had picked up roasted chickens
from somewhere. It was a raucous eight hours over the Atlantic. At
their wits' end, the flight attendants simply gave up and vanished.
During the descent into Newark Airport, the musicians were already in
the aisles getting out luggage. A violin fell from an open overhead
bin as we landed with a thud, offering an uproarious moment of
orchestral hilarity.</TE>
<TE>   The next evening, at Carnegie Hall, Russia's oldest and most elite
orchestra--its players young and old, men and women--gave a
magnificent concert of stirring, soulful Tchaikovsky.</TE>
<TE>   Not much seems to have changed, given the news reports of the St.
Petersburg Philharmonic's carrying-on during the first leg of its
flight from Amsterdam to Los Angeles on Monday, at the start of a
monthlong tour. But this time, United Airlines, not amused by the
vodka bottles and drunken behavior, threw the musicians off the plane
when it landed at Washington's Dulles Airport. The orchestra was not
allowed to proceed to LAX, putting its concert Wednesday at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   But after a night of sleeping it off, contrite St. Petersburgians
flew to LAX on Tuesday. The orchestra offered a formal apology to the
airline. And then, just as it did years ago in New York, the rowdy
bunch put on a magnificent concert.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra's antics did, however, throw an interesting light on
the music and the Russian character.</TE>
<TE>   The program Wednesday contained works by the three most famous
Russian composers of the 20th century--Stravinsky, Prokofiev and
Shostakovich--written within an artistically stormy 20-year period.</TE>
<TE>   It began and ended with the most popular 20th century Russian
symphonies--Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony and Shostakovich's
Fifth. In between was Stravinsky's rarely heard ballet "Song of the
Nightingale."</TE>
<TE>   All three, it turns out, are works by young composers who had
musically misbehaved and were making amends.</TE>
<TE>   In 1917, Prokofiev produced a Haydn-esque charmer in the wake of
his aggressively dissonant, hackles-raising Second Piano Concerto.
Around the same time, Stravinsky, who four years earlier had caused
music's most famous riot with his downright barbaric "Rite of
Spring," wrote "The Song of the Nightingale" in a colorful, exotic
style that looked back to his earlier ballet "Petrushka" and to the
tradition of his mentor in St. Petersburg, Rimsky-Korsakov.</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony represents the century's most
startling example of musical reparation. After a dangerous
denunciation from Stalin for the "decadent," sexually explicit opera
"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," Shostakovich kept himself out of the gulag
thanks to the triumphant, upbeat nature of his Fifth Symphony, which
returned him, however uneasily, to Soviet good graces.</TE>
<TE>   The Shostakovich symphony is in the St. Petersburg Philharmonic's
blood. It premiered the work in 1937 under Evgeny Mravinsky, one of
the 20th century's greatest conductors, who led the orchestra for 50
years. A recently reissued Everest recording by Mravinsky and the
Leningrad Orchestra (as it was then called) of the symphony from the
early '50s, shortly after Stalin's death, is an excellent document of
the almost unbelievable intensity the orchestra could produce with
this score.</TE>
<TE>   Yuri Temirkanov, music director of the orchestra since 1988,
following Mravinsky's death, has a somewhat different style, but the
intensity is still there. Temirkanov, who is also music director of
the Baltimore Symphony, loves to micromanage, which can make him seem
fussy in some music, such as the Prokofiev symphony. But he loves
thrust, which sweeps the listener along. When he can achieve both at
the same time, as he did in the Shostakovich, the effect is riveting.</TE>
<TE>   Details took hold, yet the orchestra played with gripping
unanimity. The low string and brass instruments ground the ensemble
with tremendous force.</TE>
<TE>   In the slow movement, the quiet passages were taut whispers, an
amazing amount of expressivity found from a thin wire of sound. This
is in fact an orchestra that can fly sober, and the momentum
throughout the symphony was astounding; everything in the score
seeming inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Stravinsky's ballet got a brightly colored, carefully tinted
performance.</TE>
<TE>   As an encore, "Tybalt's Death," from Prokofiev's "Romeo and
Juliet," was an irresistible display of orchestral virtuosity--fast,
furious and spectacularly percussive.</TE>

<HD>'Dragonfly': A Widower Listens</HD>
<DH>Kevin Costner stars in a contrived tale about a doctor who
thinks his dead wife is trying to communicate with him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Dragonfly," a souped-up romantic tale of longing for contact
beyond the grave, we're told that the Doctors Darrow (Kevin Costner
and Susanna Thompson) are the perfect team--he has the head and she
supplies the heart. Both work at the same Chicago hospital--he runs
the emergency room, and she's a pediatric oncologist. Listening to
her heart, she takes off for Venezuela on a mission of mercy despite
being pregnant only to be aboard a bus caught in a landslide.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Darrow is overwhelmed by grief, intensified by feelings of
anger and guilt. His wife had overridden his disapproval in her
decision to heed her calling, and now he has nothing to console him
but work. His bitterness, however, so overwhelms him that the
hospital's punctilious administrator (Joe Morton) orders him to take
a leave--but not before the little patients in the pediatric oncology
ward start forwarding him cryptic messages from his dead wife. Not
surprisingly, Darrow is slow to believe what is happening, but once
he's convinced that his wife is attempting to communicate with him,
nothing is going to stop him until he gets some answers.</LD>
<TE>   It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever
consolation that can be found in "Dragonfly," yet it is impossible to
find the film anything but appalling, shamelessly manipulative and
contrived, and totally lacking in conviction. It is high grade
Hollywood hokum, a polished production in which its people tend to
remind us of their impressive professional credentials and live in
expensive vintage homes with dark, burnished interiors. There's a
self-congratulatory air to Tom Shadyac's direction of a script and
story by various hands, and John Debney's relentlessly insistent
score tells just how we should be feeling every step of the way.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong in Cost- ner's performance, and it's
unfortunate that his doctor's dogged quest isn't unfolding in a
vastly different and less pretentious kind of film. The history of
cinema has shown that it's tough to evoke the genuinely spiritual,
replete with intimations of the supernatural. Those few filmmakers
who succeed in transcendence, such as Carl Dreyer and Robert Bresson,
do so through subtlety, indirection and a burning sense of commitment
in their highly personal, idiosyncratic small-scale films. Fevered to
the point of foolishness, "Dragonfly" is just a drag.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for thematic material and mild sexuality.
Times guidelines: Intense sequences of terminally ill children.</TE>

<HD>Not Much Bite in This Vampire Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You want vampires? "Queen of the Damned" has vampires. Lots and lots
of vampires.</LD>
<LD>   As enumerated in the credits, there are New York Vampires and Euro
Trash Vampires, a Vampire in the Park and a Pale Faced Vampire, Club
Vampires and a Vampire Doorman, even a simple Vampire Girl, not to be
confused with Vampire Girls Sucking. Etc. What there aren't, either
in the credits or, more critically, on the screen, are Scary
Vampires, Exciting Vampires or even any Vampires Interesting Enough
To Keep You From Falling Asleep.</LD>
<LD>   As directed by Michael Rymer and with the late rock star Aaliyah
in the title role, "Queen of the Damned" turns out to be a muddled
limp biscuit of a movie, a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much
sense even on its own terms. Though the previous film based on Anne
Rice's popular novels, the Tom Cruise-starring "Interview With the
Vampire," was far from a success, this brain-dead venture makes it
look like a masterwork by comparison.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of Cruise, it's Irish actor Stuart Townsend taking on the
role of the Vampire Lestat, neurasthenically slouching around the
screen like a fatigued and fey Gumby. "I've hidden in the shadows for
centuries," he haughtily announces. It's time for a change of life.</TE>
<TE>   Given that vampires have no trouble staying up late, Lestat quite
sensibly decides on a new career as a rock star. Soon he is up to his
fangs in groupies ("I came all the way from Tarzana," one of them
memorably announces) but even this doesn't bring contentment. As
revealed in an extensive flashback, Lestat has never been a happy
vampire. He's never agreed with the discreet Marius (Vincent Perez),
the man who turned him into one of the undead, that "a vampire's life
is a life of discretion."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that brings a smile to Lestat's face is a brief
moment sucking the blood of long-dead vampire royalty Queen Akasha
(Aaliyah), costumed like someone who wandered in from the set of "The
Mummy." "Her blood is like liquid fire," he enthuses, while Marius,
always a nervous Nellie, can only say, "What have you done, Lestat?"</TE>
<TE>   Now, by going public with his vampire status and announcing a
concert at (where else but) Death Valley, Lestat wants to out all the
world's vampires, like it or not. Naturally, he gets considerable
attention, including some he didn't plan on. That would be from the
attractive Jessie, who looks like Little Miss Muffet (actress
Marguerite Moreau starred in three "Mighty Ducks" movies as a child)
but has lots of forbidden thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   A renegade member of the Talamascans, an organization whose motto
is "Observe the dark realm but be not of it," she wants to become a
vampire in the worst way. But though Lestat takes her on a vampire
date to the Griffith Park Observatory, he is reluctant to do the
deed.</TE>
<TE>   Once Lestat's Death Valley concert gets going, things get even
more confusing. Does Lestat want to run off with Jessie or unite with
Queen Akasha and become part of the ultimate vampire power couple?
Does he want to take a stand against all other vampires or unite with
them against a common threat? You'll wish you had a scorecard to help
you figure out who is biting whom and why.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of biting, while "Queen of the Damned" has no lack of
flashing fangs and pointed teeth, it's rather decorous in its
treatment of blood. And though the film pays a lot of attention to
its look, it's more concerned with surface decor than with any real
sense of style. Similarly, "Queen's" acting so plays up the campy
aspects of the Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni script ("Two hundred
years and not a word from you," Lestat grouses at one point) that
it's hard to be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tragic aspects of her death, most audience interest
will be in Aaliyah, but her largely nonspeaking part is more like a
modeling assignment than actual acting. It's not just, as Lestat
grumbles, eternity that's unbearable; it's films like this as well.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for vampire violence. Times guidelines: bloody and
disconcerting, but not excessively so.</TE>

<HD>Keely Smith Is Glad Grammy Remembers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--When the first Grammy Awards were held in 1959, singer
Keely Smith didn't even know she had won. "We knew nothing about it
until it was all over. After it was all done, our producer gave us
the award and said, 'By the way, you won this.'"</LD>
<LD>   Now, 43 years later, Smith, 69, has been nominated again, this
time for "Keely Sings Sinatra," a collection of Frank Sinatra hits.
The nomination is in the traditional pop vocal album category. Also
nominated: Betty Buckley, Rosemary Clooney, Harry Connick Jr. and
Michael Feinstein.</LD>
<LD>   Surprised at her nomination, she's enjoying the experience she
missed in 1959. She plans to attend a party for nominees the night
before the show. On Wednesday, she'll be in the audience at Staples
Center to experience "this Grammy thing," as she calls it.</LD>
<TE>   Smith and her husband, Louis Prima, won a Grammy for their 1958
hit, "That Old Black Magic." They were regulars on the Las Vegas
Strip in the '50s and '60s, becoming friends with Sinatra and other
members of the Rat Pack--Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Peter Lawford
and Joey Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Prima were divorced in 1961; Prima died in 1978. Smith,
who never thought she could be as successful on her own, says she's
grateful that "someone like me" is again being considered among the
best in music.</TE>
<TE>   "Keely Sings Sinatra" is the second of a five-CD deal with Concord
Records. The first CD, "Swing, Swing, Swing," features "Jump, Jive
an' Wail," which was a hit for her and Prima. The Gap used the
original recording in its 1998 TV ad.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Where did you get the idea for "Keely Sings Sinatra"?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It was my husband's idea--Bobby Milano. We recorded it
when Frank was alive. We did it not as a tribute to Frank, but
singing to him. It took us about eight months to do it. As we were
mastering it, Frank passed away.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You had a romance with Sinatra, right?</TE>
<TE>   A: When Frank came into my life, I wasn't in awe of him like
everybody else was. At that point, Louis and I, our career started
taking off. All of a sudden he [Prima] was all over town, drinking
and smoking. Little by little, I guess I fell in love with him
[Sinatra] and he fell in love with me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And he proposed?</TE>
<TE>   A: He asked. But, No. 1, I would never leave a man for another
man. I would never fit into his life. I didn't drink. I didn't smoke.
I didn't cuss. I truly believe in my heart if we had gotten married,
we would have divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You spent a lot of time with the Rat Pack. What were they like?</TE>
<TE>   A: Wonderful. I adored Peter Lawford. I knew Sammy from the Apollo
Theatre. Dean was my favorite. Dean was the sweetheart of all of
them. We had a saying: Frank thought he was king; Dean knew he was
king. They were a great bunch of guys.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does it feel to be nominated again, 43 years later?</TE>
<TE>   A: I still get emotional over it. When Louis and I broke up, he
said I'd never be anything without him. That's one of the reasons why
this award would be so special to me.</TE>

<HD>New Improv at South Coast Repertory: The Marriage of
Festival, Construction</HD>
<DH>Theater*  Hardhats and actors must coexist during June, as
expansion collides with production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actors tend not to improvise at South Coast Repertory, where the
guiding ethic is a faithful adherence to the words and meanings that
playwrights put on the page. But a whole lot of
improvising--logistical, not dramatic--is going on in connection with
this year's fifth annual Pacific Playwrights Festival.</LD>
<LD>   Hardhats, not actors, will inhabit the theater in June, when the
festival devoted to showcasing and developing works in progress
customarily takes place. When the current season closes May 5,
construction crews will move in to remodel and refurbish the two
stages. The $19-million expansion and renovation project also
includes building a third stage for the Costa Mesa theater. Oct. 5 is
the scheduled reopening date.</LD>
<LD>   For the Pacific Playwrights Festival, that means improvising.
Instead of two consecutive weekends in June, the public readings of
plays will take place during the last weekend in April and the first
weekend in August. Jerry Patch, the festival's director, says
everything should be back to normal next year.</LD>
<TE>   Typically, scripts being developed through the theater's Hispanic
Playwrights Project are highlighted on the first weekend of the
Pacific Playwrights Festival, followed by an assortment of works by
emerging and established playwrights on the second weekend. This
year, April 25-28 will be designated the Pacific Playwrights
Festival. The Hispanic Playwrights Project, in its 17th year, will
take place Aug. 2-3. Because of the construction at South Coast, the
Hispanic play fest will move across the street to Founders Hall, an
intimate theater at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the Hispanic weekend, South Coast will remount
"California Scenarios," an evening of one-act plays about the Latino
experience in California that premiered at last year's festival. It
will again be staged in the Noguchi sculpture garden two blocks from
the theater. The show, a quick sellout last year because only 99
seats were sold for each performance, will run for eight
performances, July 25-Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The April festival will feature readings of five plays, including
"Exposed," a new script South Coast commissioned from Beth Henley,
best known for her 1981 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, "Crimes of the
Heart." Also to be read are "Intimate Apparel" by Lynn Nottage, whose
"Crumbs From the Table of Joy" was seen at South Coast in 1996, "99
Histories" by Julia Cho, "Truth and Beauty" by Steven Drukman and
"Our Boy" by Julia Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Patch said he is scouting locations for weekend matinee readings
because both theaters at South Coast will be occupied: Horton Foote's
"Getting Frankie Married ... and Afterwards" will be on the
Mainstage, and Richard Greenberg's "The Dazzle" will be on the Second
Stage.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, two plays in the festival have been given full
workshop productions, with costumes, scenery and actors who have
their parts memorized and move about the stage. With no place to put
a full production, all festival performances this year will be staged
readings, in which actors typically sit or stand still while reading
their lines.</TE>
<TE>   Play selections for the Hispanic Playwrights Project will be
announced later.</TE>

<HD>Staging of Arthur Miller's 'After the Fall' Is Rare Indeed</HD>
<DH>It's been many years since Los Angeles has seen the
controversial drama fully staged. This production rectifies matters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's not enough to know oneself--or maybe it's too much. For
Arthur Miller, questions of personal integrity are as double-edged as
they are inescapable, and their full dramatic weight descends with
the playwright's signature uncompromising ethical clarity in a
stunning Fountain Theatre revival of his rarely seen masterpiece,
"After the Fall."</LD>
<LD>   Miller keeps a tight rein on the performance rights to his 1964
memory play, which originally sparked controversy over its thinly
disguised account of Miller's short-lived marriage to Marilyn Monroe.
The play hasn't seen a fully staged L.A. production for 24 years.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, director Stephen Sachs and his superbly cast ensemble
repay the author's hard-won trust with the intimate focus and
delicately nuanced performances required for this challenging
work--especially Tracy Middendorf's tragic heroine.</LD>
<TE>   Employing a kaleidoscopic montage of scenes in place of
chronological narrative, the play examines the life of Quentin
(Morlan Higgins), an outwardly successful lawyer (and obvious
stand-in for Miller).</TE>
<TE>   Refusing to settle for the "workable lies" that others around him
invoke to rationalize their self-interest, Quentin looks beneath the
accomplishments and high standards of conduct that earned him so many
admirers to confront the ways he's fallen short of his own ideals.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression, Quentin left his family (Malachi Throne,
Mimi Cozzens, Rick Scarry) to deal with their foundering business
while he pursued his career. He blames himself for not doing enough
for his old friend (Cooper Thornton), a brilliant law professor with
a leftist past persecuted in the infamous congressional
anti-Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. In an even more intimate
failure, his lack of emotional availability irreparably alienated his
first ex-wife (Jacqueline Schultz).</TE>
<TE>   Many playwrights (including Miller) have devoted entire plays to
each of these moral quandaries. To coalesce them so precisely and
economically--through brief exchanges and telling details--is the
gift of a mature playwright who surpassed even his formidable (and
more familiar) previous accomplishments. In their brief stage time,
finely tuned supporting performances from Lenny Citrano, Pat Destro,
Colleen Quinn and Laura Margolis mine richly complex characters from
the sparse text.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it's that  ability to sort through surface
distractions and excavate the deeper nuggets that cuts Quentin off
from emotional participation in his own life. "We are killing each
other with abstraction," he despairs at the height of his marital
troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin finds an antidote of sorts to his own abstraction in
Maggie (Middendorf), the telephone operator-turned-glamorous
singer/star. Nowhere is the play's autobiographical content more
nakedly apparent than in their tortured relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sachs doesn't shy away from the erotic Monroe mystique in
his staging, Middendorf skillfully crafts her own riveting core to
the character. Maggie's unfiltered immediacy--which Quentin mistakes
for innocence--may connect her more directly with the world through
passion and sensation, but it also dooms her to a life of perpetual
moments strung tenuously together with only a desperate need for
stability and reassurance.</TE>
<TE>   Despite accusations at the time of the play's debut that Miller
was exploiting the memory of the recently deceased Marilyn, nothing
could be further from the truth. If anything, at great personal cost
he honors their marriage as a window into the most profound human
depths.</TE>

<HD>'Mean Machine,' Soccer's Version of 'Longest Yard'</HD>
<DH>Movies*   A British remake of Burt Reynolds' 1974 football
hit aims to be the first memorable film about the world's most
popular sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well-loved sports movies have been focused on everything from
all-American pastimes like football and baseball to downhill skiing
and even Jamaican bobsledders. Yet the world's most popular
sport--soccer--has for the most part failed to score in the movies.</LD>
<LD>   "Mean Machine," a rough-and-tumble British comedy opening Friday,
aims to change this by becoming a memorable soccer film.</LD>
<LD>   A remake of the crowd-pleasing 1974 Burt Reynolds gridiron hit
"The Longest Yard," in which motley convicts challenge their guards
to what devolves into a comically down-and-dirty game of football,
"Mean Machine" recasts the setting to a gritty English prison and the
bone-crushing sport played to soccer.</LD>
<TE>   And where "The Longest Yard" had Reynolds, a former college
football player whose promising career was cut short by injury, as
its charismatic lead, "Mean Machine" has famed ex-professional soccer
player Vinnie Jones, the husky scene-stealer from "Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch," stepping into his first leading
role.</TE>
<TE>   Although soccer-themed films are produced with regularity around
the globe, Hollywood's few attempts at tackling the sport known to
the rest of the world as football--from the ill-advised 1987 Pele
vehicle "Hot Shot" to the broad family comedies "Ladybugs" (1992) and
"The Big Green" (1995)--have been depressing, if noticed at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the popularity of the sport worldwide, I don't think
[soccer's] ever really been given its true credit from cinema," says
"Mean Machine" director Barry Skolnick.</TE>
<TE>   There were 1981's "Gregory's Girl," an idyllic British romance
about a teenage boy smitten with the girl who replaces him on his
soccer team, and 1978's "The Boys of Company C," a Vietnam War drama
in which a team of Marines must choose between throwing a soccer
match against a Vietnamese team and returning to the combat zone,
though neither was an out-and-out sports film.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's highest-profile attempt at a soccer film was the
embarrassing 1981 Sylvester Stallone picture "Victory," in which a
team of Allied World War II prisoners of war improbably use a
propaganda match against a German team as a cover for escape.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Soccer Films Not Distributed in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the soccer play having been designed by Pele, who also
played a supporting role, "it's one of those movies that kind of got
cult status due to the very poor soccer involved and the fact that
they probably gave too many British soccer players actual speaking
parts," Skolnick says.</TE>
<TE>   A number of recent British soccer-themed films, such as "Fever
Pitch," "Mad About Mambo" and "The Match," haven't received
significant theatrical distribution in the United States. "There's
another movie which Sean Bean did called 'When Saturday Comes,' and
they failed on the football action dreadfully," Skolnick says.</TE>
<TE>   "The film goes along quite nicely until they start playing soccer,
and then you think, 'I don't believe that.'" When the sports play
doesn't look authentic, he says, the film not only loses credibility
but the audience disengages emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   With "Mean Machine," which is being released here by Paramount
Classics, the filmmakers sought to break the so-called curse on
soccer films. Says Jones, who also has appeared as a heavy in
"Swordfish" and "Gone in 60 Seconds": "I said to [Skolnick], 'If I'm
gonna do this, this has got to be the most believable football movie
ever done,' and I think we've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Matthew Vaughn first had the idea of remaking "The
Longest Yard," which in many ways is the prototypal sports comedy,
after coming across it on television.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock" and "Snatch," was
looking to give Jones his first leading role and thought a soccer
version of "The Longest Yard" would make the perfect vehicle for the
former soccer player who became as famous for his off-the-field
rowdiness (he once assaulted a neighbor) as for his on-the-field
rough play (a notorious photograph showed him twisting an opposing
player's testicles).</TE>
<TE>   Jones seemed like a natural for the part of Danny "Mean Machine"
Meehan, an ex-soccer player disgraced for having fixed matches and
sentenced to prison for throwing drunken punches at policemen.</TE>
<TE>   Danny is compelled by the warden to coach a team of convicts in a
practice match against the semipro team of guardsmen, in which the
convicts use every dirty trick (not) in the book, from head-butting
to leg-stomping to injury-faking, all plays Jones admits he used in
his days as an oft-ejected midfielder.</TE>
<TE>   Being back on the green "was easy for me," says Jones, who figures
he would be coaching had "Lock, Stock" not come along. "But I just
wanted to do the acting. I just wanted to get in front of the
camera." Overcoming skepticism that he could handle the dramatic
aspects of a leading role, Jones has received decent notices in
England, where the film has already been released.</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick, a noted director of sports commercials, caught producer
Vaughn's eye with a flashy, rapid-cut soccer ad for Nike that
captured the excitement of the sport. In directing his first feature,
Skolnick, bucking a trend in sports movies, mandated that no doubles
be used for the actors in any of the game play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think audiences today, [especially] young audiences, are so
visually literate," he says. "You can't really fool them by cutting
from an actor's head to someone else's body."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer Skills Tested in 30-Minute Exam</TE>
<TE>   Determined to cast actors who could play the game convincingly,
Skolnick hired a professional coach and ex-teammate of Jones, Wally
Downes, to test the actors' soccer skills in a 30-minute exam, and
only those who made the cut could then audition. Jones also recruited
some retired soccer pals to play on the guards' team.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, soccer's the hardest sport to capture because
it's a big playing area and there's no set play. It's very fluid,"
Skolnick says. "And it was essential if we were going to stand a
chance to get the game to work on the big screen that the actual guys
out there could actually [play]."</TE>
<TE>   The cast was put through 21/2 weeks of soccer "boot camp" to get
into shape, with a full day's schedule of stretches, exercises,
jogging and soccer drills.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the number of athletes-turned-actors in the cast was
Jason Statham, a former Olympic diver for England who plays the buff,
psychotic goalie known only as the Monk. Statham, who played the
narrator in "Snatch" and also appeared in "Lock, Stock," is "such a
natural athlete that he didn't have to work out," Skolnick says.</TE>
<TE>   As in "The Longest Yard," memorable for its authentic football
action, most of the second half of "Mean Machine" is taken up by the
climactic game, which was filmed at the end of the 45-day shoot in
case any actors were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting at the no-longer-used Victorian Oxford Prison, Skolnick
let the play unfold as naturally as possible and used up to five
cameras to cover multiple angles.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously people have tried to choreograph" soccer play on film
"and it never looks real," says Skolnick, who has shot commercials
featuring boxing and ice hockey. He said of the hockey players he
used: "Ninety-nine times out of a hundred they'll be able to place
the puck where I need it. Soccer players, the best in the world,
don't do that; they don't have that ability to reproduce something to
perfection. It's not the nature of the sport. And so what I did was I
set up very loose plays that I needed to happen."</TE>
<TE>   It Took 11 Takes to Get Ball Into Net</TE>
<TE>   One play, when the convicts score their second goal, took about 11
takes just to get the ball into the net, Skolnick says. "I said to
the defense, 'Look, you just got to try and tackle. If you get there
first, that's my problem. Don't worry about it.' Because the worst
thing that happens is when you get someone who looks like they're
almost going to tackle someone."</TE>
<TE>   "Mean Machine" was budgeted at $4 million and has taken in a
healthy $8 million at the box office in the United Kingdom, despite
having opened against the second week of "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring." But can it replicate that success in the
United States, where millions of kids play soccer but the sport lags
behind many others in spectators?</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick and Jones think it can, just as films centered on
American football, like "Jerry Maguire," have won over audiences in
England because of their strong scripts and characters. "I think the
key to sports movies, to be honest with you, is that the sport is
actually secondary to the actual story," Skolnick says.</TE>
<TE>   And where "The Longest Yard" (which was released in England as
"Mean Machine," after the name of the convicts' team) balanced comedy
with an anti-authoritarian statement against a corrupt system, "Mean
Machine" tips the scale in favor of the roughhouse humor that made
hits of "Lock, Stock" and "Snatch." As Skolnick puts it, "Someone
falls over and it's funny for everyone. It should be fairly
universal, hopefully."</TE>
<TE>   The target audience in England was 14- to-18-year-old boys, he
says, but Skolnick has been surprised that an older female audience
has also reacted positively to the film. "They've kind of said, 'We
don't like soccer, but yet we like this movie.' Because
fundamentally, it's a feel-good film. It's a lighthearted comedy....
You don't really need to be a soccer fan to really appreciate it."</TE>

<HD>Taub Brings a Modernist Sensibility to Beethoven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Taub first grabbed the attention of many in the keyboard world
in the 1980s when he recorded all of the piano music of American
serialist Milton Babbitt. Taub has since joined the ranks of those
who are mesmerized by Beethoven, recording all 32 piano sonatas for
Vox and performing live cycles of the sonatas here and abroad.
Needless to say, he faces a lot more competition in Beethoven than in
Babbitt.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Taub is carving out a niche here, bringing a modernist
sensibility to Beethoven. Serving up a wide-ranging sampling of four
sonatas from the cycle at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing
Theater on Wednesday night, Taub delivered direct, unsentimental,
straight-from-the-shoulder Beethoven, with good rhythm and a
staggering degree of clarity that lays every note before the
listener.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't plumb far into the contemplative depths of the later
sonatas, nor did he convey much of the singing quality in designated
passages (part of the latter may have been due to the bright,
luster-less tone of the Yamaha piano on hand). But he didn't try to
stifle Beethoven's wilder impulses; he let them fly in all their fury
and eccentricity.</LD>
<TE>   Taub started with the transitional Sonata No. 15 ("Pastoral"),
jumped into the late period with Sonata No. 30, and worked his way
through the brief Sonata No. 27 back to Sonata No. 21 ("Waldstein").
Although closing with the heroic "Waldstein" made for good
showmanship, it might have been more musically compelling had Taub
played these sonatas in numerical order.</TE>
<TE>   That way, we could have followed Beethoven's extraordinary
evolution toward the elevated, inward-looking finale of Sonata No.
30.</TE>

<HD>An Actress Gets to Portray an Icon</HD>
<DH>Television* Angela Bassett never dreamed she would depict
Rosa Parks, but she was the producer's first choice for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Angela Bassett met Rosa Parks--the "mother" of the civil rights
movement whom she portrays Sunday in the CBS television movie "The
Rosa Parks Story"--back in 1994, she remembers feeling like a
star-struck kid.</LD>
<LD>   Bassett was overwhelmed not because Parks, who celebrated her 89th
birthday on Feb. 4, was so iconic or intimidating, but because this
demure Southern-born woman--whose courageous if simple act of
disobedience had helped alter the course of U.S. social and political
history--was so unremarkably normal, so sweet and unaffected.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to go to the restroom to pull myself together," Bassett,
who had just played Tina Turner in the 1993 biopic "What's Love Got
to Do With It," recalled of their meeting at a Southern Christian
Leadership Conference event in Atlanta. "She was just so dear, and
just beautiful. I never thought that one day I would have the
opportunity to portray her."</LD>
<TE>   That opportunity surfaced four years later, during a chance
encounter with the film's executive producer, former Los Angeles
political activist Willis Edwards, who was in town with Parks to
develop an authoritative movie about her life.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at the Beverly Hilton Hotel with Mrs. Parks. Angela was
there for some award. I saw her in the lobby and I said, 'Angela, we
are going to be doing the Rosa Parks story, and I really would hope
that you would consider playing Rosa Parks,'" said Edwards, now a
vice president with the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Bassett was politely receptive. "As an actor, you hear those kinds
of things, and it's years before they happen, if they happen. So I
had forgotten about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Edwards, along with co-producers Elaine Eason Steele
and Pearl Devers, had made some serious decisions about how Parks'
story must be told. The piece was to focus on Parks' life and not on
the disparate aspects of the civil rights movement as a whole; even
in its most virulently emotional scenes, there were to be no racial
epithets.</TE>
<TE>   Steele, co-founder and current board president of the Parks
institute, said, "We had been approached by movie companies in the
past, but they all wanted to fictionalize [Rosa Parks' life].... We
were just not for that. Willis knew what we wanted, and he was the
first contact."</TE>
<TE>   Bassett, who plays Parks from her late teens to middle age, drew
on memories of their meeting at the dinner to replicate her quietude
and dignity. "[Parks] is very different from a lot of characters that
I've played that, perhaps, chew up the scenery a bit," Bassett said.
"I was trying to be truthful to Mrs. Parks even though [with] my own
personal drama, I would want to be bigger than life. I was always
trying to be honest to her and not trying to make it more dramatic
than perhaps it needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' story unfolds not from her vantage point as a civil rights
pioneer, but from her perspective as loving wife and companion to
Raymond Parks (Peter Francis James), a Montgomery, Ala., barber and
activist who disapproves of his wife's involvement in the movement
that would make her an international figure. Bassett, who is also an
executive producer of the film, requested director Julie Dash
("Daughters of the Dust") and credits Dash (working from a script by
Paris Qualles) for her ability to capture the ideal pacing and tone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd seen some of Julie's work before, and l loved the images that
she frames. I think that she's an artist that way," Bassett said,
adding that she also selected her co-star James based on his stage
work in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rosa Parks Story" was shot on location in Montgomery, the
cradle of both the Confederacy and the civil rights movement. The
film co-stars Cicely Tyson as Park's mother, Leona. Dexter King, son
of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., plays the
role of his then-26-year-old father. Parks' childhood friend Johnnie
Carr and Los Angeles actor Nick LaTour, son of boycott leader and
local NAACP President E.D. Nixon, have cameos in the film, as the
381-day bus boycott they witnessed unfolds on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Bassett dismissed any concerns the movie won't find much of an
audience because it is airing opposite the closing ceremony of the
Winter Olympics. "I don't think there is any competition," Bassett
said. "What we're doing is artistic and what they're doing is
athletic. When Julie did her research, she found out there were
articles in Russian and Chinese that spoke of Mrs. Parks, and that
this woman--this black woman--in America had said, 'Nyet, non, no.'
If there was interest then, why not today?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the filmmakers hope to reveal a side of Parks that few
could have anticipated. "Many people are aware of Mrs. Parks as this
icon of the civil rights movement, and yet we are not aware of her as
a living, breathing human being," Bassett said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have her up on a shelf. And Mrs. Parks has always maintained,
as she says in the piece, that 'I didn't do anything big. I'm just an
everyday person, a human being just like everyone else. And what I
did, the simplicity of it, we are all capable of doing.'"</TE>

<HD>Epithet or Everyday Word? 'Boston Public' Enters the Fray</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A love-hate relationship exists between African American actor Chi
McBride and the N-word, the vilest epithet for his race. "I go
through periods in my life where I use the word, and I go though
periods in life where I swear the word off completely," says McBride,
40, who grew up on Chicago's West Side.</LD>
<LD>   "But I always feel the exact same way about white people using the
word. And that is, that word has too much power."</LD>
<LD>   Now "that word" will be a major story line on McBride's
sometimes-controversial Fox high school drama, "Boston Public,"
created by David E. Kelley. Scheduled for 8 p.m. Monday, the episode
looks at how some black youths freely use the word not only among
themselves as a term of endearment, but also with some of their white
friends--and vice versa.</LD>
<TE>   In Monday's episode, a black student and a white student at
Winslow High School toss the word back and forth, which starts a
fight with an offended black kid.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to defuse the situation, the teens' white teacher, Danny
Hanson (Michael Rapaport), leads his class in a discussion of the
word, including its use by rap artists and comics, and as the subject
of a book by Harvard Law School professor Randall Kennedy. Its very
utterance, especially by whites, causes black teacher Marla Hendricks
(Loretta Devine) to lobby principal Steven Harper (McBride) for
Hanson's removal.</TE>
<TE>   "That word has always stood for hatred coming out of a white
mouth," she says in the episode. "No teacher in any school is good
enough to erase that in a sensitivity class."</TE>
<TE>   The epithet's potency caused "Boston Public's" writers, including
Kelley, to want to write about it. "It's a sensitive topic, that goes
without saying," says co-executive producer John J. Sakmar, who wrote
the episode with Kelley, Kerry Lenhart and Sean Whitesell.</TE>
<TE>   Says Lenhart: "That's something that needs to be addressed in the
episode, that the word hasn't lost its power just because so many
people have gotten used to hearing it very casually."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time the word has been examined by series
television. Lifetime's "Any Day Now" and UPN's "Girlfriends" have
dealt with the consequences of its use.</TE>
<TE>   Lenhart and Sakmar say the episode, for which Kelley consulted
Harvard's Kennedy, isn't out to solve the problem. It's designed to
foster "healthy, positive discussion," Sakmar says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that television and movies, at best, will strike people
to have conversations, but I don't think television and movies are
going to change things that much," says Rapaport, who has appeared in
such racially charged movies as "Higher Learning," "Zebrahead" and
"Bamboozled."</TE>
<TE>   Mitsy Wilson, senior vice president of diversity development for
Fox Entertainment Group, says she "let out a major sigh" when she
heard about the episode. As an African American, she "was a little
puzzled and concerned" at this topic coming up during Black History
Month. However, "given the opportunity to read the script and have
some input with broadcast standards, and then to actually look at the
entire episode in terms of what we were trying to do, I think it's a
responsible piece of television," Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, there are those who disagree. That isn't much of a
surprise for "Boston Public," the target of a coalition of 15 family
and child advocacy groups who have complained to the Federal
Communications Commission that the series is too incendiary for the
first hour of prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural critic Darrell Mottley Newton of the University of
Wisconsin-Whitewater cites a concept in cultural studies called
"packing," in which "certain notions are 'packed' within the use of a
word. If one were to say 'sex,' certain images and notions are
inescapable."</TE>
<TE>   But "despite the reclassification and countercultural usage" of
the word, Newton says, "its horror and blight upon our imagery, and
more important, self-image as black folk, are still there."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint of Harvard Medical School was a
onetime consultant for NBC's "The Cosby Show" and sees an even deeper
meaning.</TE>
<TE>   "How does that affect a black kid age 10 watching 'Boston Public'
and listening to that discussion?" he asks. "The context of the word
is so demeaning and has all of the connotations of a lowlife,
inferior being."</TE>
<TE>   The episode doesn't suggest solutions, but McBride has one: "The
only thing that's going to make some people happy is everybody stop
using the word right now. OK, that lasted a couple of seconds. What
next?"</TE>

<HD>Photos of Drawings of Photos: DiCaprio Twice Removed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The relationship between a portrait artist and a sitter is always
loaded, but it's even more strangely skewed through the lens of
modern celebrity. An Italian Renaissance or English Baroque painter
began with the human experience of a direct encounter with the
subject. Today, an artist begins with the fractured experience of an
image forged through the shifting kaleidoscope of mass media, then
layers in a direct encounter afterward.</LD>
<LD>   In "Amy Adler Photographs Leonardo DiCaprio," the young Los
Angeles artist pictures her superstar contemporary in a manner at
once forthright and remote, immediate and detached. DiCaprio seems
there and not-there, both a presence and an absence. The same goes
for Amy Adler. Not since Warhol has an artist figured out how to
vivify so well the debased mass-media imagery of a movie star,
turning it to illuminating ends.</LD>
<TE>   Appropriately, the six large Cibachrome prints at the UCLA Hammer
Museum have been given an elegant installation in a gallery that
recalls the apse of a chapel. They derive from a photo shoot the
artist arranged with the actor last year, when both were living in
London. Adler photographed DiCaprio, as is her method, and then made
pastel drawings from the photographs. Next she photographed the
drawings. Finally she destroyed the original photographs and the
pastels. The photographs of the drawings are displayed at the Hammer,
putting us at a remove of several steps from the initial encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Adler's process shuffles the established deck of artistic values.
The sense of privilege once accorded to a portrait drawing can't
accrue to a celebrity snapshot, which is inherently mundane. By
tearing up the drawings and the snaps, Adler acknowledges the
dissipation of their power in media culture, but she also
acknowledges the power of art by turning them into a singular
photographic suite. Art is her trump card</TE>
<TE>   The result is visually odd and conceptually poignant. The six
pictures are like an old-fashioned film-strip. The actor, illuminated
from the side, looks down, looks up, glances back, tilts his head to
speak, covers his eyes (and a sheepish grin) with one hand and then
squints, Vermeer-like, toward the unseen light source (a window?).
The implication of a narrative emerges--call it a silent picture--and
it reinforces yet another story.</TE>
<TE>   Sequestered within these images is the narrative of their making.
You can see right away that they're glossy photographs, while the
crosshatched pastel markings, generalized surface planes and
simplified palette also immediately reveal that they're pictures of
drawings. The encounter between artist and sitter expands in time,
becoming a subject. Thoughtful reflection replaces the photographic
myth of a decisive moment when the shutter clicks. These photographs
don't pretend to be a transparent pipeline to movie-star essence;
they announce their distance.</TE>
<TE>   DiCaprio is casually dressed in an open dark shirt and a white
T-shirt, while the bust-length compositions and his relaxed demeanor
suggest an easygoing rapport with the artist. He's up close and
personal. But, like any portrait subject, he's still inaccessible.
The layers of experience are what distinguish these pictures from
publicity stills or other camera images. That doesn't make them more
truthful, only more compelling. Making photographic portraits of
drawings, Adler touches a deep nerve about the nature of identity in
a world of mass media.</TE>
<TE>   "Amy Adler Photographs Leonardo DiCaprio," UCLA Hammer Museum,
10899 Wilshire Blvd., Westwood, (310) 443-7000, through April 28.
Closed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Animal Portraits</TE>
<TE>   With a Certain Glow</TE>
<TE>   Tom Knechtel is a fabulist. His paintings and drawings call on
exotic sources--Victorian illustration, tarot cards, medieval
illuminations, Indian miniatures and daydreaming imagination--to tell
open-ended tales. Animals may or may not talk in his pictures, but
the natural world is irradiated with a supernatural glow.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel's oil paintings are reminiscent of cartography, but these
maps chart a highly personal mental terrain, rather than a physical
one. In one sumptuous section of the largest canvas, "A Mare's Nest,"
a man's head is wreathed with flora, into which a romping goat, a
bug-eyed ostrich, a rose-colored crab and assorted insects have been
woven. This lush glimpse of fantastic earthly paradise is itself
ringed by a circle of darkly roiling human bodies, like a hellish
vision from Dante. Knechtel's halo signifies both saint and sinner,
and it refuses to separate one from the other.</TE>
<TE>   The show also includes 19 exceptional works on paper. Painted with
black egg-based ink, the six drawings of individual animals (pig,
goat, mouse, water buffalo, etc.) isolated within empty fields of
paper seem almost Chinese. They turn common creatures into vivacious
apparitions through a remarkable economy of the brush.</TE>
<TE>   The most gorgeous drawings are the pastels, which are infused with
the rich colors of India. A sapphire lizard scampers across a
curry-yellow page. A deep-blue cow sleeps curled up in a mandarin
orange afternoon sun. A crimson bull looks out from a sheet of soft
sage green. Knechtel layers the dense pastel colors so that they seem
to glow through one another, letting the indescribable power of color
consecrate the animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Knechtel: New Work," Grant Selwyn Fine Art, 341 N. Canon Dr.,
Beverly Hills, (310) 777-8993, through March 23. Closed Sunday and
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Rugs With</TE>
<TE>   a New Currency</TE>
<TE>   Adaptable traditions of folk art meet the life-sustaining demands
of the commercial marketplace in "Wanna Buy an Afghan War Rug?"
Eleven carpets, most the size of small prayer rugs but one that's
4-by-6 feet, are on view at Dirt Gallery. The gentle flora, playful
fauna and religious iconography found in traditional Afghan weaving
have been replaced with the cold hardware and brutal machinery of
war.</TE>
<TE>   The wool rugs were woven between 1979 and 1989 by women in refugee
camps in Pakistan (and perhaps Iran) during the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan. Rich, earthy colors, made from natural vegetable dyes,
are arrayed in familiar ways. A wide border surrounds a contained
field in the center. Images are flat, seen in silhouette and often
edged in black. The patterns are symmetrical.</TE>
<TE>   What's distinctive is the subject matter. Kalashnikov rifles stand
like sentinels, framing rows of tanks, helicopters and troop
carriers. Fields of stylized hand grenades are bordered in bullets.
Land mines are laid out in decorative rows. Like an X-ray, ammunition
is glimpsed inside weaponry. The weapons seem almost cheerful, partly
because of the cartoon-like simplifications and partly because
expected patterns seem to have morphed. A floral blossom becomes a
stylized explosion, a water pipe turns into a grenade.</TE>
<TE>   The most startling rug is the largest. Beneath your feet, a parade
of military might passes by, flanked by an honor guard of enormous
rifles, as if it were May Day or Veteran's Day. Traditional
decorative and abstract patterns are woven into the hardware, which
results in anomalies like checkerboard land mines and jaunty argyle
helicopters. Paradise and purgatory get all mixed up.</TE>
<TE>   These surprising rugs may have been made in anticipation of a
Soviet market for wartime souvenirs--although, given the Russian
defeat in Afghanistan, that market didn't develop. Since then they've
been turning up in the port warehouses of Hamburg, Germany. In light
of recent events, they've taken on a new and unexpected currency.</TE>
<TE>   Dirt Gallery, 7906 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, (323)
822-9359, through April 20. Closed Sunday through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Female Artists</TE>
<TE>   Just Foolin' Around</TE>
<TE>   Girls just want to have fun, and in "Super/Sex" they do. At Post,
guest curator Michael Gold has assembled paintings, sculptures,
drawings, a video and photographs by 10 women. Indulging the male
gaze, however, has nothing to do with their art.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the work--including a pile of painted bodies by Nicole
Eisenman, black-and-white photographs of fat nudes in spare
landscapes by Laura Aguilar, and Nicoletta Munroe's color views of
Hollywood boudoirs--is familiar. Others, such as a short video of
brief and sometimes salacious vignettes by the young artist Micol
Hebron, are not. What they share is an erotic playfulness that is not
so different from what one already encounters in the culture at
large.</TE>
<TE>   The most engaging work here is a small new diptych by Megan
McManus, who was seen in a solo show at Post last fall. Looking down,
she paints her own lap--which means a viewer is cast into an intimate
position that coincides with the artist's viewpoint. Her bare,
freckled legs are backlighted, which casts her crotch into smooth,
undifferentiated shadow. The mystery is heightened by the carefully
observed banality of the context, where a beautifully painted
linoleum floor and brilliant green towel frame the artist's brightly
painted toenails.</TE>

<HD>Call It 'The Longest Meter'</HD>
<DH>'Mean Machine's' tale of a disgraced soccer star who takes
charge of a prison team benefits from solid pacing and acting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mean Machine" transports to England "The Longest Yard," one of Burt
Reynolds and director Robert Aldrich's most popular films, giving it
a contemporary edge and a thicket of not always penetrable accents.
It was a smart move on the part of "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels" and "Snatch" producer Matthew Vaughn because Tracy Keenan
Wynn's script from Albert S. Ruddy's original story is timeless and
easily relocated.</LD>
<LD>   "Mean Machine" may not be as stylish or engaging as the 1974
Aldrich film, but the material is so sure-fire, debuting feature
director Barry Skolnick has no trouble socking it over, backed by a
colorful cast headed by granite-jawed Vinnie Jones as Danny Meehan.
Danny scaled the heights of soccer stardom only to plunge to the
depths after being caught throwing a major international match. When
Danny drunkenly assaults two officers trying to arrest him, he draws
a three-year sentence to one of England's most forbidding prisons.
(The film was shot at Her Majesty's Oxford Prison, a largely
Victorian stone structure dating in part to the 11th century and
inoperative only since 1997.)</LD>
<TE>   Danny is instantly plunged into a cesspool of danger and intrigue.
His fellow inmates not surprisingly regard him as a traitor to their
beloved sport. And, as an elderly con, Doc (David Kelly), a staple
figure of prison pictures, carefully points out in regard to the
other prisoners, "You had it all. Everything they ever dreamed of.
And then you threw it all away." The question soon becomes whether
Danny will repeat himself.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Danny's presence is noticed by the prison's governor
(David Hemmings), a compulsive gambler who is thoroughly corrupt. He
attempts to maneuver Danny into training the guards'
semi-professional soccer team, but Danny shrewdly avoids becoming a
toady and successfully counters by offering to assemble a group of
inmates as a practice team for the guards. This will shore up Danny's
status with the other inmates and lift their spirits as well.
Naturally, Danny has his work cut out for him to whip into shape a
team, called the Mean Machine, composed of guys who are suitably
strong and fearless, but none too good at taking directions or seeing
themselves as team players. Danny, however, prevails, only to
discover that he's fallen into a trap that he can escape only by
risking tremendous personal sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question "Mean Machine" will play better to those
who've never seen "The Longest Yard."</TE>
<TE>   It's also likely that those attuned to thick British working-class
accents will find more clarity and possibly more humor as well.
Jones, himself a former professional soccer star, has a powerful
presence and is strongly focused; Hemmings is amusingly villainous;
and many others make vivid impressions. "Mean Machine" may not have
the resonance to linger in the memory affectionately as "The Longest
Yard" does, but it plays well, with a fast pace and plenty of punch.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some violence. Times guidelines:
Violence and language are standard for the genre and not exploitative
in tone.</TE>

<HD>Organist Will Perform a Messiaen Marathon</HD>
<DH>Music* Yale student plans series of nine-hour concerts of
what he calls "perfect music" by the mystic Catholic composer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM PAGE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A few minutes after 1 p.m. local time today, Paul Jacobs will sit
down at the organ of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the
Immaculate Conception and begin to play music by Olivier Messiaen.
About nine hours later, after the last note of "Livre du
Saint-Sacrement" (1984) dies away, Jacobs will have played every
composition Messiaen wrote for the organ, all in the course of a
single day.</LD>
<LD>   By any standards, it is a spectacular undertaking, made even more
remarkable by the fact that the 25-year-old Jacobs is still a
graduate student at Yale University. Last month he presented his
Messiaen marathon in Chicago, where John von Rhein, the chief music
critic of the Chicago Tribune, called him "one of the most supremely
gifted young organists of his generation" and declared his renditions
"superb." Further performances are scheduled for Atlanta, San
Francisco, Minneapolis and Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "I loved Messiaen's music from the first time I heard it," Jacobs
said in an interview last week. "As a boy, I was very involved with
the Catholic Church, and we had one priest who was an organ fanatic.
He didn't play himself, but he loved the grandeur and holiness of the
instrument. Anyway, when I was about 12 or 13, he took me to
Pittsburgh to hear a program, and it changed my life.</LD>
<TE>   "What I love about Messiaen is his perfect conviction and absolute
power," Jacobs continued. "I think more than ever we need to have
voices that present a very specific faith and conviction. His music
is full of a radiant joy, a joy that magnificently crushes the
listener."</TE>
<TE>   But why a marathon, as opposed to a series of presentations?
"There are a few reasons. First of all, because I'm a full-time
student, it would be impossible for me to travel and present the
music over six different nights. More important, this format allows a
complete immersion in Messiaen's work--more than 50 years of it. And
I believe that everybody is capable of appreciating Messiaen's music.
It is perfect music, you know; everything is in perfect order and you
cannot imagine a single note in any other place than it is. There's
not only intense emotion but also intelligence, real genius."</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 years since his death at age 83, Messiaen's stature as
one of the 20th century's most influential composers has only grown.
A mystic Catholic who sought inspiration from bird song and said he
saw colors when he composed, he was a complex, original thinker who,
from the beginning, went his own way. His music combined angular
melodies, intricate rhythms and dense formal schemata in a manner
that was subjective, passionate, extravagantly colorful and often
swooningly romantic.</TE>
<TE>   Messiaen shared Johann Sebastian Bach's belief that all music
should be written for the greater glory of God. "I have not written
liturgical music but rather meditative music on the mysteries of
faith," he once said. "I want to write music that is an act of faith,
a music that is about everything without ceasing to be about God."</TE>
<TE>   Like Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Scriabin before him, Messiaen
believed that music had a strong visual aspect. "When I hear music, I
hear colors," he said, "not through my eyes but through my intellect.
When I compose, I see the colors as I see the sounds."</TE>
<TE>   He described one of his harmonic sequences as going "from blue
striped with green to black spotted with red and gold, by way of
diamond, emerald, purplish-blue, with a dominant pool of orange
studded with milky white."</TE>
<TE>   Once, while watching a ballet, he got a stomachache because the
violet hue of the lighting clashed with his conception of the color
of G major.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Jacobs knows most of Messiaen's music by heart.</TE>
<TE>   "The freedom one achieves in memorization is a magnificent
sensation," he said. "Having the music come directly from the soul
and the fingers is a wonderful blessing."</TE>
<TE>   Still, quite sensibly, Jacobs will keep Messiaen's scores on the
organ throughout the day, if only as a safety net.</TE>

<HD>This Surreal 'Dumbshow' Probes Our Primal Impulses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley and Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dumbshow" at the Sacred Fools Theater is a surreal and nonlinear
piece that borrows freely from the works of Dostoevsky and Gogol to
"examine the primal human impulse to gain the advantage."</LD>
<LD>   That quote is from the press notes. However, feel free to
interpolate your own meaning onto this bizarre but finely rendered
show, which consists of a series of brief and tightly choreographed
scenes set to eclectic music.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening scene, the men and women of the large ensemble move
hectically about the stage, coalescing into a large circle. They
begin a playground clapping game, which evolves into a
ring-around-the-rosy dance, which ends with them dashing around in a
long line, crack-the-whip style.</LD>
<TE>   Through it all, the actors maintain a joyless deadpan, an eerie
juxtaposition to their childlike activities.</TE>
<TE>   The performers ambulate as if they are on tracks, rushing about
the stage but never colliding. The ensemble quickly separates into
recognizable groups.</TE>
<TE>   Two male antagonists jockey continually for supremacy, brandishing
their suit coats in a bantam-like plumage display. Four men sit in a
formal tableau, stirring their tea, then blowing bubbles through
their "spoons."</TE>
<TE>   Three women move like synchronized wind-up dolls, offering such
comments as "Men are still men, not piano keys." Two other women
cower in apparent terror, at one point donning white masks and
gesticulating from behind a black curtain. A sole woman moves with
dreamlike fluidity, inquiring, "Who do you think you are? The king of
Spain?"</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes, urgently, playfully, mysteriously. Creators Tina
Kronis and Richard Alger (Kronis directs, with Alger assisting) are
longtime collaborators who have recently worked with the
performance/puppetry collective Mummenschanz.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a keen sense of whimsy underlies their rigorous,
purposeful staging. So too does a sense of collective paranoia, the
disturbing feeling that something dire awaits these participants at
the end of their random, not-so-senseless rounds.</TE>
<TE>   F. Kathleen Foley</TE>
<TE>   "Dumbshow," Sacred Fools Theater, 660 N. Heliotrope Drive,
Hollywood. Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; also March 3, 1 p.m. March 4,
8 p.m. Ends March 6. $10. (310) 281-8337. Running time: 1 hour.</TE>

<TE>   'ElectroPuss': Skirmish in the Corporate Jungle</TE>
<TE>   Life can be precarious for a happy goldfish in a hungry pool of
sharks. Just ask Muffy Jonesmith, the hapless heroine who learns some
shocking truths about cattiness and the big bad world in Trista
Baldwin's darkly comic "ElectroPuss" from Circle X at the Hudson
Backstage Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Since career options are limited in her one-company hometown, the
archetypically perky Muffy (Jessica Makinson) follows graduation from
Zap High School with a receptionist's job at the sinister
Electricland Company where her Mom (Nedra Gallegos) willingly submits
to the advances of her sleazy boss (Jim Anzide).</TE>
<TE>   Like any parental surrogate, Electricland not only oppresses its
employees but makes them feel guilty for not doing even more on its
behalf--an all-too timely caricature of corporate entities that prey
on workers' misplaced trust in the security of their corporate
"family."</TE>
<TE>   (A portion of the box office will benefit the Crooked E. Com
Family Fund for laid-off Enron employees.)</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin's sharp satirical eye for women's predicaments in
particular--perpetuated as much by the infighting between women
themselves as by their male oppressors--is penetrating, but so
exaggerated it could easily come off as heavy-handed churlishness in
less skillful hands.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Goldberg's deft staging always finds the tone appropriate to
Baldwin's mercurial voice--whimsical at times, chilling at others.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly effective is Muffy's transformation from annoying
ditz into a brooding feline spouting faux Shakespearean soliloquies.</TE>
<TE>   While Baldwin's characters and situations rarely overlap
behavioral norms, an inspired and committed cast consistently find
the loopy sparks that make them convincing in their own over-the-top
way.</TE>
<TE>   Katy Selverstone repeatedly stops the show with her side-splitting
choreographed routines as a robotic corporate tour guide by day and
carnival attraction (run by David Grammer) by night.</TE>
<TE>   Ally Wolfe delights as an exuberantly conniving secretary with her
claws out for Muffy over office flunky Travis (Tim Wright), whose
zoological obsession with invertebrate animals seems to mirror his
own lack of spine.</TE>
<TE>   There's no shortage of comic backbone, though, in this quirky,
often hilarious gem.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Brandes</TE>
<TE>   "ElectroPuss," Hudson Backstage Theatre, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends
March 30. $15 (pay-what-you-can Sunday matinees). (323) 461-6069.
Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Margulies' One-Acts Are Less Than Satisfying</TE>
<TE>   Two one-acts by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Donald
Margulies, "Pitching to the Star" and "Women in Motion," have been
cobbled together on one bill at the Lee Strasberg Creative Center's
Studio Stras. The pairing is hardly organic. Slight and unrelated,
the pieces, as rendered here, are reminiscent more of directing class
scenes than a fully fledged professional production.</TE>
<TE>   "Women in Motion" a negligible playlet about two bickering gal
pals bound on a Caribbean jaunt, opens the evening. Libby (Chantal
Bushelle) and Monica (Rebecca Ling), office chums who have teamed up
for an ill-fated vacation, get on one another's nerves--and ours--as
soon as they board the plane. Bushelle acquits herself adequately
enough, but why director Andre Nemec encouraged Ling to affect such a
grating, adenoidal twang remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Nemec again presides over "Pitching," a predictable but amusing
play about a bemused New York playwright suffering through his first
Hollywood "pitch" session.</TE>
<TE>   The cast features Peggy Lipton ("The Mod Squad") in her stage
debut as fading Hollywood star Dena Strawbridge, a petty tyrant who
is long on ego and short on brains. Lipton's brother Robert Lipton
and her daughter Rashida Jones also star. Robert Lipton ("As the
World Turns") plays producer Dick Feldman, a knee-jerk meddler with a
god complex. Jones ("Boston Public") is alternately fawning and
cynical as Laurie, a development executive who hides her massive
contempt for Dick beneath a syrupy exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Champagne is perfectly cast as playwright Peter Rosenthal,
the appalled center of reason amid the swirling inanity.</TE>
<TE>   The pace flags early on, but gathers steam along with Margulies'
barbed aphorisms. When Dick grouses to Peter, "Life is too short for
irony," it's a comic high point. From a cold start, the actors
eventually engage us, and Margulies' brief comedy has the ring of
truth, but it is short, sweet and superficial, a playful glance at a
trifling subject that does not bear the weight of a full evening.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's "Wild Country Friday" on the WB tonight, with all four of the
network's prime-time sitcoms featuring performers from the country
music world.</LD>
<LD>   On "Raising Dad" at 8:30 p.m., Jerry Adler, familiar to "Sopranos"
fans as New York loan shark Hesh, plays Grandpa Sam. Adler gets an
unlikely daughter from Nashville in country music star Deana Carter.</LD>
<LD>   Recording artist Andy Griggs sings on "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"
(8 p.m.), Naomi Judd appears on "Maybe It's Me" (9:30 p.m.) and, of
course, Reba McEntire makes every Friday on "Reba" (9 p.m.) a "Wild
Country Friday."</LD>
<TE>   Given that "Raising Dad" is a program centered around a close-knit
family, it's tough to ignore the curious addition of Carter. Three
times, characters acknowledge the oddity of an immediate relative
having a Tennessee accent.</TE>
<TE>   The episode, built around a rift between Adler and Carter over her
choice to pursue her singing career, is tepid. Most of the writing
and acting is simplistic, and series lead Bob Saget deadpans his
delivery to such an extent that viewers may wonder if the actor is
comfortable with anything in the script, let alone the emergence of
this new Southern sister.</TE>
<TE>   However, Saget does revive for a plausibly sincere fight
underlining the hypocrisy of Adler's disapproval. For her part,
Carter is low-key but sweet--particularly sweet in her song to close
the show.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the seven Olympic nights followed by a lot of dwarfs in prime
time last week, as NBC exceeded the combined nightly audience for
ABC, CBS and Fox, and more than doubled its overall average of the
corresponding week a year ago, based on viewing estimates issued by
Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC recorded the most-watched week for any network since the 1996
Summer Olympics from Atlanta. Viewing of the Games did cool
considerably after the record-breaking opening ceremonies, but
ratings spiked upward this week, buoyed by coverage of the women's
figure skating Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If there is any silver lining to NBC's gold-medal ratings, it's
only that the Olympics remain most popular with older viewers, many
of whom fall outside the 18-to-49 age bracket that is the principal
currency to Madison Avenue media buyers.</LD>
<TE>   Thus far, despite coverage of snowboarding and similar events, the
median viewing age for the current Olympics is 48, slightly higher
than for the previous three Winter Games.</TE>

<HD>Strolling the Boardwalk With Actor Jeff Daniels</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Jim Carrey! Jim Carrey!" a group of teenagers chant as they hang
over the railing at Santa Monica pier, pointing at an actor sitting
on a bench below. But it's not Carrey. It's his "Dumb and Dumber"
co-star Jeff Daniels, who doesn't seem to notice their cries.</LD>
<LD>   During a short walk on the boardwalk from Shutters on the Beach
hotel to the pier, Daniels has already turned a lot of heads. Despite
his casual outfit--cowboy boots, beige pants, a striped shirt and a
blue windbreaker--Santa Monicans recognize the actor, who is
clutching Elmore Leonard's new novel under his arm. People whisper
discreetly, or blatantly turn their heads to stare. "I've learned not
to notice," Daniels says. He has also learned to eat a late lunch and
early dinner to avoid restaurant crowds, and to wear baseball caps
and shades, "all that silly stuff," when he wants to watch his son's
hockey games unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling incognito is one reason he prefers Michigan to Los
Angeles. One among many.</LD>
<TE>   Michigan is his home state, the home of his Purple Rose Theatre
company, and it's where he's based his independent production
company, Purple Rose Films. Michigan is also where he just finished
directing his second feature film, the comedy "Super Sucker."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is doing serious, meaningful, important movies," says
Daniels, adding that comedy's status as a "second-class citizen" was
another reason he wanted to do "Super Suckers." He had learned a
simple lesson from his directorial debut (a small film, seen mostly
in the Midwest, called "Escanaba in da Moonlight"). "It didn't have
an edge," he says. In short: "There wasn't enough sex."</TE>
<TE>   There's more sex of a sort in this new movie, the story of rival
vacuum cleaner salesmen in a small town. Daniels' character
eventually outsells his competitor when he discovers that some
appliances have several unintended applications. "We came up with the
'homemaker's little helper' [idea], and it took off from there,"
Daniels says.</TE>
<TE>   As Daniels stops in front of the hotel, a woman comes over, asking
for "$1.50." Daniels empties his pockets and puts the pile of
quarters in her hand. She saunters off. A weathered man who's missing
a couple of teeth and wearing a battered KISS jacket follows. He
leans in to take a look at Daniels. He doesn't want money.</TE>
<TE>   "I love your movies, man," he says. "I really do."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," Daniels offers.</TE>
<TE>   As the man walks out of earshot, he nods. "That's my fan base," he
says.</TE>

<TE>   Nicolas Cage will put a $4-million portion of his vintage car and
motorcycle collection on the auction block next month.</TE>
<TE>   Up for bid will be some classic vehicles, though Cage will retain
about 30 favorites. He decided last fall to part with some of his
collection, as "the cars were not getting the use that they should
because of his busy schedule," said David Gooding, president and
chief executive of Beverly Hills-based RM Auctions Inc., which will
conduct the auction in Amelia Island, Fla. (The March 9 sale is timed
to coincide with the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance car show,
which draws an estimated 40,000 people.)</TE>
<TE>   Looking for new owners: six motorcycles, three Porsches, two
Lamborghinis, two Jaguars, two Bugattis, a 1999 Rolls-Royce
limousine, a 1991 Ferrari, a 1973 Triumph Spitfire, a 1968 Corvette
and a 1957 Ford pickup.</TE>
<TE>   The most valuable of the cars is a 1956 Jaguar D-Type XKD 546
valued at between $800,000 and $1.2 million, Gooding said. The least
valuable is Cage's first collector car, a 1973 Triumph Spitfire
estimated to be worth between $15,000 and $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "When we shot that scene, it was a really strange atmosphere. The
apartment was really hot, Robert [Wisdom] was sweating all over my
back--it felt very real. But in a way, it was easy. I was naked,
doing things that were horrifying, but I felt bold, like I had the
permission to break taboos. It was refreshing." Selma Blair, in the
March issue of Details magazine, recounting the experience of
shooting an MPAA-banned scene cut from Todd Solondz's new film
"Storytelling."</TE>

<LD>A COLD SPRING</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Edra Ziesk</LD>
<TE>   Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill</TE>
<TE>   304 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Edra Ziesk, whose unusual and lovely name heralds an eye for the
lovely and the strange, certainly knows her Northeast weather. In the
Vermont village of Amity the time is now, and the season is that cusp
between winter and spring on which such snow-country villages can
seem to teeter forever. "A white button of sun had begun to burn
through, giving way to air slightly more transparent than it had
been, though the tops of the mountains were still invisible. She
could see Jody all the way up where the tree line began."</TE>
<TE>   Jody is a teenage boy, aware and sensitive but mute since infancy
owing to early neglect and abuse at the hands of his shiftless,
coked-out parents. "She" is Lenny, the lad's youngish widowed
grandmother, rescuer and caretaker. Their cozy home, encircled by
hundreds of acres of state forest, shares a mountainside enclave with
that of fiercely lonely James, a handsome albeit acne-ravaged high
school teacher. Farthest uphill stands a third house, long
unoccupied, ramshackle and riddled with wood lice.</TE>
<TE>   In this cold spring a young couple, escapees from hope-battering
New York City, arrive to seek refuge in the third house, the wife's
inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   Billy is a brash loser hoping to set up a Mexican restaurant for
the tourist trade; wife Nell, a cellist, has landed a job as music
teacher at the high school. (Yes, reader, you have guessed where
propinquity may lead.) Billy's rich array of flaws includes a
tendency to bolt; he "hates the country" and on the very first day
dumps work on their chaotic homestead to make a run back to the Big
Apple. At least Nell has her music to console her.</TE>
<TE>   Not so James, who fumes as his mountain keep is invaded by noise.
"Outside the cello music was stronger, the sound boosted outward by
rocks rubbing up against the trunks of deciduous wood.... It was
everywhere ... he leapt the porch and started up the road to shut the
sound down."</TE>
<TE>   It is a classic narrative opening gambit: Strangers have come to
town, and they will set events in motion just as swiftly and surely
as a cue ball may hit the four to the two to the pocket. These
strangers will change the local balance of relationships and
themselves be changed. Important new characters move into
range--among them Fernando, the homesick Mexican cook-to-be imported
from Manhattan; Eli Root, widower and lifeline of the community (he
owns the local heating-supply business); his rebellious son, Land;
and Land's pal Casey, a foulmouthed 15-year-old who plays a couple of
cards shy of a full deck. There are beautifully mined insights into
the adolescent's angle on experience: Annabelle, Eli's daughter, has
a girlfriend whose lower lip is "pouty to show concern," who wears
"jeans and a t-shirt with a big star in sequins on the front and
silver sandals." Annabelle watches her girlfriend "walk away, the
repetitive brightness of the sun striking off the heels of her
sandals."</TE>
<TE>   By the start of the novel's final third, Ziesk has woven accident
and motive into a tangle of  anxiety, fear and hope for her cast of
characters. Authorial portents add to the reader's flinching
anticipation of some tragic, inevitable jaw of fate about to snap
shut: "It came to Fernando now, as it had come to Billy, that he
would not see his wife again.... What Eli thought afterwards was that
everything ... began with the heat.... [Eli] could see two paths: at
the end of each, Land would be a different kind of man.... Later Nell
would think perhaps [James] had not seen her ... but of course he
had."</TE>
<TE>   At 304 pages, "A Cold Spring" is not a long book. Certain
paradoxes remain unresolved: Why, for example, does clear-eyed,
virtuous Lenny, as the mother who bore and raised the revoltingly
abusive torturer of her grandson, never give way to parental
self-searching or remorse? Why did pretty, well-educated Nell give
herself in marriage to the loutish, unprepossessing Billy? Perhaps "A
Cold Spring" could have been allowed more growing space toward the
end. As it stands, the drawn-out domestic actions of the early pages
feel lopsided relative to the headlong convergence of events in the
final chapters. And while some of the foreshadowing is fulfilled,
other speculative lines are dropped. In the end, the novel climaxes
in a single act of violence which, though fatal, seems to leave the
surviving characters' hearts and preoccupations not much altered.
This may be the author's intended message, but it leaves the reader
groping for catharsis.</TE>

<DH>Culture * Injections and chemical peels may be
theTupperware party of the 21st century as women find kinship in
plastic-surgery gatherings.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The walls are a stylish ochre, the lighting is soft and dim, the
clientele is gorgeous, and the woman who pours you a Perrier and
takes your order is dressed in a black suede skirt and go-go boots.
But this isn't a Pinot Bistro, and the lovely employee is an
aesthetician, not a waitress. A white lab coat is draped over her
chic ensemble, and it's a medical history form--not a menu--that
she's handing you.</LD>
<LD>   "Is this your first plastic surgery party?" one giddy female
patron inquires of another.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the 20 some-odd women gathered in the Encino medical
office of dermatologist Debra Luftman, M.D., the answer is yes.
Plastic surgery parties like this one, events where women bring their
friends and order up Botox injections and chemical peels like so many
dry martinis, have been popular in London and New York for the past
year, but the phenomenon is new to L.A.</LD>
<TE>   By six o'clock on Wednesday evening, the waiting room is packed
with jovial, attractive and accomplished women picking at prosciutto
and crab cake hors d'oeuvres. No one is under 30, or over 50, and
executives, housewives, actresses and fashion editors are all
impeccably turned out--these are women who can spend $300 to $400 for
a cosmetic procedure, so one can fairly surmise that their budgets
for hair, makeup, clothes and personal trainers are ample. Still,
it's a sophisticated crowd--no Baywatch breasts or garish bleach jobs
in sight.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is giddy: the clientele is nervous, but excited.
One by one, they slip away for 10, 20 minutes to one of the exam
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Rosenquist is tall, blond and the mother of three kids.
"That's why I have all the wrinkles I have," she jokes while settling
into the exam chair, then puts on a fierce scowl. "I told my kids,
this is how I look when I'm mad at you, so remember it, because I'm
not going to look like this in a week!"</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Luftman breezes in, wearing an elegant pantsuit, exquisitely
coifed and made up. She is an excellent advertisement for her
services, a 43-year-old mother of two with a bustling private
practice, a shelf of research awards and a teaching position at
UCLA--and who happens to be a much-better-looking woman than most of
her movie-star clients. "I've had all of the procedures offered here
tonight myself," she says. "Except for collagen, because I'm allergic
to it."</TE>
<TE>   Luftman practiced as an internist for two years before going into
cosmetic dermatology, a choice influenced by her interest in art and
aesthetics, which she studied under a fellowship at St. Andrew's
University in Scotland before medical school.</TE>
<TE>   The party is the first she's thrown. "I was asked to do this by
people who had heard about it happening on the East Coast," Luftman
says. "So I sent out invitations, and a menu of services to choose
from. And everything is $100 off the regular price tonight." The
services on offer this evening include chemical peels, mini-facials,
collagen injections and a new procedure called a FotoFacial, but most
of the demand is for Botox, Botox, Botox.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest-growing cosmetic procedure in the industry, Botox is a
neuro-toxin derived from the same botulism spore that causes a
particularly nasty strain of food poisoning. When injected into
muscle tissue in small doses, it temporarily paralyzes the
surrounding tissue.</TE>
<TE>   First developed to treat conditions such as facial tics, Botox's
ability to also erase the effect of frown lines and crow's feet was a
happy side effect of treatment that quickly became its own industry.
Although the Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve Botox
for removing frown lines, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons
reports Botox is now the most popular non-surgical procedure, with
nearly 800,000 performed in 2000, 88% of them on women. Of those, 59%
were in the 35- to 50-year-old age bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Luftman leans over Rosenquist, her manicured hand welding a
delicate syringe that's loaded up with toxin. It's deeply weird,
being at a party and watching one stunning woman perform medical
procedures on another, both of them laughing and gossiping all the
while. Weird, but surprisingly not unpleasant. The moment is in fact
diabolically charming, and somehow very 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "There is technique involved," Luftman explains. "If you do it
correctly you can eliminate the wrinkles without freezing the facial
expressions."</TE>
<TE>   "What's that crunching sound?" Rosenquist asks, giggling, as
Luftman pricks the skin of her forehead repeatedly with the needle.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just skin," Luftman says. "It's a good sound."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenquist chats about shopping for sunglasses, comparing and
contrasting the experience to getting cosmetic procedures, and in a
couple of minutes, the procedure is over.</TE>
<TE>   "This was so fun!" Rosenquist declares, sitting up with an ice
pack to her forehead. "I need to go have a glass of wine! Debbie
(Luftman) doesn't serve us any wine because it can increase
bleeding," she whispers to the side with a mock pout.</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall, Lori Symans, a 43-year-old vice president of sales
and marketing for a home builder, is waiting to have a smidgen of
Botox injected into her glabella--the vertical line that appears
between the brows--and a PhotoFacial, a procedure in which Luftman
uses a wand to blanket the surface of the skin with light pulses that
are supposed to stimulate collagen growth in the skin, reducing
redness and brown spots and tightening pores. "I never thought that I
would do anything like this, any kind of plastic surgery," Symans
says. "Now, I don't even care if people know I'm doing it."</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long time since the days of "Does she or doesn't she?"</TE>
<TE>   Susan Walters, who plays Diana on "The Young and the Restless,"
brought friends, and is making a fun evening of it. "My friend Kim
Ulrich, who is on "Passions," is in having Botox right now," she
says. "I brought her along because she's always game for these
things." And apparently she doesn't mind a whit that Walters is out
here divulging this information to her fans. Walters laughs, and
shrugs. "If you're that beautiful, you can fess up."</TE>
<TE>   Walters tried Botox herself, two years ago, but isn't a fan of it.
"I happen to like my face mobile," she says. And Walters, like most
of the women here, remains adamantly against having any kind of
"real" plastic surgery. "I'd be real nervous to cut into my face,"
she says. "I've worked with men and women who have had face lifts,
and I can't honestly say that the ones who had work done look better
than the ones who didn't. There are women at my kids' school who have
NO expression. You can try so hard not to look 40 that you end up
looking 50."</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich wanders out, smiling sweetly and clutching her ice pack to
her forehead. "We need all the help we can get," she says. "All of
us."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever one's feelings about plastic surgery, the most
interesting thing about the evening is its woman-centric flavor, how
communal and gentle the atmosphere is. If only pap smears and
mammograms and teeth cleanings were this festive.</TE>
<TE>   Not all plastic surgery parties have the same vibe, of course. One
imagines that the bi-monthly "Botox Cocktail Party" at the new spa at
the Palms Resort Casino in Las Vegas, presided over by plastic
surgeon Dr. Paul Nassif, is likely to be a bit more fabulous and
posh. Dr. Nassif also plans to begin hosting Botox parties in his
Beverly Hills office sometime soon. His parties may be more co-ed
affairs, as 20% of his clientele is male. "I have actors and male
models for clients," he says over the phone. "And a growing number of
businessmen who actually want to have no facial expression in
business meetings. They want to look cool."</TE>
<TE>   Once the shock of the newness wears off, the whole phenomenon's
bizarre-quotient seems low compared to that of having various and
sundry body parts tattooed and/or pierced. In terms of aesthetic
torture, Luftman claims that Botox has virtually no side effects
except for occasional and mild bruising.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise the atmosphere in her office is one of desire and
daring. You're here, everyone's having so much fun, the girls are
bonding, oh, what the heck, why not try it? Oh, what a soft, warm,
inviting thing peer pressure really is in practice. And if you
haven't experienced this powerfully seductive force since high
school, it's a shock to realize how utterly enjoyable it can be.</TE>

<HD>Friend, Crusader for American Mothers</HD>
<DH>Author pushes for reforms to benefit women who stay home to
raise kids.</DH>

<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a well-appointed Hancock Park living room crowded with women, Ann
Crittenden ticked off the facts:</LD>
<LD>   The wage gap between mothers and others is bigger than the gender
gap. A college-educated professional woman who chooses to stay home
with her child stands to lose a million dollars in lifetime earnings.
There are more economic disincentives to having a child in this
country than incentives.</LD>
<LD>   "The last part of the women's movement, is to bring this out,"
said Crittenden, sounding as if she were launching a grass-roots
political movement from her chair by the hearth in the home of Katie
Buckland, a special assistant to City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo.</LD>
<TE>   Crittenden, a former economics reporter for the New York Times, is
the author of last year's "The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most
Important Job in the World Is Still the Least Valued."</TE>
<TE>   She was a guest of the California Women's Law Center, which
periodically holds intimate, salon-like "policy forums" designed to
cultivate donors and stir consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Other guests have included guerrilla artist Robbie Conal, USC law
professor and political pundit Susan Estrich and a panel of experts
who discussed women and the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The events are by invitation only (and guests must be willing to
pay for the privilege; the law center asks for donations of $500 for
four events).</TE>
<TE>   If Crittenden wanted to be heard by some of the city's most
influential women, she was in the right place. Among the 40 or so
women (and three men) who sipped wine and nibbled string beans from
china plates were Loyola Marymount University law professor Sean
Scott, screenwriter Meg Kasdan.</TE>
<TE>   Crittenden began by telling her own story:</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, when she became a mother, she was overwhelmed by the
emotional, social and financial implications. First, she said, she
returned to work following the "baby as appendectomy" model. But she
was so besotted by her child that she decided to leave her job to
stay home. She ventured out to the same elite cocktail parties, only
this time she would introduce herself as a new mother, rather than a
New York Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "I shed status like skin off a reptile," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That experience, and her subsequent struggle to balance
motherhood, financial dependence and work, drove this book, which
took eight years to write.</TE>
<TE>   Crittenden conducted hundreds of interviews and drew on the latest
research in economics, history, child development and family law. She
argues that though many American women are liberated, mothers are
not. Mothers, she claims, are deprived of financial equality in
marriage. And the work of stay-at-home mothers does not have formal
economic value, even though it is important human capital that drives
a nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   She argues that the United States should become more like European
countries such as France and Sweden, which compensate women who stay
home to raise children. She advocates that women seek changes in the
laws and workplace rules to reward mothers for their sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   Crittenden said when she set out to write her book, which has
become a national bestseller, her dream was only that "someone will
read it." At lectures over the course of the past year, women would
stand up and ask Crittenden: What do we do?</TE>
<TE>   Don't ask me, she would say. I'm a journalist, not an activist.</TE>
<TE>   But after a year of criss-crossing the country, she has a
different answer. "I have changed," Crittenden said. "In the last few
weeks women have popped up saying, 'Let's work on this. Let's do a
women's movement.'"</TE>
<TE>   At this salon, Crittenden sounded nearly like a politician. Her
listeners--many with her book perched on their knees--craned forward,
nodding in agreement. They spoke of "platforms," "strategies" and how
to get others involved.</TE>
<TE>   Abby Liebman, one of the founders of the law center, gently
challenged Crittenden on one point: class.</TE>
<TE>   Though Crittenden mentions poor and working class women in her
book, the focus is on women like herself--upper-middle-class mothers
who gave up status-conferring careers to raise children. "My class
analysis is that all married mothers are in the same boat,"
Crittenden replied. "If we could get upper-middle-class white women
on board, we would win. If changes affect all women, it would affect
poor women as well."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone embraced Crittenden's ideas. "I feel a little
uncomfortable tagging our contributions to an economic value," said
Scott, the Loyola Marymount law professor.  "We seem to be playing
the same old boys game again. We should be tagging it to children are
valuable because they are valuable. They are not exclusively an
economic good."</TE>
<TE>   Crittenden listened, but for the purposes of political action,
disagreed. "We live in a capitalist society," Crittenden said. Hard
facts and numbers, she said, will be the only way mother's work will
ever be counted in economic terms.</TE>
<TE>   Crittenden and Marjorie Sims, the law center's executive director,
met the next day with eight female legislators from the Women's
Caucus in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We will talk about some of the issues raised in the book," Sims
said. "We will talk about what is possible legislatively on these
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Some women left the event feeling inspired. Harley Jane Kozak, a
Topanga Canyon mother of a 2-year-old and now pregnant with twins,
said when she first heard Crittenden talking about her book on NPR
she was so fascinated she nearly drove off the road. An actor who is
accustomed to supporting herself, she is now dependent on her husband
and is not entirely comfortable in her new role. "How can I find a
way to become part of this grass-roots effort to improve the life of
mothers?" she mused as she left the gathering. "I'm less at risk than
these women who are economically challenged. That gives me the
opportunity to do something on their behalf."</TE>

<LD>Do you know that scientists can tell a great deal about dinosaurs and
other prehistoric beasts from footprints they left behind? By
studying fossil footprints found all over North America, scientists
are able to tell what life was like millions of years ago for these
creatures. They can estimate their weight, size, how they walked and
how fast they moved. The prints left by these animals are known as
"trackways" to scientists--and they hold many secrets.</LD>
<LD>   One of the animals scientists have learned a lot about is the
bear-dog--the largest land-dwelling animal of its time. About the
size of a grizzly bear, it was neither bear nor dog, but a member of
a now-extinct family of carnivores that was between bears and dogs.
The bear-dog was built like a lion and probably ambushed its prey
with short, powerful bursts of speed, just as lions do today.
Bear-dog prints that were left about 14 million years ago show a
stride length about equal to the animal's body length, minus the
tail. They also show that the bear-dog moved its left legs and right
legs alternately, the same as bears do today, though at a much slower
pace.</LD>
<TE>   You can see a complete cast of a bear-dog at the Raymond M. Alf
Museum of Paleontology in Claremont. You can also see footprints of
birds, dinosaurs, amphibians, reptiles, camels, horses, elephants,
and spiders--the largest display of animal prints in the United
States. Located on the grounds of the Webb Schools, it is the only
museum of its kind located on a high school campus. For directions,
hours of operation, special programs and more details, call (909)

<HD>The Royal Treatment</HD>
<DH>Ready-to-wear from the queen's favorite couturier and other
designers' playful mixing of fabrics and textures are runway
highlights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>POLLY STEWART</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>With all due respect to Queen Elizabeth II, the thought of Britain's
hip young things clamoring to wear the designs of her most enduring
couturier, Hardy Amies, seems unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   However, not a single sky-blue suit with matching gloves, bag and
hat was in sight at the launch of the designer's first ready-to-wear
collection shown during Fashion Week here.</LD>
<LD>   Amies, 92, personally approved the design of each piece in the
collection though he sold his business to Luxury Brands Group PLC in
May last year. A three-person design team was briefed to take the
designer's timeless, British tailoring into the future with clothes
aimed at the young.</LD>
<TE>   His fall collection, titled "Work in Progress," offered
deconstructed vintage-style suiting for women with slightly Victorian
yet unfussy jackets and coats of varying lengths with just-puffed
sleeves. They were teamed with low-waisted swing skirts with exposed
back zips and inverted pleats in beautiful tweeds in olive green
flecked with black, and red with white.</TE>
<TE>   If prolific clothing designer Nicole Farhi has her way,
fashionistas will be wearing cropped pants with large pompoms on the
hems to keep their legs warm next winter. Like her British
predecessors earlier in the week--Jasper Conran, Betty Jackson and
Jean Muir--Farhi's creations focused on playing different fabrics and
textures off each other.</TE>
<TE>   Key looks included the ubiquitous faded denim jacket, in a classic
style, worn with a delicate knife-pleated black silk skirt; a gray
chunky down-on-the-farm style knitted cable cardigan worn with a very
girlie black silk embroidered skirt and black leather pleated top;
and a black goatskin sleeveless jacket worn over a sheer black
chiffon wrap top. The military feel crept in with a luxurious,
full-length olive drab leather coat worn with soft gray woolen
cropped trousers and suede boots.</TE>
<TE>   The ultra-hip London-based design duo Roger Lee and Lesley Sealey,
more commonly known by the label i.e. uniform, drew inspiration from
the technical symmetry of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Again different fabric textures were juxtaposed, with soft woolen
herringbone skirts and pants in neutral gray worn with highly
polished gunmetal belts and full, gathered blouses in soft peach silk
and polka-dot lace. Colors were muted grays and blacks, brightened
with deep turquoise, silver lame and flamingo pink.</TE>
<TE>   Raw-edged hems were everywhere at i.e. uniform. They lent a
streetwise feel to what would otherwise have been formal, intricate
tailoring that defied the genres of day and evening wear.</TE>
<TE>   Quirky label Antoni &amp; Alison, one of the most wearable of the top
British lines, conveyed an eccentric vision for winter.
Characteristic, catchy slogans were mixed with well-known
images--this time works by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh--printed on
knitted tops and worn with pretty knee-length skirts.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Jackson, who has been at the fore of British fashion for
more than two decades, presented an eclectic collection. Edgier than
her traditional trend toward classic wearability, Jackson's vision
for the autumn/winter season was overtly luxurious.</TE>

<HD>Didion's Shrewd 'Fictions' Picks Up Polk Book Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual George Polk Journalism Awards, whose winners were
announced this week in New York, enjoy a particular cachet among
working reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Named for a much-admired CBS correspondent killed in 1948 while
covering the Greek Civil War, the prizes have what author and
journalist David Halberstam calls "good DNA."</LD>
<LD>   For that reason, he was among many writers who were particularly
pleased that this year's Polk for book-length journalism went to Joan
Didion for her shrewd and unconventional collection of political
reporting, "Political Fictions." The volume compiles and amplifies
eight lengthy, reported essays written over the past 12 years for the
New York Review of Books.</LD>
<TE>   "In the writing life," Halberstam said this week, "there are
awards and then there are awards, and this is an unusually good one.
'Political Fictions' is astonishingly original, quite luminous
political reporting--something quite apart from the
inside-the-engine-room, Teddy White-derived drivel that seems to
predominate in that field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's one of the best things she's ever done as a writer.
It's smart and quite wickedly funny and it's important to journalism
for reputable judges to recognize it as terrific reporting."</TE>
<TE>   Didion recalls that her "relationship to politics began when, as a
Sacramento schoolgirl, I was walked downtown with my class to see the
State Legislature in action. It was St. Patrick's Day, and they all
were wearing green hats. That was it for me."</TE>
<TE>   Didion's political writing has an unwavering conviction that
political ends--which is to say, governance--must never be
subordinated to political means--the contest of campaigning.
"Politics is supposed to produce government and not just a permanent
campaign, which is where we are. We now have a campaign attitude
toward running the county."</TE>
<TE>   Didion says there is "very little conventional reporting, even
from conventions" in the book. In fact, she says, "these pieces
aren't really reporting at all. They are more like close textual
analysis, which is how I learned to read in the English department at
Berkeley."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Review's editor, Robert Silvers, who convinced Didion
to begin her political project more than a decade ago, said "it had
been a dream for some time that we would get her to write more
directly about politics, since her fictional work is full of
political implications and carefully arrived-at views. The result has
been very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   "I am very keen that the next thing she will do is something on
the Bush administration," Silvers said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a topic Didion regards as nearly inevitable, if only because
"they're using such a large place in the landscape, you can hardly
ignore them," she says. "I may start by looking at the
administration's relationships with the Christian right. But then, I
always start at the wrong place and end up somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley Would Be Happy With a 'Cease-Fire'</TE>
<TE>   Since stepping down as founding editor of Slate, Microsoft's
online magazine, earlier this month, Michael Kinsley has been the
object of a great deal of speculation. He has repeatedly declared
that the Parkinson's disease with which he was diagnosed eight years
ago had nothing to do with his decision. "Throughout my career, I
have changed jobs every five or six years," said Kinsley, who has
served twice as editor of the New Republic and as a co-host of CNN's
"Crossfire."</TE>
<TE>   In a conversation this week, Kinsley said his health has not
diminished his appetite for fresh journalistic enterprises. Along
with the weekly Slate column he will continue to write, Kinsley said
he is in the process of pitching an entirely new kind of political
talk show. .</TE>
<TE>   "I have a pretty carefully worked out scheme for a show called
'Cease-Fire,'" he said. "It would have two guests and a host, who
instead of goading the guests into fighting, tries to get them to
agree on whatever the issue is."</TE>
<TE>   If it succeeds, who knows where the trend might end--perhaps in
reality shows that reward decency and compassion.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kinsley continues to reflect in contrarian ways on the
state and future of online magazines. At the moment, neither Slate
nor its major competitor, Salon, has turned a profit, though Kinsley
says his publication is close. Many of the future's online magazines,
he predicts, "will be subsidized. Their small steady losses will be
made up by some rich person, as occurs now with the New Republic or
the Weekly Standard. But there also will be profitable publications."</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz's New Best Friend:</TE>
<TE>   the Religious Right</TE>
<TE>   Politics always has made strange bedfellows, but nowadays so does
publishing. And perhaps the most novel of the couplings now occurring
is between talent manager Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group
and evangelical minister turned bestselling novelist Timothy LaHaye.</TE>
<TE>   Artists Management already represents such blue-chip book-sellers
as Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton, but LaHaye is a phenomenon of a
different magnitude. In less than a decade, the nine apocalyptic
thrillers that so far comprise his "Left Behind" series have sold
more than 50 million copies to adults and tens of thousands more to
juvenile readers. The books' plots draw on LaHaye's highly individual
interpretation of biblical passages he and like-minded believers
conceive as prophecies concerning the end of the world and the second
coming of Christ. LaHaye, 75, provides a theological outline for each
volume, and a collaborator connects the narrative dots with
incidental details, like characters and plots.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Ovitz's group reached an agreement with Bantam
Dell, a division of Random House, to publish LaHaye's next four
novels for an advance of $45 million, making the group's new client
one of America's highest paid novelists. LaHaye has severed ties with
his longtime collaborator, Jerry B. Jenkins--who nonetheless has four
more novels in the series in progress--and is searching for a new
partner.</TE>
<TE>   All this is rather like Hollywood-packaging-as-usual. What is
novel is the alliance between a leading figure in what most cultural
conservatives regard as America's own evil empire and a founding
father of the Christian right.</TE>
<TE>   LaHaye and his wife, Beverly, who heads a group called Concerned
Women of America, have long been among the Christian right's most
active lobbyists who oppose abortion, equal rights for gays and
lesbians, and feminism in any form.</TE>
<TE>   Among the LaHayes' more controversial beliefs: 144,000 Jews must
convert to their brand of Christianity before the second coming of
Christ can occur.</TE>
<TE>   The LaHayes met while both were students at Bob Jones University,
an ultra-fundamentalist institution.</TE>
<TE>   Among the school's other notable alumni is the Rev. Ian Paisley,
the Catholic-bashing Ulster politician who currently is trying to
wreck the peace process in Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   No word on whether he is shopping a book proposal.</TE>

<HD>Street Smarts</HD>
<DH>Designer who once slapped his stickers on signs goes
mainstream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've no doubt seen the image all over Los Angeles, on abandoned
buildings and power boxes, telephone poles and the backs of street
signs. It is a face, a graphic black and white close-up of a man with
deep-set eyes, a closed mouth and a hard stare. Sometimes a single
word appears below the face: OBEY. This is Obey Giant.</LD>
<LD>   Shepard Fairey, a boyish 32-year-old who recently relocated to Los
Angeles after a stint in San Diego, is the artist behind Obey Giant.
His work is currently featured  at the Merry Karnowsky Gallery on La
Brea Avenue, and he is a principal in a 5-year-old design firm called
BLK/MRKT (pronounced Black Market).</LD>
<LD>   As Fairey tells it, the whole Obey Giant thing started as a
joke. It was 1989; the dedicated skateboarder had just completed his
freshman year at Rhode Island School of Design, and over the summer
he was managing a skate shop in Providence. With the boss away most
of the time, he also ran a little side business out of the shop,
selling his own designs--stickers and bootleg punk rock T-shirts he
created using handmade stencils.</LD>
<TE>   One night, while hanging out with a skate buddy at home, Fairey
was working on a stencil for a Clash T-shirt. "My friend said, 'I'm
bored. I want to learn to make a stencil,'" Fairey recalls. "So I
found an image. I saw an ad for wrestling with Andre the Giant. He
[my friend] was like, 'This is stupid.' I was like, 'No way. Andre is
awesome.' Spur of the moment I said, 'Andre's posse is the new
thing.' But really I thought it was ridiculous. That was the very
humble beginning. He said, 'No. I don't want to.' I was like, 'If you
don't, I will.'"</TE>
<TE>   Some quick handiwork and "like, $4.38" later, Fairey had the first
batch of giant stickers. Unlike today's giant image, these included
the words "Andre The Giant Has A Posse," as well as the wrestler's
impressive dimensions: "7'4, 540 LB." The face was far more
identifiable in this early incarnation. (Modifications were made in
1996 in part to appease the wrestler's estate.)</TE>
<TE>   Fairey gave most of the stickers to friends and affixed a few to
stop signs. "I thought it would be a quick inside joke," he says.
"But our group of [skate] friends latched onto it immediately." When
fall semester started up, his classmates responded equally
enthusiastically, albeit with a studied art-school intellectualism.
"They were like, 'What a cool, Dada, nonsensical art thing," Fairey
says. "'I'm going to put one on my coffee mug.'"</TE>
<TE>   Things might have stopped there, but the giant had a momentum of
its own. Fairey overheard people talking about it in clubs and bars.
They thought it was a band, he says. Others assumed it was a "skate
thing." Paranoid types presumed it was a gang or a club.</TE>
<TE>   "The more something is around, the more people want to know
what it is and the more it gains a viral power," Fairey says. "I knew
I was doing something that was affecting the environment, even if it
was anonymously....  I didn't have any aspirations like it's really
important or it's the best thing. And I still don't feel that way. I
just got addicted to it."</TE>
<TE>   Fairey printed more stickers and bigger stickers. He made giant
T-shirts and stencils. Despite the buzz, he was still operating under
the larger radar. That changed in the fall of 1990 when he hit a
billboard about a block away from campus. It was a campaign billboard
for then mayoral candidate Buddy Cianci. Fairey didn't know much
about Cianci. He just knew it was a primo spot and one he could
reach.  And he was amused by Cianci's  motto, "He never stopped
caring about Providence," a reference to his former tenure as mayor.
Fairey pasted a huge Andre the Giant head directly over Cianci's.</TE>
<TE>   "It caused a big media circus," Fairey says. "I was pretty blown
away by the response. A lot of people at RISD knew who I was and knew
about the stickers. But I had not been interviewed, and nobody knew
how to find me." Of course, the school's proximity to the billboard
put its student body under scrutiny. Campus security started asking
questions.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon Fairey walked out of the dining hall to find his
portfolio gone. He went to his next class anyway. But he wasn't
altogether surprised when, halfway through class, he was called to
the administrative offices. His portfolio contained uncut sticker
sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew they would be like, 'wicked busted' if I denied it,"
Fairey says. So he fessed up. The administrators were nevertheless
grim. "They said this is a real public relations problem," Fairey
recalls. "You're going to apologize, and you may get kicked out of
school."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Fairey's instructors had a different response, not
necessarily to the act of vandalism but to the image. "A lot of my
teachers said, 'Off the record, I love this. I'm not allowed to
endorse this. But I think this is awesome.'" The powers that be at
RISD eventually came around as well. Last year, Fairey was invited to
lecture at his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Obey Giant is a worldwide phenomenon. There's even a heady
manifesto. "The OBEY campaign attempts to stimulate curiosity and
bring people to question both the campaign and their relationship
with their surroundings," reads the condensed version. It ends: "To
catalyze a thoughtful dialogue deconstructing the process of image
absorption is the ultimate goal. All in the name of fun and
observation. The medium is the message."</TE>
<TE>   Fairey has put up Obey Giant posters and stickers in Boston, New
York, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as overseas.
In the course of his street campaign, he's been arrested eight times,
although never in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Usually the charges are related to vandalism, Fairey says. But the
police, he adds, "are creative." He's been charged  with trespassing,
malicious destruction of public property and, once, possession of a
tool of criminal mischief, specifically a can of spray paint that
Fairey says he just "happened to have" with him. With each arrest,
Fairey spent a few hours in jail but never more than 48. Fines have
ranged from $50 to $300.</TE>
<TE>   There is also an ever-evolving team of volunteers that does the
work. "I try to explain to people where the appropriate places are,"
Fairey says. "I have a certain ethic." Boarded-up buildings and
abandoned property are game, as are the backs of street signs. And
with blank billboards, says Fairey, it's carpe diem. "I want people
to see it. But I'm not saying anarchy ... I try to figure out where
the line is, where people are going to get really [angry]. That's a
delicate thing when you've set out to do something a little
antagonistic in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Though many of Fairey's fellow street and graffiti artists admire
what Los Angeles artist Robbie Conal calls his "canny distribution
tactic--put 'em everywhere and anywhere," it isn't necessarily a love
fest. "I think it's good, basic graphic design. But it's not
overwhelming," says Conal, who is well known for his political
posters, installed  using equally under-cover-of-night tactics. "I'm
not a huge fan. It's got to do with his content and lack of same. My
question is, this is an historic method of distribution often
involving adversarial ideas, and does he have one or any? Does he
have any ideas besides advertising his distribution method,
commercial products and himself?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Fairey's street campaign has served as an entree into the
world of fine art. Other examples of his work, which often depict
well-known public figures as disparate as Mao Tse-tung and Ozzy
Osbourne, have been purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.
Fairey has been taking a lot of heat lately from longtime Obey Giant
fans for going commercial. There's now a line of Obey Giant clothing
and accessories for men and women. It sells at trendy retailers such
as NYSE on Beverly Boulevard. And BLK/MRKT, Fairey's design firm,
counts several corporations--Pepsi, Ford and Netscape to name a
few--among its clients.</TE>
<TE>   Though the charges of selling out clearly pique Fairey, he mostly
brushes them off. Besides, the clothing is just another way to spread
Obey Giant, he contends. (Nearly every piece in the collection
features a tag with the OBEY manifesto as well as a stencil.) In
addition, profits from the collection and BLK/MRKT help fund the
street campaign.</TE>
<TE>   As for the future of Obey Giant, says Fairey, "there will be a point in
time where it either fizzles, it reaches a ceiling in the cool world and
doesn't grow beyond it, or it will get to where it's big and gets
reabsorbed into the system, where it's like this stuff
is available at Target." Until then, Fairey intends to keep up the
public mischief making. Don't expect a flood of fresh postings
locally, however. "I'm trying to be sensitive to the fact that this
is my home," he says. "And I can be tracked down."</TE>
<TE>   That said, full restraint is clearly near impossible. Fairey has a
collection of stickers in his pocket, and there's more where those
came from.</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: My 16-year-old daughter wants to be in fashion
but tends toward a classic look. She is a size 4, not petite, and for
religious reasons covers her knees, elbows and collarbones. Size 4 is
hard to find, but we manage after many hours of shopping to acquire
clothes for the winter that are modest. Summer clothes are impossible
to find for both reasons, especially shirts and blouses. Her fear is
that she'll look like an old lady rather than a teenager. Can you
point us in the right direction?</LD>
<LD>   --SEARCHING FOR</LD>
<LD>   SOMETHING SUITABLE</LD>
<TE>   Dear Searching: We have no doubt that you're having little luck
locating modest spring and summer clothes for your 16-year-old. The
combination of traditional warm-weather looks such as tank tops and
short skirts, plus increasingly sexy styles for teens, makes it
difficult to find conservative items.</TE>
<TE>   It's not impossible; it just takes some patience. We found a few
items--one from a surprising source--that aren't "old lady" looking
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Garnet Hill's spring catalog offers a snap-front linen jacket
styled like a jean jacket ($98). The catalog also carries cute
striped knit long-sleeve T-shirts ($38) and three-quarter sleeve
cotton/spandex T-shirts in solids or with a pretty rose embellishment
on the front ($44). There's also an ankle-length bias-cut layered
rose floral silk skirt ($118). They're at www.garnethill .com, or
call (800) 622-6216.</TE>
<TE>   At J. Jill's online site we found a few long skirts: one a
heathered cotton knit with an elastic waist ($49), another in a
waffle texture with a drawstring elastic waist ($39), and an A-line
"perfect black skirt" in rayon/polyester ($79). Find them at
www.jjill.com, or call (800) 343-5700.</TE>
<TE>   Two blouses at Boston Proper meet your requirements: a
cropped-sleeve tuxedo-style pin-tucked shirt ($59), and a
velvet-trimmed embroidered denim shirt ($49). The Web site is
www.bostonproper.com, or call (800) 243-4300.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't expect to find anything at Delia's, a teen-friendly
store, catalog and Web site known for trendy, body-baring items like
belly shirts and short shorts. But lo and behold, we spotted
something your daughter can wear: a three-quarter-sleeve shirt in
cotton/spandex for $28. The company is online at www.delias.com, or
call (888) 533-5427.</TE>
<TE>   For others searching for similar clothes, don't give up hope.
Although it seems at times that the only clothes available for teens
are sexy and revealing, there are designers and manufacturers who are
producing less provocative styles. If the old-fashioned kind of
shopping is too time-consuming and you have access to the Internet,
we suggest doing some surfing to find suitable items. We know a lot
of you don't like shopping online because of the hassle of returns,
but if you have sizing questions call customer service. If you still
can't find what you're looking for, let the companies know. E-mail
makes contacting them much easier.</TE>
<TE>   FROM THE FASHION POLICE BLOTTER: Lands' End, a catalog devoted to
traditional men's, women's and kids' clothes, has offered large sizes
for women since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   We're happy to report that it has recently expanded its offerings
and published a separate catalog for sizes 18W-26W that includes polo
shirts, tank tops, cropped pants, twin sets, dresses, blazers,
skirts, swimsuits and exercise wear. The models featured are actual
large-size models, not size 8s who ate a big lunch. To order the
catalog, call (800) 356-4444 or go online at www landsend.com.</TE>
<TE>   Write to Fashion Police, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012,
fax to (213) 237-4888, or send e-mail to jeannine.stein@latimes.com.</TE>

<LD>First came J. Lo, a.k.a. the dancing, singing actress Jennifer Lopez.
Now comes J. Rod, otherwise known as Jennifer Rodriguez, the double
bronze Olympic medalist who nailed her second medal Wednesday night
and cemented her shortened handle among sports announcers
broadcasting her victory.</LD>
<LD>   "J. Rod captures the bronze! J. Rod skates to another medal!
There's J. Rod's parents in the stands!"</LD>
<LD>   "There is something so unique about a perfectly fitting nickname
that when it works it's fabulous," says urban cultural anthropologist
Jennifer James, who lectures on cultural change and is a former
University of Washington faculty member in the psychiatry and
behavioral sciences department. "For sure, you can't get a spark of a
nickname out of Gwyneth Paltrow. On the other hand, Beverly Sills was
called 'Bubbles' because, well, you couldn't call her B.S."</LD>
<TE>   James, who was nicknamed "J Bird" when she was a kid, often goes
by J.J. today. She says with today's gender equality, "the freedom to
tag nicknames on women is a good thing."</TE>

<HD>The Otherwhere Ice Show</HD>
<DH>Part 5 The story so far: Magic has helped Molly skate to
perfection in the Otherwhere Ice Show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL KIMBERLY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Molly was happy. She had skated very well, but deep inside she knew
that in spite of the laughter and applause, in spite of the magical
beauty of this circus, there was something wrong. The other
performers seemed wistful and unhappy.</LD>
<LD>   The show came to an end. The audience left as the music faded
away, and now the pond was quiet again, shrouded in silent snow.</LD>
<LD>   Molly stood with the three tiny women and Magnus. "You were
wonderful," he told her.</LD>
<TE>   The woman who had played the wicked stepmother looked up at her
with admiration. "You were a lovely Cinderella," she said. "I played
that part once, long ago, when I was as big as you."</TE>
<TE>   Magnus frowned and brushed her aside. "Will you stay with us?" he
asked Molly. "You could star in our show every night."</TE>
<TE>   He was standing in front of her, and Molly saw with a shock that
she only came up to the third silver button on his jacket. But she
remembered being as tall as his second button!</TE>
<TE>   Now a voice inside her was screaming its warning. She skated away
from Magnus to Dad's wooden bench, where she sat to pull off her
skates.</TE>
<TE>   He followed her. "Otherwhere is a wonderful place, Molly. No one
has to work. I do it all for them with magic."</TE>
<TE>   Molly clutched the edge of the bench, remembering how Dad had told
her that hard work made you grow. The people in Magnus' world didn't
work, but they grew--smaller!</TE>
<TE>   "You need me, Molly," Magnus told her. "You can't do a double axel
by yourself, remember?"</TE>
<TE>   "But I can work on it myself," she said. "It might be hard, but
I'll learn."</TE>
<TE>   Then she grabbed her jacket and ran down the path toward home.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Kimberly lived in Ottawa, Canada, where she learned to skate.
But she never could do the double axel. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes</TE>
<TE>   .com/kids. A new five-part story begins on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Noel Cullen, 54; Sought to Restore Elegance and Variety of
Irish Cooking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noel Cullen, an educator and author who dedicated himself to
dispelling the notion that all Irish food is boiled and bland and
relies on the potato, died Saturday in Walpole, Mass. He was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Cullen wrote ''Elegant Irish Cooking,'' which offered about 200
recipes as proof of the elegance and variety of Irish cuisine.
Included were dishes such as Roast Pike With Lovage and Mullaghmore
Lobster Souffle. Cullen created the latter dish when he was a
personal chef to the late Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Allied
commander in Southeast Asia during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Cullen blamed the great Irish famine of the late 1840s for the bad
reputation Irish cooking has endured. The famine ''took away all the
elegance'' of Irish cooking, turning food into strictly a means of
sustenance, not fine dining, he said. Especially in the United
States, Irish cuisine became defined by ''potato, corned beef,
cabbage or booze,'' he added.</LD>
<TE>   He proudly pointed out that Irish monks in the 6th and 7th
centuries introduced garlic to much of the world, that an Irishman
invented mayonnaise and that Irish immigrants founded many French
wineries.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Dublin, Cullen became a culinary apprentice at 13. He held
bachelor's and master's degrees from Johnson &amp; Wales University and a
doctorate in education from Boston University, where he taught
culinary arts and food and beverage management. He also was a former
president of the American Culinary Federation.</TE>

<LD>J.C. Penney Co., the second-largest U.S. department store chain, said
it had profit of $95million in its fiscal fourth quarter, and
earnings this year will be less than forecast because of lower income
from its pension fund.</LD>
<LD>   Net income of 32 cents a share in the quarter ended Jan. 26
contrasted with a loss of $580 million, or $1.26, a year ago. This
year, profit will be 85 cents to 95 cents, less than the 96-cent
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First
Call, Chief Financial Officer Robert Cavanaugh said.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney fell $2.80, or 12%, to
close at $20.79 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Andersen Broaches a Settlement Plan</HD>
<DH>RELATED STORIES Fiasco repeat: Enron is not the first to
financially self-destruct. A1  Independent review: A judge picks an
examiner to study Enron North America Corp. C4</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm has floated a plan to settle dozens of
lawsuits from its failed audit of Enron Corp., a move that represents
a savvy strategy to force shareholders and creditors to negotiate
jointly so that neither gets left out, legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Such a tactic also could speed the resolution to the claims
against the large accounting firm and end an anticipated hemorrhaging
of clients and staff, industry observers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But the initial figures floated--$600 million to $800 million,
according to one attorney involved in the case--may be too small to
satisfy the claims of the competing interests of shareholders
involved in a class-action lawsuit and creditors, who are separately
seeking restitution in federal Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen, which is the target of multiple federal investigations
for its role in the failure of the Houston-based energy trader in
December, provided little detail about its efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Reaching out to the groups affected in this case is consistent
with our commitment to address the issues raised by Enron's collapse
in a straightforward and constructive manner," Andersen said in a
statement. "We think it is in the best interests of all parties to
deal expeditiously and responsibly with what has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   "We remain confident that we can work through this successfully,
and we want to focus our attention on taking the steps and making the
reforms needed to strengthen our firm, the accounting profession and
the capital market system," Andersen said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen floated the idea in separate meetings with Enron
creditors in its bankruptcy proceedings and a group of shareholders
who have filed a class-action lawsuit seeking damages from the
Chicago-based accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call between attorneys in the class-action
lawsuit Feb. 14, lawyers for Andersen came on line "saying that
Andersen was interested in talking about a settlement," said Trey
Davis, spokesman for the University of California system, which was
named lead plaintiff in the shareholders' lawsuit Friday. The UC
system lost $145 million in pension and endowment funds in the Enron
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   There have been "no substantive discussions," Davis added. "We
have been the lead plaintiff in this case for only three business
days. You can't have a settlement until we know all the facts in the
case."</TE>
<TE>   The university joined the lawsuit in December, claiming that it
was duped by a "massive insider trading" scheme in which the company
and the Andersen accounting firm issued false financial statements
and made "false and misleading statements about the company's
purportedly record results and strong operating performance."</TE>
<TE>   As a lead plaintiff, the university and its law firm manages the
litigation on behalf of the other plaintiffs in the shareholders'
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Parker, a Houston attorney who represents New York and
Florida pension funds in the class action, said Andersen's entreaty
is "just the first round of what will be many rounds of discussion."</TE>
<TE>   He said the initial figures broached aren't enough to satisfy the
claims of all the interested parties in the Enron debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need is an independent assessment as to the ongoing
viability of Andersen as a business enterprise and as to how much
they can pay," Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said Andersen has about $250 million in insurance and
could come up with hundreds of millions more from its operations.
Parker and others also believe that Andersen's 1,300 U.S. partners
will have to make some sort of contribution in the form of a
partnership assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "But the only way they would pay is if they believed that Andersen
had a future as a business enterprise," Parker said. "The fact is
that this firm is worth more to everybody alive than dead."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe you will see anybody agree to a settlement
without a partnership call or assessment," said John C. Coffee Jr.,
an accounting expert and law professor at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee added that he wasn't surprised that Andersen was starting
to move now to settle the lawsuits and claims.</TE>
<TE>   "They were waiting for the court to appoint a lead plaintiff [for
the shareholders] so that they would have someone to negotiate with,"
Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   "This also is a very astute strategy to try to turn the two
principal groups of plaintiffs in this case against each other in a
fight over a limited amount of funds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither group, for example, would want to see the other gain an
advantage in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The worst scenario for Andersen is to have to negotiate a large
settlement with veteran class-action law firm Milberg, Weiss,
Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach, which is representing the UC system, and
then have to come back and deal with Enron's creditors separately.</TE>

<HD>Recession May Be One of Mildest on Record</HD>
<DH>Economy: Sharp jump in Conference Board index suggests the
downturn is ending and the recovery could be vigorous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN CRUTSINGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recession is shaping up as one of the shortest and mildest on
record. In fact, it may already be over, private economists said
Thursday, based on various upbeat reports.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic
indicators, a key gauge of future activity, shot up 0.6% in January,
its fourth consecutive monthly increase.</LD>
<LD>   "The strong signal from the indicators is that the recession is
ending and that the recovery could be more vigorous than earlier
anticipated," said Ken Goldstein, a senior economist with the New
York-based industry group that issues the index.</LD>
<TE>   While the leading index was flashing signals of a rebound, another
report Thursday showed that last year's slowdown may not have been as
severe as first believed.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed by 11.4% in December to $25.3 billion, its best showing
since September.</TE>
<TE>   This unexpectedly large improvement sent economists scurrying to
upwardly revise estimates for overall economic activity in the fourth
quarter. Many said the gross domestic product may have risen by 1% in
the October-December quarter, based on the stronger trade showing,
instead of the originally reported 0.2% increase.</TE>
<TE>   The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of
when recessions begin and end, has said the downturn began in March,
ending a record 10-year stretch of prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   The economic research bureau is not expected to issue a ruling on
the end of the downturn for several more months.</TE>
<TE>   If current indications hold up and the third quarter, when the GDP
fell at a 1.3% rate, is the only negative period, the drop in
economic output during the recession will be just 0.3%, making this
the mildest recession in U.S. history. The National Assn. for
Business Economics said Thursday that 60% of the economists on its
forecasting panel believe the recession is over.</TE>
<TE>   The NABE's newest forecast put economic growth at 1.5% for 2002
and an even stronger 3.8% in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 10,000
to 383,000 last week.</TE>

<HD>Examiner to Probe Enron Subsidiary</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bankruptcy judge says he will appoint investigator
to help resolve conflict among creditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Hoping to resolve a simmering dispute among Enron Corp. creditors, a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge said Thursday that he will appoint an
independent examiner to review the company's largest subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   The examiner will study the finances of Enron North America Corp.,
an apparently profitable unit that included Enron's once-formidable
energy-trading operation.</LD>
<LD>   Creditors have clashed over the management of Enron NA and the
possible payouts it could generate. The confrontation could have
major implications for the future of Enron and for the bankruptcy
case.</LD>
<TE>   Energy companies that traded with Enron NA say they should be
repaid directly from the unit's assets, which some estimates put as
high as $10 billion. The energy firms worry that the parent is
siphoning cash from Enron NA, dissipating their potential recovery.</TE>
<TE>   From Dec. 2--the day of Enron's bankruptcy filing--through Jan.
23, Enron NA generated $579 million in cash flow, said Rhett
Campbell, an attorney at Thompson &amp; Knight in Houston who represents
25 energy firms. That money was funneled to the parent company, which
issued the unit a promissory note, Campbell said. As of Jan. 23,
Enron had spent $250 million of that cash, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The energy companies asked Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to bar the
parent firm from dipping into the unit's cash flow. Gonzalez refused
to grant that request. Instead, he said he would name an examiner who
will compile a report on Enron NA's finances within 20 days of being
appointed.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the energy companies praised the judge's ruling.
"It'll help build a situation that protects our interests," said
David Bennett, a Thompson &amp; Knight attorney. The appointment of an
examiner is "the next best thing" to stopping the flow of cash to the
parent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The energy companies' request was opposed by the official
committee of unsecured Enron creditors, which is composed primarily
of financial firms. Instead, the official committee proposed "a few
modest remedies" to protect Enron NA's assets, Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Luc Despins, an attorney representing the creditor committee,
refused comment after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's action could be the opening salvo in a larger conflict
between the creditors. Among other requests, the energy firms have
asked to have a trustee appointed to oversee Enron NA's operations.
If granted, that could significantly affect the way Stephen Cooper,
Enron's acting chief executive, attempts to restructure the company.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) released details
of a 1999 videotaped meeting with employees in which Enron executives
urged employees to invest all of their 401(k) retirement money in
Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   During an appearance before a House panel last week, Enron human
resources vice president Cindy Olson testified that the company
wanted to talk to employees about diversifying their investments, but
didn't want to cross a "fine line" by giving workers investment
advice.</TE>
<TE>   But the videotape shows a woman named "Cindy"--who appears to be
Olson--telling employees they should "absolutely" invest all their
401(k) money in Enron stock, Waxman said in a letter to Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., chair of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said former Enron president Jeffrey Skilling can be seen
nodding in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman noted that Olson, who could not be reached for comment,
sold over $1 million of Enron stock on Feb. 16, 2000--less than three
months after the meeting took place.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Thursday, Vanity Fair magazine asserted
that Enron's concealment of losses dated at least to 1987, far
earlier than previously disclosed, and was brought to the attention
of former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   In an article, the magazine said the concealment dated to a rogue,
fraudulent trading operation within a former Enron unit known as
Enron Oil Co., which led to losses of $185 million and the
imprisonment of the unit's former president, Louis Borget.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted with evidence of the fraud, which was turned up by
Enron internal investigators and the accounting firm Andersen in
1987, Lay rejected their advice to fire Borget and another executive,
Vanity Fair said, citing an unnamed former Enron auditor and other
sources.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine quoted former Enron accountant Jan Avery as saying
that she and other auditors were pushed to use accounting gimmickry
to cover up debts and losses. That practice with special Enron
partnerships finally exploded into scandal last fall and drove the
firm into bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Study Calls Biofood Safeguards Inadequate</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Current system could miss signs of
environmental harm, National Academy of Sciences says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government's system for regulating genetically engineered crops
is inadequate to prevent environmental damage from new types of
vaccine- and chemical-producing crops coming to market in the next
few years, according to a study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture should more rigorously review
genetically modified crops before approving them for commercial use
and monitor them more closely after approval, said the report by the
National Academy of Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has said consistently there is no evidence the
genetically modified corn and soybeans so widely planted in recent
years have harmed the environment.</LD>
<TE>   However, the report said, without "systematic monitoring, the lack
of evidence of damage is not necessarily lack of damage."</TE>
<TE>   Among examples of such plants, some corn is being tested that will
produce a protein that will serve as a vaccine against hepatitis B.
Another protein derived by moving chicken genes to corn could be used
as a chemical in labs.</TE>
<TE>   As plants with stacked genes and other multiple genetic
modifications hit the market in the years ahead, the USDA must more
carefully weigh the environmental risk and make more information
about these plants readily available to the public, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA needs to seek outside scientific peer review of crop
applications and advice on changes in regulatory policy, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   And it said the agency needs to more actively solicit public
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology companies now submit about 1,000 applications to the
USDA each year for review.</TE>
<TE>   They keep much of that information secret from the public by
classifying the material as business secrets, the report said--even
as the same data is made public in Europe and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA, which requested the study after critics accused it of
lax regulation, is supposed to ensure that hardier, gene-altered
crops don't develop into super-weeds or harm insects and other
animals.</TE>
<TE>   However, companies can field-test crops just by "notifying" the
USDA that the plant meets its guidelines on environmental effects.</TE>
<TE>   And once these crops are approved, they generally can be grown
anywhere in any amount farmers choose.</TE>
<TE>   Crops that produce their own pesticides are regulated more
stringently, because they are handled by the Environmental Protection
Agency under a different law.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gould, a North Carolina State University scientist who led
the study, said the problems it cited amounted to "small loopholes."</TE>
<TE>   "We are offering suggestions for a system that is functioning.
We're not condemning the system," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Administration,
which oversees the crops, said they have begun working to address
some of the weaknesses highlighted in the report.</TE>

been left out of a proposal to revive the telecommunications network
company, intends to file an alternative rescue plan today that would
keep investors in the firm and kick out many top executives.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual bid from the group, led by the Coburn &amp; Meredith
investment firm in Hartford, Conn., would raise about $1 billion
through the sale of warrants, sources familiar with the bid said.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers must persuade the Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that
sufficient demand exists for the warrants, which guarantee holders
the right to buy Global Crossing shares at a set price in the future.</LD>
<TE>   Coburn &amp; Meredith faces a quiet period until the filing, but a
grass-roots collection of individual investors joining the effort
made it clear that the company's pending plan to sell a 79% stake in
the company for $750 million is unacceptable. Creditors would jointly
own 21% and receive $300 million in return for forgiving about $12.4
billion of debt. Current shareholders would get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has $22.4 billion worth of assets, made up mainly
of the world's biggest network of undersea and terrestrial
fiber-optic cable for high-speed transmission.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a public company. They have no right to treat us like a
personal piggy bank. The shareholders own the company, although
[Chairman] Gary Winnick may act like he owns it," said Jay Province
of Charlottesville, Va. The 44-year-old Web developer said he
invested $25,000 in Global Crossing in September as part of a plan to
save for his two children's university education.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokesman John Schmidt said the company is not
aware of the shareholders' efforts but is obligated to consider other
offers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the company itself has a motion pending to allow it to
negotiate with potential bidders that might bring in more than the
existing joint offer from Singapore Technologies Telemedia and
Hutchison Whampoa, one of Hong Kong's biggest companies. Several
sources familiar with the bankruptcy filing say other bidders already
have surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   But Global's motion asks that any bids be at least $60 million
more than the existing offer to cover a $40-million break-up fee and
other costs associated with arranging the current deal, said John
Biedermann, a New York lawyer whose firm is the proposed counsel for
the committee of unsecured creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert E. Gerber, who is presiding over the
nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy, will hear the company's motion
March 7.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholders' bid is extremely unusual, according to several
independent experts. They doubted the plan would succeed, saying
bankruptcy law favors a company and its creditors and that few
investors are likely to bet more money on Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   "This company is very far gone. I don't see any ability to raise
equity capital," said Harry DeAngelo, professor of finance at the
University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Error Tops $113 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc. said it overstated revenue by as much as
$113million in the first nine months of 2001, more than the
$95million the biggest online home listing company had estimated.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, revenue was overstated by $39million to $45million, the
Westlake Village-based company said. Homestore.com originally said it
had $351million in revenue through the first nine months of 2001 and
$229million for all of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Homestore.com said last month it found advertising sales that
should have been accounted for as barter transactions because they
were related to purchases of goods and services by the company. The
discovery led to the ouster of Stuart Wolff, its chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   The company's shares last traded Feb. 12, closing at 72 cents. The
Nasdaq Stock Market, which had halted trading as it sought more
information, announced trading will resume today. The new estimate of
the amount by which revenue was overstated for 2001 ranges from
$104million to $113million, up from the company's' previous estimate
of $54million to $95million.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in the size of the overstatement in part reflects
sales of software and services that shouldn't have been included in
revenue, said DeLise Keim, a company spokeswoman. That amount, about
$7 million to $23 million, will be recorded as deferred revenue, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com, which has more than 90% of the home sale listings
on the Internet, manages the Realtor.com Web site for the National
Assn. of Realtors. Its biggest shareholder is New York-based Cendant
Corp., which has a 12% stake.</TE>

<HD>Nike Buys Surfwear Maker Hurley</HD>
<DH>Apparel: Purchase of Costa Mesa firm gives sneaker giant
one of industry's hottest brands and presents formidable challenge to
small rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a deal that is likely to send shockwaves through Southern
California's surfwear businesses, industry icon Bob Hurley has sold
his company in Costa Mesa to giant Nike Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of the sale were not disclosed. But in acquiring Hurley
International, Nike, which has been trying for years to break into
the burgeoning market for surf, skate and snowboard clothes, is
picking up one of the industry's hottest brands that last year did
about $70 million in business.</LD>
<LD>   Hurley, who is 46 and considered one of the titans in the surfwear
community, said in an interview Thursday that he decided to sell his
company to the Beaverton, Ore.-based sneaker giant to help him build
the brand and expand internationally. Nike's foray into the market
could present a formidable challenge to the hundreds of smaller youth
sportswear firms that have grown up around the beach communities of
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how this is going to play to the hard-core surf
crowd that Hurley targets," said Tony Cherbak, a partner at Deloitte
&amp; Touche accounting firm and an expert on the industry. Hurley said
he will remain as president of the Costa Mesa business, which he
founded in 1998 after splitting off from Billabong USA, a brand that
Hurley built into one of the biggest names in the casual youth
apparel business.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley said he expected no change in direction for Hurley
International, which employs about 150 people and will operate as a
subsidiary of Nike. It is "a monumental task" to try to build a
global brand, and linking with Nike will make that easier, he said.
"We thought it best to partner up with a global brand to get the
Hurley message out there."</TE>
<TE>   But word of the deal stunned industry insiders, who have fiercely
guarded the tight-knit community of hundreds of small companies that
have thrived in an anti-establishment culture.</TE>
<TE>   Jen Fair, manager of Beach Access in Costa Mesa, a surf and skate
clothing shop, said she expected a backlash among some surfers. "The
industry considers itself on being core [rooted in the sport]," she
said, "and Nike is a big corporation that stretches everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Fair said Hurley clothes are among her shop's biggest sellers and
have cool cachet, even though they're also sold at Nordstrom. Under
Nike's ownership, she said, Hurley products could start appearing at
department stores and other mass retailers. And if that happens, she
said, her shop might stock fewer Hurley products.</TE>
<TE>   But Tim Harmon, president of Pacific Sunwear of California Inc.,
said the partnership between Hurley and Nike should be "very strong"
and provide Hurley with more money to market the brand. He said
Hurley was the top-selling men's brand at his stores in December.</TE>
<TE>   For Nike, buying Hurley fits into the $9.5-billion athletic shoe
company's plans to diversify into other brands, said Tom Clarke,
president of Nike's new business ventures. Over the years, Nike and
other outsiders have had difficulty moving into surf and skate
apparel, because the local industry is cliquish and tends to close
ranks especially when a large corporation tries to tiptoe in.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Nike opened ACG (All Condition Gear) South in Irvine
for that purpose, but that office closed after just a month. After
that, the company gave seed money to Savier Inc., a start-up skate
shoe company in Oregon, which it now owns.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley, who opened Hurley's Surfboard in Costa Mesa more than 20
years ago, said he's not worried about what some might see as an
unusual union.</TE>
<TE>   "We think teenage kids are super smart," he said. "They're going
to decide if we're a relevant brand or not."</TE>

<HD>Panel Seeks Records on ImClone</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Drug makers are asked to turn over papers
about talks with the Erbitux maker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The House Energy and Commerce Committee is seeking records from Amgen
Inc., Pharmacia Corp. and five other drug makers on their discussions
with ImClone Systems Inc. about possible partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   The committee, along with the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, is investigating whether ImClone
misled investors about its cancer drug Erbitux. Letters also were
sent to Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Merck &amp; Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Chiron
Corp., and Abbott Laboratories.</LD>
<LD>   The committee previously requested records from ImClone and its
estranged marketing partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which acquired
marketing rights to Erbitux last fall in a $2-billion deal.</LD>
<TE>   ImClone stunned investors Dec.28 by disclosing that the  Food and
Drug Administration refused to consider its Erbitux application.
Shares of the New York-based company have plunged almost 70% since
the announcement. The shares fell $1.12 to $16.77 in Thursday's
trading on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the seven drug makers was "engaged in serious discussions"
with ImClone about forming a strategic partnership related to
Erbitux, said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and ranking Democrat John D. Dingell of
Michigan, in their letters seeking documents. When those discussions
took place wasn't clear.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone previously disclosed in a regulatory filing that during
the summer of 2000, it approached several pharmaceutical companies,
including Bristol, about a "strategic transaction." The unnamed
companies conducted due diligence, but no deal resulted.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen confirmed it looked seriously at Erbitux but decided not to
go forward. "There are a lot of decision points that make something a
good fit," said Amgen spokesman Jeff Richardson. "The science, the
price."</TE>
<TE>   Chiron also confirmed it looked at Erbitux, but noted that "such
discussions are common in biotechnology." Amgen and Chiron said they
would cooperate with the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining companies couldn't be reached. People in the
industry have speculated that Pharmacia was interested in Erbitux
because it markets the chemotherapy drug irinotecan, which ImClone
has combined with Erbitux in trials with colon cancer patients.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin and Dingell asked the drug makers for all internal audits,
investigations, reports and other records relating to ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, ImClone Chief Executive Samuel Waksal has paid back
almost $500,000 to the company after discovering he may have violated
a regulation designed to discourage insider trading. The CEO returned
the money to ImClone after making a series of trades with an exchange
fund, a Wall Street arrangement for corporate insiders who want to
diversify their stock holdings.</TE>

<HD>Tech Sector Woes Drag Stocks Lower</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Earlier Dow rally reverses course amid worries
about 2002 corporate profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 3.3% Thursday to its lowest level
in almost four months as investors, unswayed by positive economic
data, again dumped technology and telecom stocks.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials slid 1.1% as uncertainty about the strength of
this year's expected recovery of corporate profits dogged blue-chip
stocks as well.</LD>
<LD>   Intel was a drag on the key indexes, sliding $1.96 to $29.48 after
Banc of America analysts cut their earnings estimates for the largest
chip maker, citing higher inventory levels. Other hard-hit tech and
telecom stocks included Cisco Systems, BellSouth, AOL Time Warner and
Ciena.</LD>
<TE>   "The economic news is extremely encouraging, but it seems we've
got to see earnings come through before people get their confidence
back," said Rod Smyth, chief investment strategist at First Union
Securities in Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq's drop of 59.33 points to 1,716.24 sent the tech-heavy
index to its lowest close since Oct. 31. In the last six weeks,
Nasdaq has given back 54% of the big 636-point gain it racked up from
Sept. 21 through Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 106.49 points to
9,834.68, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 17.03
points, or 1.6%, to 1,080.95.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange and
almost 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Volume was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators
posted a better-than-expected climb in January, and other reports
also offered encouragement for the U.S. economy in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth said professional traders such as hedge fund managers, who
often sell stocks "short"--betting on a decline--have fueled recent
market volatility. Nasdaq closed at its low for the day. The Dow--up
88 points at its high--took a 195-point swing from its peak to its
close.</TE>
<TE>   "The professionals are jumping on whatever momentum they see,"
Smyth said. "But the [individual] investors are just kind of frozen.
They're not causing these moves."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the choppy market, prospects remain strong for overall
profit growth in the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter, said Joe Cooper,
research analyst at earnings tracker Thomson Financial/First Call in
Boston. He noted that negative profit guidance from companies and
downward earnings revisions from Wall Street analysts are off sharply
from last year's pace, indicating stability.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson Financial expects second-quarter S&amp;P 500 operating profits
to rise about 9% compared with the second quarter of 2001. That would
mark the first positive year-over-year comparison since the fourth
quarter of 2000. The issue facing investors may be the magnitude of
this year's profit recovery, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "Analysts are still projecting a moonshot," he said. Brokerage
analysts expect S&amp;P 500 profits to jump 17.3% in 2002, while Thomson
Financial forecasts only a 6% rise. Questions about credit quality
could hurt the financial sector, he said, where expectations are
highly optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, U.S. Treasury yields fell as skittish investors
fled to government debt. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased
to 4.85% from 4.89% Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Cisco slumped $1.58 to $15.11 after published reports that
executives held stakes in a partnership that benefited in the 1990s
from ties to the computer-networking equipment giant, raising the
issue of a potential conflict of interest. The company declined
comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Ciena dropped $1.10 to $7.60--a 12.6% loss--after slashing its
second-quarter revenue guidance, further pressuring the tech sector.
Ciena reported a first-quarter operating loss of $56.7 million, or 17
cents a share, compared with year-ago profit of $54.7 million, or 18
cents, as sales fell 54% to $162 million. Analysts expected a loss of
20 cents on sales of $164.6 million. The Amex networking index--which
includes Ciena and Cisco--dropped 5.9% as all 15 of its members were
down for the day.</TE>
<TE>   * IBM lost $2.93 to $96.38 as accounting worries continued to dog
the biggest computer company, whose stock is down 20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   * BellSouth lost $2.50 to $37.95 after cutting its 2002 profit
forecast because of slowing sales and currency devaluations in
Argentina and Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   * AOL Time Warner dropped $1.20 to $23 after a Wall Street Journal
report said Janus Capital has been a net seller of the shares even as
some of its mutual fund managers have praised the stock.</TE>
<TE>   * Newspaper stocks fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded its
outlook for the group. Tribune, publisher of The Los Angeles Times,
lost $1.68 to $41.84; New York Times fell $2.20 to $44.20.</TE>
<TE>   * Petco Animal Supplies raised $275.5 million in an initial public
stock offering, returning to public ownership less than 18 months
after being taken private in a leveraged buyout. San Diego-based
Petco, the second-largest pet supply chain, sold 14.5 million shares
at $19 each, in the middle of its planned range of $18 to $20. The
shares will begin trading today under the symbol PETC on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, Japan's Nikkei-225 rallied 4.7%, its biggest one-day
gain in nearly a year, as bargain hunters stepped into the battered
market. However, Japanese stocks were lower in early trading today.</TE>

<DH>Telecom: Audit says firm obscured $2 billion over three
years and should refund $349 million to customers. Company disputes
claims.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday accused SBC
Pacific Bell of hiding nearly $2 billion in revenue over three years
and called on the state's largest local phone company to refund $349
million to customers.</LD>
<LD>   Although one of the largest in state history, the refund
recommended in an independent audit is expected to be vigorously
contested by PacBell.</LD>
<LD>   "We disagree with the fundamental conclusion of this report that
we owe our customers $350million in refunds," said John Britton, a
spokesman for SBC PacBell, which recently changed its name to reflect
its ownership by San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc., the
nation's second-largest local phone company. "We'll work with the
commission, and where appropriate, we'll make corrections. But we're
confident that our accounting is consistent with CPUC requirements."</LD>
<TE>   As a regulated utility, PacBell must follow special accounting
requirements for its local phone business in California. The
irregularities alleged in the audit deal only with those special
requirements and do not pertain to the company's financial statements
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But the PUC's rules are important because they establish how much
the state's two largest phone companies, PacBell and Verizon
California, can charge customers.</TE>
<TE>   High levels of earnings were supposed to be shared with customers
in two of the three years audited.</TE>
<TE>   The report by Kansas-based Overland Consulting covered 1997, 1998
and 1999 and found that PacBell overstated expenses and assigned many
key phone company functions to SBC affiliates outside the PUC's
purview, making the company "harder to track and evaluate."</TE>
<TE>   "The transfer of functions out of the telephone company has the
potential to significantly reduce the control and authority the CPUC
has traditionally exercised over regulated telephone operations," the
report stated.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates said an increasingly complex telecommunications
landscape--in which companies operate dozens of businesses--makes it
more difficult to hold individual operating units accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "If the company is able to inflate costs, it can reduce the amount
of money it has to share with its customers," said Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San
Diego. "In the non-regulated world, that's called fraud."</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear from this report that ratepayers have been
robbed," said Regina Costa, telecommunications research director for
the Utility Reform Network, an advocacy group based in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The report comes at an awkward time for PacBell, which is lobbying
for state approval to let it enter the long-distance phone market in
California. In states where local phone companies are allowed to
provide long-distance service, the local carriers often are able to
edge out long-distance providers such as AT&amp;T Corp. That's because
local carriers can sell a suite of services when consumers call to
set up phone service.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, SBC last year signed up more than 1 million
customers in less than six months after it was allowed to sell long
distance alongside its local service in Texas. In California, PacBell
provides local phone service for more than 90% of residents.</TE>
<TE>   The findings in Thursday's audit echo a similar investigation of
Verizon California, the state's second-largest local phone company.
That audit, conducted last year, concluded that Verizon misreported
$112 million in "excessive profit" over three years and recommended
the entire amount be refunded to consumers. Verizon is disputing the
findings.</TE>
<TE>   In PacBell's case, auditors found that the company incorrectly
posted expenses, including income taxes, pension and retirement
costs, and the depreciation costs of its plants between 1997 and 1999
and "substantially understated" its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   If the report's estimates of PacBell's profit are correct, the
company must refund about $3 to an average consumer with a $45
monthly phone bill. Refunds would be higher for those with larger
bills.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates and industry analysts say any refund would be a long
time coming. Negotiations between the company and the state could
whittle down that amount, and the hearing process scheduled to
conclude in December could well be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   "This kicks off a process that will play itself out over many
months," said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry consultant in
Atlanta. "This is positioning. At the end of the day when the
negotiations are done, the number I'm sure will be a fraction of the
$350million, if anything at all."</TE>
<TE>   SBC last year reported more than $7.2 billion in profit on revenue
of $46 billion. SBC shares fell 55 cents to $36.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Delays PG&amp;E Earnings</HD>
<DH>RELATED STORY Accord: Regulator approves deal on bonds for
buying power. B8</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp. delayed announcing its earnings Thursday, citing
accounting foul-ups with off-the-books financial vehicles. The echoes
of Enron Corp. caused shares to tumble in early trading.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E said it thinks that the financial vehicles, called "synthetic
leases," used to keep three power plants and some
electricity-generating turbines off its books, may not have had
enough outside ownership under federal rules, which would require the
San Francisco utility holding company to amend its financial
statements back to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   However, PG&amp;E said, any reclassification would not have a
"material impact" on earnings, equity or the company's debt
agreements. The amendment would involve increasing assets and
liabilities by about $1 billion, PG&amp;E said, taking pains to point out
that its use of off-the-books financing was limited and was fully
disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Despite those assurances, PG&amp;E's stock slumped in early trading,
indicating Wall Street's anxiety over accounting issues in the
aftermath of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's stock dipped as low as $19.81 on Thursday morning on the
New York Stock Exchange but ended the day at $20.12, down 47 cents,
or 2.28%. Investors initially panicked but calmed down when the
extent of the problem appeared to be relatively small, said Jeffrey
Gildersleeve, an analyst with Argus Research Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Gildersleeve, who has a "sell" rating on the stock, didn't expect
the disclosure to harm PG&amp;E's prospects as its utility struggles to
emerge from bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, has proposed a reorganization
that has been challenged by state utility regulators. The parent
company and another subsidiary, National Energy Group, are not part
of the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was unfortunate in that the market is obviously very
jittery about accounting and corporate transparency," Gildersleeve
said. "On the other side, it wasn't something that they planned or
thought about. It was more of a 'whoops.'"</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E had planned to release its earnings and file its annual 10-K
report with the SEC before the market opened Thursday and to hold a
conference call with investors to discuss the results. But as the
firm and its auditors, Deloitte &amp; Touche, were going over the
documents Wednesday, they uncovered a "technical issue" related to
four synthetic leases, PG&amp;E spokesman Greg Pruett said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of holding routine monthly payments from the partnerships
in a special account, the proceeds were given to the participants,
primarily banks, Pruett said, declining to name the partners. That
may have accidentally reduced the ownership of outside investors
below the 3% necessary to keep the assets off PG&amp;E's balance sheet,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E decided to wait to announce its results so that the numbers
would be accurate and so that the earnings news release and the 10-K,
which more fully discloses assets and liabilities, could be put out
together, Pruett said. Enron was criticized by investors and analysts
for failing to release those documents together, a move seen as
attempting to cloud analysis of the energy trader's complex business.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always thought that it is far better to be excessive in
providing information to investors," and that practice has
intensified with the Enron-inspired skittishness, Pruett said. The
synthetic leases "were disclosed on a regular basis" and
credit-rating companies were informed about them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E expects to resolve the accounting questions quickly and issue
its 10-K, fourth-quarter and year 2001 earnings "in a fairly short
time frame," Pruett said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations commonly use synthetic leases to finance construction
so that they can enjoy the tax advantages but don't have to take
depreciation charges from the assets against their earnings.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's National Energy Group used the leases to finance the
$1.4-billion construction of a power plant in Connecticut, which is
nearing operation, and the La Paloma power plant that is being built
near Bakersfield.</TE>

<HD>Free Ad Time Very Limited, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Television: Groups face stiff competition to get their
public service announcements aired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nonprofit groups that depend upon public service announcements to
tell their stories are facing extreme competition for a severely
limited amount of donated air time on television, according to a
national study released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcast and cable television allocate 15 seconds per hour for
PSAs, and nearly half of that air time falls between midnight and 6
a.m., according to the report titled "Shouting to Be Heard." Only 9%
of time made available for PSAs falls during prime time, according to
the report.</LD>
<LD>   The study confirms what's long been known--growing demand for
television air time continues to dramatically outstrip the supply of
available air time.</LD>
<TE>   ''I don't know what policymakers will think when they see our
data," said Vicky Rideout, a vice president with the Menlo Park,
Calif.-based foundation. "Our hope is that media companies will look
at it and determine whether it accurately reflects the contributions
they want to make to society."</TE>
<TE>   Some broadcast industry players disagreed with key elements of the
report, which was released during a panel discussion in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Broadcasters, which estimates the value of
PSAs that ran on local television in 2001 at $1.8 billion, disputed
the determination that nearly half of PSAs run when most Americans
are asleep. "Our research has found a pretty even distribution of
PSAs throughout the various parts of the day," said NAB spokesman
Dennis Wharton.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based Ad Council, which produces spots on crime,
education, drunk driving and various health-related issues, said that
30% of its spots run during the middle of the night. Ad Council
President Peggy Conlon described the study's methodology as
"questionable," saying that the survey was too narrow in scope to
provide definitive findings.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the University of Indiana analyzed a week's worth
of programming on the four broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and
NBC), the Spanish-language Univision network and five cable networks
(CNN, ESPN, MTV, Nickelodeon and TNT).</TE>
<TE>   Researchers also polled public service directors at local
television stations who determine which PSAs get on the air.</TE>
<TE>   The study determined that networks dedicated an average of 17
seconds each hour for PSAs, including five seconds per hour during
prime time programming. Cable networks averaged seven seconds of PSAs
during an hour. In contrast, Univision averaged 48 seconds per hour
and MTV weighed in with 16 seconds per hour.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity between broadcast and cable is driven, industry
observers said, by the federal requirement that broadcast outlets
serve "the public interest, convenience and necessity." Broadcasters
aren't required to run PSAs, but television stations use them as one
measure of how they're serving the public interest, Wharton said.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters will probably not free up significant amounts of time
for additional PSAs, industry observers said.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Case Figure Not Questioned</HD>
<DH>RELATED STORY Rescue plan: Some shareholders have their own
proposal. C2</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The law firm that Global Crossing Ltd. asked to examine a
whistle-blower's allegations about the company's accounting methods
failed to interview the executive, the company's auditor or make sure
that its board knew about the issues.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations by the former finance executive are now being
investigated by both the FBI and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing's general counsel at the time, James Gorton, asked
the New York firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett last summer to
investigate the claims by then-Vice President Roy Olofson, who said
the telecommunications company was misleading its investors and
bankers.</LD>
<TE>   But Simpson Thacher didn't talk to Olofson, company auditor
Andersen or Global Crossing directors, instead relying largely on
executives who assured the law firm that the board and Andersen had
debated the issues already.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an accounting issue that the accountants had signed off
on and the board had fully discussed in meetings in the spring," said
Richard Beattie, chairman of Simpson Thacher's executive committee.
Beattie said the firm reviewed the board minutes and otherwise relied
on what Global Crossing executives told it. "I don't believe we did
anything wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson Thacher's actions, which are complicated by the firm's
close financial and personal ties to Global Crossing, in some ways
resemble those of Vinson &amp; Elkins, the Texas firm criticized for
investigating complaints about Enron Corp. deals that the law firm
had worked on.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Vinson &amp; Elkins at Enron, Simpson Thacher wasn't involved
in the fiber-optic capacity swaps that concerned Olofson. But the
multiple roles played by the big firm illustrate how the concerns
generated by Enron's bankruptcy are spreading beyond big corporations
and accounting firms to legal workers as well.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers are beginning to re-examine their conduct in the wake of
the Enron mess, and over time, the American Bar Assn. may change its
guidelines, said Donald Hilliker, former chair of the Bar's ethics
committee. "Law firms are often at the center of many of these
transactions."</TE>
<TE>   With the hindsight provided by the federal investigations, Global
Crossing's bankruptcy filing, and a board probe begun after the
letter was made public, legal experts said Simpson Thacher appears to
have erred in cutting short its inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't act like lawyers should act. It doesn't sound like
they did an adequate investigation," said legal ethicist Susan Koniak
of Boston University. "It seems like all they were able to do is give
some executives some cover, based on apparently nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Beattie said the law firm didn't have an obligation to contact the
board in part because Olofson's five-page letter hadn't accused the
CEO or the general counsel of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   But law professors said the seriousness of the allegations should
have prompted Simpson Thacher to determine on its own, or from
uninvolved parties, whether they were valid.</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly have a responsibility to understand what the
whistle-blower is alleging. And if they need another kind of expert
to do that, they should get one," said New York University law
professor Stephen Gillers.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing now says the board's audit committee is looking
into Olofson's claims. The company has said that Olofson was looking
for money with a threatened wrongful-termination suit and that the
accounting issues he raised were standard industry practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like something that should have gone to the board" at
once, said Hofstra University legal ethics specialist Monroe
Freedman. "I infer that that was very poor judgment" on Simpson
Thacher's part.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said Simpson Thacher also could have been influenced
by its close ties to Global Crossing, which included millions of
dollars in annual legal fees, the fact that Gorton and the general
counsel for subsidiary Asia Global Crossing Ltd. were both Simpson
Thacher alumni, and the fact that some Simpson Thacher partners owned
stock in Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Law firm employees could have such investments because Simpson
Thacher, like other firms, several years ago began allowing purchases
of client stock. Beattie said Thursday that some of the firm's
lawyers held Global Crossing stock, but none had more than $15,000
worth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's permissible to own an equity interest in your client, but
there could be situations in which the lawyer's equity interest would
make it difficult for the lawyer to give independent legal advice to
the company," Gillers said. Those situations are more likely when the
investment constitutes a substantial part of the lawyer's worth, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson Thacher is Global Crossing's primary outside law firm, and
it has advised the company on such deals as its $6.5-billion sale of
a Web site hosting subsidiary to Exodus Communications Inc. in the
fall of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Global Crossing and Asia Global Crossing, Simpson
Thacher represents or recently represented Global Crossing CEO Gary
Winnick, his Pacific Capital Group, ex-general counsel Gorton, and
current or former Global Crossing directors and officers David Lee,
William Adrillers and Barry Porter, according to Simpson Thacher's
application to represent Global Crossing during its bankruptcy
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   And if Global Crossing's board should eventually decide that it
was so poorly served by Simpson Thacher that it has grounds for a
malpractice suit, it will have one more hurdle. Global Crossing's
current acting general counsel, Rhett Brandon, is a full-time partner
at Simpson Thacher.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Trade Gap Shrinks 8%; State Exports Plunge</HD>
<DH>Commerce: The narrower deficit does not mean good news for
nation's exporters, which are being hit by a strong dollar, weak
overseas economies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 8% in 2001, its first improvement
in six years, as recession-wary consumers trimmed their purchases of
imported goods, more than offsetting a drop in foreign demand for
U.S. products, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But the improvement in the trade gap didn't translate into good
news for the nation's export sector, which is being pummeled by a
strong dollar and weak overseas economies.</LD>
<LD>   California exports plunged by 26% in the fourth quarter of 2001
compared with the same period in 2000, capping a brutal year for the
state's high-tech manufacturers, whose products account for nearly
half of the state's exported goods. Exports of computers and
electronic products tumbled from a record $16.6 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2000 to $11.2 billion in the final quarter of 2001--a drop
of 33%.</LD>
<TE>   Government figures showed that the U.S. trade gap for goods and
services totaled $346.3 billion in 2001. That follows a record trade
deficit in 2000, when the imbalance hit an all-time high of $375.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the narrowing of the trade gap probably will result in a
higher 2001 U.S. gross national product than previously projected,
some economists cautioned against interpreting it as a sign of
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had come about because of an increase in exports, that
would be solid news," said Rajeev Dhawan, director of Georgia State
University's Economic Forecasting Center. "This is a sign of weakness
... because it's coming entirely from reduced consumption of
imports."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the overall decline in the goods and services deficit,
America's trade gap with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada last year
hit record levels of $30 billion and $53.3 billion, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the trade deficit with Japan, mired in its third
recession in a decade, shrank to $69 billion, the lowest level since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, China retained its crown as the country with the
largest trade imbalance with the United States, a title it seized
from Japan in 2000. America bought $83 billion more in goods and
services from China last year than it was able to sell to the Asian
giant.</TE>
<TE>   California, the nation's largest exporting state, saw its overall
exports decline nearly 11% last year to $106.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The major culprit was the state's information technology sector,
which has been walloped by the collapse in business investment.
Exports of computers and electronic products totaled $50.3 billion in
2001, an 18% decline from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Although overall exports declined every quarter in 2001, analysts
said the steep fourth-quarter drop reflects lingering fallout from
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and record inventory liquidation in
the final quarter of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another reflection of the high-tech slump," said Ted
Gibson, an economic consultant and former chief economist with the
California Department of Finance. "I don't think the first quarter
[of 2002] is going to be much better."</TE>
<TE>   He and others say California exporters, like those in the rest of
the country, are facing a double whammy of a weak global economy and
a strong dollar.</TE>
<TE>   That's bad news for California's manufacturing sector, the
nation's largest, which is highly dependent on foreign sales. The
National Assn. of Manufacturers estimates that nearly 25% of the more
than 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost in the last year and
half can be attributed to the steep decline in U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   NAM attributed much of the decline to the sharp rise in the value
of the dollar, which makes U.S. goods more expensive and, thus, less
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   For the month of December, California's exports totaled $7.9
billion. That was down just slightly from November's $8 billion. But
it represented a 29% plunge from December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento trade analyst Jock O'Connell had been expecting a
better December performance, making him leery about the prospects of
a rebound any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we'll see a substantial recovery much before the
summer," he said. "I'm hoping we've seen the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing
Group, said members of his organization, which include some of the
biggest high-tech manufacturers in the Bay Area, are expressing
"cautious optimism" about the second half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some smaller high-tech players are downright bullish
about their overseas prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Ramdev Regulapati, chief executive of Milpitas, Calif.-based
Mobile Web Surf, expects sales of his fledgling firm to grow
fifteenfold this year, with nearly three-quarters of that coming from
customers in Asia and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Regulapati, whose company makes data exchange servers for mobile
devices, said the unfolding "wireless revolution" represents a
substantial opportunity for his firm and others in California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the next big thing," Regulapati said. "We don't see any
problem in expanding our revenue and getting customers outside the
U.S."</TE>

<HD>FTC Says Wade Cook Still Misleading Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Wade Cook Financial Corp. was accused of failing to refund millions
of dollars to investors who attended its stock trading seminars, as
required by a 2000 settlement with U.S. regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission contends that Wade Cook and his
Seattle-based company continue to make unsubstantiated claims of the
returns that investors can reap with the trading strategies
recommended during his "Wall Street Workshop" seminars.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC sought civil contempt citations Wednesday against Cook and
his company for failing to obey a 2000 consent order to stop making
false and unsubstantiated claims and to pay refunds to customers who
failed to recoup their seminar tuition from stock trades.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been serious consumer injury in this case, and that
injury must be addressed by the defendants," J. Howard Beales III,
chief of the FTC's consumer protection staff, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Wade Cook settled charges by the FTC and 13 states that
the company made false claims that investors could earn a 20% monthly
return on their investments by following his stock trading
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Wade Cook Financial were up 1 cent to 19 cents in over-
the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 50,000 customers who paid $3,000 to $5,000 to attend
the two-day seminars were covered by the settlement. As of Jan. 18,
the company had mailed refunds to 132 customers, said FTC lawyer
Eleanor Durham.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC also asked a judge in Seattle to order Cook and his firm
to place $5 million in a fund to be distributed to customers.</TE>
<TE>   There was no comment from the company.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Endocare Inc., an Irvine maker of surgical devices, said Thursday it
will acquire closely held Timm Medical Technologies Inc. for $34.8
million in cash and stock to expand its urology business and add to
its national sales division.</LD>
<LD>   Endocare will pay $11 million in cash and 1.62 million shares of
Endocare common stock, valued at $23.8 million at Thursday's close,
said Len Hall, a spokesman for Endocare. The stock closed at $14.69,
up 72 cents, on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   The combined company will offer products to diagnose and treat
prostate cancer, urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, bladder
cancer and other illnesses. Endocare expects Timm to generate annual
revenue of $10 million to $12 million.</LD>
<TE>   Timm Medical, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., distributes urological
products and devices. Its sales and marketing group, with more than
50 people, serves about 4,000 urologists. The transaction is expected
to be completed in March.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Coco's and Carrows restaurant chains, which have been
operating under bankruptcy protection for the past year, has agreed
to sell the Irvine restaurants for up to $38 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Advantica Restaurant Group Inc. said in a regulatory filing that a
group of bondholders plans to buy FRD Acquisition Co., an Advantica
subsidiary and operator of Coco's and Carrows. FRD filed for
bankruptcy after skipping a $9.8-million payment on $167.6 million in
debt securities.</TE>
<TE>   If the transaction is approved by bankruptcy court, the buyers,
who were not identified, would have 120 days to come up with the
funds, said Advantica spokeswoman Debbie Atkins. Advantica had tried
to find a buyer for Coco's and Carrows for two years so it could
focus on its Denny's chain.</TE>

<HD>Aetna Posts Fourth Straight Loss</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The health insurer's results for fourth quarter
are worse than expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc. continued to pay a high price for its status as the
nation's largest health insurer as it announced Thursday a
fourth-quarter loss--its fourth straight quarter of red ink--that was
worse than Wall Street analysts had expected.</LD>
<LD>   The 148-year-old Hartford, Conn.-based company reported an
operating loss of $84.6 million or 59 cents a share in the quarter,
excluding charges related to layoffs and a restructuring announced in
December. Aetna is trying to become a smaller, more profitable
company after several costly years of enrollment growth and
acquisitions that made it the biggest insurer.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was in sharp contrast to one year ago when Aetna posted a
profit of $28.7 million, or 20 cents a share. Its per share loss was
deeper than the worst anticipated by analysts, which ranged from
forecasts of 28 cents to 56 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter was $6.04 billion, down 8.4% from
$6.6billion in the same quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna's top officials expressed optimism for the near future. "We
have a smaller book of business and a more favorable economic
outlook. We now enter 2002 positioned for profitability," said Aetna
Chairman and President John W. Roe.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial plunge when the New York Stock Exchange opened
Thursday, Aetna's stock rallied to close up $1.62 at $33.50 for a
gain of more than 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the company that had an enrollment of 19.5 million insured in
January 2000, has perhaps already fallen from the top spot. Aetna
announced that it had trimmed membership to 15.6 million in January
and was pointing to enrollment cuts down to between 14.5million and
15 million by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, it seems to have fallen below the current No. 2
in enrollment, UnitedHealth Group. That company had 16.5million
members at the end of 2001, according to the publication Managed Care
Week.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna is "a big ship and it's a tough one to turn," said Bear
Stearns analyst John Rex. He and other analysts agreed that Aetna's
problems are considerable and won't be easy to fix.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus is that the company emphasized enrollment growth
over profitability for too long, and also was slow to reduce its
reliance on the traditional HMO model, when smaller and quicker
competitors were rolling out a broad range of medical care products
and turning away from pure HMOs. The traditional HMO model involved
fixed payments per patient to doctors and hospitals, regardless of
how much care they needed. That is being supplanted by more of a
shared risk, fee-for-service model with higher payments.</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar analyst Tom Goetzinger, said "Most managed-care
companies reported strong fourth quarters. Aetna did not....Worse
still, the excellent results of other providers like UnitedHealth
Group and WellPoint Health Networks position those firms to take
Aetna's more profitable members."</TE>
<TE>   Most health insurers, according to Kirby Bosley, a principal in
the Los Angeles office of William M. Mercer, "are working very hard
to diversify their [coverage] portfolios and moving away from
traditional HMO offerings."</TE>

<HD>Computer Associates Taps Bank Credit Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Computer Associates International Inc., which was forced to cancel a
$1-billion debt sale, said Thursday that it has tapped a bank credit
line as its short-term financing costs soared.</LD>
<LD>   The company, whose shares have plunged 45% this month, has
borrowed $1.4 billion of $3 billion in credit lines arranged by
Credit Suisse First Boston, said Ira Zar, Computer Associates' chief
financial officer. The money was used to pay back other debt, Zar
said.</LD>
<LD>   Computer Associates is the third company in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 Index to turn to bank financing as investor concerns that
businesses' accounting practices have overstated profit. Tyco
International Ltd. and Qwest Communications International Inc.
stopped selling commercial paper as investors demanded higher yields
and shorter terms.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating how Computer Associates recorded sales of software and
maintenance fees, Newsday and the New York Times reported.</TE>
<TE>   The software maker's shares fell $2.01, or 9.6%, to $18.90 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The Islandia, N.Y.-based company canceled its bond sale after
Moody's Investors Service said it was considering lowering the firm's
credit rating. Moody's review crimped the company's short-term
financing because fewer investors can buy commercial paper from a
company that may be downgraded soon.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Associates said it hasn't drawn on its credit lines to
pay down its commercial paper obligations.</TE>

<LD>   San Diego (14-11, 6-6) at Pepperdine (18-7, 11-1), 7:30, Fox
Sports Net, KPLS (830)--The Waves may have the disappointment of
losing Saturday's West Coast Conference showdown at Gonzaga, but they
can still clinch a tie for the regular-season title with two
victories this week. Pepperdine has won six of the last seven
meetings with the Toreros, including a 96-91 double-overtime victory
at San Diego on Jan. 26. Center Cedric Suitt had a school-record 10
blocked shots in that game. The Toreros are battling with San
Francisco and Santa Clara for the No. 3 spot in the conference
tournament next week.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Stephens</LD>
<TE>   Santa Clara (12-13, 7-5) at Loyola Marymount (9-17, 2-10), 7,
KXLU-FM (88.9)--Loyola is trying to end a losing streak that reached
nine games Saturday with an 83-79 overtime loss at Portland. Kent
Dennis was a bright spot for the Lions, scoring 21 points. Santa
Clara is trying to secure third place in the West Coast Conference.
The Broncos are coming off victories against San Francisco and St.
Mary's. Steve Ross is averaging 15.8 points a game for Santa Clara.</TE>

<TE>   No. 2 Stanford (26-1, 16-0) at USC (14-11, 10-6), 7, KMPC
(1540)--Fourth place may be the Trojans' Pacific 10 fate. They could
finish in a tie for second with Arizona State if they win today and
Sunday against California, and Washington and Arizona State lose
their final games. But Arizona State holds the tiebreaker over USC,
meaning the Sun Devils would be seeded second and the Trojans third
in the Pac-10 tournament. And if the Trojans don't win at all this
weekend, they could end up tied for sixth.</TE>
<TE>   California (7-18, 2-14) at UCLA (7-18, 3-13), 7, KACD (850), KEWS
(1350)--This may be the final week of conference play, but it appears
the eighth-place Bruins and ninth-place Bears have a first-round date
in the Pac-10 tournament next week.</TE>

<LD>A hot dog cost Indiana State a basketball game this week. The
Sycamores were leading Drake, 60-59, with 19 seconds to play Tuesday
night when the ball went out of bounds and officials gave possession
to the Bulldogs.</LD>
<LD>   Angered by the call, Indiana State fan William Butwin tossed his
dinner onto the Hulman Center court and was promptly ejected, making
it a not-so-free throw.</LD>
<LD>   A subsequent crowd-control technical foul against the home team's
fans allowed Drake to tie the game and eventually win it, 62-60.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dropping from No. 1 didn't sit well with Duke captains Mike Dunleavy
and Jason Williams.</LD>
<LD>   So they did something about it Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Dunleavy scored a career-high 30 points, and Williams had 26 as
the No. 3 Blue Devils got back in sync after their second loss of the
season by rolling over No. 20 Wake Forest, 90-61, at Winston Salem,
N.C.</LD>
<TE>   The Blue Devils (24-2, 12-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) shot
63% to remain on the heels of conference-leading Maryland, which
defeated Duke by 14 points Sunday to end its winning streak at 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize we're still getting better and you could see tonight
we're still taking steps and becoming the team we know we can be,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy was 11 for 15 from the field. His previous best was 27
points earlier this season at North Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   Duke was a miserable seven for 33 from three-point range against
No. 2 Maryland, but was 12 for 23 this time as Dunleavy and Williams
combined to go 10 for 17.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest (18-9, 8-5) remained in third place in the ACC.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons came in ranked No. 8 in the nation in scoring,
but shot only 33% and turned the ball over a season-high 21 times.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Pittsburgh 78, Rutgers 59--Donatas Zavackas scored 19
points and the Panthers (23-4, 11-3 in the Big East) shot 70% in the
second half to defeat the Scarlet Knights (17-9, 7-6) at Pittsburgh
to win their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Brandin Knight had 13 points and eight assists for Pittsburgh,
which has won eight of nine and is having its best season since the
1973-74 team was 25-4.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse 73, Seton Hall 71--Preston Shumpert scored 17 points and
assisted on a game-clinching layup as the Orangemen (20-7, 9-4 in the
Big East) held off the Pirates (12-14, 5-8) at East Rutherford, N.J.,
giving Coach Jim Boeheim a 20-win season for the 24th time in 26
years.</TE>
<TE>   DeShaun Williams had 18 points and Kueth Duany scored all 14 of
his points in the first half before breaking his nose in a
second-half scramble.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 74, Minnesota 55--Adam Ballinger had 20 points and
nine rebounds as the Spartans (16-10, 7-6 in the Big Ten) defeated
the Gophers (14-10, 7-6) at East Lansing, Mich., in a matchup of
teams competing for an NCAA tournament bid.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Tech 66, Fresno State 63--Gerrod Henderson capped a
game-high 28-point effort with a three-pointer in the final seconds
to lift the Techsters (17-8, 11-4 in the Western Athletic) to a
victory over the Bulldogs (16-12, 7-8) at Ruston, La.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Feel the Pain While Losing to Magic</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Maggette might go on injured list today.
Miles, Richardson also hurting after 119-102 defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette, frustrated and hurt, pounded his right hand on the
scorer's table during the Clippers' 119-102 loss Thursday to the
Orlando Magic and made matters considerably worse.</LD>
<LD>   Already suffering from a mild concussion and a nagging knee
injury, Maggette gave himself a dislocated right pinky with his anger
over a referee's call. He could be placed on the injured list today,
meaning he could be sidelined for at least five games.</LD>
<LD>   "Corey's probably going to be out for quite a while," Clipper
Coach Alvin Gentry said when asked about Maggette's status.</LD>
<TE>   And the hits kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles had muscle spasms in his right side, which were
brought on by a sprained right shoulder he suffered against the
Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Miles grimaced from almost the moment he entered the game until
Gentry sent him to the locker room with the game out of reach to
start the fourth quarter. His status was termed questionable for
Saturday's game against the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   And there was more.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson felt a tweak in his right hamstring taking a
garbage-time jump shot. He was taken out and did not return. He said
he would be "all right" for Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Elton Brand played gamely despite a stretched tendon in
his right ring finger. One night after sitting out the Clippers'
victory over the Miami Heat, Brand had 19 points and 15 rebounds
against Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating, especially at this time of year, when we're
fighting for a playoff spot," Gentry said of the injuries. "You've
just got to deal with it. It's OK when it's one or two injuries here
or there, but somehow we're now talking about five or six guys and
all of them are key guys. We're running out of guys.</TE>
<TE>   "And our best player is back in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   That would be versatile swingman Lamar Odom, sidelined by sprains
to his right wrist and ankle. He is expected to be out several more
weeks. Maggette has been starting for Odom at small forward, but it's
uncertain what Gentry will do next.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic overwhelmed the Clippers from the start. Orlando swept
the Clippers up in a high-tempo game and faltered only slightly in
the second quarter, when a double-digit lead slipped to only 48-44.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers committed turnovers on three of their next five
possessions and the Magic took off again. Orlando led by as many as
27 points in the second half, turning the game into a runaway before
14,143 fans at TD Waterhouse Centre.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady scored 22 points, Darrell Armstrong had 20 and Mike
Miller 19 for the Magic. McGrady, who had 47 points in the Magic's
loss Dec. 10 to the Clippers at Staples Center, also had seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando made 10 of 26 three-point baskets (38.5%) and had 21
offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing about this team is that if we're going to be in
this playoff race, then we have to be more consistent," Gentry said
of the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't play solid defense one night and give up 119 the next."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were always a step behind and never in contention
after their brief run in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the Clippers trailed, 58-46. Soon enough, their
deficit reached 78-51.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, Gentry removed his starters, leaving only point guard
Jeff McInnis on the floor for the final, meaningless moments. Backup
Keyon Dooling continues his slow recovery from a sprained left ankle,
suffered Nov. 14, and has played limited minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "More bad news, more bad news," Brand said afterward. "But we have
to continue to fight. It seems like we're going to have to will our
way into the playoffs."</TE>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The NBA's trading deadline passed Thursday afternoon and, as
expected, the Clippers did not make a move. Others did, but the
Clippers decided against trading for trading's sake.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be ridiculous for us to trade our seventh man for
someone else's seventh man," Coach Alvin Gentry said before the 3
p.m. PST deadline came and went. "Why trade any of our starters
unless it's for somebody else's All-Star? It's important to keep our
team together and build on what we have."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers would have preferred to have played a slower tempo
than they did in Thursday's loss to the Orlando Magic.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of passing the ball inside to power forward Elton Brand,
they settled for quick jump shots from the outside, however. The
Magic excelled in a fast-paced game, racing to a lead that grew to as
many as 27 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "Orlando is just like us in that they're really tough at home,"
guard Eric Piatkowski said. "They are more up-tempo here and get out
on the break. They play with a lot of energy and confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry put it this way: "They seduced us into shooting quick
shots. If they've got Pat Garrity on Elton Brand, then we've got to
pound it inside and we didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   One night after holding the Miami Heat to 71 points, the Clippers
gave up that total to the Magic less than four minutes into the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' defensive effort against Miami was their best this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have given up 119 points two other times this season.</TE>

<HD>Kids Are Just All Right, Garcia Is a Bit Better</HD>
<DH>Golf: He edges Howell III in an unimpressive meeting of
22-year-olds on second day of match-play event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Those weren't bunkers, those were sandboxes, which could mean only
one thing. Yes, it was Kids Day at the Accenture Match Play
Championship, where 22-year-old Sergio Garcia stared straight into
the eyes of 22-year-old Charles Howell III and managed to defeat his
elder of seven months.</LD>
<LD>   Milk and cookies all around.</LD>
<LD>   The precocious Garcia is full of swagger, and as we have come to
know, also very full of waggle, but he's definitely a load at this
match-play business. Garcia's pre-shot routine may be to grip and
regrip as if he is wringing out a pair of socks, but you have to say
it's downright effective.</LD>
<TE>   "I mean, to win these kinds of tournaments, you have to play well,
but you have to be a little lucky," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't even matter that Garcia's victory march on the back nine
Thursday amounted to one birdie, three bogeys, five pars and a few
dozen regrips. No, what mattered was that Garcia pulled out a 1-up
victory over Howell on another day of so-called upsets at the
$5.5-million crapshoot at La Costa.</TE>
<TE>   After two days, only four of the top-20 ranked players are still
around with fourth-seeded Garcia chief among them. The others are
sixth-seeded David Toms, 14th-seeded Jim Furyk and 17th-seeded Bob
Estes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, busy making their travel plans by sundown were No. 5
Ernie Els, No. 7 Retief Goosen, No. 8 Davis Love III, No. 9 Vijay
Singh and No. 10 Chris DiMarco.</TE>
<TE>   Toms didn't exactly take the easy way out in his match against
Rocco Mediate, holding on for a 1-up decision. But the fact that he's
still around while a bunch of other guys ranked in the top 10 aren't,
well, Toms says that's not so surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just guys are so even," he said. "Obviously, you have a
handful of really top players, but if they are a little bit off, they
are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Still around are Tom Lehman, who posted a 1-up victory over Els,
and Jose Maria Olazabal, who birdied the last hole for a 1-up victory
over Retief Goosen. Paul Azinger had a big lead, but struggled to get
past Love, 1-up. Azinger will play Niclas Fasth, who ousted Singh, 3
and 2. Factor in Mark Calcavecchia's 2-and-1 victory over DiMarco and
you can see that the shelf is all but bare of top-10 players.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are there will be many additional opportunities for Garcia
and Howell to run into each other on the golf course, so it would
probably be a good idea not to make too much of their first
match-play competition. Neither played that great--Howell had five
birdies and five bogeys and Garcia had three birdies and three
bogeys--but that's not why they drew the largest gallery of the day
... a gallery that included Garcia's friend, tennis pro Martina
Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   It was expected to be great theater, or at least a preview of
great theater, and there is no rain check for the fact that it didn't
really work out that way. Howell was too busy trying to steer his
ball straight instead of bouncing it off trees or hitting it off cart
paths as he spent too much time doing.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that their matchup might be of fairly high interest to
the golfing public clearly was not lost on Howell.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I just lost, so it's hard for me to say, but it definitely
was fun," Howell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We both [understood]. We both wanted to beat each other. The
thing is, neither one of us played our best. It was just one of those
things."</TE>
<TE>   Howell said he didn't even mind the number of grips and regrips he
noticed in Garcia's pre-shot routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's his little thing, I guess," Howell said. "I certainly wasn't
surprised by it. I counted a few, just for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Next for Toms is Steve Flesch, but the PGA champion said he didn't
think much of his victory over Mediate because neither played very
well.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you would call it a pillow fight," Toms said. "It didn't
look like either one of us wanted to win."</TE>
<TE>   Olazabal and Calcavecchia meet today with the winner facing either
John Cook or Brad Faxon. The Toms-Flesch winner would play either
Kevin Sutherland or Furyk. Lehman will play Matt Gogel today and the
winner draws either Garcia or Scott McCarron. The Azinger-Fasth
winner meets either Estes or Nick Price.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia allowed himself a moment to assess his chances with only 16
players left out of the original 64.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the big guys aren't there, but you've still got to
realize that all of the other guys who are playing and [the players]
who beat the big guys, they are all good players. And they beat them
playing well."</TE>
<TE>   All right, big guys gone. Players who beat big guys good. Players
playing well ... looks like everything's in order for another day of
upsets.</TE>

<DH>With Sheffield Out of the Picture, Dodger Outfielder in a
Position to Become Club's Undisputed Leader</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Shawn Green confronted Gary Sheffield in a tension-filled dugout last
season demanding an explanation.</LD>
<LD>   Having overheard Sheffield make critical comments about his effort
on a play in a game against the San Diego Padres at Qualcomm Stadium,
Green was finally at a breaking point.</LD>
<LD>   As the rest of the Dodgers sat transfixed, fearing their top
players would fight, Green motioned toward Sheffield and asked, "Do
we have a problem?"</LD>
<TE>   But Sheffield backed down, several witnesses said, telling Green
that everything was fine and declining to repeat what he had said.
The usually reserved Green had drawn a line in the sand and his
teammates, fed up with Sheffield's antics, were impressed.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the incident have come to light recently, now that
Sheffield has been traded. Not as a shot against a now-former Dodger
who wore out his welcome, but as evidence that the Dodgers hope Green
is ready to be a commanding presence on and off the field.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers need Green to step up and assume more responsibility
in the batting order and clubhouse, continuing his evolution into
becoming the club's undisputed leader. Great things are expected of
the slugging right fielder after he established a franchise record
with 49 home runs in 2001, and the Dodgers are confident they have
backed the right guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any hesitation in him in terms of assuming that role,
and I think he started to assume some of that role last year," Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans said while watching fielding practice
Thursday at Dodgertown. "For me, what we've seen early in this camp
is a guy who appears to be a lot more comfortable in that role.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 29 years old, it's his third year with the team, and it
takes a while for a guy to feel you're to the point where you can say
and do some of the things you have to do as a leader. You've seen a
difference in him this year, very quietly, that indicates to me that
he's aware he has to turn it up another notch."</TE>
<TE>   Green said he's ready for the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that my role has changed over the last couple of
years," said Green, who has been slowed in spring training by a mild
case of tendinitis in his left (throwing) shoulder. "My first year, I
didn't want to say a lot. I wanted to be the new guy and leave it at
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, after having a tough first season, I was focused on
getting back to where I wanted to be. Now, I'm at the point where the
team has changed so much, and I've been here for a little while, I
feel like it's important for me to become one of the leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger officials were hoping Green would become the club's
franchise player when they brought him to the team in a four-player
November 1999 trade with the Toronto Blue Jays and signed him to a
six-year, $84-million contract that made him the second highest-paid
player in club history. They were banking that Green would help them
win a playoff game for the first time since 1988, and lessen fans'
anger about their earlier trade of Mike Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   However, the first year didn't go according to script.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who attended Tustin High, struggled under the weight of
returning home and the organization's expectations. He batted .269
with 24 home runs, 44 doubles, 99 runs batted in, 98 runs and 24
stolen bases in 29 attempts. Not bad numbers--but not good enough for
someone being paid an average of $14 million per season.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being the left-handed complement to the right-handed
Sheffield, Green was considered one of the main reasons the Dodgers
flopped again. After acknowledging that his "swing got all messed up"
because he tried too hard to hit homers, Green decided to "get back
to basics and just drive the ball" last season.</TE>
<TE>   The change produced one of the best seasons in Dodger history.
Green broke the team record of 43 homers that had been shared by
Sheffield and Hall of Famer Duke Snider. He also batted .297, led the
club with 125 RBIs, 121 runs and had 31 doubles with 20 stolen bases
in 24 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "The acclimation period is over for him, as far as the adjustment
that had to be made in going from the American to the National
leagues, and also coming home to the place where he grew up," Manager
Jim Tracy said. "He's jumped all those hurdles."</TE>
<TE>   Players have noticed positive changes in Green, who has been more
outspoken about team issues since Sheffield's demand for a contract
extension almost tore apart the Dodgers last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Quotes attributed to Sheffield in a national baseball publication
blasted the Dodgers for giving ridiculous contracts to, among others,
Green, pitcher Darren Dreifort and first baseman Eric Karros. Green
has repeatedly declined to comment about the article, but sources
said he felt betrayed by Sheffield, who encouraged team officials to
bring Green to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Green made his feelings known to Sheffield in closed-door meetings
after the All-Star outfielder arrived late to Dodgertown, sources
said. The transformation had begun.</TE>
<TE>   "No question, he's definitely our main guy," second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "He's a special individual; we're going to have to
run with him."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers also know Green can't do it alone.</TE>
<TE>   "With the year he had last year, he should be coming in here with
a very confident attitude," Karros said. "Whatever is thrown his way,
I'm sure he'll be able to handle it, but you're going to win as a
group.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy isn't going to carry you and one guy isn't going to lose
it for you. Everybody has to go out and perform at a level that
people expect. That goes for the manager to the last guy on the
roster."</TE>
<TE>   Green is one of many players pleased that Sheffield is no longer
on the roster. The Dodgers want players who want to be Dodgers, and
Sheffield seemingly wanted to work almost anywhere but Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely feel like this team had an issue that doesn't need
to be dealt with anymore because he ... it was obvious he wasn't
happy here," Green said. "He made it known, so there was an issue.
Now, everyone here wants to be here and is happy to be on the
Dodgers. That pretty much solves the problem right there."</TE>

<HD>Unlike Bryant, He Has It Covered</HD>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>He is only 17, a junior at St. Vincent-St. Mary High in Akron, Ohio.
But LeBron James has already made it to the cover of Sports
Illustrated and is poised to jump straight to the pros.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant can relate. He made the leap from preps to pros. But
even he was never on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a high school
junior. If he had been?</LD>
<LD>   "I never would have gone to class," Bryant said.</LD>
<TE>   How does he think James would fare in the NBA?</TE>
<TE>   "If he is as good as they say he is," Bryant said, "he'll still
have to improve his game. And if he is not as good as they say he is,
he'll have to improve even more."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant wouldn't pass judgment on whether James should skip
college.</TE>
<TE>   "Do what you want to do," he said. "But if you come to the NBA,
you have to sacrifice a lot. It may not be a business for you, but
it's a business for them. And they are paying you millions of
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Does Bryant have any regrets about his own move to the pros at the
expense of spending a few years experiencing college?</TE>
<TE>   "What better experience is there than the NBA?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who heatedly protested Tuesday when the referees ruled
that what would have been a game-winning basket against Boston did
not beat the buzzer, grudgingly admitted after viewing a videotape
that the officials were right--that the ball was still on at least
one fingertip when the clock hit 0:00.</TE>
<TE>   "They guessed a good call," Bryant said, "because there is no way
they could know that for sure."</TE>

<HD>Flaky Lakers Get Win</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. is outrebounded by 21 and outplayed
much of the night, but still manages to beat Cavaliers, 104-97.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>As he came out to discuss Thursday night's game at Gund Arena, Phil
Jackson asked a reporter if it was snowing outside.</LD>
<LD>   It was, he was told.</LD>
<LD>   "It was also pretty deep on the court tonight the way we
floundered around," the Laker coach said.</LD>
<TE>   That they did. Outrebounded, 51-30, and guilty of a
less-than-artistic effort for much of the night, the Lakers
nevertheless managed to pound out a 104-97 victory over the Cleveland
Cavaliers in front of a sellout crowd of 20,562.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Harper, the former Laker who lives in the area and was a
spectator Thursday, called the Laker performance "lethargic."</TE>
<TE>   He got no argument from his former coach.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably the best analysis," Jackson said</TE>
<TE>   "How we managed to win and keep the tempo in our favor," Laker
guard Kobe Bryant said, "I don't understand. I'll have to look at the
tapes."</TE>
<TE>   What he'll see is a lot of himself and Shaquille O'Neal putting
the ball through the basket.</TE>
<TE>   When you have two of the best scorers in the league, and they
account for 61% of your points, you can overcome a little lethargy.
Bryant scored 32 points and O'Neal 31 as the Lakers opened a
five-game trip by breaking their three-game losing streak, the
longest they've had in the Jackson era.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers improved to 36-16 despite the fact O'Neal had only four
rebounds, including one in 19 minutes in the second half. And despite
the fact the Lakers were beaten on the offensive boards, 15-8. And
despite the fact Bryant converted only six of 11 free-throw attempts.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the Lakers had only five turnovers after
committing 21 in their previous game against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "What you make up at one end of the court, you lose at the other,"
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   But this was about more than numbers. This was about emotion and
motivation. It's February and, at 18-35, the Cavaliers are thinking
more about spring tee times than playoff time.  A chance to bump off
the two-time defending champions was one of the few things they had
left.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers, it's more about keeping their powder dry and their
sights on the bigger battles come April, May and, they hope, June.</TE>
<TE>   "We come to town and teams view this as the big game," Bryant
said. "We don't view it as that big a game."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Jackson put it, "Our players are not willing to give up
their reserve energy until it's time. And it's almost time."</TE>
<TE>   The perception around the league seems to be that, as was the case
last season, the talented Lakers will be able to flick a switch and
be at peak form when it becomes playoff time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad people think that so they will be worried about us,"
forward Robert Horry said. "But I don't think we can allow ourselves
to get in that frame of mind. Because some nights it's just not going
to click for us."</TE>
<TE>   Most nights, it doesn't click for Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "I am about winning basketball games," Cavalier Coach John Lucas
said. "And I am not enjoying this."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland was led by former Clipper Lamond Murray, who had 23
points, and Ricky Davis, who scored 19.</TE>
<TE>   Tyrone Hill was the major force on the boards for Cleveland with
14 rebounds. Bryant and Horry led the Lakers with six each.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest Laker lead was 11 points. Every time they seemed ready
to put Cleveland away, they let the Cavaliers back into the game by
allowing them inside to get a rebound or permitting them to roam free
for open jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers led, 26-20, after one quarter, 53-44, at the half and
83-78 after three quarters. Always ahead. Never secure.</TE>
<TE>   "You go into a game trailing with teams like Utah and the Lakers,
and it takes a while to catch up and a lot of energy," Cavalier guard
Andre Miller said. "We burned our energy coming back and had nothing
left when it got close."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the third quarter, with the Lakers clinging to a
three-point advantage, Bryant, with a defender in his face, took a
fadeaway jumper from 16 feet.</TE>
<TE>   It swished as the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Betcha they count that one," he said with a big grin as he raced
by the press table, referring to his game-ending shot Tuesday night
against the Celtics that was ruled too late to count, costing his
team a victory.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over Thursday, Bryant was still smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those nights where we really couldn't get
loose," Bryant said, "and we managed to win anyway. We'll take an
ugly win."</TE>

<HD>Montgomerie Bows to the Jeers</HD>
<DH>Golf: Four-time player of year in Europe says he doubts
he'll play again in U.S. after honoring current commitments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Colin Montgomerie, who was heckled by fans in his first-round match
at the Accenture Match Play Championship, says he probably isn't
going to play any more tournaments in the U.S. after this year.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll be 39 in June, I just don't need this anymore," said
Montgomerie, who lost, 2 and 1, to Scott McCarron in Wednesday's
match at La Costa. Montgomerie said he was heckled on several
occasions during the match, including an incident on the 12th hole
when he was cheered after missing a putt.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomerie also said he was heckled about his weight and about
how he was enjoying the outcome of the match.</LD>
<TE>   "All the usual material," Montgomerie said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without turning around, I knew I could accurately predict the
appearance of these kinds of fans: shorts, tennis shoes, T-shirt, cap
on backward, holding a beer. I was correct."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron, however, thinks Montgomerie overreacted.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing has been blown out of proportion," he said.
"There was only one guy who stifled a yell when Colin missed his putt
at the 12th. And that was it."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, the seven-time leading money winner on the European
Tour and four-time European Tour player of the year, has won 26
tournaments, but none in the U.S., where he plays sparingly. Soon, he
might not be playing at all. Montgomerie, who flew home Thursday to
London, is supposed to play next in the U.S. at Bay Hill.</TE>
<TE>   He said he probably will honor his playing commitments in the U.S.
the rest of the year, but is probably not coming back in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Hughes, the PGA's senior vice president and chief of
operations, hopes Montgomerie reconsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "He has many fans in this country who appreciate his skill and
achievements," Hughes said. "We certainly hope that, upon reflection,
Colin elects to keep selected U.S. appearances on his schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie also indicated his ban on playing any tournaments in
the U.S. would include major championships, including the Masters,
PGA Championship and U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "No offense to Scott McCarron, but if this is happening to me in
the first round of a tournament in such a low-key setting, what would
happen to me on the 17th hole of a major?" he said. "Would I even be
allowed to take back the club? Would someone run across the green and
snatch my ball away from me?"</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie played only seven PGA Tour events in 2001. His best
result was a tie for fourth at the NEC Invitational. He missed the
cut at the Masters, tied for 52nd at the U.S. Open, tied for 13th at
the British Open and was disqualified at the PGA Championship for
signing an incorrect scorecard.</TE>
<TE>   As he trudged up the steps to the clubhouse after his match
Wednesday, someone in the gallery asked Montgomerie how he was
feeling. Montgomerie said he was delighted not to be spending a
"second longer" in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Montgomerie did not sound angry about his treatment by the
galleries, but seemed tired of the situation and resigned to the fact
that he is a continual target. He said he isn't sure why he has been
subject to ridicule by the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to school in this country [at Houston Baptist University]
and I have traveled here extensively," he said. "But it continues to
happen. At this point, I'm at the edge. There is no level playing
field. I simply don't have the desire to deal with it any longer."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie says the first time he was ridiculed on the course by
fans was at the 1994 U.S. Open at Oakmont, where he lost to Ernie Els
in a three-way playoff. The next year, he said he received more abuse
at the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill, the same year he lost a
sudden-death playoff to Steve Elkington at the PGA Championship at
Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   And in the 1997 U.S. Open at Congressional, Montgomerie was
consistently interrupted during play with shouts of "USA, USA"--"the
Ryder Cup effect," he said. Montgomerie once again wound up as a
runner-up to Els in the Open.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie's next event is the Dubai Desert Classic, March 7-10.
A course he designed, Emirates Hills, is next door to the site and is
in line to host the European Tour event in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Spurs Find a Way to Shoot Down Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It only seemed as though every shot the San Antonio Spurs took landed
at the bottom of the net.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs connected on their first 11 three-point attempts and
Charles Smith scored a career-high 32 points in a 115-92 victory over
Sacramento on Thursday night at San Antonio in the final
regular-season matchup between the teams. The Kings won the first
three.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve Malik Rose had 23 points and Tony Parker had 15 for San
Antonio. Tim Duncan had 13 rebounds but scored only nine points, the
first time he didn't have at least 10 this season. David Robinson had
his fourth double-double in the past six games with 10 points and 11
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   "The guys played great tonight," Duncan said. "I think I held us
back in the first [quarter]. I sat down and we really started
rolling."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs didn't miss a three-pointer until Steve Smith was short
in the waning seconds of the third quarter. San Antonio ended the
night 12 of 16 on three-pointers, with Smith making four and Parker
three.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 98, Boston 92--Dirk Nowitzki had 33 points and 23 rebounds
and Michael Finley and Steve Nash hit key three-pointers to lead a
comeback at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks had only eight players in uniform after a trade
earlier in the day with Denver, but were able to overcome a 14-point
third-quarter deficit because of their three stars.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 94, Atlanta 79--Rasheed Wallace had 20 points and six
rebounds, Dale Davis had 12 points and 14 rebounds and Bonzi Wells
had 18 points in the victory at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The Blazers won their fourth consecutive game and fifth in six
games since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 93, Washington 82--Jason Kidd had 30 points, eight
assists and seven rebounds as the Nets defeated the Wizards for their
first road victory over a Michael Jordan team since 1985, a streak of
23 games.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd scored 12 points, including a 40-footer at the end of the
third period, in a 17-2 run that put the Nets ahead, 81-65, early in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 78, Memphis 72--Shawn Marion scored 18 points and the Suns
held the Grizzlies to six points in the fourth quarter at Memphis,
Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 89, Minnesota 83--Cuttino Mobley scored 26 points and
Steve Francis had 16 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists on his 25th
birthday in the victory at Houston.</TE>

<HD>McKay Accepts Six-Year Deal to Stay in Tampa Bay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay decided to remain with
the team Thursday, mending his fractured relationship with Buccaneer
ownership and accepting a six-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   McKay, the Buccaneer general manager for the last seven seasons,
had been contemplating leaving the club since the sons of owner
Malcolm Glazer vetoed his plan to hire former Baltimore Raven
assistant Marvin Lewis as the team's new coach two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Although the general manager led the team's initial effort to lure
Jon Gruden away from the Oakland Raiders, the Glazers finished the
deal and hired Gruden this week without input from McKay.</LD>
<TE>   McKay, who had a year left on his contract, interviewed for the
Atlanta Falcons' vacant general manager job last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Vinatieri, who kicked the winning field goal in New England's
Super Bowl victory after making the tying and winning kicks in a
playoff win over Oakland, was designated the Patriots' "franchise"
player.</TE>
<TE>   Another kicker, Jason Elam of Denver, also received the
designation on the final day to protect players with "franchise" and
"transition" tags for free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Both are guaranteed $1.24 million, the average of the salary of
the five top-paid kickers in the NFL. In addition to the two kickers,
those getting "franchise" tags also included tight end Tony Gonzalez
of Kansas City, middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter of Philadelphia,
offensive tackles Tarik Glenn of Indianapolis and Walter Jones of
Seattle, free safety Kwamie Lassiter of Arizona and all-pro
linebacker Jason Gildon of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Jets re-signed their most important free-agent-to-be,
left tackle Jason Fabini.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other veterans were released so teams could get under
the $71.8-million salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Romanowski, the Denver Broncos' 35-year-old linebacker, left
the team after being told he would have to compete for a starting job
in training camp. Minnesota cut safety Orlando Thomas and linebacker
Ed McDaniel.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Ken Dilger of the Colts also was on the cut list along
with two of Indianapolis' starting defensive backs, Jeff Burris and
Chad Cota. Denver's Leon Lett, who won three Super Bowl rings in
Dallas, also was cut.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Michael Allen, a PGA Tour regular for the first time since 1995,
shot an eight-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead after the first
round of the Tucson Open.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Funk, Loren Roberts and Brandel Chamblee shot 65s, and Andrew
Magee, the 1994 winner at Tucson National, was two strokes back along
with David Berganio Jr., John Huston and Bob Heintz.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick rallied from a four-game deficit in the second set to
beat Brazilian Andre Sa, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, in the second round of the
Kroger St. Jude tournament at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Roddick will play Sargis Sargsian of Armenia in
the quarterfinals today. Sargsian upset sixth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman,
1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (8).</TE>
<TE>   On the women's side, fourth-seeded Alexandra Stevenson beat
Silvija Talaja, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2, to reach her first semifinal since
1999 at Wimbledon. She will play Alina Jidkova, a 7-6 (5), 6-2 winner
over Jana Nejedly.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams defeated Anastasia Myskina, 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, to
advance to the semifinals of the Dubai Women's Open in the United
Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   In another quarterfinal, second-seeded Monica Seles defeated No. 7
Angeles Montolio of Spain, 6-0, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Enqvist of Sweden withdrew from the ABN/AMRO World Tennis
indoor tournament in Rotterdam, Netherlands, because of flu, giving
Roger Federer of Switzerland a walkover in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   In other action, second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia was
ousted by Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner and two-time CART champion
will take the spot of former IRL champion Greg Ray, who could not
come up with a major sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series crew chief Bob Keselowski, team
owner Key Keselowski and driver Terry Cook were penalized for a
technical violation discovered after the season-opener at Daytona
Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The crew chief was fined $10,000, while the owner and driver were
each hit with the loss of 100 championship points. Cook finished
sixth in the race, accumulating 160 points.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will play host to No. 18 USC today in the first game of a
three-game nonconference baseball series at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
Both teams were swept in their last series. UCLA (7-6) lost three

America poll after losing three games against then-No. 25 Baylor at
Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Trina Tinti, the women's gymnastics coach at California and a

<LD>Twenty-two years ago, the Herb Brooks-coached U.S. men's hockey team
beat Germany in the quarterfinals, then upset the Soviet Union in the
semifinals en route to a gold medal at Lake Placid. On Wednesday, the
Herb Brooks-coached U.S. men's hockey team beat Germany in the
quarterfinals and will play Russia today in the semifinals. Miracle
on Ice Redux?</LD>
<LD>   Not quite. In 1980, the United States was playing primarily with
young, inexperienced players. The Soviet Union had a veteran,
professional team that was considered the best in the world.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the U.S. and Russian teams are both filled with NHL
veterans. They are almost equal in talent, at least if the 2-2 tie
they played to in the first round is an indication.</LD>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, Canada meets Belarus. If Belarus wins,
there's your new miracle on ice.</TE>

<LD>There's one lesson that holds true in any Olympics, summer or winter.
If you want to have fun, go where the Brazilians are.</LD>
<LD>   The country that hosts Carnival, the world's greatest party, is
home to the world's most energetic and fun people.</LD>
<LD>   And this year the Brazilian Winter Olympic contingent is larger
than ever thanks to the addition of the Brazilian bobsled team. Meet
Eric Maleson, who isn't just the driver, he's the president of the
Brazilian Bobsled, Skeleton and Luge Assn. One of his push-athletes,
Matheus Inocencio, saw snow for the first time in November. They ride
in a sled known as the Frozen Banana. Their motto: Samba on Ice.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we bring a whole new atmosphere to the Olympics," Maleson
says. "The Olympics need that. After Sept. 11, we need that. The
world as one, you know? Get together, you know? And we get together
through music, happiness, samba."</TE>
<TE>   He's sitting in the Rodizio Grill, a Brazilian restaurant that has
served as the unofficial team training table. Behind him a man beats
on a drum and sings. His teammates are liable to break into dance at
any moment.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that brings sadness to their faces is the timing of
these Games. The opening ceremony happened to coincide with the first
day of Carnival back home. But brakeman Cristiano Paes had a simple
solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Carnival here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A Brazilian is Brazilian, anywhere he is," push-athlete Edson
Bindilatti says in Portuguese, with Maleson translating. "He always
brings the love for samba, the openness. We love everybody. That's
the Brazilian attitude."</TE>
<TE>   So how do you bring that attitude to the altitude and make it
samba time on a frozen track 7,000 feet above sea level?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to shake it," Maleson says. "Shake the hips, the
quadriceps."</TE>
<TE>   And just like that, Inocencio starts grooving, swaying his hips
back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   And if it's too cold?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll make it really hot," Bindilatti says.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do Bindilatti and Inocencio provide the team's speed,
they give it a good portion of its funkiness.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't the most likely bobsled candidates. Bindilatti is
afraid to ride roller coasters, but now he hurtles down the track at
close to 90 mph. Inocencio, a late replacement for an injured
push-athlete, had never seen snow before a training run in Calgary
last November. (When asked about that experience, he wraps his arms
around himself, starts shivering and says, "Muitto frio." No
translation necessary).</TE>
<TE>   Maleson did some research in track and field and called them.
Bindilatti is a Brazilian decathlon champion. Inocencio won the
bronze in the 110-meter hurdles at the Brazilian track and field
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought it was a joke, somebody trying to make a prank or
something," Maleson says.</TE>
<TE>   But they were willing to give it a shot. It was something new.</TE>
<TE>   For Maleson, bobsledding's appeal was the speed. He had always
wanted to be a Formula One race car driver. But that's a sport for
millionaires, requiring serious sponsorship. Maleson bought his first
bobsled for $1,700 in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Except he neglected to tell his girlfriend, Lisa Papandrea. They
were living in Massachusetts, where they met while Maleson attended
language school in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go out one morning, open the garage door and there was
this big, obnoxious yellow thing in there," Papandrea says.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her that was my new toy," Maleson says.</TE>
<TE>   A bobsled. For a guy who wiped out and totaled his car the first
time he tried to drive in New England's snow.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Oh yeah, sure. You're gonna be a great bobsledder,'"
Papandrea says.</TE>
<TE>   But Maleson was a natural. The first time he tried driving a sled,
at the old Olympic course in Lake Placid, he didn't crash. And he was
hooked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I was driving a race car," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After two years he got his super license, which allowed him to
compete internationally. Only one problem: He was a Brazilian
citizen, and Brazil did not have a federation affiliated with the
national Olympic committee. That meant he couldn't compete for any
country.</TE>
<TE>   His solution: form his own federation. The accreditation process
was a bureaucratic procedure Papandrea calls "a six-year nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   They had limited funding from working part-time jobs. Papandrea
cleaned out the closets and held yard sales to raise cash. She
learned just how long she could go without paying utility bills
before the power got cut off. Her sister sent them boxes of
essentials such as toothbrushes and toilet paper. When they were
given a new sled by the Brazilian Olympic Committee through an
International Olympic Committee program, they sold the old sled on
EBay for $5,000. ("I liked the sled when I was selling it for five
grand," she says.)</TE>
<TE>   And after all that, it came down to three races in Lake Placid
last December to qualify for the Olympics. Bobsledders must earn 60
points in five competitions on three tracks over two seasons. The
Brazilians needed 44 points before the last two days of racing. They
crashed in the first race. In the next race, they finished third out
of eight teams. And in the final race, they made the cutoff by 0.03
of a second.</TE>
<TE>   No group has had more fun at these Olympics than the Brazilians.
Bindilatti and Inocencio grin, give thumbs-up signs and say
"Brasssiiil" every time they see a camera. They broke out into "La
Bomba," a popular Carnival dance, in the middle of a restaurant.
Bindi-</TE>
<TE>   latti had the flags of different nations painted on his nails at
the beauty salon in the Olympic village, then shoved his hand in the
face of Prince Albert of Monaco to show them off.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, there's still love for the Jamaican bobsled team, but this
year's two-man team was a little more serious than the original cool
runners in 1988. Their driver, Winston Watt, is a physical fitness
instructor for the army. The brakeman, Lascelles Brown, said: "We
come to do the bobsled. After bobsled, then we party."</TE>
<TE>   There's a little something waiting for Maleson when his two days
of competition that start today are finished. He and Papandrea will
get married at the Olympic village.</TE>
<TE>   Love in the air, samba on ice. It's all good. Or, as the
Brazilians would say, Muitto Bom.</TE>

<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Germany edged Norway for the gold medal in the women's 20-kilometer
cross-country relay Thursday, shortly after Russian superstar Larissa
Lazutina was disqualified for having high levels of hemoglobin.</LD>
<LD>   Norway won the silver, and Switzerland took bronze.</LD>
<LD>   Russia planned to protest the race, team leader Gennady Ramensky
said.</LD>
<TE>   The disqualification of Lazutina, trying for a record-tying 10th
medal, knocked four-time defending champion Russia out of the event.
The Ukrainian team did not start because Valentina Shevchenko also
failed the blood test.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians--Lazutina, Olga Danilova, Nina Gavriljuk and Julija
Tchepalova--have dominated cross-country events at Soldier Hollow.
They have a combined six medals--two gold, three silver and one
bronze--and were the heavy favorites to win the relay.</TE>
<TE>   Without them, Norway and Germany battled for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegians led after the second and third legs, but Evi
Sachenbacher quickly passed Anita Moen on an uphill at the
1.7-kilometer mark.</TE>
<TE>   Moen--using countryman and four-time biathlon gold medalist Ole
Einar Bjoerndalen's skis--retook the lead just before the skiers
entered the stadium and looked as if she might pull away. But
Sachenbacher, who won the silver medal in the 1.5-kilometer sprint
Tuesday, cruised past the leader with 100 meters to go.</TE>
<TE>   Moen realized she was beaten and coasted across the finish line in
second.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans--Manuela Henkel, Viola Bauer, Claudia Kuenzel and
Sachenbacher--covered the course in 49 minutes 30.6 seconds, 1.3
seconds faster than Norway.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth consecutive silver medal for Norway in the
event. Russia had won seven of the first 12 gold medals since the
relay made its Olympic debut in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Italy, third in the last three Olympic relays, was sixth.</TE>

<HD>Britain Takes Gold; U.S. Team Swept Aside</HD>

<DL>OGDEN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Four women from Scotland won an Olympic gold medal here Thursday for
what normally would be considered inappropriate behavior--throwing
rocks in the house.</LD>
<LD>   Skip Rhona Martin, on the last shot of the championship game, took
a Swiss stone out of the scoring house, giving Britain a 4-3 victory
in women's curling at the Ice Sheet at Ogden.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, in a tournament that Canada, the modern-day power, couldn't
win, the title went to a team from the country where the sport was
born in the 1600s. Canada won the bronze medal, beating a surprising
United States team, 9-5.</LD>
<TE>   Fans rose, cheering as Martin's stone crawled to the Swiss stone,
then ever-so-gently bumped it away, leaving the Scottish rock to take
the point.</TE>
<TE>   Fans waved Scottish flags as sweepers Debbie Knox, Fiona McDonald
and Janice Rankin dropped their brooms and began the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "They jumped in the air," Martin said. "I couldn't even see the
stone, so I figured it must have been good."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second dramatic victory in two days for the Scots.
Martin's final shot in Wednesday's semifinal had beaten Canada, 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a great shot and last stone," Swiss skip Luzia Ebnoether
said of Martin's game winner.</TE>
<TE>   In finishing fourth, the U.S. improved on its previous Olympic
showing, a tie for fifth at Nagano in 1998, which left the Americans
with mixed emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud," said skip Kari Erickson. "We got fourth place.
Fourth place in the Olympics is very good ... but we would have liked
to have a medal."</TE>
<TE>   Added Ann Swisshelm, the vice skip, "This team has a motto and it
comes from a movie ['A League of Their Own'], 'There's no crying in
curling.' I will admit that today is about as close as I've ever come
to crying in curling. But it was a great game. We had a great
Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians scored twice in the first end and never looked back,
making the U.S. play more defense than planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to go after them," Erickson said. "They're a good team
and we wanted to make them shoot tough shots."</TE>
<TE>   That came as no surprise to the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   "They pretty much did what they did all week," skip Kelley Law
said. "We were expecting the game they played against us. We can play
that finesse game so we wanted to put some pressure on them and we
did that."</TE>
<TE>   Canada pretty much put it out of reach in the fifth end, when
Erickson tried to angle a take-out shot around a three-stone guard
and just missed. Law then set another guard for the scoring stone and
Erickson, with the last shot of the end, hit the guard, giving Canada
another point and a 5-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson scored with two shots in the eighth, making it 7-5 in the
eighth, but Canada scored again in the ninth, then, with the last
shot in the 10th, played strictly defense and still scored again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really disappointed, but what can we do about it now?"
Swisshelm said. "We can't get back any rocks we've already thrown."</TE>
<TE>   Erickson ruefully agreed. "We had opportunities to score a few
points and that didn't happen in every end," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even making the bronze-medal game, however, was encouraging to the
Americans, who were 2-3 in round-robin play before winning four in
succession to make the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Canada had hoped for better than bronze.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expectations were high, but it doesn't always turn out that
way," Law said.</TE>
<TE>   "[After losing to Britain on Wednesday] we were hoping that we
would wake up and it would be a nightmare. But we woke up and it was
Thursday morning, the sun was shining and so we played our best....</TE>
<TE>   "It's an Olympic medal we won today, not a consolation prize."</TE>

<DH>As Three Above Her Wobble, New York Teen Skates Away With
Gold</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>She floated over the ice, as delicate as the flutes that played her
music but as assertive and strong as any champion has ever been.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah Hughes faced daunting odds Thursday night and overcame them
with uncanny poise and polish, staging one of the greatest upsets in
the annals of Olympic figure skating.</LD>
<LD>   With a softly flowing lavender dress and steely resolve, the
giggly 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., performed a technically
demanding but artistically appealing routine Thursday to vault from
fourth place to the gold medal, a leap of faith few but she believed
she could carry off.</LD>
<TE>   While favorites Michelle Kwan and Irina Slutskaya toiled on the
ice--Kwan two-footed a triple toe loop and fell on a triple flip,
drawing a collective gasp from the crowd packed into the Salt Lake
Ice Center--Hughes soared to "Daphnis et Chloe" by Ravel. She edged
Slutskaya by a 5-4 margin on the judges' scorecards, leaving
Slutskaya with silver and Kwan with bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen-year-old Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who fell on her
combination jump, dropped from third after the short program to
fourth overall because the long program is weighted to count for
two-thirds of the final score.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' rally is unprecedented in the 11 world championships and
four Olympics that have been contested since the compulsory figures
were eliminated from figure skating competitions and the current
format of short program-long program was adopted.</TE>
<TE>   It also marked the fourth time the U.S. has placed two women on
the Olympic medal stand: In 1956 Tenley Albright won gold and Carol
Heiss won silver; in 1960 Heiss won gold and Barbara Ann Roles won
bronze. In 1992 Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan won gold and
bronze, respectively, and in 1998, Tara Lipinski and Kwan won gold
and silver.</TE>
<TE>   "I skated for pure enjoyment," said Hughes, who learned to skate
as a toddler on the family's backyard rink so she could keep up with
her hockey-playing older brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how I wanted my Olympic moment to be."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan and Sasha Cohen surely didn't envision their Olympic moments
playing out as they did.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan was the favorite here, as she had been at Nagano and was the
leader after the short program, as she was in Japan. The 21-year-old
Torrance native, a six-time U.S. champion and four-time world
champion, had endured a rocky season that included splitting with
choreographer Lori Nichol and longtime coach Frank Carroll. She
needed her independence, she said, and her performance in winning the
U.S. title last month at Staples Center seemed to justify her
decision to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   But as at Nagano four years ago, Kwan's Olympic long program
performance ended with tears of despair instead of triumph. She was
again surpassed by an eager teenager who outjumped her and found a
way, for at least four magical minutes, to match the artistry that
supposedly was Kwan's hole card.</TE>
<TE>   At the post-event news conference, Kwan wore a fake gold medal
given to her by 1976 Olympic gold medalist Dorothy Hamill. That would
be as close as she would come to the real thing after a silver in
1998 and bronze this time. She said she hasn't decided whether she
will continue in Olympic-eligible competition, but Thursday's results
might be a less-than-gentle hint her time has passed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had great practices, and I think this was my worst skate for
a while," Kwan said, her face scrubbed clean of makeup and her eyes
bearing traces of tears. "It's a bummer.</TE>
<TE>   "The color of the medal doesn't matter. The important thing is my
family is here to support me. It's OK.... I was talking with my
parents this morning that I remember I was real young, at a
competition in Las Vegas, and I was talking in my sleep, saying,
'It's OK, it's OK.' I told my parents I had dreamed about figure
skating. Today, I have to remind myself it's OK. It's OK."</TE>
<TE>   At Nagano, it was a plucky, exuberant, 15-year-old Tara Lipinski
who overtook her to win the gold. This time, it was a polished,
poised 16-year-old named Sarah Hughes who occupied the top step on
the medal podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to shrug my shoulders and say, 'It's life,'" said Kwan,
who bit her lip to suppress her tears after she skated, apparently
aware her gold medal dreams were fading. "This is all about
competition. You don't skate well every night....</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a wonderful journey, the last four years since Nagano.
I know everyone thinks I waited around the last four years to win
gold. My whole goal was to leave a mark on skating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard. Tonight I just wanted to come home with the gold. When
you're young, you dream of it. You want to be in the same category as
Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, Brian Boitano. It just wasn't my
night. I just have to remind myself to keep my head high."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, third after the short program, had to content herself with
a fourth-place finish in her Olympic debut. She had a shaky landing
on the first part of her triple-triple combination, the triple lutz,
and fell on her triple loop. She tried to pull it out but lacked the
spark and verve that had put her in medal position after Tuesday's
short program.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have the flow I needed for the triple toe loop," said
Cohen, who skated to "Carmen," complete with a red flower in her
hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't do anything more."</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya felt she had done all she could too, and bemoaned her
presentation scores. They ranged from 5.6 (out of 6.0) to three 5.9s,
but also included three 5.7s.</TE>
<TE>   Saying she had not heard about the Russian Olympic Committee's
threat earlier in the day to withdraw its team before her
performance, she nonetheless echoed some of Russian officials'
complaints about unfair scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I work so hard this year for my [presentation] marks and in all
competition I have higher marks, 5.8 and 5.9. Here it's 5.6," she
said. "I have shock. That's it.... I skated great today. I am a good
skater and the judges took the choice and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   The judges had ample reason to choose Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Calmly pulling off a triple salchow-triple loop and, later a
triple toe loop-triple loop, she was smooth and sure and increasingly
animated as her music played on. Leaning forward afterward, as if she
couldn't believe the ovation that followed her performance, she
beamed and drank in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was probably my greatest skate ever. So it was nice it
happened the night of the Olympic long program," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into the long program, I didn't think I had a chance to win
gold. When I went out there I didn't think about medals. I went out
and skated for the fun of it. I didn't hold back. I just let it go.</TE>
<TE>   "When I finished and the crowd roared is a moment I'll remember
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Her coach, Robin Wagner, appeared as stunned as Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   The winner learned the impossible is possible, that the Olympic
ideal, too often trampled and sullied by scandal and whining, can be
inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really go out and skate for a gold medal. I went out to
have a great time," said Hughes, the fourth of six kids of John
Hughes, a former college hockey player turned attorney, and Amy
Hughes, a busy mom and three-year cancer survivor.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'This is the Olympics. I want to be the best.'</TE>
<TE>   "And it's amazing, really, truly amazing."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Who would have thought that Michelle Kwan, Irina Slutskaya, Sasha
Cohen, Sarah Hughes and Maria Butyrskaya would become bit players in
the Winter Olympics' women's figure skating competition?</LD>
<LD>   But that's what happened Thursday night. When the skaters still in
contention for medals went onto the ice at 8:43 p.m. MST to warm up
for their freestyle programs, the only people who mattered to those
who knew what truly was at stake were named Sissy Krick, Tatiana
Danilenko, Maria Hrachovcova, Ingelise Blangsted, Paolo Pizzocari,
Irina Absaliamova, Pekka Leskinen, Deborah Islam and Joseph Inman.</LD>
<LD>   They were the nine judges who would determine the winners.</LD>
<TE>   And oh so much more.</TE>
<TE>   Since last week's scandal involving the pairs competition, figure
skating judges have been scrutinized like never before by officials,
media, the public and even other judges. Judges say they have been
afraid to talk among themselves about skating lest anyone accuse them
of conspiring to predetermine an event.</TE>
<TE>   The panel for the women's freestyle competition Thursday night at
the Salt Lake Ice Center was under additional pressure after a news
conference called a couple of hours earlier by the Russian Olympic
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians, convinced that their relatively low medal count is
the result of a post-Cold War conspiracy against them, said they are
demanding a review of questionable decisions in figure skating,
cross-country skiing and ice hockey by International Olympic
Committee President Jacques Rogge.</TE>
<TE>   If not satisfied, they warned they might withdraw their athletes
from the remaining three days of competition, refuse to compete in
future Olympics and organize their own Games, a la the Goodwill
Games.</TE>
<TE>   Implied was that they would be closely watching the judges in the
women's freestyle program to determine whether Americans Kwan, Cohen
and Hughes would be favored over Russians Slutskaya and Butyrskaya.</TE>
<TE>   So the judges were not only deciding medalists in the marquee
event of the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   They were deciding the future of the Olympics, and, considering
that the Games play an even larger role than the Miss America pageant
in promoting world peace, perhaps the fate of the civilized world.</TE>
<TE>   I thought Thursday night that the world had dodged a bullet, at
least for one more night.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics might suggest that the Russians, with their shoe-pounding
act, were merely attempting to influence the judges to favor their
skaters, but it appeared as if Sarah Hughes, the 16-year-old from
Great Neck, N.Y., had made that impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Skating second among the serious medal contenders, she became the
first woman to perform two triple-triple combinations in the Olympics
and exhibited artistry far beyond her norm.</TE>
<TE>   She still had to have help to win the gold medal because she was
fourth after Tuesday night's technical program. She got it when the
three skaters who were ahead of her, Cohen, Kwan and Slutskaya,
faltered.</TE>
<TE>   The only difficult decision for the judges should have been
whether to place Kwan or Slutskaya second in the freestyle program.
If the majority had gone with Kwan, she would have won the gold medal
by virtue of her first-place finish in the technical program.
Instead, Slutskaya finished second.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, however, four of the nine judges had Slutskaya first in
the freestyle program, ahead of Hughes. Not so amazing, one was the
Russian judge. The others were from Slovakia, Denmark and Belarus.
The five judges who favored Hughes were from Germany, Italy, Finland,
Canada and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   So it appears as if the bloc voting is still alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, it is indefensible for a judge to have voted
Slutskaya first. But the Russians might not see it like that.</TE>
<TE>   Look out. Here comes still another bullet.</TE>
<TE>   All the talk of "Miracle on Ice II" has made the Russians nervous.
They could sense that they were being set up as soon as the Americans
named Herb Brooks as coach, a feeling that was reinforced when Mike
Eruzione and his 1980 teammates emerged to light the caldron during
the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   That led to suspicions among the Russians that the fix might be in
if they had to face the Americans in today's semifinals. But during
Wednesday's quarterfinal game against the Czech Republic, they began
to wonder if the fix might be in to prevent them from playing the
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps never before has a team protested a game that it won, but
the Russians were outraged by referee Stephen Walkom, a Canadian
native who lives in Pennsylvania. From the final three minutes of the
first period until the middle of the third period, six consecutive
penalties were called against the Russians. Three within three
minutes in the first period left them two men down.</TE>
<TE>   They prevailed, 1-0, but only because of the superior goaltending
of Nikolai Khabibulin.</TE>
<TE>   Vitaly Smirnov, an IOC vice president from Russia, said that he
saw "malicious intent" in the referee's calls and suggested that the
Americans would rather play the Czechs in the semifinals because a
loss to them would be easier to explain to the remaining cold
warriors in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov, one of two IOC members who didn't vote for the
compromise--he abstained--that awarded a second gold medal to the
Canadian pairs team, complained Thursday about that decision.</TE>
<TE>   So did the president of Russia's Olympic Committee, Leonid
Tyagachev, who suggested that the IOC give the Russian cross-country
skiers disqualified Thursday after a failed drug test a second gold
medal because they would have won the race.</TE>
<TE>   We are now peering into the Pandora's box opened by the IOC with
its politically expedient but shortsighted decision in the pairs
controversy. It will reverberate throughout the future of the Olympic
movement, however long or short that might be.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia Try to Keep Emotions in Check</HD>
<DH>More than 20 years after the 'Miracle on Ice,' and less
than a week after a 2-2 tie, adversaries meet in the semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The fact that the United States men's hockey team faces Russia in the
semifinals exactly 22 years after their "Miracle on Ice" meeting
isn't just coincidence. You might say it was preordained.</LD>
<LD>   If the pairings were reseeded, Belarus' quarterfinal upset of
Sweden that left the U.S. with the best record among active teams
would have meant a U.S.-Belarus matchup. But the next round is
determined by pairings set out by the International Ice Hockey
Federation in April 1999. So Canada, the winner of game 30 of this
tournament, gets Belarus, winner of game 31.</LD>
<LD>   And it's the U.S. vs. Russia. Time for the old adversaries to get
it on again.</LD>
<TE>   Russian Coach Slava Fetisov, who played on the 1980 Soviet Union
team, approached U.S. Coach Herb Brooks at the Olympic village
cafeteria Thursday and said, "Herb, 22 years ago we met. What do you
think?"</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I can't think that far back, Slava,'" Brooks said. "But
he was thinking about it. He said, 'It's kind of eerie.'"</TE>
<TE>   Like the 1980 meeting in Lake Placid, this game is for a shot at
the gold-medal game, not the actual prize itself. And Thursday's
sensational news conference, at which the Russians threatened to pull
out of the Olympics because of perceived unfairness toward them,
added an old-fashioned Cold War chill to these Games. Not that things
are exactly the same, however.</TE>
<TE>   For a snapshot of the changes, consider the image of Alexei
Zhamnov, with a Nike swoosh on his Russian jersey, holding an
autographed USA sweater given to him by Chicago Blackhawk teammate
Phil Housley. Zhamnov had promised one to friends in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of NHL players has removed the kids-against-pros
angle that made that 4-3 victory in 1980 even more compelling. Brooks
even discounted the notion that Belarus' victory over Sweden was
similar.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweden wasn't the greatest hockey team in the world," Brooks
said. "And Belarus wasn't a bunch of college kids playing them. You
can't even compare. It was a big upset, but not like that."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Brooks has tried to do, however, is to make his players
feel college-age--or even younger--again. And one of the great
aspects of this tournament is that it can invoke feelings in NHL
players in the middle of February that normally aren't felt until
June.</TE>
<TE>   "At certain times in your career, you feel like it's the biggest
game that you'll ever play in," U.S. forward Doug Weight said.
"Whether it's a Game 7 in Edmonton or the first game of the Olympics
in 1998. We've all played in the playoffs the last four seasons. This
is probably one of the biggest games you'll play in.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to keep our emotions in check. It's funny
saying that after you have 25,000 hockey games under our belt in the
NHL, plus playoffs. But we're all pretty nervous right now."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Soviet Union teams won the gold eight times from
1956-1992, Russia is something of an underdog.</TE>
<TE>   "Russian people were so spoiled, they got used to seeing us win,"
Zhamnov said. "If we win a gold medal, it's going to be huge. People
even celebrated [Wednesday] when we beat the Czechs. It's big. People
are missing the old Soviet teams. They want to see victories."</TE>
<TE>   Fans on both sides want to see the U.S. and Russia re-create the
excitement of their meeting Saturday, which ended in a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard a lot of compliments after the game that people really
enjoyed that hockey game," Russian forward Valeri Bure said. "That's
what it's all about, it's for us to play hard, for us to play the
game, but as much [we're] playing for the fans and the people who
watch the game. When they like what they see, it's a big compliment
to us."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forward John LeClair expects an even better effort than the
first, when the teams were playing the second of back-to-back games
after assembling in Salt Lake City two days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were a little tired," LeClair said. "I think we're
going to be a better team when we play them tomorrow night."</TE>

<HD>Youthful Sweden Wins Bronze</HD>
<DH>The team upsets Finland, 2-1, providing some consolation
for a country reeling from the men's loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>First, Swedish goalie Kim Martin won a coin flip. Then, she won an
Olympic bronze medal.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, a 15-year-old who plays hockey with boys to stay sharp,
stopped 32 shots Thursday to lift Sweden to a 2-1 victory over
Finland in the third-place game.</LD>
<LD>   It was a surprising victory, but no more shocking than the way
Swedish Coach Christian Yngve reached the decision to start the
ninth-grader over veteran Annica Ahlen for the big game.</LD>
<TE>   "Sweden has a good history of coin tossing," Yngve said. "That's
what we did here. They were so close. Kim has given us some good
performances here. This was her big chance to come out as a great
goalie."</TE>
<TE>   Now, she'll have a medal to go with the ice cream and cake for her
16th birthday party next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't very nervous," Martin said. "I just go out and play,
just try to play the best I can."</TE>
<TE>   Evelina Samuelsson provided all the offense for the Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old scored her first goal of the Olympics 5:08 into
the game after a high rebound off Finnish goalie Tuula Puputti.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve minutes later, Samuelsson put Sweden ahead 2-0 by winning a
scramble in front of the net and stuffing in a power play goal.</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave the Swedish women their first medal in major
competition. It may have, in a small way, eased the pain from
Sweden's shocking 4-3 loss to Belarus in the men's quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to see them fall out the way they did yesterday,"
Yngve said.</TE>
<TE>   The women salvaged the week, even though they managed just only
nine shots on goal over the final two periods.</TE>
<TE>   Martin preserved the lead.</TE>
<TE>   She made four point-blank saves to hold Sweden's one-goal lead in
the third period, the final on a slap shot from just a few feet
outside the crease by Petra Vaarakallio.</TE>
<TE>   Martin improved to 2-1 in the Olympics. Her loss came Tuesday, 4-0
against the United States in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   When the game ended, it looked more like a gold-medal celebration.
The Swedes stormed off the bench and piled on their young goalie,
having won a medal nobody expected them to get.</TE>
<TE>   Finland was the favorite to take third. It has long been viewed as
the most likely country to challenge the United States and Canada,
which win almost everything in women's hockey.</TE>
<TE>   The Finns were the defending Olympic bronze medalists and a
six-time third-place finisher at world championship events over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   But they went 0-for-8 on the power play, and despite some good
shots, they couldn't mount any steady pressure after they fell behind
2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job as a coach to help the team win, and I didn't
succeed," Finnish Coach Jouko Lukkarila said. "So I'm the guy to
blame."</TE>
<TE>   Puputti made 18 saves for the Finns.</TE>
<TE>   Hanne Sikio scored Finland's only goal, a shot that bounced
through Martin's legs with 8:25 left in the second period.</TE>

<LD>As time expired on the American women's hockey team's dream of a
golden repeat and chants of "USA!" dissolved into a dull roar
Thursday night, the Canadians rushed their crease and bowled over
goalie Kim St.-Pierre.</LD>
<LD>   It was the hardest anybody got hit all night at the E Center.</LD>
<LD>   As the Canadian hockey team hugged, kissed and crawled on the ice
with delirious glee, an observer couldn't help scanning the ice rink
to see if referee Stacey Livingston had her armed raised for one last
penalty on the Olympic champions.</LD>
<TE>   It would have been a fitting ending to one of the worst-officiated
hockey games on a major stage.</TE>
<TE>   Thank the Olympic gods that Canada won, 3-2, or Jamie Sale and
Wayne Gretzky would be marching arm-and-arm, leading the True North
back across the border today.</TE>
<TE>   Women's hockey got a free pass at the Nagano Games. It was new to
the Olympics in 1998. The U.S. victory was heralded as a second
"Miracle on Ice" in some circles, a misguided notion.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is women's Olympic hockey makes women's college
basketball look like NFL parity. There are two teams: the United
States and Canada. Critics who claim women's college basketball is
only Connecticut and Tennessee can be shouted down. Not here.</TE>
<TE>   Neither country has ever lost an international game to a third
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the championship game in the Olympic tournament, Canada
and the U.S. had combined to outscore their opponents, 63-4. Sweden
had given serious consideration to not even sending a team to Salt
Lake City because it didn't think it was competitive enough.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Sweden won the bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of other competition aside, two splendid teams took the ice
Thursday in front of a crowd itching to see greatness. Those teams
played a close game, but nothing close to a great game. Livingston
didn't allow it. The rules of the women's game, barring body
checking, didn't allow it. It became a game of power-play frustration
and penalty-killing exhaustion. Flow was lost. These two teams
clearly are skilled and strong enough not to be treated like delicate
little flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the officiating, Canada's captain, Cassie Campbell,
said, "Atrocious."</TE>
<TE>   "It was atrocious," added Hayley Wickenheiser, the best women's
player in the world. "An American ref, we didn't get anything called
our way. I've never seen anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, I don't know.</TE>
<TE>   I thought Madame Le Gougne called a nifty game. Or was that
American coach Ben Smith's wife with the whistle?</TE>
<TE>   Livingston gave the Americans eight successive power plays at one
point, including two five-on-three situations. Hockey is not an easy
game to officiate, but believe this: No team of equal skill deserves
eight power plays in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Livingston called phantom trips.</TE>
<TE>   Livingston called cross-checks that were love taps.</TE>
<TE>   Both American goals came on the power play. They were two for 11
on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "She couldn't have been worse if she was wearing their jersey,"
Canada's Geraldine Heaney said.</TE>
<TE>   The hilarious thing is Jayne Hefford's breakaway goal, which
proved to be the winner, with one second left in the second period,
may well have been offside.</TE>
<TE>   And in this sense, the game was not so different from a
Connecticut-Tennessee game. When the play is elevated to a terrific
level, the officiating lags behind.</TE>
<TE>   There shouldn't have been an American or Canadian referee, but
beyond nationality there should have been elite officiating for this
game. Heck, they would have been better off using an NHL referee from
the men's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is women's hockey has to be played at that level more
often in order to get the referees some experience," Canada Coach
Daniele Sauvageau said. "Or else they'll have to go to the men's
side."</TE>
<TE>   Wickenheiser claimed she saw fear in the U.S. women's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   She is clearly wrong. This morning, the fear is in the eyes of the
International Olympic Committee, because too many of its judges and
referees cannot see clearly, cannot see fairly.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Women Savor Hockey Gold</HD>
<DH>The world champions finally win the one prize that had
eluded them, defeating the U.S. 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The U.S. women's hockey team found out what it's like not to get to
every puck first. The players experienced the unusual feeling of
looking up at the scoreboard and seeing a deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, they rediscovered what it is like to lose.</LD>
<LD>   It all came at the worst possible time for them: the gold-medal
game of the 2002 Olympic Games.</LD>
<TE>   And so Team Canada, winner of all seven Women's World
Championships, finally claimed the one prize that has eluded it in
the sport the nation cherishes so passionately.</TE>
<TE>   When the final seconds ticked off to finish a U.S. comeback
attempt and secure the 3-2 victory at the E Center, the Canadians
threw their gloves, sticks and helmets all over the ice as they
rushed together to jump on goalie Kim St.-Pierre. The U.S. players
slowly took their places along the opposite blue line and waited (and
waited and waited) for the Canadians to come over and initiate the
traditional postgame handshake line in a reversal of their positions
at the inaugural women's tournament in the 1998 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first loss for the United States since it lost to
Canada in the gold-medal game of the Women's World Championship on
April 8, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   After that the United States racked up 31 consecutive victories on
its pre-Olympic tour, including eight over Canada, then won its first
four games at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't win the big one," U.S. defenseman Angela Ruggiero said.
"It didn't really count. It's disappointing to lose that one game, of
course. But I'm proud of our team, for how hard we've worked. We did
win a silver medal. It just hurts right now."</TE>
<TE>   But Chris Bailey noticed a strange thing when she looked down
during the medals ceremony. She didn't focus on the silver medal
around her neck. She looked at the USA on her jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be wearing the bronze or wearing a silver medal or no
medal at all and be able to wear the red, white and blue," Bailey
said. "I'm just as proud of being an American, losing today, as I was
when we won in Nagano. And that's pretty surprising to me."</TE>
<TE>   For Canada, it was the ultimate satisfaction to see the maple leaf
flag raised highest above the ice and hear "O Canada" played over the
loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very proud of our World Championships," said Jayna Hefford,
who scored what proved to be the winning goal. "But we kept having to
hear, 'The U.S. won the Olympics.' It does make me feel a little more
complete."</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive part of Canada's victory was its 29-27
advantage in shots, even though the United States spent almost 16
minutes on the power play, compared with only six minutes for Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "In a five-on-five situation, we knew we could beat them,"
Canadian forward Lori Dupuis said. "It's just unfortunate tonight we
got so many penalties. Obviously in a five-on-four we can beat them.
We just kept plugging away."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, St.-Pierre kept turning away the United States, power
play or no power play.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to the gold-medal games, they've always had a hard
time finishing on our goaltenders," Canadian forward Vicky Sunohara
said. "Finishing in exhibition games is great, but when it counts is
when it counts."</TE>
<TE>   Canada scored first 1:45 into the game, when Cherie Piper circled
behind the net and shot. Sara DeCosta blocked it with her stick, but
the puck went into the air and Caroline Ouellette tipped it past
DeCosta.</TE>
<TE>   That just made the Canadians hungrier. They were outshooting the
U.S., 9-3, through the first 111/2 minutes of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Then Canada received four consecutive penalties. The United States
even had a two-skater advantage for a minute and nine seconds near
the end of the period. It allowed the U.S. to send eight unanswered
shots at St.-Pierre, but the Americans trailed, 1-0, at the end of
the first.</TE>
<TE>   Another penalty 71 seconds into the second period led to the
Americans' first goal. Katie King redirected a Tara Mounsey slap shot
from the blue line into the net.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed to energize the Americans into their more familiar
role as aggressors.</TE>
<TE>   But Hayley Wickenheiser, who was named the tournament's most
valuable player, took away the momentum just over two minutes later
with her seventh goal of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the period was more penalties and more power-play
failures.</TE>
<TE>   In the waning seconds, Canada's Hefford broke free and bore down
on DeCosta. DeCosta went down on her side and blocked the shot with
her body, but the puck flipped over her and bounced across the goal
line with only one second remaining.</TE>
<TE>   It took four more Canadian penalties before the United States
could convert, but finally Karyn Bye scored a power play goal with
3:33 remaining. The Americans scrambled desperately over the
remaining minutes but couldn't get another shot past St.-Pierre.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think that's the way the bounces went tonight," DeCosta
said. "We're an amazing team, and Canada played really well tonight."</TE>
<TE>   There were some gripes flying back and forth in the interview area
afterward, with the Canadians saying the Americans had signed their
names across the faces of Canadian players in pictures that hung in
the Olympic village and that they stepped on a Canadian flag in the
dressing room before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That is so ridiculous," U.S. forward Andrea Kilborne said. "That
is so classless of them to even say that. I don't think anyone here
would ever do that."</TE>

<HD>Is Expanding the Games in the Cards?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The International Bridge Federation plans to apply this year to the
International Olympic Committee for a place on the Olympic program.
Opponents might protest that bridge is not a sport, but where does it
say that all contests in the Olympics must involve sports?</LD>
<LD>   "These are the Olympic Games," said Bruce Keidan, an unofficial
spokesman for the IBF. "They are not called the Olympic Sports."</LD>
<LD>   Besides, said Keidan, whose day job is as an editor for the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, "a century from now, people might look back
in amazement that the Olympic Games included boxing, which is known
to cause senile dementia, and not bridge, which is known to prevent
the onset of senile dementia."</LD>
<TE>   One might argue that a person would have to already be suffering
from senile dementia to try to get a sport into the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Don Porter, president of the International Softball Federation,
campaigned for almost three decades to get his sport onto the program
for the Summer Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-nine years, six months and 13 days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard no, no, no from the IOC," he said. "It was a long, hard
struggle. I can't tell you how many times I considered giving up."</TE>
<TE>   Porter finally heard yes in 1991. Softball was played for the
first time as a medal sport in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Porter said softball was finally accepted because the IOC
recognized that the Games needed more female competitors. Softball
was added on the program as the female equivalent to baseball.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, it is more difficult to gain admission to the Summer
Olympic program now because of concerns about the size of those
Games. With more than 10,000 athletes already involved, the IOC is
committed to a slow-growth or even a no-growth policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Olympics, with approximately 2,500 athletes, has more
room to expand, but the IOC charter restricts those Games to ice or
snow sports.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the charter is relaxed, sports that might have to remain on
the waiting list for a while longer include ballroom dancing,
bowling, golf, karate, roller skating, squash and water skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps bridge could move to the front of the line by placing
tables on ice.</TE>
<TE>   There no longer are demonstration or exhibition sports in the
Olympics, but there was an IOC Grand Prix championship for bridge
here the week before the Games began. Canada won the men's
championship, France the women's. About 30 IOC members watched at
least one game.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, bridge doesn't have a huge physical component," Keidan
said. "But the concentration level required to play is pretty high.
It's golf without the clubs."</TE>
<TE>   Bridge's campaign probably won't have difficulty raising money. A
leading proponent is Warren Buffett.</TE>

<HD>His Impact Is Frozen in Time</HD>
<DH>Norman, Olympic Oval's main iceman, lauded for creating
ideal ice surface.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>Marc Norman knows perfect ice.</LD>
<LD>   He can spot it when his life depends on it as he hangs off a
frozen waterfall 200 feet up, looking for a spot to support his
climbing gear.</LD>
<LD>   He can make it too. Norman is the main iceman at the Utah Olympic
Oval, the fastest ice on earth. The arena holds eight of the 10 world
records in Olympic events--and today, there's an opportunity for one
more, in the 10,000-meter men's race.</LD>
<TE>   Norman, a former competitive speedskater, isn't taking any chances
with the slippery stuff. Two days before the races, he stayed at the
arena until about midnight, directing his crew as they shaved bumps
off the oval, flooded it with hoses and cranked the surface of the
rink down to about 9 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The $30-million venue boasts more than six times the cooling
capacity of most hockey rinks, an air-purification system to keep
dust off the sheet and a computer network that calls Norman's cell
phone the instant anything goes wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Norman, 28, is so obsessed with frozen water that his coworkers
have nicknamed him the "Ice Meister." He usually arrives at the rink
at 7 a.m. and stays until training sessions end 14 hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Even the water at the oval--1,000 tons flowing through 33 miles of
pipe embedded in the rink's concrete floor--is complex. Impurities
are removed by a deionizing unit, then salt is added to lower the
freezing point below 18 degrees, making the ice clear.</TE>
<TE>   Norman's ice has the perfect blend of grip and glide.</TE>
<TE>   Grippy ice is a little soft, allowing skaters to dig in and build
speed. Ice that glides resists the blades, so racers can slide with
less effort. Sprinters want grip and endurance racers demand glide,
so Norman tweaks the ice for each distance.</TE>
<TE>   "That's very special," said gold medalist Anni Friesinger of
Germany, who said the ice helped her break her own world record in
Wednesday's 1,500. "Sometimes when the ice is very fast you break
away in the corners, and here you still have grip."</TE>

<HD>Lagging Lodwick Hopes for Elway-Like Finish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Not even a phone call from John Elway could make Todd Lodwick fly far
enough to join the contenders in the final Nordic combined event of
the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Lodwick is hoping to pull off one of Elway's trademark last-ditch
comebacks, though.</LD>
<LD>   "Miracles have happened, and hopefully we can have one [today],"
Lodwick said after finishing 12th in the jumping portion of the
sprint competition Thursday, on the big hill at Olympic Park.</LD>
<TE>   Finland's Samppa Lajunen, who won the individual gold medal and
anchored the winning team event, set himself up for his third gold by
turning in the best jump of the day on the 120-kilometer hill.</TE>
<TE>   Lajunen scored 123.8 points, which will translate into a 15-second
lead over second-place Ronny Ackermann in today's 7.5-kilometer
cross-country race at Soldier Hollow. Lajunen's teammate Jaakko
Tallus, the silver medalist in the individual, will start three
seconds behind Ackermann.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick will start 56 seconds behind the leader and 38 seconds
behind third place, which makes it unlikely the United States will
break through and win its first medal in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were third after the team jumping competition last
week, but they went out too fast in the next day's relay race and
wound up fourth. It still was the best finish by a U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick took seventh in the individual event, also the best
showing by an American. But since he started seventh and couldn't
move up, he joked that he was too big a fan of Elway, who wore No. 7
as the Denver Broncos' quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   That anecdote made the rounds earlier this week and got back to
Elway, who called Lodwick on his cell phone Wednesday. Lodwick paused
the video game he was playing, and they chatted for about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about everything--golf, the works," said Lodwick, who's
from Steamboat Springs, Colo. "It was really, really cool. He said
'Good luck today,' and it was definitely a motivation for me."</TE>
<TE>   Jumpers only get one try in the sprint competition, and Lodwick's
jump wasn't nearly as impressive as his earlier ones. But he's only
five seconds behind Austria's Felix Gottwald, the top-ranked Nordic
combined athlete in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll finish further ahead than when I start," Lodwick said. "The
game plan might be to catch Felix right off the bat and see what he's
doing and hang with him."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody on the U.S. team performed his best. Bill Demong stands
13th, while Johnny Spillane is 37th and Matt Dayton 39th.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans might have been drained from Sunday's relay race,
when they finished 50 seconds behind bronze-winning Austria.</TE>

<HD>FBI Will Probe Ohno Threats</HD>

<LD>Threatening e-mails regarding short-track speedskating gold medalist
Apolo Anton Ohno have been turned over to the FBI for investigation,
the U.S. Olympic Committee said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The threats were received after Ohno's first race, when he won the
silver medal in the 1,000 meters after wiping out near the finish
line, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said.</LD>
<LD>   Another 16,000 e-mails regarding Ohno, mostly from sources in
South Korea, forced the USOC to take down its Internet server early
Thursday, Moran said. Service was restored almost nine hours later.</LD>
<TE>   Ohno was the second one across the finish line Wednesday night but
won gold when South Korean Kim Dong-Sung was disqualified for
blocking him during the last lap of the 1,500 meters.</TE>

<TE>   The French judge at the center of the figure skating scandal
calmly denied to International Skating Union investigators that she
was part of any vote-swapping deal and said she voted for the Russian
pairs team on merit, her attorney told Associated Press on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In three hours of testimony Wednesday, Marie Reine Le Gougne
recanted the accusations that several witnesses reported hearing her
make in an emotional outburst last week following the pairs
competition, attorney Max Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was under extreme pressure, feeling emotionally assaulted and
even physically assaulted when she made those statements," Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why she had named French skating chief Didier Gailhaguet as
the one who had pressured her into voting for the Russians over a
Canadian pair, Miller said, "She did it to escape further pressure,
to deflect criticism."</TE>
<TE>   The ISU suspended Le Gougne indefinitely last week, and she could
face permanent suspension. Miller said Le Gougne wants to be
reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet has denied pressuring Le Gougne.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese Olympic Committee apologized to local authorities
after a cross-country coach inadvertently pointed an unloaded
biathlon rifle at police in Heber City, near the Soldier Hollow
venue.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Kazunari Sasaki, who said he had never handled a gun, asked
the biathlon coaches if he could hold one of their rifles. He pointed
the weapon toward a window in their hotel room, and two police
officers in a room directly across the way saw the gun pointing in
their direction.</TE>
<TE>   The officers quickly came to check, and Sasaki was still holding
the rifle when he wheeled to face them as they entered the room.</TE>
<TE>   The JOC commended the officers for the "great restraint they
exhibited in this manner."</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki, speaking through an interpreter, said: "I didn't know
anything about gun etiquette. I heard afterward that if I pointed a
gun at the police officers, they could have shot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former King Jari Kurri, an NHL Hall of Famer and an assistant
coach for the Finnish men's team, was elected to the International
Olympic Committee's athletes' commission.</TE>
<TE>   Alpine skier Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, cross-country skier
Manuela Di Centa of Italy and speedskater Adne Sondral of Norway also
were voted to the panel in balloting by athletes at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Wiberg and Di Centa, the leading vote-getters, each will serve
eight-year terms; Kurri and Sondral will serve four years.</TE>

<LD>How's this for a double-headline doubleheader?</LD>
<LD>   Russians Threaten To Take Their Olympics And Go Home.</LD>
<LD>   Humankind's Faith In Figure Skating Judges Restored.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, Belarus over Sweden in men's hockey is looking like a
routine day at the office.</TE>
<TE>   Who'd have expected the Russians, pushed around from pairs skating
to cross-country skiing for two weeks, to reach into their moth-eaten
bag of old Cold War tricks and threaten to boycott the last three
days of the 2002 Winter Olympics and possibly the entire 2004 Summer
Olympics as well?</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Winter Games were still shaking their heads over
that one when, a few hours later, the women's figure skating long
program commenced ... and the long-assumed coronation of Michelle
Kwan got waylaid by an unexpected outbreak of judicial common sense
and fair play.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan and her family aren't going to feel any better hearing this,
but Thursday night at the Salt Lake Ice Center, five judges very well
may have saved the sport of Olympic figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   You knew the story line, the one that threatened to engulf this
city whole: Kwan, cruelly deprived of her career-capping gold medal
in Nagano in 1998, had done her time, put in an extra four years,
waited patiently, worked diligently, charmed the figure skating
community and audience according to the textbook. Thursday night she
would get her just rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan might have been outskated by Irina Slutskaya and Sasha Cohen
in Tuesday's short program, but the judges propped her up for her
golden moment, awarding Kwan first place at the intermission break
while sending her one final, unspoken order: Stay on your feet
Thursday and the championship is yours.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Sarah Hughes, fourth place in the short program,
produced a historic free skate performance--hitting two triple-triple
combinations, a first for an Olympic woman skater--the buzz remained
in the air: If Kwan skates cleanly, she still should win.</TE>
<TE>   But Kwan did not skate cleanly. She two-footed a landing on the
first jump of her first combination. She all but sat on the ice as
she stepped out of a triple flip.</TE>
<TE>   The judges scored her appropriately-- second in the free skate
behind Hughes, with one competitor, Kwan's longtime Russian rival
Slutskaya, remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya was far from perfect as well. She left out a planned
triple jump and she barely held her landing on a triple flip that
left her wobbling precariously near the dasher boards.</TE>
<TE>   What would the judges do? They had three choices:</TE>
<TE>   * Protect Kwan by underscoring Slutskaya.</TE>
<TE>   * Finesse the marks in favor of Slutskaya, tossing the Russians a
gold medal so they'll take their scheduled place in the closing
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   * Score Slutskaya and Kwan 2-3 and give the gold to Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   It was close, a 5-4 vote that did little to dissolve perceptions
of bloc favoritism, but the judges, in a shocker, did the right
thing. They awarded Hughes the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   How about that: The skater who skated the best Thursday night
actually won the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, obviously, was more than a little surprised. Appearing
dazed as she stepped onto the ice for the medals ceremony, Hughes
paused in front of the podium and took a few curious looks around
before Kwan, the old veteran, graciously showed her how to climb to
the top level.</TE>
<TE>   It's a result that should sit well with America. As for the
Russians and silver medalist Slutskaya, it's still too early to tell.
But give them a break. After all, it can't be easy, being Russian in
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Your pairs figure skaters win the gold medal, a glittering
singular achievement in most places.</TE>
<TE>   But not here, not in the valley of the screaming-banshee media,
who keep crying "Foul" and "Scandal" until the International Olympic
Committee, just to get them to shut up, commission the minting of a
second set of gold medals--tossing the things around as if they were
Olympic pins or bus schedules. Here, a Roots Team USA beret was a
tougher get than a pairs figure skating gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Then, your vaunted men's hockey team finishes third in its
four-team round-robin group and is thrown into a daunting
quarterfinal match against 1998 gold medalist the Czech Republic. The
Czechs receive a total of six minutes in penalties. Your players are
hit with 22 penalty minutes, including three two-minute penalties in
the last 2 1/2 minutes of the first period. You still don't know how
you won that one, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Then, your most decorated athlete at these Games, cross-country
skier Larissa Lazutina, is disqualified from the women's 20-kilometer
relay because abnormal levels of hemoglobin were detected in a
pre-race blood test. The test result not only knocks your four-time
defending Olympic champion squad out of the event, but costs Lazutina
her chance at a record-tying 10th career Olympic medal.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to drive you to drink, until you remember how long a
drive it is to the nearest state liquor store.</TE>
<TE>   What can you do?</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the Russians came up with something, and you have to
admire the initiative, if not the sheer chutzpah.</TE>
<TE>   They threatened to pull out of the Olympics if the IOC didn't
address their complaints and didn't stop disrespecting Team Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Not-so-subliminal message: Slutskaya skates against the Americans
tonight, our hockey team skates against the Americans tomorrow. You'd
better give us an even shake.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya placed better than Kwan but not Hughes, so it's hard to
predict the Russians' next move.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a big hockey game scheduled at the E Center this
afternoon. The Americans will be there. The Russians might want to be
there too.</TE>

<HD>High School Kid Restores Joy to the Games</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A prone, clammy, gasping, Winter Olympics was resuscitated Thursday
by a high school kid with the nerve to simply skate to the middle of
its chest and start pounding.</LD>
<LD>   Pounding through the cynicism.</LD>
<LD>   Pounding through the crybabies.</LD>
<TE>   Pounding so bravely and brilliantly, nobody could argue.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes is the 2002 Olympic women's figure skating champion,
and, pardon the language, there's not a damn thing the Russians can
say about it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor the Canadians. Nor the South Koreans. Nor any other nation
that, before Thursday night, turned what should be the height of
sport into a darkened whine cellar.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes is the Olympic champion, and these Games stand united
today, finally, behind a 16-year-old kid who showed there is still
room here for giant leaps in final moments that even fur-lined judges
cannot ignore.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't just snatch away a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   She snatched it minutes before officials pulled it out of the box,
snatched in the middle of a triple flip while reaching over the
shoulders of arguably the three best women skaters in the world.</TE>
<TE>   She grabbed like nobody has grabbed it before, maybe the biggest
upset in Olympic figure skating history, fourth to first in four
breathtaking minutes.</TE>
<TE>   We'll let her say it. She said it immediately after her long
program, mouthing the words in the middle of the Salt Lake Ice Center
while a blizzard of flowers and animals and gratitude fell to the ice
around her.</TE>
<TE>   She said it better than anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God."</TE>
<TE>   Were you watching her? Were you crying?</TE>
<TE>   People in the press box were crying. Fans in the stands were
crying. Hardened skating officials were crying.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the many maudlin stories of these Games, those weren't
tears of sadness or joy, but of renewal.</TE>
<TE>   That somebody barely fourth place after Tuesday's short program
and seemingly out of medal contention could skate like she still
believed she could be a champion....</TE>
<TE>   That a kid with a floppy haircut and goofy grin would be unafraid
to stare down the judges and their preconceptions and their scams....</TE>
<TE>   That somebody would challenge the system on its biggest and
brightest night....</TE>
<TE>   Now that was something.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said it to those judges again and again, four minutes
solid, with the first pair of triple-triple combinations in Olympic
history, with a spinning finish that turned her into a perfect violet
blur.</TE>
<TE>   You want to prove you're impartial? Then make me your champion.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, people were crying even though the top three skaters
after the short program had yet to skate.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was that good.</TE>
<TE>   Then, beginning with Sasha Cohen, the final three skaters were not
nearly as good.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, the Laguna Niguel teenager who had never been in this
position in a world-class event before, finally showed it.</TE>
<TE>   She was clearly uncomfortable during a warmup session that looked
more like a skating lesson, as she picked her way carefully and
slowly around the ice.</TE>
<TE>   When it was her turn to skate, she lasted less than a minute
before hitting the ice on a triple-combination, and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, watching on television in the bowels of the arena ,
holding hands with coach Robin Wagner, the Long Island kid was surely
thinking what the 15,000 fans were thinking.</TE>
<TE>   One down and two to go.</TE>
<TE>   Next up, Kwan, who was cheered like a champion, but who
immediately showed the same caution that seemed ominous in her
first-place short program.</TE>
<TE>   You know what those in other sports always say about injuries
occurring more often to those who play it safe?</TE>
<TE>   In a different sort of way, it happened here.</TE>
<TE>   Forty seconds into her program, she doubled-footed a triple jump.
Then, at 2:19, she missed on a triple-flip and hit the ice.</TE>
<TE>   She finished strong, even threw in a unplanned triple jump at the
end, but it was too late, and she knew it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the worst I've skated in a while," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned by a teenager for the second consecutive
Olympics--remember Tara Lipinski?--Kwan's night went from worst to
worse as she tearfully crossed the ice after the event to stand on
the bronze-medal podium.</TE>
<TE>   Although she mostly choked them back, they were clearly tears of
sadness. But she kept her cool and showed her trademark class,
graciously congratulating the top two skaters.</TE>
<TE>   The final skater, Russia's Irina Slutskaya, was not nearly so
gracious.</TE>
<TE>   As it was written in this space, she was probably the best skater
in the short program. But clearly, on Thursday, she never found the
same groove.</TE>
<TE>   She made several mistakes. Her program didn't flow. Several times
she seemed off balance or uncertain. She didn't grab for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   This being the biggest moment of the life of a skater who has
never won world championship, such tentativeness is certainly
defensible.</TE>
<TE>   But her behavior afterward was not.</TE>
<TE>   Mere hours after a Russian delegation threatened to pull their
team out of town if they weren't treated fairly, Slutskaya unfairly
and cheaply stoked the fire.</TE>
<TE>   She thought her presentation marks were low, and wouldn't stop
talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Interesting thing about these Olympic Games, I'm obviously not
the only Russian who has suffered here," she said immediately after
her skate.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she added, "I have a shock ... it's a shame."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about her delegation's charges of overall unfairness,
she said, "That's very interesting too."</TE>
<TE>   This space defended the Russian pair skaters against the awful,
precedent-setting decision that forced them to later share their gold
medal with the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday night was different. Slutskaya needed to close her
mouth and listen to the philosophy of a champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I had a chance of a gold, much less a medal,"
Hughes said. "I didn't even think about the medal. I skated because I
love to skate. I just let everything go."</TE>
<TE>   In other words?</TE>
<TE>   Faster, higher, stronger.</TE>

<HD>Russians Threaten to Leave Salt Lake</HD>
<DH>Unhappy over what they see as unfair judging, sports and
political leaders also say they may not compete in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Using inflammatory rhetoric reminiscent of the Cold War and the
boycotts that plagued the Olympic movement in the 1970s and 1980s,
Russian sports and political leaders threatened Thursday to withdraw
from the Salt Lake Games and said they might not take part in the
Athens Summer Games in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The latest controversy to cast a shadow over the Games came after
Russia's Larissa Lazutina, a nine-time Olympic medalist, was
disqualified before the women's 20-kilometer cross-country relay
because of a high red-blood-cell count found in a pre-race test. The
Russians were unable to replace Lazutina in time for the race, which
was won by Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Leonid Tyagachev, the president of the Russian national Olympic
committee, blamed the country's disappointing showing so far at these
Olympic Winter Games on unfair judging, starting with last week's
unprecedented decision to award a second set of gold medals to a
Canadian pair of figure skaters who had originally finished second to
the Russians. The incident involving Lazutina exhausted Russian
patience, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not the only country that is humiliated," Tyagachev said,
referring to other controversial "nonobjective" judging decisions
during the Games. "In other words, this is a very serious topic. How
can we compete in the future?"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking through a translator, Tyagachev initially gave
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge 24 hours to
respond. Later, Vitaly Smirnov, an IOC vice president and longtime
IOC member from Russia, said there was no ultimatum: "Not 24 hours,
nor 48 hours." Later still, Tyagachev said that if Rogge were to take
the extraordinary step of sending an explanatory letter to Russian
President Vladimir Putin, that "will be a satisfactory conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Olympic officials moved quickly to respond. A couple of hours
later, IOC Director General Francois Carrard said Rogge had indeed
sent a letter to Putin. He did not detail the contents but said
Rogge, after briefings with skating, hockey and ski officials, had
been "quite reassured" that there were no judging improprieties
directed against Russian athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Carrard also said there was "no pressure" from Putin, that Rogge
simply "felt it appropriate" to keep the Russian president informed.</TE>
<TE>   He also said, "The Russian delegation, the Russian athletes, the
Russian people have shown a long commitment to the Olympic movement
and we trust they will keep this full delegation and commitment." As
for the possibility of a Russian departure, he said, "This is a
hypothetical question and I will not take it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the South Korean delegation announced that it, too, was
furious about a judging call in Wednesday night's 1,500-meter
short-track speedskating race, in which the apparent winner, South
Korea's Kim Dong-Sung, was disqualified and American Apolo Anton
Ohno, who had finished second, was awarded the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials said they would do "whatever is necessary"
to correct "this unfortunate misjudgment" and, like the Russians,
would consider boycotting the closing ceremonies of the Games, set
for Sunday. In the meantime, the Koreans announced, they had filed a
protest with the international skating federation, with an
international sports arbitration panel--and were considering the
filing of a lawsuit in a U.S. court over the 1,500-meter results.</TE>
<TE>   Carrard said the South Korean protest was a matter for the
International Skating Union, the worldwide skating federation at the
center of last week's dispute involving the Canadian and Russian
pairs figure skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage," Carrard said, "the IOC has received no proposal
and taken no action."</TE>
<TE>   It remained highly uncertain late Thursday whether the Russians
were serious about leaving the Games--or were merely ratcheting up
the pressure on judges in sports they still are competing in, or were
simply trying to save face for constituencies back home.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Irina Slutskaya, second behind Michelle Kwan of the U.S.
heading into Thursday night's free program in women's figure skating,
finished second. Kwan finished third. American Sarah Hughes, who
skated an exemplary program, won gold.</TE>
<TE>   Today the U.S. and Russian men's hockey teams meet--in a rematch
of the famous 1980 game, won by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The repercussions of a pullout would be far-reaching, affecting
the Olympic movement--Russia has long been a key player in Olympic
affairs--and the careers of Russia's most influential sports leaders.
For instance, Moscow officials have made no secret in recent months
of their interest in bidding for the 2012 Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet Union dominated winter sports from its arrival in the
Winter Games, in 1956, until the breakup of the country a decade ago.
It boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games--in apparent
retaliation for the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games, which was
announced in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, in Calgary, the Soviets won 29 medals. In 1992, in
Albertville, the so-called Unified Team--athletes of the former
Soviet Union, less those from Baltic states--won 23. In 1994, in
Lillehammer, the Russians won 23. In 1998, in Nagano, the Russians
took home 18 medals.</TE>
<TE>   At these Games, with three days of competition left, the Russians
have won 14 medals, five gold. Germany, the United States, Norway and
even Austria have won more medals.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, with a previous best of 13 medals, in Nagano
and Lillehammer, has won 30 here in Salt Lake--10 gold.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials--including Pavel Rojkov, chairman of the Russian
state Committee for Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism--made it
plain Thursday they believed the problem was not poor performance but
unfair judging.</TE>
<TE>   It started, Russian officials said, with last week's furor over
the pairs skating program, in which Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier were originally awarded silver, Russians Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze the gold. Amid pressure, the Canadians got
their gold.</TE>
<TE>   Tyagachev maintained Thursday that Russian officials supported
that position, even though he said 90% of Russian fans disagreed with
the awarding of the second gold.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Wednesday's men's hockey game between the Czech Republic
and the Russians. The Russians won, 1-0, but left the game feeling
that they'd been called for excessive penalties and the Czechs thus
enjoyed too many power-play opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov called the refereeing in that game "truly disgusting" and
said he saw "malicious intent."</TE>
<TE>   The final straw came Thursday, before the start of the women's
20-kilometer cross-country relay, in which four athletes each ski a
five-kilometer leg. A Soviet or Russian team had won this event at
every Olympics since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   But one of Russia's top athletes, Lazutina, was disqualified
before the race because of the high red-blood-cell count. A high
count could signal the use of a performance-enhancing artificial
substance.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials said the explanation was innocuous--Lazutina was
having her period. "There is nothing to hide," Tyagachev said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a sure gold medal, and it was just taken away," Smirnov
said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Russian coach Anatoly Akentev: "We have been present at the
funeral of the ski relay race within the framework of the Olympic
Games."</TE>
<TE>   Carrard said the inflamed emotions were understandable:</TE>
<TE>   "The stakes are high. Emotions are high. Tensions are high. We
understand it. Judgment calls, we've said it from Day One, are part
of human nature and human reactions are understandable. There is a
lot of emotion building up, and I think these protests are the
expressions of such emotions."</TE>
<TE>   And he said, "Let's see what time does to all this."</TE>

<AU>HOWARD FENDRICH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, NBC's figure skating announcers didn't give viewers much
guidance at all.</LD>
<LD>   Ten days after their incredulity at the results of the pairs
competition was followed by the Winter Olympics' biggest controversy,
the three commentators never got around to telling the TV audience
why Sarah Hughes won the women's gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it wasn't until 11/2 minutes after Thursday night's
results were official--and a camera captured Hughes' spontaneous
reaction, falling to the floor, shrieking and hugging her coach--that
a graphic was put on the screen to show who won silver and bronze.</LD>
<TE>   To that point, Tom Hammond, Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic failed
to mention that Irina Slutskaya of Russia had finished second and
Michelle Kwan of the United States was third.</TE>
<TE>   Some might have thought Kwan had taken the silver medal, just as
she did at the 1998 Olympics in Japan. That's what was implied when
Hammond said: "And for Michelle Kwan, Nagano revisited."</TE>
<TE>   Before Slutskaya skated, the network showed a graphic showing that
Kwan was in first place ahead of Hughes. But the network didn't
explain that Hughes could pass Kwan depending on Slutskaya's scores.</TE>
<TE>   A skater's final ranking is reached by adding their placements
from the short and long programs. Until Slutskaya skated, Kwan's
combined score would have been enough to trump Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   But Slutskaya's performance in the free skate earned her second
place and pushed Kwan into third for that portion. The placement
differential left Kwan with the bronze medal and put Hughes and
Slutskaya in a tie. Hughes won the tiebreaker because she won the
long program.</TE>
<TE>   Even by the time NBC closed its show 25 minutes later, there
wasn't a full explanation of why Hughes was first, Slutskaya second,
and Kwan third, other than a reference to a "three-way tie."</TE>
<TE>   The only attempt at translating the results was Hamilton saying:
"Mathematically, it had to be perfect. Mathematically, Sarah Hughes
had to win the long [program] and Michelle Kwan had to be third in
the long for this result. And that's exactly what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton was also the one who most clearly framed what had
happened right after the results were known.</TE>
<TE>   "Sarah Hughes wins the gold medal! What an upset! What an
unexpected result," he said. "But the performance of the night won
the gold medal. What a deserving gold-medal performance."</TE>
<TE>   To Bezic's credit, she did make clear right after Hughes'
program--Slutskaya, Kwan and another U.S. contender, Sasha Cohen,
were still to skate--that it was spectacular and put the American in
position for a top finish.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just made a case for herself," Bezic said when Hughes
finished. "Those three skaters are going to have to skate their best.
What a phenomenal performance."</TE>
<TE>   Then, after Slutskaya closed the competition, Bezic set the stage
for the surprising final result, saying, "Sarah's was the performance
of the evening. What will the judges do?"</TE>

<HD>Miller's Rally Second to One</HD>
<DH>American wins second silver medal of Games, as Austria's
Eberharter breaks through with his first gold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>U.S. Alpine ski officials can now chuck those Groucho masks, cancel
witness protection plans, come out from their chalets and finally
join this red, white and blue medals party.</LD>
<LD>   They can do this because Bode Miller didn't get held up in
security and made his second Olympic start.</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Sam's otherwise agitated Alpine team saved a little more
face Thursday and Miller is the man who saved it.</LD>
<TE>   Eight days after providing the home country its only Alpine moment
with his come-from-behind silver performance in men's combined,
Miller played Comeback Kid again to take the silver medal in giant
slalom.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the biggest achievement of my life, to ski the way I
skied today," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephan Eberharter, racing his last Olympic race and still trying
to escape the shadow of teammate Hermann Maier, stamped his name in
Austrian ski racing history by ice-dusting the field in the first run
and then cruising to the gold with a two-run time of 2 minutes 23.28
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally I have gotten the gold," Eberharter said. "It was my last
chance to get one."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, in seventh place after the morning run, skied the fastest
second run to jump six racers into second place, .88 of a second
behind Eberharter. Norway's Lasse Kjus finished third with a time of
2:24.32, and added a bronze medal to the silver he won in the
downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, 32, completed his Olympic box set after winning silver
in the super-giant slalom and third in the downhill. He also earned a
silver in giant slalom at the 1998 Nagano Games, finishing second to
Maier.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter was crushed after losing the super-G gold medal by a
tenth of a second to Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, and would never
have guessed his crowning achievement would come in giant slalom, his
third-best discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect gold here; I didn't expect anything here,"
Eberharter said. "Today it worked. Today I'm the lucky one."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a 24-year-old from New Hampshire, became the first
American male to win two Alpine medals in the same Olympics since
Tommy Moe in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   His style on the slopes has been described as unique and
unorthodox.</TE>
<TE>   "He has, how do you say, a crazy style in skiing," Eberharter said
of Miller. "But he's fast, and that's all that counts."</TE>
<TE>   With a victory in Saturday's slalom, in which he will be the
favorite, Miller can become the first American Alpine racer to win
three medals in one Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "That means the Americans have had bad luck in the Olympics,"
Miller said, downplaying the prospects. "We've had people capable of
doing that before. It's never been done, but I think it's just a roll
of the dice. I don't know, but I think my chances are good going into
slalom."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's second giant slalom run was about as good as it gets in
gate racing. The top 15 racers from the morning run race in reverse
order, meaning Eberharter skied last among the top group.</TE>
<TE>   Miller stood in seventh place, yet only .17 of a second separated
him from a silver medal.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had to go all out to get a medal and crossed the finish
line in first place, but then had to wait out the last six racers,
all of whom had better first-run times.</TE>
<TE>   "I did what I could do; I was done," Miller said. "It's completely
out of my hands at that point. I just get to sit and watch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of fun. It was fun watching those guys ski, because
the situation provokes good skiing, but it also provokes mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Misstep by misstep, Miller climbed the ladder.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to sixth when Italian Alexander Ploner skied out, and all
the way to fourth when Austrians Benjamin Raich and Christoph Gruber
couldn't top Miller's time.</TE>
<TE>   Miller clinched the bronze when Kjus, skiing third to last,
checked in .16 of a second slower. Bronze turned to no worse than
silver when Italy's Massimiliano Blardone dropped to eighth after his
slow second run.</TE>
<TE>   To win gold, Miller needed a major mistake by Eberharter, who had
almost a one-second advantage entering his second run.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, though, put down a run only .03 of a second slower
than Miller's and easily won the gold.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's medal only added to his growing seat-of-his-pants legend.
Last week, in the combined, he pulled out a silver after being 15th
after the downhill and fifth after the first slalom run.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the plan at the beginning of the day," Miller joked of
his comebacks.</TE>
<TE>   After Eberharter came through the finish line, Miller was one of
the first to congratulate him. He understood how much it meant for
the Austrian to secure his first gold medal in his last Olympic race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a little bit overshadowed in the past by Hermann and
some of the other Austrians," Miller said of Eberharter.</TE>
<TE>   "But the guy comes to win every day."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he felt honored to be sandwiched between Eberharter
and Kjus on the medals podium.</TE>
<TE>   "Both those guys are at the top of their sports," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter's Olympic medal was his fourth; Kjus garnered his fifth
Olympic medal to go with 10 world championship medals.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the 19-year-old Miller made his World Cup debut in
a race at Park City. He was 69th after the first run and finished
11th.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come a long way in five years," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Who can say what the next five years will bring? Miller has
already single-handedly bailed out the U.S. Alpine program.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Games, U.S. Ski and Snowboard President Bill Marolt had
predicted 10 medals for his athletes. Miller's silver was the 10th,
but only the second in Alpine.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just been dragging along," Marolt said of his Alpine team.
"We wanted to deliver on that goal and get the monkey off our back."</TE>
<TE>   With Picabo Street retiring after finishing 16th in the women's
downhill, the U.S. team was looking for a new star to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   Miller appears to be that man.</TE>
<TE>   "A new legend is being built right before our eyes," USSA Vice
President Alan Ashley said.</TE>

<LD>How did the NBC sob story department miss this?</LD>
<LD>   Ronny Ackermann, a 24-year-old German who helped his country's
Nordic combined team win a silver medal, told the BBC that he
abstained from sex for 389 days before the event.</LD>
<LD>   He said it helped his strength and focus. Too much, maybe.</LD>
<TE>   After his Sunday event, he said he would continue to abstain from
sex for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Olympics, I will look for a girlfriend," he told the
BBC. "Until then, the only thing I'll be caressing is my medal."</TE>
<TE>   Naming Rights Not Worth Much Now</TE>
<TE>   Under IOC rules prohibiting the names of corporations on Olympics
venues, for the last two weeks the Delta Center has been renamed the
Salt Lake Ice Center.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has it resulted in confusion among spectators, who must
still walk under a huge Delta Center sign to enter the facility, but
it is costing Delta plenty of money.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bloomberg News, NBC mentioned "Salt Lake Ice Center''
about 20 times during one recent figure skating telecast, exposure
which would have been worth $4.3 million to Delta Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a Sport That Has It All? Get a Broom</TE>
<TE>   Ann Swisshelm, vice skip of the U.S. curling team that finished
fourth in the Olympic tournament, said the exposure probably had done
wonders for the game, which she considers every bit as exciting as
the so-called "extreme sports."</TE>
<TE>   "Our traditional sport is fairly rebellious at this point," she
said. "I'd like to think that we don't need to have any sort of
amplitude measure in order to have success.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make our game not physical, not dramatic. I think we
showed a couple of people that this game is very exciting. It's not
slow, it's not boring and it's not something that old people do. One
of the joys is that it's a sport that all people can play.</TE>
<TE>   "So, I think we've got it all. How cool would it be to walk around
with a broom? Really, that's pretty outrageous. You're going to be a
pretty unique teenager, playing the sport of curling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy Got Sloppy</TE>
<TE>   Erik Schlopy joined the list of U.S. Alpine skiers who have been
disappointments in these Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy, 29, missed a gate about 15 seconds into Thursday's men's
giant slalom and had to hike back uphill to make it.</TE>
<TE>   He did, but finished a woeful 12.08 seconds out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy qualified to make a second run but elected to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy, not Bode Miller, was America's best hope for a giant
slalom medal before the season. Schlopy finished third in last year's
World Cup standings but never got into elite race form after
contracting mononucleosis in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy said he was inspired by Chris Witty, the American
speedskater who returned from mono to win gold in the 1,000 meters.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I couldn't double on the mono side," Schlopy said.</TE>
<TE>   Schlopy lives in Park City and wanted to fare better in front of a
home crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say it's a nightmare; I tried," Schlopy said. "My
family still loves me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's Still Alive, Right?</TE>
<TE>   Miller has a reputation for being able to keep his composure in
pressure situations, but he says no one in ski racing has a lower
pulse rate than Norway's Lasse Kjus, who finished third in Thursday's
men's giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get nervous," Miller said, "but that guy is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's Aimed to Please</TE>
<TE>   Miller was whisked from one interview to another after earning his
second silver medal, but says he doesn't mind the attention.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sort of the way it is," Miller said. "It's almost easier
for me that way. I don't have to organize or think too much. I just
walk around, people ask me to do things and I do them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still at a Loss</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hays and Brian Shimer needed some water after their last
practice runs for the four-man bobsled. Seems like that drought isn't
over just yet.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the victory by Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers in the
inaugural women's bobsled, the U.S. men still haven't won an Olympic
medal since 1956.</TE>
<TE>   "They've only started a streak," said Hays, who came within .03 of
a second of winning bronze in the two-man. "It's still our job to
break the streak. Men haven't won in 46 years. The women did a
wonderful job. Let's hope we can do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   "I told everybody, 'the women won, no pressure on us now,'" added
Shimer, who will retire after the Olympics. "But no, that's not the
case, not at all, and nobody's going to see it that way."</TE>

<TE>   Raise a pint to Clifton Wrottesley, possibly the happiest
fourth-place finisher in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Wrottesley just missed winning Ireland's first medal in the Winter
Games when he finished .42 of a second behind the bronze medalist in
skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   But Wrottesley, who financed much of the trip to Salt Lake City
himself, wasn't disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wonderful," he said. "We've only been at this for 10
years. We're young at this sport."</TE>
<TE>   Ireland doesn't have much snow and its Olympic committee struggles
to raise money for winter sports. Wrottesley wants to help promote
the Winter Games in his country.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's event, he wore an orange, green and white
racing suit that included a large green shamrock on his backside.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing fourth, he said a celebration was on tap. "I'm
sure we might be able to wrestle a bottle up."</TE>

<HD>Lynn's Fall at Sapporo Led to Rise in Popularity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Falling during Olympic competition usually spells disaster for figure
skaters. But Janet Lynn's tumble, and subsequent reaction to her
miscue, during the 1972 Winter Games at Sapporo, Japan, helped
elevate the 18-year-old skater to near-legendary status.</LD>
<LD>   Lynn, a five-time U.S. champion on the strength of her
free-skating talent, already was out of gold-medal contention in
Sapporo because of typically poor marks in what were then-required
compulsory figures. During her free skate performance, she fell
attempting a flying sit spin. Instead of breaking into tears, Lynn's
face broke out in a smile. She regained her composure and won the
bronze medal.</LD>
<LD>   "When I knew I couldn't win [after the compulsory portion of the
competition], I was very distressed and sad," Lynn told the Chicago
Tribune in 1997. "I went back to the Olympic village, and I began
crying and arguing with God, saying, 'I wanted to do it for you, my
nation and my coach. I feel like I am such a huge failure.'</LD>
<TE>   "I gathered myself all I could and thought, 'Perhaps there was a
bigger purpose to my skating, to show God's love and express the gift
for skating he gave me.' Because of that attitude, when I fell, I was
able to keep smiling. The next day, I was an instant heroine in
Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, who has coached many Olympic skaters, once called
Lynn, who was not one of his pupils, "the most beautiful, wonderful
skater who ever lived....She had such flow to the music, such style.</TE>
<TE>   "She flew, she absolutely flew."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn, who lives in suburban Detroit, has been married to Richard
Salomon since 1975 and has five children. She remains a deeply
religious, private person and has kept a low profile since retiring
from skating for a second time in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Born Janet Lynn Nowicki on April 6, 1953, in Chicago, she began
skating at age 2 and won her first national championship, the U.S.
junior title, in 1966 at 12.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, she competed in the Winter Games at Grenoble, France, and
finished ninth. The next year, she won the first of five consecutive
national titles. Before the 1972 Winter Games, she changed her name
to the more marketable Janet Lynn.</TE>
<TE>   After her bronze-medal performance at Sapporo, Lynn signed a
$1.45-million, three-year contract with the Ice Follies, reportedly
making her the highest-paid female athlete in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn, however, was unable to complete the contract. She was
plagued by a chronic cough throughout her amateur career, and her
health problems worsened as she traveled with the ice show. Lynn once
said the show's manager kept an oxygen tank nearby for when she came
off the ice. Her illness eventually was diagnosed as exercise-induced
asthma.</TE>
<TE>   She retired in 1975 and, after three years of worsening health, a
doctor discovered that Lynn's condition was caused by an allergy to
wheat, yeast, food additives and preservatives. She regained her
health after changing her diet and returned to compete in
professional skating competitions, retiring again after winning the
1983 World Professional Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Despite never winning a gold medal or world championship, Lynn has
had an enduring effect on figure skating. Before the 1973 season, the
International Skating Union reduced the value of compulsory figures
from 60% to 30% and made two free-skating programs worth 70%.
Compulsory figures eventually were eliminated.</TE>

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>You forgive the mistakes because they play so hard. You forgive the
sloppiness because they never let the bad things make them give up or
give in. You forgive them the silly fouls and "Oh, no!" shots because
of the "Oh, my!" rebounds from Sam Clancy and "Oh, yeah!" three-point
baskets from David Bluthenthal and the "Oh, wow!" fireworks from
freshman Errick Craven.</LD>
<LD>   USC defeated Stanford, 77-58, Thursday night at Maples Pavilion.
It was the worst home loss for the Cardinal in nine seasons. The
Trojans didn't only beat the Cardinal, they took the heart out of the
Cardinal. They forced surrender from a team that never gives up.</LD>
<LD>   "The team that competed hardest won," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "The team that wanted it most won. They came in
here, took it right at us. They were more physical, got after loose
balls, really played well. This is a very good basketball team."</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans played without point guard Brandon Granville for 13:32
in the first half and USC led Stanford, 31-30, at the break. The
Trojans came out with a furious purpose in the second half, came out
the aggressors, came out with an intensity even though Sam Clancy was
called for his third foul with 59 seconds left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Two seniors who should know better, Granville and Clancy, both had
three fouls by halftime. Granville had gotten his third before some
of the Maples Pavilion fans had found their seats. Granville and
Casey Jacobsen tussled under Stanford's basket, a double bump, a
double foul. Which was OK for Jacobsen because it was his first foul.
Granville couldn't take that chance, but he did. He was called for
his third.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans didn't slow down. Clancy was grabbing every
rebound. Freshman Rory O'Neil was growing up before our eyes, gaining
confidence by the second, making jump shots and playing defense.</TE>
<TE>   From eight points down, the Trojans rallied. They rallied and
wouldn't back down, so who could be upset when Clancy tried to take a
charge against Jacobsen and was called for his third foul just before
halftime?</TE>
<TE>   With his team having gone ahead and with the prospect of Granville
back on the court, it might have been smart for Clancy to back off
and let Jacobsen have his layup. But conceding something is not what
Coach Henry Bibby expects from his players and it is not something
any Trojan is willing to do.</TE>
<TE>   It is the most dangerous characteristic of the Trojans, this
stubborn insistence that full speed is the only speed.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they play too hard, which isn't smart but is better than
the alternative.</TE>
<TE>   When Bluthenthal missed a three-point shot midway through the
second half, Granville got the rebound. Little Granville, the man
with three fouls. He made his way through the lane, under the basket
and took away the offensive rebound while players like 7-foot Curtis
Borchardt and 6-7 Teyo Johnson practically had to scratch their heads
while trying to understand what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't figure out why USC is ranked only 20th," said the man who
runs the press room at Maples.</TE>
<TE>   A good point, but it is only one of the conundrums of this team.</TE>
<TE>   How did the Trojans go ahead of Stanford while their leader sat on
the bench? How did the Trojans keep up the frenetic pace with a short
bench after losing starting center Kostas Charissis because of a
broken bone in his left ankle earlier this week?</TE>
<TE>   How is it Bluthenthal never changes the expression on his face,
not when his shot is wobbly and not when it is as precise as a
computer-guided weapon? How is it Craven is never deterred by his
mistakes and always propelled to the extravagant--the extravagant
steal or dunk or one-handed rebound?</TE>
<TE>   How is it O'Neil, who could pass for a high school freshman with
his wide eyes and gawky walk, could provide a steady hand for the
Trojans when Granville was watching? How is it the Trojans not only
scuffled for every loose ball, but got nearly all of them? How is it
the Trojans were always ready with a body when a Cardinal player
thought he had a clear path to the basket?</TE>
<TE>   Clancy said that he sees a blossoming confidence among teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "We had it at the end of last year when we got on our run," Clancy
said. "It's been slow coming this year. We've had to work the young
guys in. But we have it now."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens with USC at California on Saturday, the Trojans
deserve to be ranked in the top 10 nationally. Stanford was ranked
No. 10 and Montgomery suggested maybe USC and Stanford should trade
places.</TE>
<TE>   Right now the Trojans deserve to be considered for a No. 2 seeding
in the NCAA tournament. Right now the Trojans have produced
consecutive victories against two programs that have been the class
of the Pacific 10 Conference for several seasons, Arizona and
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Bibby would give up none of his emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to win the basketball game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe that's the secret. The Trojans didn't come here to keep
a share of first place in the Pac-10, although they did. The Trojans
didn't come here to polish a national reputation, although they did.
They came to win a basketball game, and they did.</TE>

<HD>Famous Last Words: Rome Picks Radio</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: Sports talk kingpin will give up TV show to
stay with the medium that made him a star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Rome, who has dominated sports talk radio for more than a decade
and more recently became a force in television, has decided to
concentrate on radio.</LD>
<LD>   "What it came down to is, after more than a decade, I still love
doing the radio show," Rome told The Times Thursday. He'll make an
official announcement today.</LD>
<LD>   Rome said he will honor his contract with Fox and continue doing
his nightly show, "The Last Word With Jim Rome," for Fox Sports Net
until the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not shutting the door on television," Rome said. "I
anticipate I'll still have a television presence one day a week. I
just have no idea what that presence will be. I'm leaving my options
open."</TE>
<TE>   His decision to concentrate on radio hardly comes as a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   His nationally syndicated show is heard in 185 markets in the
U.S.--including KXTA (1150) in Los Angeles and delayed on XTRA (690)
in San Diego--and 11 in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   But Rome, who started building his empire by doing traffic reports
for a Santa Barbara radio station while a student at UC Santa
Barbara, also has achieved considerable success in television. "The
Last Word," which Rome began doing in 1999, has provided Fox Sports
Net with a show that gets critical acclaim and national attention.</TE>
<TE>   But now, he said, it's time to cut back.</TE>
<TE>   Rome, 37, has been saying for more than a year that he would
eventually have to choose between radio and television.</TE>
<TE>   In television, "The Last Word" has to compete with similar shows
such as ESPN's "Unscripted With Chris Connelly," formerly "Up Close,"
and "Pardon the Interruption," a new show.</TE>
<TE>   In sports talk radio, Rome rules. He is the most listened-to host
in the nation, with more than 2.5 million listeners weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Rome chose radio over television is because the
Premiere Radio Network, which syndicates his show, made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   Rome and Premiere are now equity partners not only in his show,
but in Internet rights, merchandise and tour stops involving Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is, it's a sweet deal," Rome said.</TE>
<TE>   Rome said a major factor in deciding to cut back was a desire to
spend more time with his wife Janet and 10-month-old son Jake.</TE>
<TE>   "My priority now is my family--my wife and my child," he said.
"The radio show and everything else could go away and I could have
nothing, and they'd still support me.</TE>
<TE>   "The way things are now, I work 14-15 hours every weekday. We
never go out during the week.</TE>
<TE>   "I get home from the TV show around 5:30, spend some time with
Janet and the baby, then by 7:30 I'm up in my office working until
midnight. I'm up at 5 the next morning getting ready for the radio
show."</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect Rome to become a slacker.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never lose my edge," he said. "I've always thought my
greatest strength is that I love to work. I have an enormous capacity
for work.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen other guys lose their edge and they've lost everything
they have. I will not lose my edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what has made the difference for me is that I've also
outworked the next guy."</TE>
<TE>   What also has made his radio show successful is its uniqueness and
variety.</TE>
<TE>   Some listeners may like Rome's glossary, much of which has worked
its way into mainstream conversation. "Smack," "have a take,"
"clones," "pie hole" and "props" are a few examples.</TE>
<TE>   Others might like the calls from Rome's "clones." He calls his
hard-core fans clones because they try to imitate him.</TE>
<TE>   Some like his humor.</TE>
<TE>   And still others may like his interviews. Rome is acknowledged as
one of the best interviewers in sports broadcasting--always prepared
and able to draw out the person he is interviewing.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Rome got his feet wet in broadcasting by doing traffic
reports, he got his own sports talk show in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   He got his first big break in 1990, when he was invited to
interview for a position as weekend update anchor at XTRA.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before Rome had his own show at XTRA, and people
began to notice.</TE>
<TE>   XTRA is also where Rome met Janet. She was a vice president for
Noble Broadcasting, which owned the station. XTRA, now a Clear
Channel station, still carries Rome's show, but on a delayed basis.
His show is heard live in Los Angeles, 9 a.m. to noon, on KXTA,
another Clear Channel station.</TE>
<TE>   Rome broke into television in 1994 as host of "Talk2," then a new
show on a new cable channel, ESPN2. It was on this show Rome had his
most infamous moment.</TE>
<TE>   When quarterback Jim Everett was a guest on the show, Rome kept
calling him "Chris," after Chris Evert. Rome was implying Everett was
soft.</TE>
<TE>   Everett asked him to stop, and Rome called him "Chris" one more
time. Everett then lunged at Rome, knocking over a table.</TE>
<TE>   The public sided with Everett. The general opinion was that Rome
was a wise guy who had it coming.</TE>
<TE>   It was a major bump in the road, but Rome has survived.</TE>
<TE>   After Rome began doing "The Last Word" in 1999 and became a star
in two mediums, he was named to the Sporting News' list of 100 most
powerful people in sports, coming in at No. 78, which was 14 spots
ahead of Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   He was No. 73 in 2000 and climbed to No. 36 last year, when he was
named media person of the year by Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   Off the air, the picture hasn't always been quite as pretty. At
times Rome has been described as aloof, egotistical and difficult to
deal with. But some of his critics also say he has mellowed with age.</TE>

<HD>Mavericks Get Van Exel, LaFrentz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Cuban made a major trade with Denver, adding Nick Van Exel and
Raef LaFrentz to his first-place Dallas Mavericks, while Marc Jackson
went from Golden State to Minnesota for a relatively minor price.</LD>
<LD>   Van Exel, LaFrentz, Avery Johnson and Tariq Abdul-Wahad were
traded from Denver to Dallas for Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway, Donnell
Harvey, cash and a first-round pick in the 2002 draft.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota acquired Jackson from the Warriors for center Dean
Garrett and a future second-round pick.</LD>
<TE>   Those two trades were the only ones made before the NBA's
deadline, bringing this week's total to four. Chicago and Indiana
pulled off a seven-player trade Tuesday, and Boston made a
five-player deal with Phoenix on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Denver General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe had been trying all month
to find a team willing to take Van Exel without having to include
LaFrentz in the deal, but in the end the trade with the Mavericks was
his best remaining option.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second major deadline deal in as many years by Cuban,
the billionaire owner of the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this team, which has probably played at a higher level
than any I ever had," said Coach Don Nelson, whose Mavericks began
the night atop the Midwest Division with a record of 37-17. "But I
don't think our team is any better than the others that we are
fighting for a playoff position.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this may elevate us, and I hope it will give us a real
chance to win our division."</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel and LaFrentz were Denver's two leading scorers, and
Johnson started at point guard for the Nuggets while Van Exel sat out
the last five games with an inflamed elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Tony Dutt said Van Exel agreed to some deferrals in his
current contract. He declined to provide details. Van Exel had said
he was willing to give up some of the guaranteed $26.5 million in the
final two years of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was attractive to the Nuggets because his $20.5 million
salary comes off their salary cap after next season. Howard was
averaging 12.9 points and 7.4 rebounds for the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel, a point guard, will be joining a team that already has
one of the league's best playmakers--All-Star Steve Nash. He also
will be playing for an assistant coach, Del Harris, whom he clashed
with while the two were together several years ago with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Warrior-Timberwolve trade wasn't agreed on until 10 minutes
before the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the guys who were in the room with me and said this
is another typical trading day," Timberwolve General Manager Kevin
McHale said.</TE>
<TE>   But McHale picked up the phone and gave one last call to Warrior
General Manager Garry St. Jean, who said Golden State still had not
found a taker for the 6-foot-10 center who was a first-team
all-rookie selection last season.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who averaged 4.9 points and 2.5 rebounds this season,
plans to join the Timberwolves in San Antonio for their game Saturday
night.</TE>

<HD>Probes Clear Tyson</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Prosecutors unable to solidify two claims of sexual
assault against the former heavyweight champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will not be charged with
sexual assault in two separate cases in Las Vegas, prosecutors said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was simply unclear whether the sexual interaction between each
of the two alleged victims and Mr. Tyson was consensual or forced,"
Clark County prosecutors wrote in a Thursday letter to Las Vegas
police.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said there was no question sexual relations occurred
between Tyson and the two women, but said there was "no possibility
whatsoever" to successfully prosecute Tyson in either case.</LD>
<TE>   "His position, of course, is it's consensual. Their position is,
of course, it's not," Clark County District Attorney Stewart Bell
said. "It's just not clear. It could have been either. I don't
suppose we'll ever really know the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Ten prosecutors reviewed the evidence gathered since police began
investigating Tyson in September.</TE>
<TE>   They said the police investigation was so thorough that there was
nothing more police could have done, or do in the future, that would
warrant charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson himself won't comment, spokesman Scott Miranda said.</TE>
<TE>   Police sought arrest warrants from prosecutors for Tyson on
multiple counts of sexual assault in each case.</TE>
<TE>   In the first case, police began investigating Tyson in
mid-September, after a Las Vegas woman went to a hospital with
injuries that she said were suffered when the boxer raped her at his
home.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy District Attorney Doug Herndon has said the woman had
been in a six-month romantic relationship with Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   The second woman went to police Dec. 28 and reported that she also
had been attacked at Tyson's home in November 2000.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: UCLA remembers headgear, but forgets to
bring its game, losing to Cal, 69-51.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Taking a cue from forward Jason Kapono, every UCLA player donned a
white headband Thursday night against California.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired display of unity or a sign of getting tight around the
temples?</LD>
<LD>   The answer became obvious soon enough.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA turned in its worst performance of a rapidly disintegrating
season, losing, 69-51, before a sellout crowd of 12,000 at Haas
Pavilion, the Bears' deafening, sweltering on-campus arena that
became especially hostile after Matt Barnes knocked Cal guard Shantay
Legans out cold with an forearm shiver late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bruins haven't heard, or felt, the worst yet.</TE>
<TE>   Louder still will be the cries of UCLA followers wondering how
such an experienced team can fall apart so completely, losing seven
of its last 13.</TE>
<TE>   More stifling than ever will be pressure on the Bruins to somehow,
some way find a measure of consistency in time for the Pacific 10
Conference and NCAA tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are playing for seeding in the conference tournament,"
guard Billy Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (17-9, 9-6 in the Pac-10) is alone in sixth place and all but
eliminated from the regular-season conference race with three games
to play. Cal (19-6, 10-5) improved to 16-1 at home after holding the
Bruins to their lowest point total of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to demonstrate chemistry and intensity," UCLA Coach Steve
Lavin said. "We had neither tonight. We shot poorly and allowed Cal
to get the ball inside for easy baskets."</TE>
<TE>   Shooting is usually the least of UCLA's problems. But the Bruins
shot only 42.6% and the deft touch from the perimeter shown by
Kapono, Knight and Barnes much of the season vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono was three for nine, making two of eight from three-point
range and scoring 10 points. He hit a three-pointer less than two
minutes into the game and did not make another shot until three
minutes into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was as good as invisible with six points, no rebounds and
no assists in 26 minutes. Barnes missed eight of 11 shots, totaling
eight points and two rebounds in 30 minutes, and continued his
disturbing trend of committing turnovers with four.</TE>
<TE>   But most distressing was his blow on Legans, who was unconscious
for two minutes and suffered a concussion. Pac-10 officials will rule
today on whether Barnes is suspended for Saturday's game at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Legans grabbed Barnes' jersey after missing a layup with 2:44 to
play and the Bruin forward retaliated by sending both arms into his
face. Barnes was ejected and Cal fans threw pennies at him and yelled
at his family members sitting behind the Bruin bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost control, it was unacceptable and it won't happen again,"
Barnes said. "It was definitely the wrong thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cal Coach Ben Braun: "I know Matt Barnes and I would like to
think it's a moment where Matt lost his head."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes was one of three players to lose the headband at halftime
after UCLA fell behind, 33-18. Although the Bruins played better in
the second half, Cal's Amit Tamir did too, scoring 14 of his 18
points to help keep the lead in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   The only positive for UCLA was center Dan Gadzuric turning in his
third strong game in a row, making seven of seven shots and notching
18 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing went right early for the Bruins. UCLA scored on only eight
of 32 first-half possessions, committing 12 turnovers and making
seven of 21 shots from the field. Gadzuric (10 points) was the only
Bruin to make more than one field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Cal's first 12 points came inside five feet. Center Solomon Hughes
made five of six shots in the half and guard Brian Wethers made four
of five, all from short range.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, even Kapono had stripped off his headband.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all about the team, wearing those," forward T.J. Cummings
said. "But we didn't come out and play basketball the way we were
supposed to."</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Trojans use their full-court defense to
complete season sweep of Stanford with 77-58 win at Maples Pavilion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Stanford tried to prepare for USC's often-devastating full-court
press defense.</LD>
<LD>   After being forced into 27 turnovers the last time the teams met,
the Cardinal practiced five-on-seven this week, trying to get ready
for the organized chaos the press presents.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't work.</LD>
<TE>   The 20th-ranked Trojans used their defensive staple and a
second-half run while throwing in a few more wrinkles to confound No.
10 Stanford again and embarrass the Cardinal, 77-58, Thursday in
front of 7,391 at Maples Pavilion to stay even with Oregon at the top
of the Pacific 10 standings.</TE>
<TE>   USC (19-6, 11-4), which completed its first regular-season sweep
of Stanford (17-7, 10-5) since the 1991-92 season, had 11 steals and
forced 16 turnovers in the Cardinal's worst home loss since 1993. It
was also USC's largest margin of victory against Stanford since the
Trojans' 89-64 win at the Sports Arena in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "In their half-court offense, it was like all they were trying to
do was get the ball to Casey Jacobsen," USC freshman Errick Craven
said. "It was like they wanted him to win the game himself and they
were just happy to break the press."</TE>
<TE>   And after the Cardinal broke the press, a suffocating 2-3 zone
defense was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "We threw a lot of different defenses at them," USC senior point
guard Brandon Granville said. "We were switching up on them and that
was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford shot 46.8% from the field but USC limited the Cardinal to
26.3% (five for 19) from beyond the three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen did have a game-high 23 points but he was 0 for 4 from
three-point territory and Stanford's 7-foot center Curtis Borchardt
was hounded into a 10-point, six-rebound night, 7.1 points and 5.6
rebounds below his averages.</TE>
<TE>   Five Trojans scored in double figures for the fifth time this
season with senior small forward David Bluthenthal continuing his hot
hand with 22 points, making three of six three-pointers. Senior power
forward Sam Clancy had his 11th consecutive double-double with 17
points and 11 rebounds, and Granville had 13 points, seven assists
and one turnover in 24 foul-plagued minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman center Rory O'Neil came off the bench to score 12 points
and Craven had 11 points and four steals.</TE>
<TE>   "We just came out and played our best," Clancy said. "It was
awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The full-court press can produce a rush of points in a hurry when
it's successful, but it can also let the opponent score in bunches
and leave a team susceptible to scoreless droughts.</TE>
<TE>   USC experienced both ends of the spectrum against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   After opening with an 11-5 lead 15:51 into the first half, the
Trojans went cold while Stanford was busy with a 14-0 run over the
next six minutes to go up by 19-11, the biggest lead of the half.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was the Trojans' turn to run.</TE>
<TE>   After unexpectedly starting football tight end-turned-basketball
center Gregg Guenther, Bibby went with a quick lineup of Craven and
Robert Hutchinson in the backcourt, Bluthenthal and Clancy at forward
and O'Neil at center midway through the first half and USC held the
Cardinal to two field goals over a stretch of 10-plus minutes.</TE>
<TE>   And with Borchardt on the bench with two fouls, O'Neil hit a
15-foot jumper to give the Trojans a 31-25 lead with 1:46 remaining
in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Then Stanford closed the gap to 31-30 by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   USC had seen enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans forced Stanford into turnovers on its first two
possessions of the second half, triggering a blistering 10-0 USC run.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal would get no closer than eight points, 45-37, with
15:42 to play.</TE>
<TE>   USC eventually held a game-high 23-point advantage, 77-54, with 51
seconds to play following a Granville layup.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't much mystery to that game," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "The better team won. The team that wanted it more
won. The right team won. They were more physical, they got after
loose balls and they played really well.</TE>
<TE>   "The start of the second half was critical."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby paused when asked if he ever thought his
team could blow out what is normally a fundamentally sound team in
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here wanting to win a basketball game," Bibby said. "You
don't think about a blowout. You think about coming in and playing
hard and putting yourself in a position to win."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>In the Angel clubhouse, Mo Vaughn occupied the locker next to Garret
Anderson. Vaughn has not spoken to Anderson since  August.</LD>
<LD>   As the Angels' full squad took to the field for its first spring
workout Thursday, Vaughn was on the other side of the country, in
training camp with the New York Mets. Vaughn was happy to be there
and, truth be told, the Angels were just as happy he wasn't with
them.</LD>
<LD>   "If a guy doesn't want to be here, it's not good for him to be
here," Anderson said. "That would give us a lot of distractions. We
just don't need that when we're trying to contend."</LD>
<TE>   Vaughn's reputation as a clubhouse leader took a severe bruising
during his three years with the Angels. He signed the richest
contract in franchise history, for $80 million over six years, then
tumbled into the dugout in the first inning of his first game and
wrenched an ankle. He played hurt and played fairly well, hitting 69
home runs and driving in 225 runs in his first two seasons with the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   During his first season, in 1999, he alienated teammates by
remaining in the clubhouse rather than rushing onto the field during
a brawl. He virtually withdrew from the team last season, when he did
not play while rehabilitating after surgery to repair a torn biceps.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Vaughn addressed rumors that he longed to return to
the East Coast by saying, "I made a commitment to do a job here." In
October, he told a Boston radio station he wanted the Angels to trade
him, before bothering to tell the team. Vaughn, who played for the
Boston Red Sox from 1991-98, missed family and friends on the East
Coast and missed the passion of fans there.</TE>
<TE>   "If I make a commitment, I'm going to play out my contract,"
Anderson said. "He had some pretty tough things happen to him. I
don't understand all the things he went through to get to the point
of saying, 'Hey, I can't deal with this any more.'</TE>
<TE>   "But the way he did it was definitely way out of line as far as
the way this business was run."</TE>
<TE>   Because Vaughn did not play last season, the Angels did not expect
to be able to trade him until other teams could assess his health
this spring. By watching him in a private workout, and then agreeing
to acquire him, the Mets not only got themselves a powerful first
baseman but saved the Angels from what would have been a tense
opening to camp, with Vaughn having to explain to teammates why he no
longer wished to play with them.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a bad situation, because a lot of guys didn't
care for what he said," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Anderson is happy that Vaughn is happy. And Anderson is
happier that, in removing Vaughn, the Angels could acquire a
distinguished veteran pitcher in Kevin Appier.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, when you've got a disgruntled player, someone will take
him off your hands, but for nothing," Anderson said. "I'm glad with
the way it turned out for both parties."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of last season, the Angels planned to audition
shortstop prospect Alfredo Amezaga this spring, with the possibility
of Amezaga winning the job and David Eckstein moving to second base.
For now, the Angels have abandoned that plan, concerned that Amezaga
would be overmatched on offense and convinced they cannot sacrifice
offense in their lineup.</TE>
<TE>   So the Angels plan to start the season with Adam Kennedy at second
base, with Benji Gil backing up Eckstein and Kennedy. But, as Kennedy
says, "I think I'm coming in here to win a job."</TE>
<TE>   After a terrific rookie season in 2000, Kennedy regressed on
offense and defense last season, starting with a broken finger in
spring training and evolving to the point where Manager Mike Scioscia
took advantage of the hot bat of Gil by platooning him with Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't anything I had ever experienced," Kennedy said. "I was
unsure of my role most of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia says Kennedy has "the potential to be an outstanding
everyday major league second baseman," but a lineup spot is not
retained on potential. If Kennedy realizes his potential, he believes
he could hit .300 with a lot of doubles and 20 stolen bases. If he
does not, the Angels could trade him to make room for Amezaga later
this season.</TE>
<TE>   That would force Kennedy, who grew up in Riverside, to continue
his career away from friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   "That's always been the icing on the cake," he said. "I've
explained to them that it can't last forever."</TE>

<HD>Watson Takes Over as Dean of Discipline</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Watson was hired Thursday as baseball's new dean of discipline
and said he intends to further crack down when players and managers
and coaches act out of line.</LD>
<LD>   Watson replaces Frank Robinson, who increased fines and
suspensions during his two years in charge of discipline for on-field
conduct. Robinson became manager of the Montreal Expos last week.</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball was way behind the times," Watson said. "We were still
in the 1960s and this was the year 2000. Things were dealt with in
'60s numbers, all the way from fines to days of suspension."</LD>
<TE>   Watson, a former player, coach and general manager, sounded as if
he would increase penalties for beanballs and on-field fights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going backward," he said. "Baseball is still the most
lax of all the major sports in the amount of dollars and maybe the
days suspended."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>It Appears to Be a Win-Win Situation at University</HD>

<LD>All John Kessler did was show up. Now just about all he has to do is
tell the Irvine University boys' tennis team he coaches to do the
same.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans are that good.</LD>
<LD>   "Have I walked into some kind of a situation at Uni, or what?"
said Kessler, who arrived from Long Island, N.Y., in September--just
in time to lead the University girls' tennis team to the Southern
Section Division II semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   He expects the boys' team to go even farther.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some pretty fair teams in New York, but nothing like the
level that this team is at," Kessler said.</TE>
<TE>   University, which was 18-7 and won its second consecutive Division
II title last year, has a lineup that might be the state's deepest.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 1 singles will be senior Aaron Yovan, a Southern Section
singles semifinalist and Ojai tournament Interscholastic Division
finalist last year who plans to play at UCLA in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "There are basically two things I can tell Aaron: When to show up
and, when he holds up the Southern Section trophy, to make sure we're
all in the picture," Kessler said. "The kid is a great player."</TE>
<TE>   Yovan is No. 7 in Southern California and No. 38 nationally in the
U.S. Tennis Assn. boys' 18 division standings.</TE>
<TE>   University's No. 2 singles spot will be filled by either junior
Jack Li, the Southern California boys' 16 division sectional
champion, or Harvard-bound senior Henry Mak, who is back after being
sidelined most of last season because of a blood disorder. Li is No.
16 in boys' 18 SCTA standings.</TE>
<TE>   Another senior, Jeff Lawrence, was Mak's replacement last year and
also could play No. 3 singles or in doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Senior captain Anson Hsu and junior Michael Haier also are likely
to play both singles and doubles, and Kessler is high on freshman
Matt Chou, No. 73 in boys' 16 SCTA standings.</TE>
<TE>   "That collection of seven guys might be one of the best seven in
the country," Kessler said. "Long Island has some top tennis, but to
see that many guys on one team, that's what makes this team special."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of season, the Trojans hope to advance to their fourth
consecutive Division II final. They beat Woodbridge last year and
Brentwood in 2000, and lost to Harvard-Westlake in the 1999 final.</TE>
<TE>   "The expectations are very high. I never expect to lose a match,
period," Kessler said.</TE>
<TE>   "And with this group, the expectations are even higher, and they
should be high. No reason, when we're all together, that we should
lose to anybody."</TE>

<LD>A look at the preseason top 10 boys' tennis teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Irvine University (18-7, SS-Div. II)</LD>
<LD>   Deep and talented Trojans should make their fifth consecutive
appearance in the Southern Section Division II final match.</LD>
<TE>   2. Servite (24-0, SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame-bound Patrick Buchanan, the Southern Section singles
runner-up, is back, along with six others from last season's team
that won the Division IV title.</TE>
<TE>   3. Corona del Mar (23-0, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Sea Kings are relatively young, but brothers Cameron and Carsten
Ball will give opponents double trouble in singles play.</TE>
<TE>   4. Los Alamitos (21-2, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McQuaid and Co. won the Division I title last season. The
Griffins will put an 18-match winning streak on the line in opener
against Corona del Mar on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   5. Harvard-Westlake (17-5, Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Ferlianto tops a strong singles lineup, and Wolverines might
be deeper in doubles, thanks to addition of Josh Lederman, who won
2000 SCTA boys' 14's sectional doubles title, and three top freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   6. Woodbridge (19-6, SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   Brett Van Linge, bound for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, leads last
season's Division II runner-up. The Warriors will play in Division
III this season.</TE>
<TE>   7. Westlake (19-1, SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors have been in five consecutive championship matches,
have seven players back from last season's Division III runner-up
team, adding freshman Ben Steenland and junior transfer Ben Pearson.</TE>
<TE>   8. Esperanza (18-4, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs, who compete in the Sunset League with Los Alamitos,
return eight of their nine players from last season's team that
reached the Division I quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   9. Hoover (11-4, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Excitement abounds with arrival of freshman Sam Tadevosian, the
SCTA boys' 14 sectional runner-up, sophomores Hakop Tadevosian and
Sergy Vagramian, and Dylan Kim, a junior from Korea.</TE>
<TE>   10. Troy (24-4, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Das and five others return from last season's team that
advanced to the Division II semifinals, and they are joined by
several young, talented players.</TE>

<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>All it took for Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii to make a good
first impression on the Dodgers Thursday was a few dozen easy pitches
off a bullpen mound.</LD>
<LD>   "My first thought as I watched him was, 'Now that's a mature
delivery,'" pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "You can tell he's done
it lots and lots of times. It's like an art critic looking at a
painting and saying, 'There's a great painting.'"</LD>
<LD>   A fan might look at Ishii, 28, and think: There's a funky
delivery. After stepping back off the rubber to start his windup,
Ishii brings his hands together at his belt and hesitates for about
two seconds. Then he brings his hands over his head and continues his
delivery.</LD>
<TE>   It's the kind of deceptive wrinkle that many Japanese pitchers,
including Hideo Nomo, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Kazuhiro Sasaki, use in
their deliveries. Considering the success Japanese pitchers have had
in the big leagues, will more young pitchers in the U.S. try to
emulate them?</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to what culture allows," said Colborn, who spent
four years (1990-93) as a pitching coach in Japan. "If kids grew up
watching Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax with that pause in their
deliveries, they would be doing it. But there would have to be a
critical mass of people buying into it before there were wholesale
changes."</TE>
<TE>   This will be a spring of adjustments for Ishii. In Japan,
12-hour-a-day workouts are the norm in spring training. Ishii's first
Dodger workout Thursday was about three hours. Pitchers throw
virtually every day in Japan. Not so in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We practice well into the night in Japan, and here it's only
three or four hours," Ishii said through an interpreter. "But that
will be long enough [to get ready] as long as I do what I have to do
every day."</TE>
<TE>   Before taking the field Thursday, Ishii had a brief chat with
Nomo, the Dodger right-hander. "He told me whether you win or lose,
even if you lose, still try hard," Ishii said. "That was the extent
of our conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, whose 1995 Dodger debut attracted hundreds of Japanese
reporters, photographers and cameramen every day, seems to be glad
Ishii is in camp, because the new Japanese pitcher will deflect
attention from the seven-year veteran. About 45 Japanese media
members were on hand Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little easier for me to concentrate on things on a
day-to-day basis," Nomo said. "A lot of the attention is on Ishii
now."</TE>

<TE>   Kevin Brown threw 40 pitches off a mound Thursday, the first time
he has thrown off a mound since undergoing surgery to repair a torn
flexor muscle in his right elbow last September. Brown mixed in a few
sliders but was not throwing at full speed.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he hasn't been anxious about cutting his fastball
loose, but his biggest challenge this spring will be determining when
and how far to push his arm through the recovery process.</TE>
<TE>   "When I throw in the bullpen, I usually don't throw easy, I like
to go close to game speed," Brown said. "It's not easy for anybody to
figure out the right spot to be in as far as getting your work in.
It's a touchy-feely thing.... The anxiousness comes from trying to
find your level as you increase step by step, and visualizing in your
mind where you should be at."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby, recovering from the same surgery Brown had, threw 60
pitches off a mound Thursday, about 20 of them curves, and appears to
be on course to pitch when the Dodgers begin exhibition games next
week.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks went back to work Thursday, minus their three
Olympians.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Kariya (Canada) and Oleg Tverdovsky (Russia) were expected to
still be busy with their nationalistic pursuit of a gold medal. But
Ruslan Salei (Belarus) also remained in Salt Lake City after his
country's upset of Sweden in Wednesday's quarterfinals.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves open a slim possibility of Duck players bringing home
gold, silver and bronze medals from the games.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm an impartial observer," Coach Bryan Murray said. "But, to me,
the Belarus game shows why hockey is a unique sport. You can have all
the ability and do a great job coaching, but there is still a
goaltender out there."</TE>
<TE>   Belarussian goalie Andrei Mezin stopped 44 of 47 shots in the 4-3
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Salei said the victory was like winning the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," Salei told reporters in Salt Lake. "Nobody
thought we could possibly beat Sweden. But anything can happen in one
game. It's overwhelming. It's history. They may make this a national
holiday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NHL teams are not allowed to make any deals during the Olympic
break, but the Ducks are letting other teams know who is available
off their roster.</TE>
<TE>   Last month General Manager Pierre Gauthier sent out a list of 10
players that he would consider trading. Defenseman Keith Carney is
now on the block, according to hockey sources.</TE>
<TE>   Carney, acquired in an off-season trade, was the big reason for
the Ducks' rapid improvement on defense. His stay-at-home style,
combined with underrated offensive abilities, would seem to make him
a keeper. Yet he is also a player who could bring a considerable
return.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Neil Drysdale won the Kentucky Derby two years ago with the
brilliant Fusaichi Pegasus, who, unfortunately, didn't do much after
his big victory at Churchill Downs and was retired before the end of
2000.</LD>
<LD>   Whether Drysdale has another prospect for the world's most famous
race could be determined today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday Break, a son of Forty Niner who was bred in Japan, will try
two turns for the first time in his career against four other rivals
in the $54,000 allowance contest, the seventh of eight races today.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Koji Maeda, Sunday Break was second in his debut at
Hollywood Park on Nov. 25, losing by a head to Taillevent.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 26 at Santa Anita, the bay colt was third as the 7-5
favorite. About a month later, he won a seven-furlong race by 41/2
lengths as the 2-1 choice.</TE>
<TE>   If Sunday Break handles the extra distance--today's race is 1 1/16
miles--he could continue on the road to the Derby, a race that lacks
a standout and where the current local front-runner, Siphonic, has
some questions regarding his condition.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the field are Raven Power, a son of Known Fact who was
beaten by a neck in his two-turn debut on Jan. 30; Azillion, who was
third in his first start in this country in the same race; Gold
Dollar and Hot Contest.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A full field of 3-year-olds will race 11/8 miles
on the turf in the $100,000 Palm Beach Handicap at Gulfstream Park in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Kimmel. The high-percentage trainer has won with
12 of 32 at Gulfstream.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Cliff Delima. A trainer who won with 18% of his
starters last year, Delima is struggling at Golden Gate Fields. He
had only one victory from his first 51 starters at the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three singling Fresh Tarte in the
third, using All Grace, Imaginary Gold, Delavallade and Fiddlin Devon
in the fourth and Estrella Prisa and Jorrocks in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/123. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $20/$745.60. Total money bet: $716.</TE>

<LD>The Kings' first practice since the NHL's 12-day Olympic break began
Feb. 14 was anything but normal Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   With Coach Andy Murray still experiencing symptoms of
post-concussion syndrome at his family's home in Faribault, Minn.,
and four Olympians (Adam Deadmarsh, Aaron Miller, Mattias Norstrom
and Mikko Eloranta) not due to rejoin the team until Tuesday, the
King workout had a certain playground-like feel at the team's
HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   "The first day is to just get the kinks out," said assistant coach
Mark Hardy, who along with fellow assistants Dave Tippett and Ray
Bennett conducted Thursday's practice in Murray's absence. "After
you've had that long of a layoff, it's tough. You have to first get
your legs and your hands going and then over the next few days, we
have to get our minds back into it."</LD>
<TE>   After being involved in a single-vehicle accident Friday in rural
Wisconsin, Murray had planned to travel to Los Angeles on Wednesday,
but doctors advised him not to travel until today. Murray suffered a
mild concussion, four broken ribs, a separated left shoulder and
several lacerations from his accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who do not play again until Tuesday at Columbus, did
plenty of skating Thursday and finished their workout with a spirited
three-on-three game. But because the team's coaching staff wants to
make sure the players are healthy for the remainder of the season,
the drills definitely lacked some intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Winger Ziggy Palffy competed for Slovakia in the Olympics and did
not have to report back to the Kings until next week but that didn't
keep him from practicing with his teammates Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to see Ziggy having some fun out there," Hardy said.</TE>

<HD>Outlaw Lasoski Ready to Take Flight at Perris</HD>

<LD>Tony Stewart won't be at Perris Auto Speedway Saturday night, he'll
be in Rockingham, N.C., for a Winston Cup race, but the Dude will be
there with Stewart's sprint car when the World of Outlaws make an
appearance in their outrageous winged machines.</LD>
<LD>   The Dude, Danny Lasoski, is the defending Outlaws champion in
Stewart's No. 20 Eagle. Lasoski, who lives in Dover, Mo., won only
four main events to 16 for Mark Kinser last year, but his year-long
consistency enabled him to edge two-time champion Kinser by 30 points
in the closest championship race since the Outlaws were formed 24
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Lasoski's nickname doesn't come from his lifestyle, it comes from
the time his grandfather saw him for the first time and said, "That
is my little Dude."</LD>
<TE>   Last Friday, Lasoski drove to a sixth-place finish in the
International Race of Champions at Daytona, a race won by Stewart. It
was Lasoski's first race on pavement, but he finished ahead of NASCAR
drivers Bobby Labonte, Sterling Marlin, Kevin Harvick and Dale
Jarrett and Indianapolis 500 winners Buddy Lazier and Helio
Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny's excited about driving the [Outlaws] car this year,"
Stewart said. "Last year at this point we were playing catch-up. We
were just trying to get everything ready and organized to contend,
let alone defend a title like we are this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have cars built, whereas last year at this time we
were still building them. We didn't even have a trailer. This year we
have the same trailer and it's stocked and ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   Lasoski, 43, won the last Outlaws main event at Perris in February
2000. Last year's scheduled race was rained out.</TE>
<TE>   Kinser, who won the title in 1996 and 1999, won the first five
Pennzoil World of Outlaws races held at Perris beginning Nov. 1,
1996. He drives a Mopar for his father, famed crew chief and car
builder Karl Kinser.</TE>
<TE>   Also entered Saturday night are Steve Kinser, 46, Mark's cousin
and a 16-time Outlaws champion who was voted "Greatest Sprint Car
Driver of All Time" two years ago; Sammy Swindell, 46, a three-time
champion; and Joe Saldana, holder of the Perris track record of
14.070 seconds around the half-mile clay oval.</TE>
<TE>   The Outlaws open their 66-event season tonight at Kings Speedway
in Hanford.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup</TE>
<TE>   Who is this slow-talking Virginian with the syrupy accent who was
the last one standing when they finished the Destruction Derby 500
last Sunday in Daytona Beach?</TE>
<TE>   Ward Burton is 41 and finally escaped the shadow of younger
brother Jeff when he won stock car racing's biggest prize. In 1999,
he finished second three times, all to brother Jeff.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 500, he had been named honorary chairman of the
NRA-Beeman Grand Prix for marksmen with physical disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   He comes by the honor deservedly. While attending Hargrave
Military Academy, he was ranked No. 1 on the school's rifle team.</TE>
<TE>   After attending Elon College in North Carolina, Burton spent two
years in a log cabin, living off the land by hunting, trapping and
fishing for his food. Today, he operates the Ward Burton Wildlife
Foundation, which purchases parcels of land in an effort to conserve
and protect wildlife habitats.</TE>
<TE>   The only personal vehicle he owns is a V10 Dodge pickup.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes me where I want to go on the farm, it takes my family
wherever we want to go, it's all I ever needed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be racing Sunday at Rockingham, N.C., the track where he won
his first Winston Cup race in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's philosophy for driving a race car: "Drive it like you
stole it."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Davis, his car owner, is cut from a similar cloth. He is a
self-proclaimed hillbilly from Batesville, Ark., who grew up dreaming
along with neighbor Mark Martin about someday coming to Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hillbillies coming down here the first time in 1987,"
Davis said. "To come down and be able to do it and then be this
successful is pretty special for a guy from Arkansas."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is the NASCAR owner who discovered Jeff Gordon and plucked
him from the open-wheel ranks of the U.S. Auto Club in 1992 to drive
a Ford in the Busch Grand National series. Gordon left for Rick
Hendrick and Chevrolet when Hendrick discovered that Davis did not
have a signed contract with Gordon and stole him away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Petty was not pleased with the way the 500 played out.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Daytona was an exceptional race until the last 40
laps," said the third-generation driver. "Then in a lot of ways it
was an embarrassment to Winston Cup racing. In my opinion, to have
the greatest drivers in the world just running into each other ... to
bill ourselves as a sport that we are and to tear up more cars at
Daytona than will be torn up at Martinsville and Bristol, either one
of the short tracks that are known for beating and bashing, is a
little bit of an embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   "To have that few cars running at the end of the biggest race of
the year ... I didn't notice any one driver or any one group doing it
more than they've done in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think the drivers respect the cars or respect each
other they way they did 15 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Glover, team manager for Chip Ganassi Racing, says Sterling
Marlin got a bad rap when he was criticized for getting out of his
car during a red flag stop and pulling his fender off the tire.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sterling and Jeff Gordon got together in turn 1, the right
front fender on Sterling's car was rubbing just bad enough that he
was probably going to cut down the tire," Glover said.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't take that chance and put him and everyone else in
danger. We were going to have to come in one way or the other so we
had Sterling jump out and check out the damage during the red flag."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin, leading at the time, was penalized and sent to the rear of
the pack and finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's recipe for eliminating all the blocking that led to two
multi-car accidents Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   "Take away their rearview mirrors and ban spotters. It's the
spotters who tell drivers where and when to block."</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   John Force will be after his 100th national event victory Sunday
at Firebird Raceway in Phoenix in his Castrol Mustang funny car. He
got No. 99 two weeks ago at Pomona. Next best in the National Hot Rod
Assn. list is pro stock driver Bob Glidden with 85. Force, 52, has
won the last three races at Firebird and seven of the last eight....
Buzz Calkins, winner of the first Indy Racing League event in January
1996 at Orlando, Fla., has retired as a driver with hopes of becoming
a team owner.</TE>
<TE>   Vintage cars will be welcome to run Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. on the new quarter-mile paved track at Willow Springs Raceway in
Rosamond. Information: (661) 269-2700.</TE>
<TE>   Mike LaRocco, winner of the second EA Supercross at Anaheim
Stadium, is expected to be out eight to 10 weeks after breaking his
right wrist in an accident last Saturday night in Minneapolis when he
and Travis Pastrana tangled. Ricky Carmichael won his third race and
passed LaRocco for second place in points behind France's David
Vuillemin. Round 8 will be in Atlanta on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   When the Rolex Sports Car Series comes to California Speedway on
March 22-24, its program will include 30-minute Ferrari Challenge
races on Friday and Saturday, the 400-mile Rolex series on Saturday
and a 250-mile Grand-Am Cup race at 8 a.m. Sunday before the 400-mile
IRL race.</TE>

<HD>Something Fishy About Making This a Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard Lopez of Paramount on Tuesday cast some Crave Bait into
Chris' Pond at Santa Ana River Lakes and walked away with a monstrous
trout that could land him in the state's freshwater fishing record
book.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez pulled from the small Anaheim fishery a rainbow weighing
24.09 pounds, a catch that is being submitted to the Department of
Fish and Game for state record consideration. The current record is a
23-pound rainbow caught in January 2000 at Lake Natoma in Northern
California.</LD>
<LD>   A remarkable catch? That's open to debate.</LD>
<TE>   The fish Lopez caught was grown at a private hatchery in Northern
California to record size before it was stocked. It was among two or
three such fish planted in the last week in hopes that one would be
caught during a  big-fish promotion.</TE>
<TE>   One was, and as a result the concessionaires at Santa Ana River
Lakes  have landed a valuable marketing tool. Or they will have, if
and when the record is approved by the Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   Should such a catch qualify for a record?</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is beaming beneath the spotlight, saying that an angler has
to catch a record-sized fish, regardless of when it was stocked, and
pointing out that his whopper took 30 minutes to subdue.</TE>
<TE>   A point well made.</TE>
<TE>   Still, what we also have is a fish that might not even have had a
day to get used to its surroundings, to become the slightest bit
wary. The glob of Crave was probably the first thing it had eaten in
its new home.</TE>
<TE>   What Lopez's catch illustrates is that hatcheries are pumping out
bigger trout every year. And that, in California anyway, they can
produce record-sized trout for whoever  is willing to pay the price.</TE>

<HD>Boats Set Sail as Halibut Make Their Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Zammit came all the way from New Boston, Mich., to go halibut
fishing aboard Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray. He caught a
19-pounder and proudly proclaimed that "New Boston rocks!"</LD>
<LD>   Danny Wi traveled a much shorter distance, from Costa Mesa, to
fish aboard the landing's Betty G. He caught a 17-pounder and
declared, much less emphatically, "This was my lucky day."</LD>
<LD>   This was Saturday, the oval-shaped bookends being reeled in off
Malibu and Manhattan Beach, respectively, making it a lucky day not
only for the two fishermen but for a fleet that, during the long,
cold winter months, had been sorely lacking in passengers.</LD>
<TE>   "This is right on time, or maybe even a little late if anything,"
Jeff Jessop, skipper of the Betty G, said of the seasonal influx of
halibut into sprawling Santa Monica Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Jessop's 13 passengers boated only seven legal-sized halibut--22
inches or longer--but that's a good day by halibut-fishing standards.
They also caught about 50 "shorts," which is an indication that there
are lots of fish already in the bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Spray's 27 anglers, fishing 15 miles north of the Betty G,
caught only eight legal halibut but also reeled in dozens of shorts,
which is an indication of how widespread the migration is.</TE>
<TE>   'Barn Door' Prospects</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest "barn doors" caught so far this season was a
41-pounder taken a month ago aboard the Betty G. It was caught on a
sardine but in its gullet were a couple of much larger mackerel,
showing how voracious the larger halibut can be.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, several line-class world records have been set by
halibut fishermen in the bay, topped by a 50-pounder caught on
16-pound-test monofilament in 1996. The all-tackle world record is a
58-pound 9-ounce halibut caught at Santa Rosa Island in June 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Derby Dope</TE>
<TE>   The balmy forecast this weekend bodes well for those planning to
drift for halibut.</TE>
<TE>   And for the hundreds planning on participating in any of the
upcoming mega-derbies, well, they can only hope for weather this
nice. In past years, either or both of the bay tournaments have at
times been blasted by wind and rain.</TE>
<TE>   With this in mind, the Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby has been
pushed back to April 27-28. "We did that because of what happened
last year [with the weather]," tournament chairman John Bourget said.</TE>
<TE>   What he failed to take into consideration, though, was that the
Eastern Sierra general trout season opener is April 27. This is bound
to present a dilemma for those who like to fish both. Cost of the
derby is $60 an angler. Derby hotline: (310) 450-5131.</TE>
<TE>   The Marina del Rey Halibut Derby, which drew nearly 1,000
participants last year, is taking its chances with Mother Nature and
sticking to its April 6-7 schedule. Cost is $60 an angler ($25 for
those 15 or younger). Hotline: (310) 827-4855.</TE>
<TE>   New this year is the Shoreline Yacht Club/976-TUNA Charity Halibut
Derby, held outside the bay from Pt. Fermin to Huntington Pier,
scheduled May 4. Cost is $35 an angler. Hotline: (562) 435-4093.</TE>
<TE>   All three derbies, which boast an array of prizes and feature
optional team competitions, benefit various youth fishing programs.</TE>
<TE>   On the Waterfront</TE>
<TE>   Bill Poole and Frank LoPreste are now majority owners of Point
Loma Sportfishing as well of nearby Fisherman's Landing, having
purchased the former from Dan Sansome, who is retiring.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there have been changes in ownership of two of the
most popular boats in the huge San Diego fleet. The American Angler,
previously owned by Sansome, has been sold to Sam Patella and Brian
Kiyohara. The Pacific Queen, previously owned by Patella and
Kiyohara, has been sold to Bill Cavanaugh.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the American Angler specializes in multiday long-range
trips, the Pacific Queen is arguably the Southland's premier
overnight boat, though it occasionally runs longer trips. Cavanaugh,
formerly a skipper on the Excel, said there won't be much of a change
in the boat's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   A Cloud Over Crowley</TE>
<TE>   With the Eastern Sierra trout opener only two months away, they're
scrambling like mad to get things in order at Crowley Lake Fish Camp.
As mentioned here last week, a Jan. 29 fire destroyed a large storage
facility and everything in it, including boats, motors and other
equipment, causing $1 million worth of damage.</TE>
<TE>   John Frederickson, whose company, Sierra Recreation, operates the
concession, said this week that the fire was actually the second
disaster to have struck at the popular Eastern Sierra fishery. A few
days earlier, 90-mph winds swept through the region, tearing up a
column of docks and causing more than $100,000 worth of damage.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fire, it also destroyed the Crowley Lake Fish Camp
booth and more than 4,000 color brochures that were going to be
brought to the Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and Boat Show, March 6-10 at
the Long Beach Convention Center. So the show will go on without much
in the way of representation from Crowley.</TE>
<TE>   The 'Early Opener'</TE>
<TE>   There is an Eastern Sierra trout opener before the opener, and
it's known simply as the Early Opener in southern Inyo County.</TE>
<TE>   On March 2, the streams from Independence Creek south on the west
side of U.S. 395 will open to angling. Most will be well-stocked and
include rainbow trout to about five pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Kicking off the Early Opener is the Diaz Lake Trout Derby,
sponsored by the Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce. Details: (877)
253-8981.</TE>
<TE>   Turnaround Time</TE>
<TE>   Gray whales have finished their business in Baja's lagoons and
have begun their northbound migration to their home waters in the
Bering Sea. For Southland whale watchers, the numbers of leviathan
passers-by should be increasing by the day, peaking in mid- to late
March.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate the turnaround, the L.A. Chapter of the American
Cetacean Society is holding its annual "Whale of a Day" festival
March 2 from 10 a.m.- 4 p.m. at the Point Vicente Lighthouse on the
Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights include a lighthouse open house, kids activities, arts
and crafts, information booths and, of course, a chance to see whales
and other marine mammals frolicking offshore.</TE>

<LD>Nobody seems to stand a chance when they visit McArthur Court these
days.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Ridnour scored a career-high 25 points, and No. 15 Oregon set
school records for  three-point baskets made and  points scored in a
Pacific 10 Conference game Thursday night with a 115-77 victory over
Washington State at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks (19-7, 11-4 Pac-10) remained tied for first place in the
conference with USC. They are 15-0 at home this season, winning by an
average margin of more than 25 points.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we've already peaked in terms of understanding how hard
you have to play and how committed you have to be to have success,"
Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "I've never had a team so focused."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Moore scored 34 points to lead the Cougars (5-19, 1-15),
who are 0-10 on the road this season.</TE>
<TE>   J Locklier had 12 points and seven rebounds for Washington State,
which has lost 17 of 18 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Jones scored 18 points, and Luke Jackson had 17 for
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who lead the country in three-point percentage, were 16
for 26 from long range, including a stretch of six consecutive in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Every Oregon player scored as the Ducks shot 54% from the field,
62% from three-point range and 93% from the free-throw line, all
season highs.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out with a lot of energy and we were ready to win this
one," Ridnour said.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive possessions in the second half, Ridnour hit two
three-pointers and found Robert Johnson with a behind-the-back pass,
bringing the sellout crowd to its feet chanting "Luke! Luke! Luke!"</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Lever made a three-pointer with 5:15 left in the first
half to cap a 20-6 run and put Oregon ahead 33-19.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon record for  points scored is 121, set against Portland
in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The previous school record for  three-pointers was 15 against West
Florida in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 68, Oregon State 63--Curtis Allen scored 15 points as
the Huskies put themselves in the driver's seat for the eighth and
final spot in the Pac-10 tournament by defeating the Beavers at
Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn scored 14 points and David Dixon had 12 for the Huskies
(10-16, 4-12), who ended a five-game losing streak to Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Ricci scored 24 points and Brandon Payton had 19 for the
Beavers (11-15, 3-12).</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time Washington Coach Bob Bender defeated his
former assistant, Oregon State Coach Ritchie McKay, in four tries.</TE>

<LD>Jose Osorio of La Puente Nogales High could not have picked a better
time to double his season goal total than against Riverside Poly in a
Southern Section Division II quarterfinal Thursday at Nogales.</LD>
<LD>   Osorio, a junior forward, scored two goals, the second of which
gave Nogales a 4-3 victory in double overtime and propelled the
Nobles into a semifinal against top-seeded Los Alamitos on Tuesday at
a site to be determined by a coin flip.</LD>
<LD>   Osorio headed in a corner kick from Mynor Lima with 31/2 minutes
left in sudden-death overtime after the Nobles (20-4-2) had trailed,
2-0, at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   His first goal (and third of the season) came off a crossing pass
from Jesse Luna and tied the score, 2-2, with less than a minute left
in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Nogales, which beat Riverside Poly on penalty kicks in last year's
quarterfinals, took a 3-2 lead with four minutes left in the first
20-minute overtime when Gonzalo Alvarez scored on a left-footed shot
off a cross from Luna.</TE>
<TE>   But fourth-seeded Poly (24-4-1) tied it a minute later on a goal
by Brett Hiroto.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Poly (19-1-1) suffered a big loss eight minutes into the
first overtime when Joel Mojica was knocked unconscious and suffered
a broken nose while going up for a ball with Nogales defender Juan
Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   The game was stopped for about 35 minutes as Mojica was tended by
coaches and paramedics before being taken to County-USC Medical
Center by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   He was released later Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Asafo-Agyei Is Driven by a Dream</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A race that initially caused him nightmares has turned into a source
of motivation for Raphael Asafo-Agyei of Chino Don Lugo High.</LD>
<LD>   Asafo-Agyei, who is entered in the boys' 500- and 880-yard runs in
the L.A. Invitational indoor track and field meet at the Sports Arena
on Saturday, cost himself a state title in the 800 meters last June
when he threw up his arms in celebration with five meters left in the
race at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Asafo-Agyei, who has signed with USC, appeared to have the race
won after passing leader Matt Bates of Los Gatos with 40 meters to
go. But he eased up just enough in his final strides to allow Tykie
Harris of San Gorgonio to edge past him and win in a slowish 1 minute
53.80 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Harris had finished well back of Asafo-Agyei in the Southern
Section Division I final and Masters Meet the previous two weeks, but
his exaggerated lean at the finish line gave him a victory margin of
.07 seconds in the state final.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nightmares about that race for a little while," Asafo-Agyei
said with a laugh. "I honestly thought I had it won, but then when he
dove across the finish line, I was really surprised. I didn't know
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Asafo-Agyei, the son of a Ghanan father and a half-Scottish,
half-Ghanan mother, was disappointed by his "stupidity," but hasn't
been dwelling on it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the 6-foot-3, 175-pound senior has watched videotape of
the state final numerous times.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done it just to remind myself what happened," he said. "To
see what I could have done differently in the race.... There is a
part of me that is sad that it happened, but there is also a part of
me that is glad it happened because I learned a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Asafo-Agyei's performances certainly didn't suffer after his first
loss of the season.</TE>
<TE>   He ran 1:51.86 to finish fifth against a national-class field in
the Golden West Invitational at American River College in Sacramento
a week after the state meet and clocked a career-best 1:50.70 to
finish sixth in the National Scholastic outdoor championships at
North Carolina State a week later.</TE>
<TE>   He is the third-fastest returning 800 runner in the nation and
hopes to run in the 1:46-1:47 range this year.</TE>
<TE>   The national high school record of 1:46.45 was set by Michael
Granville of Bell Gardens in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "His workouts have been phenomenal," Don Lugo Coach Don Salyers
said about Asafo-Agyei.. "He's feeling really, really good. He's much
stronger than he was last year."</TE>
<TE>   Asafo-Agyei expects to run in three or four events, counting
relays, in the L.A. Invitational, but he's not sure if he will run in
both the 500 and the 880.</TE>

<HD>LeDuc Chose a Refresher Course</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven league titles in 15 seasons. Four Southern Section
championships. Fourteen consecutive seasons of 23 or more victories.</LD>
<LD>   Mike LeDuc of Glendora High isn't just any coach. He's a professor
of basketball, a man who belongs in the upper echelon when it comes
to rating the best of the best in the high school coaching
profession.</LD>
<LD>   What separates him aren't the championships his teams have won or
the three prolific scorers--Tracy Murray, Cameron Murray and Casey
Jacobsen--he once tutored. It was a decision he made off the court.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years ago, at age 37, LeDuc gave up his coaching position--for
one season.</TE>
<TE>   "Glendora has one of the best followings of any public school in
the CIF," LeDuc said at the time. "But with that kind of support come
expectations that nothing less than winning is accepted. The wear and
tear over the years takes a toll. I felt I just needed some time to
stand back and catch my breath."</TE>
<TE>   LeDuc wasn't burned out. He still loved to coach and thrived on
competition. He was just tired and wanted time to reflect. He spent
the season watching Glendora games while serving as athletic
director.</TE>
<TE>   He returned the next season with renewed vigor and a greater
appreciation for what his job truly required.</TE>
<TE>   "It changed me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gone were his annual goals of winning a league title or a Southern
Section championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are goals I don't have any more and haven't had for 10
years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He began to understand that if he got his players to fulfill their
potential, everything else would fall into place.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing for coaches after an extended time of coaching
to take a year off," he said. "It brings good vision why we're here.
These are high school kids, not NBA players. It's a learning
experience. I think by stepping out of the competitive experience we
live in, you can see that better.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back understanding that doing the best you can is good
enough. You don't have to win every game. You can make mistakes. It's
not about winning and losing."</TE>
<TE>   His teams are stronger than ever. Glendora won the Division I-AA
championship last season with no big-name players.</TE>
<TE>   The Tartans (26-2) are in position to win the I-A title this
season with no Murrays and no Jacobsens.</TE>
<TE>   Three seniors--5-foot-11 Larry Monroe, 6-6 Spencer Foster and 6-2
Michael Mehanna--have helped Glendora reach tonight's quarterfinals
against Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   LeDuc has created a program that brings out the best in his
players. Glendora is a one-high school town in an upper-middle class
community. Players walk through the gym as freshmen and are trained
until the moment they have to turn in their uniforms as graduated
seniors. They're educated with values and fundamentals that never
leave them.</TE>
<TE>   "When they show up as freshmen, we teach them a system," LeDuc
said. "It's a simple system, yet it takes a lot of repetition to be
good at."</TE>
<TE>   Glendora players learn to play specific roles. Somehow, since the
day he arrived in 1986, LeDuc has been able to convince players to
sacrifice for the good of the team. Maybe it had something to do with
luck. Tracy Murray was a sophomore in LeDuc's first season as coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It was easy for players to buy into getting the ball to him as
good as Tracy was," LeDuc said. "In my opinion, he was the most
dominant offensive player in the history of California [basketball].
Once your kids have bought in, tradition takes over."</TE>
<TE>   There are other LeDuc trademarks. He's not a screamer, although he
does raise his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you yell too much, you lose a lot of impact," he said.
"I try to reserve it to when it can do something positive."</TE>
<TE>   He goes through many games without using any timeouts. He has lots
of plays he can call out for special situations. He doesn't want to
give opponents time to regroup and he expects his players to stay
composed.</TE>
<TE>   Three of LeDuc's former assistants qualified teams for this
season's I-A playoffs. Two of them, Ty Stockham of San Bernardino San
Gorgonio and Yancy Dodson of Riverside Poly, met in Tuesday's second
round. San Gorgonio won.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated to see either one lose," LeDuc said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's semifinals, Glendora could face Thousand Oaks, which
has already knocked off former LeDuc assistant Gordon Hamlow of
Rowland and, to advance, must defeat San Gorgonio tonight. By then,
the Tartans will have seen many of LeDuc's strategies from his former
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   But the master still has plenty of tricks.</TE>
<TE>   LeDuc is preparing for a new challenge next season. He's 47 and
his son, Matthew, will arrive as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a regular kid who wants to play basketball," LeDuc said.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew couldn't have a better coach and father to learn from.</TE>

<KH>BIG WEST ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Irvine Stays in the Title Race</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Needing to win to stay alive in the Big West Conference
regular-season championship race, UC Irvine got its usual strong
contributions from Jerry Green and Jordan Harris against Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   But it was sophomore Matt Okoro who provided the surprising spark
in the Anteaters' 77-63 victory before 2,273 at the Bren Center. The
reserve forward had a season-high 10 points in 25 minutes to help
Irvine (19-8, 12-4) pull within a half-game of idle Utah State with
two games remaining.</LD>
<LD>   Green had 23 points and seven assists and Harris added 19 points
and 10 rebounds. But the talk was all about Okoro, who played a key
role in the Anteaters' surge after leading by one at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   "Matt Okoro was a big spark obviously," Irvine Coach Pat Douglass
said. "We've been hoping he'd get more relaxed out there. We've been
having high expectations for him and all season he's been a little
tight."</TE>
<TE>   Okoro helped trigger a decisive 13-0 run early in the second half.
After Harris' three-point basket broke a 39-39 tie, Okoro dunked a
missed shot by Adam Parada. Green then set up the forward for a layup
and another dunk and the Anteaters suddenly had a 52-39 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see Matt doing that stuff, it gets the fans crazy and
brings us more in focus," Harris said. "It gets us more juiced."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine shut down Cal Poly (14-9, 8-7) in the second half. The
Mustangs made only seven field goals and shot 26.9%. Varnie Dennis
and Brandon Beeson were held to eight points after combining for 24
in the first half. Beeson had only six of his 21 points after
halftime and Dennis was held to only two after scoring nine in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State 77, UC Santa Barbara 74--The 49ers (11-16, 7-9)
scored eight consecutive points to erase a four-point deficit with
three minutes to play, then made four of six free throws in the
waning moments and upset the Gauchos (15-9, 9-6) in a heated game
before 1,912 at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Johnson had 18 points and Travis Reed added 15 for the 49ers,
but Cody Pearson was key with nine rebounds, seven offensively.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara, which got a three-pointer from Branduinn Fullove
with four seconds to play to pull within 76-74, had a chance to tie
at the end, but an attempted buzzer-beater by Jacoby Atako missed
bounced off the front of the rim.</TE>
<TE>   After the physical game, which included a technical foul on Adama
Ndiaye of Santa Barbara and an intentional foul on Long Beach's Kevin
Roberts, tempers flared and a shoving match broke out. Players
converged, but no punches were thrown.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hull led Santa Barbara with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CS Northridge 73, UC Riverside 64--Ian Boylan scored 25 points and
Markus Carr broke out of a shooting slump and scored 18 as the
Matadors (9-15, 8-7) ended a five-game losing streak before 588 at
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Boylan, a 6-foot-6 freshman from Norman, Okla., made nine of 13
shots, including four of six three-pointers to help Northridge win
for the first time since Jan. 26, when the Matadors defeated
Riverside, 84-69, at Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the best games we've ever had a freshman play
here," Northridge Coach Bobby Braswell said. "He carried us."</TE>
<TE>   Carr, who had made only three of 23 shots in the previous two
games while nursing a toe injury, made seven of 10 shots against
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Bell led Riverside (8-15, 5-10) with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 67, Cal State Fullerton 61-- The Titans (4-20, 1-14)
stumbled through their eighth consecutive loss before 1,521 at Titan
Gym, falling behind, 7-0, after the first three minutes and remaining
in single digits until five minutes remained in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans managed to cut an 18-point deficit to six with 1:20
left, but could get no closer.</TE>
<TE>   With Babacar Camara getting in early foul trouble and forward Josh
Fischer sidelined for the season because of a heart condition,
Fullerton went mostly with a four-guard lineup. Senior guard David
Castleton, who missed six conference games because of academic
deficiencies, played 22 minutes for Fullerton, the most since the
season opener against Pepperdine, and scored a season-high nine
points. Pape Sow led the Titans with 18 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Preston and McLemore had 17 points each to lead Pacific
(16-9, 8-7).</TE>

<HD>A Grass Act Is in Store</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The search for a suitable grass court has taken Patrick McEnroe from
Houston to Phoenix to Southern California, leaving no blade unturned
for the upcoming Davis Cup quarterfinal against Spain.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, McEnroe, the U.S. Davis Cup captain, was at Mission
Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage and said it was "one of the best
grass courts I've hit on." Previously, he and other USTA officials
were at PGA West in La Quinta, Desert Highlands Tennis Club in
Scottsdale, Ariz., and Westside Tennis Club in Houston, which is also
the site of the U.S. Clay Court Championships in late April.</LD>
<LD>   This fast-paced tour has been necessary because the deadline for
site and surface selection for the quarterfinal is next week. The
U.S.-Spain quarterfinal is scheduled for April 5-7. The original
deadline was Monday, but USTA officials received an extension until
Wednesday. If necessary, another extension could be granted, but
McEnroe wants to make a decision.</LD>
<TE>   The last time the Davis Cup was in Southern California was in
April 2000. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi played for McEnroe's older
brother, John, at the Forum in a 3-2 victory against the Czech
Republic. Usually, the USTA prefers to move the matches around the
country, and its executives also are aware of the scheduling
proximity to the men's and women's event at Indian Wells, which
starts in less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Grass, however, limits the options in April.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, Houston is the front-runner, unless something
changes in the next couple of days," Patrick McEnroe said Thursday.
"It's a nice setup. I certainly feel that would be the best spot for
this particular match. Again, once we get the set of proposals in
writing, we'll have to see what people say."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe's presence on the site inspection trips is an indication
of his interest and commitment. For the first-round match in Oklahoma
City, he went through two days of media appearances around the state.
This time, he is checking out the court surfaces first-hand, playing
on the different grass courts.</TE>
<TE>   Seating limitations are working against the sites in Southern
California. One scenario would have the team playing its matches at
PGA West but practicing and staying nearby at the La Quinta Resort &amp;
Club, McEnroe said. Houston is already set up with preparations for
its upcoming clay-court event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a question of how many seats we can put in it," he
said. "I think we should be able to sell 7,000 to 9,000 seats. Some
of the places we went to could only put in 4,000 or 5,000. Mission
Hills ... I just don't know if we could get as many seats in there as
we'd really like to.</TE>
<TE>   "The big decision will have to come in the next couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   The situation was reversed the last time the United States played
Spain, in the Davis Cup semifinals in 2000. It was in Spain, and on a
clay court, of course. Spain won, 5-0, and afterward, John McEnroe
said he felt like "throwing up." It was his last match as captain.</TE>
<TE>   And now, it could be Spain's turn to play on its least-favorite
surface.</TE>
<TE>   Youngster Juan Carlos Ferrero reached the third round at Wimbledon
last year and veteran Francisco Clavet got to the fourth round in
1998. Still, Spain's top players, Alex Corretja and Albert Costa, are
infrequent visitors to the All England Club.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready to roll," Patrick McEnroe said. "We're ready to give
the Spaniards what they don't want to see."</TE>
<TE>   There's Sampras and Andy Roddick for starters. McEnroe said
Sampras told him Wednesday that he had resumed hitting after a minor
foot ailment at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really good for Pete--good for him to be around those
guys," McEnroe said. "It certainly inspired him in practice, and he
had to play well in his match, even when he wasn't feeling 100%."</TE>

<LD>Now that Jim Rome has said he will no longer be doing "The Last Word"
beyond this year, the question is: What will Fox Sports Net come up
with to fill the void?</LD>
<LD>   Here's a hint: The cable network recently hired Lisa Dergan, a
former Playboy Playmate of the Year, as a local reporter for the
"Southern California Sports Report" and Foxsports.com this week
started a Web site that features a picture of national reporter Lisa
Guerrero, posing braless and with her blouse unbuttoned.</LD>
<LD>   When one first clicks on Guerrero's Web site, the first thing that
comes up is Guerrero posing as a reporter, interviewing Chan Ho Park.
Then that picture fades away and up comes the sexier one.</LD>
<TE>   So what is Guerrero, a sports reporter or a sex symbol?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if Fox Sports Net can't beat ESPN journalistically, it can
try to outsex its competitor.</TE>
<TE>   And if you think certain people find Tom Arnold and "The Best Damn
Sports Show Period" offensive, wait until Fox Sports Net puts
together its stable of bikini models to do the sports news.</TE>
<TE>   Serious female sports journalists certainly won't be happy about
it.</TE>
<TE>   One such person is Christine Brennan, a figure skating reporter
for ABC and ESPN and a sports columnist for USA Today since 1996 and
for the Washington Post for 12 years before that.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan was incensed after hearing about Guerrero's Web site
photo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a shame, here in 2002, that women are embarrassing
themselves in this manner," Brennan said from Salt Lake City. "This
is very disconcerting.</TE>
<TE>   "Some women still believe they have to do this. Why not stand up
to the bosses and say no? It's demeaning.</TE>
<TE>   "It plays to the oldest stereotype, that women can't be appealing
with their brain, only with their body. We don't have to do that
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "It saddens me that women will still succumb to this. How does an
athlete take you seriously after you pose like that? How do the
viewers?</TE>
<TE>   "I blame her. She should be a role model. Instead, she is a
disservice to herself and future generations of women coming up who
want to be serious sports journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd hope by 2002 we'd have come a long way, but maybe we
haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Said Guerrero: "Does posing for a provocative picture diminish my
ability to call a basketball highlight? Not in my opinion, but I'll
let the viewers decide."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling here is that Guerrero does a good job on the updates,
regardless of what she's wearing.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, can she be taken seriously?</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero will no doubt have more to say about all this when she
joins Times sports columnist T.J. Simers on Fox Sports Net Sunday
night at 10.</TE>
<TE>   Awkward Conflict</TE>
<TE>   As for Brennan, she found herself in an awkward situation at the
Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   She's there to cover figure skating for her newspaper and
television employers. And the biggest news involved the Canadian pair
of David Pelletier and Jamie Sale, whose agent is Craig Fenech. He is
also Brennan's broadcast agent, which raises questions of conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said she has been forthcoming, telling her bosses about it
and also informing her readers by putting what she called a
disclaimer into her USA Today column on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said she and the Canadian skaters are only three of about
80 clients represented by Fenech's company, the Sparta Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Greg is the hub of the wheel and the rest of us are 80 separate
spokes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute of St. Petersburg, Fla., said while Brennan is a respected
journalist and there was a disclaimer--which he said should be called
a disclosure--there are still issues here.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you tell people about the problem doesn't eliminate
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said one solution would be for Brennan to stay away from
reporting on the skaters. A less drastic solution, he said, would be
a rigorous checks and balances among Brennan and her bosses to make
sure the reporting and writing is proper and that Brennan maintains a
high standard of journalistic independence.</TE>
<TE>   Fitting Assignment</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of women in sports broadcasting, Ann Meyers was excellent
as the commentator on the USC-Arizona men's game for ABC last
Saturday. She made good points and added to the overall enjoyment of
an exciting game.</TE>
<TE>   It's a positive that Meyers' bosses see nothing wrong with
assigning her to a men's game. Not that it's anything new for Meyers.
At one time, she was the radio commentator for UCLA men's basketball.
She announced Thursday night's Pacific-Cal State Fullerton men's game
for Fox Sports Net, and she'll work the West Coast Conference men's
tournament final in San Diego March 4 for ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Who would you rather listen to on a men's game, Meyers or Dick
Vitale?</TE>
<TE>   Shaq and Chick</TE>
<TE>   After Chick Hearn's hip surgery Tuesday, Shaquille O'Neal was
interviewed on Fox Sports Net's Laker pregame show and came up with a
good idea. "Maybe a limo company in town needs to give Chick a free
service so that he doesn't have to drive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The service station where Hearn fell and broke his hip Sunday is
located at Ventura and Balboa boulevards in Encino. Chick and wife
Marge were on their way to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The Hearns requested that Chick be taken to Valley Presbyterian
Hospital in Van Nuys rather than a closer hospital. They know Valley
Presbyterian well. And the people there know the Hearns.</TE>
<TE>   In the hospital chapel is a statue of St. Jude, donated by the
Hearns in the memory of their children, Samantha and Gary. Valley
Presbyterian is where Samantha died of viral pneumonia at age 41 in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   KXTA (1150) broke the story Monday about Hearn's mishap the night
before. Hearn was supposed to do a promotional shoot for sister
station KIIS-FM (102.7) Monday morning, and Marge called the station
to say her husband couldn't make it because of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   CBS is expected to announce next week that Dan Marino and Boomer
Esiason will be joining "The NFL Today." Marino is expected to also
return to HBO's "Inside the NFL." ... John Madden's representatives
met with Fox Sports chairman David Hill and President Ed Goren this
week to discuss a possible contract extension. Madden's contract with
Fox expires after one more season and there has been talk about
Madden going to ABC's "Monday Night Football" if he doesn't re-sign
with Fox. Twice before, Madden has been rumored to be heading to
"Monday Night Football." ... TV Guide reports in next week's edition
that ABC and ESPN have been putting out feelers about Bob Costas and
he appears interested. Costas' contract is reportedly up in June.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Al Michaels is among sports celebrities being honored
Saturday night at the Sports Legends Awards dinner at the Century
Plaza. The affair benefits the Paralysis Project of America. ...
Recommended viewing: "Sidelines: L.A. Hoops," a series that provides
a behind-the-scenes look at the Clippers, is being carried by ESPN
Sunday nights at 7.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   "Star Crossed," on ESPN Sunday night at 5, examines the downfall
of Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. It's a good topic but a bad
show. ESPN tries to get fancy and tell the story as a Shakespearean
tragedy. It's only a guess, but there probably aren't too many ESPN
viewers who are into Shakepeare. Nice try, ESPN, but the overproduced
show doesn't work.</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Patience Ends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four decades ago, a leftist guerrilla group set out to make life
better for the poor people of Colombia. Today, they routinely kill
those peasants' children as they blow up buildings with car bombs and
mine rural roads. They destroy power towers, oil pipelines and
bridges. Two weeks ago, they cut off Bogota's water supply. The
cocaine trade they heartily embrace has rotted their ideology beyond
recognition, and even the most adamant reformers wonder what they are
hoping to achieve.</LD>
<LD>   If the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, set out to
turn their nation into a workers' paradise, they have succeeded in
creating what one Colombian attorney terms "a dysfunctional hell."</LD>
<LD>   Almost four years ago, Colombian President Andres Pastrana began a
dialogue with these guerrillas. Later, he ceded a Switzerland-size
zone to them as a haven for peace talks. His critics said he was
naive. But Pastrana persevered. Tuesday, when the guerrillas hijacked
a plane and kidnapped the president of the Colombian Senate's peace
commission, Pastrana's patience finally ran out. The next evening,
pressured by a frustrated public, he broke off the peace talks that
had never really begun.</LD>
<TE>   Colombia's 130,000-member army should have no problem taking back
the territory these 17,000 or so guerrillas occupy. But it must
protect civilians as it drives out the enemy. The guerrillas, in
turn, will probably increase their attacks, killing clerks and
farmers and children who get in the way, as well as civilians they
suspect of links to the country's right-wing paramilitary forces.</TE>
<TE>   Hired by the nation's rich, these paramilitary thugs are as bad as
the guerrillas, and if Pastrana hopes to keep the people on his side
he must crush them as well. The United States should stand on the
side of the Colombian people and make any further aid subject to
Pastrana getting tough with both murderous groups.</TE>
<TE>   Then Congress needs to lift restrictions on Colombia's use of
weapons that came as part of the U.S. anti-drug package: A guerrilla
who traffics in drugs, after all, is a drug dealer. Sharing U.S.
intelligence information with the democratically elected government
could prevent terrorist attacks. President Bush and Congress should
also heed Pastrana's plea and begin teaching the Colombian army how
to defend bridges, electricity towers and pipelines. All this would
be easier if Europe and Latin American nations gave up the notion
that FARC is a legitimate political force.</TE>
<TE>   The United States must avoid sinking into South America's
notorious political quicksand. But it cannot abdicate responsibility.
As the global war on terrorism continues, stability in the hemisphere
becomes an urgent goal.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who is running for a
fourth term, describes herself as a "fairly opinionated" person--a
self-assessment that supporters would translate as confident and
energetic and critics as in-your-face and cranky. Molina admits that
her style is "not one that creates comfort" and prides herself in not
playing the game of politics, especially if politics means
compromise. It is a style that earns her admirers outside the county
Hall of Administration but not always results within.</LD>
<LD>   Molina does her best work building communities: encouraging her
constituents in the Eastside, East L.A. and parts of the San Gabriel
Valley, many of them poor or immigrants, to get involved in civic
life. Working with the sheriff and the district attorney and with
housing, health and other county departments, she set up a task force
to fight crime and gang violence in Valinda, a San Gabriel Valley
community that was having three to five shootings a month. The team
attacked from all angles, using building codes to shut down gang
houses, for instance, and sending in social workers to investigate
child neglect and abuse. The strategy proved successful, and Molina
plans to duplicate it elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Molina faces a single opponent in the race, community college
professor David Sanchez, who ran unsuccessfully last spring for a Los
Angeles City Council seat. Sanchez has admirable goals, from bringing
down crime to creating jobs, but no clear plan for how to accomplish
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Times endorses Molina as the best choice for the 1st District.</TE>
<TE>   In the 3rd District, Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky is running
unopposed for a third term. If Molina is an issues-oriented gadfly,
Yaroslavsky is a pragmatist adept at the art of compromise. But he
also can stand his ground--and the heat. He championed and won
approval last year of a much-needed busway across the San Fernando
Valley despite vigorous opposition from an Orthodox Jewish community,
a key constituency in a district that runs from the Westside to Los
Feliz and includes much of the Valley. Would that he could show the
same backbone when it comes to another key constituency. A member of
the Local Agency Formation Commission, which will decide whether to
put Valley secession to a public vote, Yaroslavsky opposes secession
but seldom questions his vocal secessionist constituents. An expert
on the $16-billion budget who helped save the county from bankruptcy
once, Yaroslavsky is the best hope for keeping the deficit-ridden
health department from torpedoing the county's hard-won financial
stability.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Assessor Rich Auerbach, elected in 2000 to fill
the previous assessor's unfinished term, got off to a fast start. He
appointed an office ombudsman to serve as an advocate for property
owners and small businesses with complaints about appraisals or
taxes. He brought the assessor's office into the 21st century by
making it easily accessible via the Web and is working to computerize
the county's 2.3-million-parcel property roll.</TE>
<TE>   Three other candidates are running for assessor, but none can
match Auerbach's track record. He deserves reelection to a full
four-year term so that he can continue these reforms.</TE>

<LD>Basketball is no more realistic a ticket from the ghetto to the NBA
than is winning the lottery. But encouraging sports as a way to learn
self control, set goals and stay off the streets can help kids out of
poverty, not by making them rich but by teaching them skills they can
apply in every part of their lives. Today's up-to-the-minute role
models are Olympians Derek Parra and Apolo Anton Ohno.</LD>
<LD>   A San Bernardino native son, the 31-year-old Parra won a silver
medal last week and gold on Tuesday, becoming the first Mexican
American to win an Olympic speedskating medal. Growing up, he could
barely afford the $2.75 admission to the local Stardust Roller Rink,
the neighborhood haven from gunshots and graffiti. He sold everything
he had to afford a move to Florida to train with a renowned in-line
speedskating coach. Between practice sessions, he works at a Home
Depot.</LD>
<LD>   Parra's medals may win him some product endorsements, maybe a
cereal box cover, but speedskating is not going to make him rich. The
most important endorsement it earned him, money can't buy. "My son,"
says his dad, Gilbert Parra, "is my hero." Judging from the frenzy in
San Bernardino, he's a hero to more than a few others.</LD>
<TE>   Apolo Anton Ohno, 19, won silver and gold in two speedskating
events before an audience full of fans, with two more races to come
Saturday. Ohno's father credits the discipline of skating--and a
stint training in Lake Placid, N.Y.--for keeping the teenager from
hanging out with gangbangers.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the boys and girls who played in a South Central
basketball tournament this week sponsored by L.A. Bridges, the city's
gang intervention program, and the nonprofit Central Recovery
Development Program, are about as likely to win Olympic gold as that
spot on the NBA. But like the Stardust Roller Rink, these and other
neighborhood sports programs provide at the very least a respite and
a chance to dream. It's something if they simply give kids an outlet
for teenage energy. If they also teach the cooperation, discipline
and pride needed to move ahead in the world, that's worth more than
any gold medal.</TE>

<HD>Romer Backs Team to Finish Belmont</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: The superintendent favors developers led by
Latino advocacy group for troubled project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A construction team led by a Latino educational advocacy group should
finish the environmentally troubled Belmont Learning Complex, Los
Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer recommended Thursday to the school
board members.</LD>
<LD>   Alliance for a Better Community, a coalition of Latino activists
and businesspeople, assembled the best development team and presented
the best plan to finish the high school and solve environmental
problems at the 35-acre downtown site, Romer said.</LD>
<LD>   The president of the team is Ed Avila, the former head of the Los
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and a politically connected
proponent of finishing the Belmont campus.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance was recommended over Komex H20, the only other
finalist for a job that is expected to cost $68 million to $88
million. A third bidder, Eastridge Cos., was disqualified because of
an alleged conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Overcrowding is the greatest barrier to increasing student
performance," said Romer who said the alliance stood the best chance
of completing the project quickly, safely and within the budget. "If
we can move forward on Belmont, that will be just one giant step to
relieving this overcrowding problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Board of Education plans to vote on Romer's
recommendation next month.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont campus, part of which sits on an old oil field, would
serve as many as 4,600 students who are now bused to other schools
around the city. After $154 million had been spent, construction was
halted in 1999 when methane gas and gasoline byproducts were
discovered underneath the school. Plans now call for inserting an
underground barrier and venting the gas.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the alliance's political and grass-roots connections
were a "plus" that might help the group communicate better with
parents. But Romer said he based his decision on the findings of an
expert advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   "The ABC team, led by Matt Construction, can provide strong,
capable, experienced project management for this complicated
project," the panel's evaluation stated. Matt Construction, which
would manage the Belmont project for the alliance, is one of the
oldest and biggest firms in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Matt built the Crystal Cathedral, the Bonaventure Hotel, the
United California Bank building and several schools.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance group began as an informal network to improve
education for Latino youths. Its president, Avila, said the Belmont
controversy inspired its formal incorporation 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought Belmont was such an important issue to the Latino
community that we became a legal entity and hired a staff," Avila
said. The group was worried that the district might sell the Belmont
property and scrap plans for a school there.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance's board of directors includes leaders from the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Central
American Resource Center and the National Assn. of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials, as well as several prominent Latino
businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Jose Huisar said he was impressed that "ABC
represents some Latino leaders that have been working on this issue
for a long time and are in tune with the population of students and
parents there."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Buresh, spokesman for the expert review panel, said that
Komex's team, of Westminster, seemed too large and inflexible
compared to the alliance's. Komex CEO Anthony Brown said Thursday
that he had not heard about Romer's recommendation and complained
that he and his partners were out of the loop.</TE>

<HD>City Officials Urge Passage of Bond Measure to Help
Emergency Facilities</HD>
<DH>Ballot: Hahn and Parks attend event boosting the
$600-million plan at a cramped, overcrowded Reseda police station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials assembled outside an overcrowded San
Fernando Valley police station Thursday afternoon urging residents to
pass a bond measure that would give the city $600 million to upgrade
its emergency facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition Q, which will be on the March 5 ballot, would provide
money to replace the city's emergency operations center and four
aging police stations, build two police stations in the Valley and
Mid-Wilshire, and repair and renovate deteriorating Fire Department
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The bond would cost the average homeowner about $3 a month--or
about $35 a year for 24 years.</LD>
<TE>   This is the third time in recent years that the city has asked
voters to approve a bond that would renovate public safety
facilities. The last two propositions received the support of a
majority of voters, but failed to get the needed two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, officials said the bond is essential to help police
officers and firefighters do their jobs and to decrease response
times to emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The needs are great," Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said at a
news conference at the West Valley Community Police Station in
Reseda. "It is intolerable to force our fine men and women in blue to
work in these kinds of conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are cramped inside the 42-year-old station, which would
be one of the first replaced with the bond money. Two police officers
work inside a former broom closet; others file reports from a
makeshift addition tacked onto the back of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was joined at the news conference by several City Council
members, Fire Chief William Bamattre and Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks, who is seeking a second five-year term. Hahn opposes Parks'
reappointment, but on Thursday, the two men said they were united in
their support for Proposition Q.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best $600 million we'll spend in this city," Parks
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes there's disagreements at City Hall, but there's no
disagreements on this," the mayor added.</TE>
<TE>   Some Valley residents who want to create a separate city oppose
the bond, saying that it should not be on the ballot before the city
votes on secession. A dozen opponents waved "No on Q" signs at the
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a question about the need for facilities," said
Chatsworth resident Bill Powers. "This is a question of timing,
disingenuousness and a historic mismanagement of funds."</TE>

<HD>School Trustee a Foe of Bond Issue</HD>
<DH>Election: 'Needs' are really just 'wants,' and taxes are
too high, says Anaheim official. Pupils learn through good teachers,
books, she says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unlikely foe opposes Anaheim Union High School District's
$132-million bond measure on the March 5 ballot: one of its own
trustees.</LD>
<LD>   "In these hard economic times," board member Alexandria Coronado
asks voters in March 5's sample ballot, "do you really want to tax
yourselves more? As citizens of the state of California, we are
already taxed more than any other state in America. Enough is
enough!"</LD>
<LD>   Coronado's name does not appear on the ballot statement, which is
signed by an Anaheim anti-tax group of which she is a member. But in
an interview, she confirmed that she did write the statement opposing
the bond issue.</LD>
<TE>   Still, word of her opposition has reached colleagues, some of whom
have said they're disappointed the board can't unanimously favor the
bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   "It is easy for Alex to say 'No, no, no' [to taxes]," said fellow
Trustee Thomas Holguin, who, with three colleagues, voted in November
to put the measure on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Coronado was absent from that vote but later said she would have
voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy asking voters to raise taxes, Holguin said.</TE>
<TE>   But "what is best for our schools? Our neighborhoods? You have to
have a spine. Are you going to look at the full picture or just what
is going to get you a vote," he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Coronado, who is running for a seat on the Orange County Board of
Education, said she agonized over the issue but ultimately felt
compelled to speak the conscience of her taxpaying constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand why the district is doing this, and that we have
facilities needs," Coronado said.</TE>
<TE>   But "if you look at the list of the so called 'needs' that have
been put out by the school district, they are not needs, they are
wants.... Do we really need white [marker] boards on all four walls,
or the latest computer modems, the latest technology? ... Although
those things are nice, that's not where kids learn from. They learn
from good teachers and books," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If the bond issue passes, district officials said they could use
the money to modernize and renovate aging campuses and help ease
overcrowding by building a new junior high school.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would raise property taxes $30 annually for each
$100,000 of a property's assessed value. It is among seven similar
measures in Orange County this March.</TE>
<TE>   If a statewide education bond measure passes in November, the
district could receive an additional $125 million in matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   Coronado said it is time for the district "to think outside the
box" and consider alternative sources of funding for maintenance and
renovation projects.</TE>
<TE>   She proposes that the district set up a privately managed trust
fund that would pay dividends for such purposes. She said she would
back a bond issue specifically for building schools.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Supt. John Larner said the district doesn't have the
capital to set up a trust fund, and that the money it sets aside for
maintenance is barely enough to keep up with the schools' needs.</TE>
<TE>   Coronado said she sympathizes with the district's plight and won't
campaign actively.</TE>
<TE>   But others consider her ballot statement a form of campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really shocked at this," Larner said. "I don't consider
writing the rebuttal [to the bond measure] remaining neutral."</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raising Records Fall in D.A. Race</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Bamieh's total in the Ventura County contest tops
$900,000, with $317,000 for Totten.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fund-raising in an increasingly bitter Ventura County district
attorney's race blew past the $1-million mark this month, fueled
largely by huge sums pumped into prosecutor Ron Bamieh's campaign by
his wealthy father.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the $374,000 that Bamieh received in recent weeks
came from San Mateo businessman Sam Bamieh. The elder Bamieh gave his
only son $307,000 over a four-week finance reporting period that
ended Feb. 16, and then funneled another $67,000 in so-called "late
contributions" in the days after.</LD>
<LD>   That brings the senior deputy district attorney's fund-raising
total to $912,000 since his campaign began last year.</LD>
<TE>   Rival candidate Greg Totten, meanwhile, collected $91,000 from
more than 200 contributors during the same four-week period and
posted no late contributions. Despite a wider base of support, Totten
has come nowhere close to Bamieh's war chest, raising a total of
$317,000.</TE>
<TE>   The two are vying to replace longtime Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury in the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.2 million raised in the combined campaigns has already
smashed records for a county seat and could exceed $1.5 million by
the March 5 primary, a political analyst predicted. Money raised this
election season far outstrips the previous record of $427,500 raised
during the contest two years ago between Supervisor Steve Bennett and
his defeated opponent, Ventura Councilman Jim Monahan.</TE>
<TE>   Big money in Ventura County elections is usually reserved for
congressional races in which candidates tap into the fund-raising
bases of national parties and interest groups, said Herb Gooch,
chairman of the political science department at Cal Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really quite extraordinary money," Gooch said. "In a
county with 750,000 people, it's hard to raise that kind of money
from the inside. In this case, it really goes back to Sam Bamieh, a
single individual whose contacts are Bush proteges, Washington
insiders and other out-of-state people."</TE>
<TE>   Totten renewed charges that Sam Bamieh, a frequent GOP
contributor, is trying to buy the election for his ambitious son. The
huge sums also point out the need for campaign contribution limits in
Ventura County races, Totten said.</TE>
<TE>   The county currently has no restrictions on how much a candidate
can receive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the latest example of Sam Bamieh making good on his
promise to make sure his son gets elected," Totten said. "In any
other race, whether it's Congress, governor or the president,
contributions of this magnitude would be illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, 36, said huge spending is necessary to overcome Totten's
backing by a "huge political machine." Totten, the No. 2 man in the
district attorney's office, is endorsed by Bradbury, Sheriff Bob
Brooks, police and labor unions and four Ventura County supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using every trick you can imagine--they don't mind
destroying people's lives with their negative campaigning," Bamieh
said, referring to a press conference Totten called this week to
reveal that a 72-year-old Bamieh backer had been convicted on drugs
charges 13 years earlier. "In order to combat that and fight on an
even level, it requires resources," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions in the contest to replace retiring county Supervisor
Frank Schillo also have surpassed the Bennett-Monahan record.</TE>
<TE>   Businessman Randy Hoffman and Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman
Linda Parks have raised a combined $486,000 since their campaigns
began. Hoffman, an entrepreneur with the backing of Thousand Oaks
business owners, investors and developer-business magnate David
Murdock, accounts for the vast majority, having raised $379,500.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who is limiting contributions to $500, has raised a total
of $106,000. Her contributors are teachers, retirees, homemakers and
professionals from across the county. In the latest filing period,
she raised $32,239.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman widened his fund-raising lead by taking in $167,750 for
the reporting period. His contributions include $25,000 from Beverly
Hills investor Louis Gonda, $10,000 from the union representing
county sheriff's deputies, a $10,000 loan from Assemblyman Tony
Strickland (R-Moorpark) and $5,000 from Camarillo resident Edward
Atsinger, who runs a string of Christian radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, who has given Hoffman $91,000, did not make any
contributions during the latest reporting period.</TE>
<TE>   Parks called Hoffman's mounting campaign chest "obscene" and said
his acceptance of money from developers shows that voters cannot
trust him to hold the line on urban sprawl--a significant issue in
the Thousand Oaks-based 2nd District.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman countered that the business community is backing him
because it thinks he is more responsive to its concerns than Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are quite frankly fed up with Linda Parks' divisiveness and
lack of responsibility," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions were more moderate in Supervisor Judy Mikels'
campaign to win a third term in the Simi Valley-based 4th District.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels raised $27,000 during the latest filing period, bringing
her total to $101,808. Contributors included business owners in her
district, developers, Los Angeles law firms and quarry operators.</TE>
<TE>   Her opponent, Moorpark fraud investigator John Lane, raised
$31,000, including a $10,000 contribution from the county deputies'
union. Lane has raised a total of $89,000.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement unions have been Lane's biggest financial
supporters, but he also picked up donations from individuals who
think Mikels is too friendly with developers. Richard Francis,
coauthor of the county SOAR growth-control laws, gave Lane $500.</TE>

<HD>Park Bond Would Benefit Rural, Urban Projects</HD>
<DH>Environment: Measure on March ballot would provide $2.6
billion for land, water cleanup in all parts of California.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The $2.6-billion park and environmental bond measure on the March 5
ballot would provide funding for a broad array of rural and urban
projects ranging from old-growth redwoods and salt marshes to urban
parks and farmland preservation.</LD>
<LD>   The most expensive bond measure of its kind in the nation's
history, according to the state's Resources Department, its largess
could extend from North Coast forests to the Sierra Nevada, desert
canyons to suburban wildlife corridors.</LD>
<LD>   It comes two years after voters approved $2.1 billion in
conservation spending under Proposition 12. About 80% of those funds
have been spent, but more is needed to clear a backlog of projects
and to save stretches of wilderness before growth and development
swallow them, said state Resources Secretary Mary Nichols.</LD>
<TE>   Californians had approved park bonds about every three years until
the late 1980s, after which no significant bonds were approved for 12
years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "For every one of these projects we did, there's a half dozen
waiting to be done," Nichols added.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 40 proponents are optimistic about the measure's
chances. Among its supporters are the California Chamber of Commerce,
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the AARP and the League of California
Cities.</TE>
<TE>   A survey last fall by the Public Policy Institute of California, a
nonpartisan research center, found that two-thirds of voters
supported Proposition 40. The survey was conducted two months after
the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon</TE>
<TE>   "You would think now would not be an ideal time to ask California
to spend more money on parks, but there is no drop-off in interest in
environmental and park issues, even though we are in an economic
downturn and America is focused on terrorism and security issues,"
said Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow at the institute.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Proposition 40 argue that voter support for the
measure reflects the public's belief that a fast-growing state must
protect the resources that make it such an attractive place to live.</TE>
<TE>   California is adding about half a million residents each year;
that growth means more pollutants flushed to the ocean, more land
gobbled up for houses and stores and more demand for parks and
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making a statement that we are a state that recognizes
we're going to continue to grow at a rapid pace and that this is a
very attractive state to live in, but only as long as the quality of
life continues to be good. It shows people are committed to a
balanced approach to growth," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder
Creek), the author of Proposition 40.</TE>
<TE>   Some Conservatives Say Time Isn't Right</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is jumping on the Proposition 40 bandwagon. Some
conservative Republicans and taxpayer advocates say the measure
requires too much spending at the wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   "To go forward with additional bonds at this time is a little like
getting a pay cut and going out and buying a new car," said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. "We
don't' see anything important enough to go into debt right now."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), who wrote the ballot argument
against the measure, is concerned that too much money is being spent
too quickly on the environment. "The money is being squandered not on
parks, but on pork," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Haynes said, environmentalists may be inclined to
spend the money on what he described as "mischief."</TE>
<TE>   "The environmentalists' approach is to protect all the rats, the
flies and the weeds, that nobody ought to own land, build a house on
it or use the water, that we should all live off of nuts and the
trees and the land," Haynes said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhoods and Coastal
Protection Act of 2002 is not aimed entirely at protecting nature. It
provides $833 million for local and regional parks, in part to boost
recreation opportunities for city-dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   "Urban L.A. is the most park-poor city in the country. Proposition
40 provides resources for underserved communities that are park poor.
It's something that can begin to change the city's landscape," said
Carlos Porras, executive director for Citizens for a Better
Environment.</TE>
<TE>   High on the list of urban park priorities are places such as
Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles, where community leaders are attempting
to transform oil rigs and industrial vestiges into a 1,200-acre park
between Culver City and Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Other projects under consideration in Los Angeles include the L.A.
River parkway, restoration work at the Sepulveda Basin near Van Nuys
and improvements at Hansen Dam. Those projects, however, must contend
with a laundry list of others for funding, said Assemblywoman Fran
Pavley (D-Agoura Hills).</TE>
<TE>   Rather than earmark many specific projects for funding,
Proposition 40 would disperse money to communities based on
population and through block grants to conservancies and government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica Bay, Mountains Targeted</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $1.28 billion is designated for environmental conservation
programs, including forest acquisition, wetlands restoration and
habitat protection. About a third of those funds would be divided
among eight conservancies, with the state Coastal Conservancy
receiving the lion's share. Projects to clean beaches, reduce
polluted runoff and repair degraded streams would be eligible to
receive $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among the places where the money might be put to use: Truckee
Marsh near Lake Tahoe, one of the most significant remaining wetlands
in the Sierra; oak woodlands in San Luis Obispo County; salt marshes
in the San Francisco Bay; Coal Canyon near Chino Hills State Park,
one of the most significant wildlife corridors in the state; the
Santa Monica Mountains; palm oases in the Coachella Valley; Santa
Monica Bay; and the San Joaquin River Parkway near Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the money could be used to help the state pay its share of
the CalFed program, a joint state-federal effort to save the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which provides drinking water to
two-thirds of the state and irrigation water to more than 7 million
acres of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   For campers and picnickers, an additional $225 million is
designated for use in California state parks, with campgrounds,
trails and interpretive centers receiving top priority. Maintenance
of those facilities has lagged while visitor demand has soared,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $268 million would be available to protect
historical buildings and cultural resources, which are increasingly
being lost as new buildings are added to growing communities.
Conservationists say that some of the money could be used to build a
visitor center and memorial at Manzanar, a former detention camp in
the Eastern Sierra where 10,000 Japanese Americans were interned
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Communities from Napa to Ventura intent on protecting agricultural
lands could tap into $75 million of Proposition 40 funds. The state
Air Resources Board would receive $50 million to pay for programs to
cut smog.</TE>

<HD>Voters Receive Wrong Ballots</HD>
<DH>Politics: Error causes some in Camarillo to get forms
intended for Simi Valley residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An election department snafu has resulted in the wrong ballots being
sent to a handful of absentee voters in Camarillo, raising concerns
about the potential for problems in the March 5 primary.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County elections chief Bruce Bradley said human error is
to blame for some Camarillo residents--only about 10 have come
forward so far--receiving absentee ballots intended for voters in
Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Bradley said the problem likely occurred when an election worker
reached for the wrong pile while helping insert more than 40,000
absentee ballots into envelopes mailed out earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   There is no way to know how many misdirected ballots went out,
Bradley said. But he said he suspects they went to no more than 50 of
the 7,600 voters in the Camarillo area who requested absentee
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is not widespread," he said. "I don't think it's
going to affect any races."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) worries otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   He said his office has been contacted by several people in the
Camarillo area who unexpectedly found themselves able to vote in the
4th District supervisorial race in which incumbent Judy Mikels is
facing challenger John Lane. Camarillo residents are in the 3rd
District, where there is no supervisorial race this year.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly worries that the ballot error could result in some
ballots being disqualified or counted in the wrong election.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these races could be very tight, and if we learned
anything in the last presidential cycle, it is that elections should
be taken more seriously than like they might have been in Florida and
other places," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said any voter who receives the wrong ballot can contact
the election division and get the correct one. Residents have until
Tuesday to request an absentee ballot by mail.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Bradley said even if an absentee voter received the
wrong ballot and erroneously cast a vote in the race for 4th District
supervisor, the department's computers would catch the error and
disqualify that vote.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the ballot, however, would stand.</TE>

<HD>More Can Afford Houses in County, Study Concludes</HD>
<DH>Real estate: UCSB researchers find that a higher percentage
of residents can buy a home in the $300,000 range than in last two
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More Ventura County residents can afford to buy a home today than a
year ago, despite a long-term housing shortage and prices that
continue to climb much faster than most salaries.</LD>
<LD>   That is what researchers with the UC Santa Barbara Economic
Forecast Project have found. The group's annual forecast, released
Thursday, reported that 37.4% of county residents are able to afford
a median-priced home in the $300,000 range. That is up from 35.5% of
residents last year and from 31.4% in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The overall increase in the housing affordability index is
attributed to an explosion in the number of well-paid engineers,
researchers and executives in the county's technology sector.</LD>
<TE>   Anchored by biotechnology giant Amgen of Thousand Oaks and
supported by other medical, science and technology companies, Ventura
County's nondurable goods sector has swelled its payroll by 76% since
1997, from 8,800 jobs to about 15,500 jobs this year. In a county
with just under 300,000 jobs total, Amgen, with more than 5,400
workers, is the largest private employer.</TE>
<TE>   Average annual salaries in the nondurable goods sector
skyrocketed, from $35,000 in 1997 to about $85,000 this year, the
UCSB study found.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are changing for the better," said Jerry E. Knotts of
Thousand Oaks, financial services manager for the California
Manufacturing Technology Center. "It's doubtful that homes here will
ever be affordable for everybody. But we're moving in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Home Ownership Still Not Possible for Many</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an Oxnard-based attorney and affordable
housing advocate, said the statistics belie the larger picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's great for those who are making money hand over fist,"
she said, "but there's a huge disparity between the corporate CEOs
and high-tech industries out there in the east county, the
'knowledged workers,' and the rest of the county, which is going in
reverse. [Home ownership] is farther and farther out of reach."</TE>
<TE>   The county's 22,000 agricultural workers will earn on average
about $21,000 this year, up from about $19,000 in 1997. The county's
more than 53,000 retail workers also will earn an average salary of
$21,000 this year, up from $17,000 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   UCSB economists predict that the median existing single-family
home price, which stood at $218,000 in 1997, could average $336,000
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The median price for existing single-family homes was $338,000
countywide for the fourth quarter of 2001, according to the most
recent figures from the California Assn. of Realtors. But DataQuick
Information Systems Inc., whose numbers include condominiums and new
homes, calculates the county's median home price was $284,000 last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Assn. of
Realtors, said affordability is in the eye of the beholder.</TE>
<TE>   "You're attracting skilled labor that can afford a home," she
said. "But how are we going to attract good teachers? We are not
getting the kind of construction we need. You can't continue to grow
an economy without affordable housing."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders State to Let Disabled Students Use Aids on
Exit Exam</HD>
<DH>Education: Court refuses to exempt such pupils from the
test, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday ordered California to accommodate disabled
students who take the high school exit exam and to provide some
students with an alternative assessment.</LD>
<LD>   "Overall, we're pleased with the ruling," said Doug Stone of the
state Department of Education. "The key thing for us is that we have
a green light to go ahead and administer the test."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer did not halt the testing
altogether, as advocates for the disabled had requested, but he did
require students to be allowed to use calculators, spell-checking
devices and, if needed, have the tests read to them. He also ordered
the state to devise a different test or assessment method for
students who are too disabled to take the exam.</LD>
<TE>   The Disability Rights Advocates, an Oakland-based nonprofit group
that filed the lawsuit against the State Board of Education, had
claimed that the test discriminated against those students by not
allowing them to use calculators or aids to read material while
taking the exit exam, unless they obtained waivers from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said the state has no problem with allowing students to take
the test with accommodations. The only difference now is that "based
on the judge's ruling, we can't deny any waivers," and a small
percentage of students will be exempt from taking the test, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already looking at ways in which we can assess or evaluate
kids with special needs," Stone said. "We're pleased that this test
is going forward as planned. This provides us with a significant
opportunity to continue to get additional data so that we're in a
better position to assess how kids are faring on this high-stakes
exam."</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, all students must pass the exam to graduate,
beginning with the class of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The state will begin administering the tests to sophomores next
month. Last year, the state offered the exams, but a failing grade
did not count against students.</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% of disabled students failed the math section and 82%
failed the language portion. The failure rate for students not
disabled was half as large.</TE>
<TE>   Each of California's 45,000 disabled sophomores who will begin
taking the test next month has an Individual Education Plan that
explains what type of accommodations can be used for in-class exams
and assignments. Thursday's ruling allows those same accommodations
for the exit exam.</TE>

<HD>Head-On Collision Near Piru Kills 2, Closes Part of Highway</HD>
<DH>Traffic: A truck is also sideswiped, and flying debris from
the fatal crash damages a fourth vehicle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fiery four-car crash near Piru early Thursday left two men dead and
shut down a section of California 126 near the Los Angeles County
line for almost four hours.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 6:40 a.m. when a Honda Accord
traveling west apparently crossed into oncoming traffic, sideswiping
a pickup truck before colliding head-on with a Honda Civic.</LD>
<LD>   The impact was so powerful that the Civic exploded in flames and
its engine was thrown from the car, witnesses said. Flying debris hit
a fourth vehicle but didn't injure the driver.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the Civic, 20-year-old Jesus Zacharias Chavez of
Santa Paula, was killed instantly, said California Highway Patrol
Officer Steven Reid. The driver of the Accord was airlifted to Henry
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where he was pronounced
dead. His name was withheld pending notification of his family.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the pickup, Sergio Contreras Ruiz, 33, of Fillmore,
and his three passengers were not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Witness Jim Austin was traveling east on the highway when he saw
Chavez pass him at about 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't get more than 50 yards in front of me when it was
suddenly like someone threw a stick of dynamite under his car and it
just exploded," said Austin, 61, of Fillmore. "It was like driving
through a canopy of trees with smoke and car parts flying everywhere.
The young man had no chance."</TE>
<TE>   Austin's Jeep was badly damaged by the Civic's flying transmission
parts, windshield wipers, radiator bits and the entire engine block.
He struggled to keep his car from rolling and brought it to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very fortunate; all that debris could have gone through my
windshield and taken me out," said Austin, who was unhurt but whose
car sustained major front-end damage.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP is still trying to determine why the driver of the Accord
apparently crossed into oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if he fell asleep or if he was reaching for
something, we just don't know," Reid said. Based on witness accounts,
excessive speed does not appear to be a factor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   California 126 was shut down from Center Street to the Los Angeles
County line from about 7 a.m. until almost 11 a.m. Traffic was backed
up for miles.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP is asking anyone who may have witnessed the accident to
contact them at 477-4132.</TE>

<LD>Sheriff's and county fire officials continued their search Thursday
for the cause of a Palmdale house fire that killed a 6-year-old girl
and critically injured her brothers and uncle.</LD>
<LD>   Rochelle Fuentes died at the scene, and Joseph Jacobo, 4, and
Jacob Jacobo, 3, were in full cardiac arrest when firefighters
rescued them Wednesday morning from their grandparents' burning home
on Stanridge Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, both boys were on respirators and in critical
condition at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, said hospital spokesman
Steve Rutledge.</LD>
<TE>   The home had no smoke detectors, sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have found no evidence of a crime, said Sheriff's Lt.
Marilyn Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a tragic house fire, and a young child died, and that's
how we are looking at it at this time," the lieutenant added.</TE>
<TE>   The children's mother, Danielle Maropulos, had left them at her
parents' home to to be looked after by their aunts and uncles.</TE>
<TE>   An uncle, Nathan Maropulos, 22, was in critical condition on
Thursday at the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks with
third-degree burns over 25% of his body and was suffering from severe
smoke inhalation, said hospital spokesman Larry Weinberg.</TE>
<TE>   Another uncle, 17, and an aunt, 21, were treated at a hospital for
smoke inhalation and released.</TE>

<HD>5th Child Dies From Fumes; Father Is Facing Arrest on
Murder Counts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 6-year-old girl died of her injuries Thursday, becoming the fifth
sibling to perish after their father allegedly lighted a charcoal
grill inside their Pico Rivera home, turning it into the family's gas
chamber.</LD>
<LD>   Adair Garcia, found unconscious near the grill, will be arrested
on five counts of first-degree murder after he is transferred to the
county jail ward early today. Garcia was taken to a Whittier hospital
after Wednesday's tragedy and is in stable condition.</LD>
<LD>   The father of six admitted to the killings in a videotaped
conversation with investigators before being taken to the hospital,
law enforcement sources said.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no doubt it was his intent to kill everyone in the
home," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear. "There were
several portable space heaters that worked.... He was lying next to
the barbecue."</TE>
<TE>   Bear said there is additional evidence that will be disclosed
later. He would not confirm or deny the videotaped admission.</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Garcia, after clinging to life for almost a day, died at
UCLA Medical Center on Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described Adair Garcia, 30, as despondent over a
failing marriage, but there were few outside signs of tension in the
home of the large middle-class family living in a suburban
neighborhood, where a daughter loved the violin and the parents
seldom missed a school event.</TE>
<TE>   Although friends never spotted warning signs of the tragedy to
come, there were marital problems, Bear said. Tensions between Garcia
and 30-year-old Adriana Arreola had ratcheted up recently and Arreola
had moved out of the home 11 miles east of downtown Los Angeles a
week before the tragedy, Bear said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday evening, the veteran investigator said, Garcia tucked
his youngsters into bed and allegedly stoked the family barbecue in
the living room. Among the first deputies to come upon the children's
bodies in the home in the 9600 block of Washington Boulevard was a
distant relative, who just days before had spent time with the
youngsters, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Carrier, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman, said
autopsies will determine whether the children died of carbon monoxide
poisoning, smoke inhalation or another cause.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda, 10, Jonathan, 7, and 2-year-old Anthony were found dead
early Wednesday by their maternal grandmother, who had arrived to
baby-sit. Cecilia, 4, died later Wednesday at Whittier's Presbyterian
Intercommunity Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Only one sibling--9-year-old Kassandra--survived. She remained
hospitalized at UCLA and is expected to recover.</TE>
<TE>   At the Whittier hospital, Garcia was able to talk to doctors
Thursday, but said little.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to say what his state of mind is," said Dr. Nadeem
Chishti. "He is asleep most of the time and when he is awake, I see
nothing on his face."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia continued to be treated Thursday to flush carbon monoxide
out of his system with pure oxygen, Chishti said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's co-workers at SBC Pacific Bell's Rosemead office, where
he is a splicing technician, could not reconcile the events with the
man they knew.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a family man and would talk about his kids all the time.
We are dumbfounded as to what pushed him over the brink," said a
co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Garcia's co-workers were so shaken that they took the day
off Thursday. Colleagues, who asked not to be named, said Garcia and
his wife both worked for Pac Bell until she decided to stay home with
their children.</TE>
<TE>   At two schools in Montebello, students and staff members recalled
the Garcia children with fondness.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a special friend to me," 6-year-old Desiree Chavez said
of Vanessa, her first-grade classmate. The two played handball and
tag and Vanessa especially enjoyed children's songs.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda's class at La Merced Intermediate School wrote goodbye
letters. "She like to play 'Mary Had a Little Lamb,'" said Elaine
Espinoza, 10, who took violin lessons with Brenda.</TE>
<TE>   Crisis counselors were on hand at the school and nearby La Merced
Elementary School, which the younger Garcias attended,</TE>
<TE>   "It has been rough," said Rosa Solis, La Merced Intermediate's
principal</TE>

<HD>Council Foes Trade Insults</HD>
<DH>2nd District: Cardenas attacks Greuel's 'tax-and-spend'
agenda. Her camp says his plan lacks substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Candidates in a tight race for a key spot on the Los Angeles City
Council traded insults Thursday as each attacked the other's vision
for the 2nd District.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Cardenas characterized a 51-point plan offered for Los
Angeles by opponent Wendy Greuel as "an extreme case of
tax-and-spend," and he released his own six-point plan--which Greuel
promptly dismissed as lacking substance.</LD>
<LD>   With the election for the east San Fernando Valley district seat
less than two weeks away, the campaign rhetoric heated up a notch
between Cardenas, a Democratic assemblyman from Panorama City, and
Greuel, a DreamWorks SKG executive from Van Nuys.</LD>
<TE>   Cardenas called for the opening of three council field offices in
the district, instead of the one that currently exists. He also said
he would make his council office "the place where constituents can go
to get a status report on any complaint."</TE>
<TE>   He called for annual audits of the 2nd District office, and said
he would bring in federal and state dollars to open local
small-business and job opportunity centers, and would make sure
Valley taxpayers get their fair share of city resources.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the candidate pledged to make sure the debate over a
possible vote on secession is a fair and open process. He called his
plan "simple and achievable."</TE>
<TE>   Countered Julie Buckner, a Greuel campaign spokeswoman, "We don't
think it's a plan at all. Instead, it's a handful of political
slogans in the form of a press release."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel's plan, released last week, includes proposals to expand
the police force by 1,500 officers, expand the senior lead officer
program, add firefighters and traffic officers, expand the L.A.'s
Best after-school program, spearhead efforts to find sites for new
schools and fight to preserve open space.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe her so-called plan is an extreme case of tax-and-spend--or
maybe it's really just cynical, calculated politics as usual, where
the game is about making promises you can't keep," Cardenas said in a
statement released by his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Buckner said Cardenas lacks credibility on the issue of taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no standing on this issue, as someone with a history of a
failure to pay taxes and a legislator at a time when the state faces
a $12-billion budget deficit," Buckner said.</TE>
<TE>   She released a 1997 notice of a federal personal income tax lien
against Cardenas for $12,000 that was owed, and the notice showing
the lien was lifted about three months later.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said the personal income tax lien stemmed from his
involvement with a nonprofit child-care group called Escuella de la
Gente that failed. As a member of the group's board of directors,
Cardenas said he agreed to pay the back taxes it owed. Cardenas said
he was paying the taxes in monthly installments as part of an
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service when he was surprised to
find that the IRS had filed a lien.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I found out there was a lien, I wrote a check and paid
it off completely," Cardenas said. "If they had bothered to tell me
there was a lien, I would have paid it sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas spokesman Josh Pulliam said he believes Greuel, by
attacking personal finances, is dodging the issue of the cost of her
51-point plan, which he said could be in the tens of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Greuel reported raising $299,000, including $95,000
in city matching funds, and ended the reporting period on Feb. 16
with $73,900 unspent in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas reported that his campaign has raised $228,000, including
$50,000 in city matching funds, and ended the period with $57,900
unspent.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel continued to win financial backing from entertainment
industry figures, attorneys, environmentalists, developers and city
officials who knew her from her work for then-Mayor Tom Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   She received 51 contributions from the entertainment industry,
including funds from Universal Studios, Paramount and the Fox Group,
producers Rob Reiner and Ray Stark, and Jack Valenti, president of
the Motion Picture Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Her coffers will swell further Monday when DreamWorks founders
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen sponsor their
second fund-raiser for Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas' fund-raising so far has included $50,000 from a Feb. 8
event held by Walt Disney Co. executives, including Chairman Michael
Eisner. He also received contributions from Universal Studios and
Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates are competing for the 2nd District seat vacated
in October when Councilman Joel Wachs resigned to take a job with an
art foundation in New York City. The district extends from
Sunland-Tujunga to Studio City, including parts of Sherman Oaks and
North Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Reopening Schools to Handle Surging Enrollment</HD>
<DH>Education: School district is feeling the effects of
immigration, denser housing and class-shrinking policies. Portable
classrooms will also be added.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anticipating a flood of new students, Garden Grove school officials
have voted to reopen campuses, change attendance boundaries and add
portable classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   "Our district is bursting at the seams, so it was an easy issue to
open those schools," said Terri Pitsenberger, a parent who served on
the committee that came up with the plan for the 50,000-student
Garden Grove Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   "We tried to make it as least-disruptive as possible," she said.
"People don't like change in general, but from what I've heard, most
of the community seems real supportive."</LD>
<TE>   A wave of immigrants to the district and the razing of some
single-family homes to build large apartment buildings have caused
enrollment in the district to rise rapidly, district spokesman Alan
Trudell said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, new programs such as computer labs and
state-mandated smaller class sizes in the primary grades have
increased demand for classroom space.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many Orange County districts that have grown steadily,
Garden Grove saw its enrollment peak in the 1960s at 53,000 students,
then gradually decline. Now, officials say they expect enrollment to
increase with the city's population, reaching 51,000 pupils over the
next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees voted Tuesday to reopen Garden Park Elementary, now being
operated by the nonpublic Rossier Elementary School for children who
cannot attend regular classes for a variety of reasons. Garden Park
will revert to a district school this fall. Rossier, which has used
the site for four years, will move, probably outside Garden Grove,
said the school's executive director, Barbara Casey.</TE>
<TE>   A closed campus, Edgar School, will reopen for districtwide
educational programs, possibly with a staff training center,
after-school programs and a preschool for special education students.</TE>
<TE>   Board members also voted to alter attendance boundaries for Loyal
H. Barker and Enders elementary schools, sending some students from
them to Garden Park.</TE>
<TE>   To relieve crowding on the growing eastern end of the district,
trustees decided to expand O.A. Peters Elementary School by adding 17
portable classrooms plus an administration office, multipurpose room,
cafeteria, library and restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   To relieve crowding at Woodbury Elementary, about 340 students in
the Gifted and Talented Education program there will move to Peters.
Fifty-five special education students at Peters, meanwhile, will move
to Woodbury. The two schools are about a mile apart.</TE>
<TE>   Boundary changes have been divisive in some Orange County school
districts. In Capistrano Unified, parents complained that the
district was ripping the community apart by separating children who
had been classmates since kindergarten. That dispute was resolved by
modifying some changes in school boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   But officials in Garden Grove said parents welcome the changes. No
one objected when the issue was raised in Tuesday's meeting of the
school board, Trudell said.</TE>

<LD>Temperatures broke records throughout the Los Angeles area Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Even in areas that didn't see record highs, temperatures reached
about 10 degrees above normal, according to meteorologist Jeremy
Nelson of Weather Cental Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "When you're talking about 10 degrees off the norm, you're talking
about stuff that doesn't happen often in any season," Nelson said.</LD>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, temperatures reached 88 degrees, breaking
a Feb. 21 record of 86 set in 1982, according to Weather Central. The
longest-standing record fell in Burbank, where highs reached 85, one
degree higher than Feb. 21, 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Winds blowing from Utah and Nevada created the high-pressure
system that pushed heat into California, Nelson said. The hot spell
is expected to continue through the weekend. Other Southland
communities setting high-temperature records Thursday included: Santa
Ana with 93 degrees (topping a record 87 set in 1995); Long Beach,
89; Torrance, 87, and Chatsworth, 88.</TE>

<HD>1-Year Jail Term Ordered for Simi Mother in 2 Sons' Heat
Deaths</HD>
<DH>Courts: The sentence is part of five years' probation for
Marlene Heath, 40. The boys died in a sweltering van in the family's
driveway last summer while she slept.</DH>

<LD>A Simi Valley mother who left her two young sons to die in a
sweltering minivan last summer while she lay asleep after drinking a
bottle of wine was ordered Thursday to serve a year in county jail as
part of a five-year sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark
came a week after he spared Marlene Heath, 40, a lengthy state prison
term following her no contest plea last fall in the Aug. 4 deaths of
her sons, Jake, 3, and Dylan, 13 months.</LD>
<LD>   Heath told police that after drinking the wine that morning, she
drove toward Ventura for a company picnic but turned back. She then
fell asleep in her bedroom and found the children strapped in their
car seats four hours later, dead.</LD>
<TE>   Clark, who last week sentenced Heath to probation, went with a
probation department recommendation that Heath serve jail time and
ordered the former Kinko's employee to begin her incarceration in
Ventura County Jail on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Aramesh, who prosecuted the case, said
that although she wanted state prison time for Heath, she was
satisfied with Clark's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "What she did was inexcusable," Aramesh said. "The message is that
you will serve time if you neglect your children."</TE>
<TE>   Because she could receive credit for good behavior while in jail,
Heath could be released in less than a year, prosecutors said. She
would then be on probation for the remainder of her 60-month
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Other terms of Heath's probation include performing 500 hours of
community service, attending 52 child abuse education classes and
paying $1,100 in investigation fees to the county probation
department.</TE>
<TE>   Heath's attorney, Louis Samonsky, said he was not surprised by the
jail sentence considering the level of public surprise that his
client was not sent to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any judge, he tries to reflect the community values,"
Samonsky said. "There was a backlash, so I figured there would be
some jail time, but she was a good mother by all accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last week, when Heath and her husband, Phillip, attended
the hearing surrounded by dozens of family members and friends, only
a few relatives attended Thursday's proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when reacting to Clark's decision to spare his wife a
prison sentence of up to 12 years for felony child endangerment,
Phillip Heath had said his sons "are up in heaven right now jumping
up and down."</TE>
<TE>   After Clark's ruling Thursday, he brushed aside reporters'
questions as he led his wife across a courthouse lawn to meet with
probation officials at the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Aramesh and Samonsky repeated to the judge the
themes they introduced last week.</TE>
<TE>   Aramesh said even though Heath knew she had a serious drinking
problem last summer, she chose to put her children at risk, first
when she drove drunk and then when she left them in the car with
outdoor temperatures of nearly 90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Samonsky said Heath has made substantial progress since she moved
full-time into a Ventura alcohol and drug treatment facility.</TE>
<TE>   "She would like to stay in her sober living house for another year
as a condition of her probation," Samonsky said.</TE>

<HD>Housing Authority Finances Under Federal Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Funds: Third suit in as many years alleges the city agency
mishandled money and punished those who complained. HUD audit is
underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Persistent allegations of financial wrongdoing at public housing
projects have triggered a federal audit of the Los Angeles Housing
Authority and a third lawsuit in three years charging retaliation
against people who complained.</LD>
<LD>   At issue, city officials said, is whether the agency or others
misspent some of the $25 million in federal funds funneled to
residents for providing security, janitorial and moving services at
the 20 city-run housing developments.</LD>
<LD>   "There is an audit in progress," said Mimi Lee, district inspector
general for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</LD>
<TE>   Tenant leaders, agency contractors and their attorney said they
have met with federal auditors and turned over a large number of
documents generated by the latest lawsuit. If the audit determines
that federal money was misused, HUD could seek reimbursement from the
Housing Authority. There is no criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In two previous lawsuits, the agency has been ordered to pay
judgments totaling $1.8 million to whistle-blowers.</TE>
<TE>   Federal auditors are reviewing the latest lawsuit, in which a
moving company owner alleges that agency managers received cash meant
for poor residents, manipulated bids on contracts, tolerated double
billing by a well-connected consultant and retaliated against those
who got in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Several tenant leaders alleged in depositions that managers took
away contracts when they complained about excessive consultant costs
and double billing.</TE>
<TE>   Among the allegations in the lawsuit are those made by Barron
Gardner, who owns Barron's Moving and Storage in Van Nuys. He accuses
the Housing Authority of taking away business and withholding
payments after he rebuffed a longtime authority consultant who wanted
a 10% payment to help Gardner get a moving contract that eventually
was worth more than $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the evidence shows that the Housing Authority is involved
in the misappropriation of funds," said Lenton Aikins, the attorney
who is handling the latest lawsuit. He won the two earlier suits.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Shen-Urquidez, an attorney for the Housing Authority, said
there is no merit to the allegations, which she described as coming
from disgruntled former agency contractors. She said some of the
allegations were "fabricated."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, scheduled for a hearing Wednesday in Los Angeles
Superior Court, also alleges that officials engaged in "misuse and
mismanagement" of funds that were meant to help poor residents of the
projects. It seeks unspecified damages and a court order requiring
reform of agency contracting practices.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the controversy is private consultant Dwayne
Williams, who has received $125-an-hour contracts to help resident
groups organize security, moving and janitorial services at six city
housing projects. Williams is a defendant in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Based on billings Aikins obtained from the agency, he estimated
that Williams has been paid more than $1.2 million since 1995 by the
agency and resident groups at Jordan Downs, Pueblo del Rio, Estrada
Courts, William Mead, San Fernando Gardens and Aliso Village.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that tenant complaints about double billing
and excessive charges by Williams were ignored by agency Assistant
Director Lucille Loyce.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Toliver, former president of the Resident Management
Council at Jordan Downs and former head of the Jordan Downs
Management Group Inc., said in a deposition that Williams was hired
to help her council set up a thrift store to employ residents.</TE>
<TE>   The store was never opened, but tenant leaders said in depositions
and interviews that they paid themselves bonuses at the urging of
Williams, who managed the finances for the corporation. Officials
denied that Williams approved bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Toliver, who headed the Resident Management Council from 1995 to
2000, said in a deposition taken by Housing Authority attorneys that
she accepted bonuses of about $500 twice. She also said in the
statement that she gave Loyce $500 in cash twice and bought a $400
purse for Loyce.</TE>
<TE>   "That is an absolute, outright fabrication," Shen-Urquidez said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyce and other Housing Authority officials deny that they
received money or that Williams acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Shen-Urquidez said the tenant leaders made allegations against
Williams after he reported improper bonuses and other spending.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the whistle-blower. That is why they are going after him,"
Shen-Urquidez said, adding that agency officials are considering
whether to pursue criminal charges against some tenant leaders who
allegedly misused money.</TE>
<TE>   She credited Loyce and Williams with bringing millions of dollars
to job-creation programs in Jordan Downs and other housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, the Van Nuys mover who has done business with the agency
for 15 years, alleged in the lawsuit that Williams "demanded" a 10%
payment "in return for a guarantee that [Gardner] would receive the
William Mead [moving] contract." Gardner said he rejected Williams'
demand and lost the contract.</TE>
<TE>   In a previous suit against the Housing Authority, Margaret
Gardenhire, an agency manager who oversaw activity at Jordan Downs
and was once named employee of the year, was awarded $1.3 million for
claims of retaliation for reporting complaints about Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Housing Authority contracting director George Marioneaux
alleged retaliation for his "refusal to violate the law and engage in
fraudulent and excessive invoicing of the federal government''
related to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. A jury awarded him
$572,992 in damages. The two parties later reached a confidential
settlement, which ended an appeal of the lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>LAX 'VIP Lines' May Be Axed</HD>
<DH>Travel: Confusion results after new aviation security
agency orders halt to special treatment for frequent fliers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For harried business travelers, navigating the nation's airports
post-9/11 has meant long lines, uncertain departure times and hours
of waiting. But the airlines created at least one perk to pacify
their best customers: special "VIP lines" at crowded security
checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   So it was with confusion, anger and occasionally resignation that
frequent fliers greeted the news this week that transportation
bureaucrats were trying to take away the shorter, faster lines.</LD>
<LD>   The fledgling Transportation Security Administration ordered the
airlines to eliminate the popular VIP lines Sunday. That's when the
agency officially assumed responsibility for screening checkpoints at
the nation's 429 commercial airports. The 3-month-old TSA said the
move was necessary to make screening more consistent and efficient
from airport to airport and passenger to passenger.</LD>
<TE>   Airlines interpreted the order in myriad ways. At Los Angeles
International Airport, some carriers ignored the request. At other
locales, airlines put signs for priority lines back in place when
their competitors failed to comply. Airlines complained that federal
security employees were enforcing the plan inconsistently. And the
confusion prompted the security bureaucrats to clarify their
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   The imbroglio illustrates the enormous challenges facing the TSA,
which was created last year by Congress to revamp security at the
nation's airports. As in the case of VIP lines, the agency and its
security imperative are expected to repeatedly collide with the
airlines' insistence on easing the way for their customers.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be conflicts every step of the way," predicted Billie
H. Vincent, a former Federal Aviation Administration security chief.
"Knowing the nature of the industry, the airlines and the airports
both will resist doing things."</TE>
<TE>   TSA officials urged patience as bureaucrats work to build the
organization while scurrying to comply with stringent deadlines in
the new aviation security bill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big system starting up quickly," said Jim Mitchell, a
TSA spokesman. "We have a lot of new people in airports representing
us, and there are a few situations where things are not the way we
want it to be."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest carriers, including United, American, Northwest, Delta
and Continental, created the VIP lines after the terrorist attacks to
lure lucrative business travelers back to the skies.</TE>
<TE>   Those coveted fliers produce the bulk of airlines revenues.</TE>
<TE>   It was perhaps no surprise, then, that the carriers responded to
Sunday's "no-VIP line" rule by trying to preserve as much privilege
for frequent fliers as they could.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Airlines insisted that its 2-month-old "exclusive
security lanes" in cities including Detroit, Seattle, Chicago and Los
Angeles remain legitimate because the separate lines end before they
reach security checkpoints. The lines feed into a single set of
baggage X-ray machines and metal detectors used by all customers.</TE>
<TE>   Other airlines quickly adopted this argument.</TE>
<TE>   After initially expressing doubts about the continue use of elite
lines, the federal agency later said the lines would be allowed--as
long as all passengers had equal access to security equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Though the airlines insisted that they are complying with the
federal directive, the reality at LAX this week showed something
different.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, a United employee guided frequent fliers
through a designated first class line that fed into two X-ray
machines and metal detectors. Other passengers were routed around
these machines to another, longer line.</TE>
<TE>   At American Airlines' Terminal 4, first and business class
passengers also were directed to a separate line. Although there was
no VIP sign, an airline employee waved them toward that line, where
only a handful of people waited.</TE>
<TE>   Most coach class passengers followed the natural flow of traffic
to a much longer general security line, where they had to wait with
dozens of others to be scanned.</TE>
<TE>   As in the United terminal, the queue where first and business
class passengers were directed by American employees had its own
X-ray machine and metal detector.</TE>
<TE>   Federal security officials said they knew some airlines were
violating the directive by directing frequent fliers to special
checkpoints. But officials at the TSA said they have authority over
the screening areas, and will eventually ensure that the airlines
comply.</TE>
<TE>   The new equilibrium at the terminals was only beginning to dawn on
travelers. And many business fliers weren't happy to hear that their
special shortcuts might be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it matters," snapped Steve Wasserman, 40, an investment
banker traveling to New York. Wasserman, who logs 70,000 miles a year
in the air, was perspiring as he said he had only a few minutes to
reach his flight.</TE>
<TE>   Others agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horrible idea," said Elias AbuShanab, 34, a retail
executive with a clothing firm. "Certainly because I travel a lot,
and business travelers are how the airlines make their money."</TE>
<TE>   But several other executives exhibited the spirit of cooperation
still evident at many of the nation's airports since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to take me 15 minutes to get on an airplane," said Andy
Espinosa, 60, a salesman who travels twice a month. "These lines are
good for us. On the other hand, I can see why others would be
frustrated by it. We need to combine solidarity and privileges."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure from businesspeople and airlines for greater speed
promises to color the security discussions for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne McInerney, executive director of the National Business
Travel Assn., said companies suffer billions in lost productivity
when employees get stuck in airports.</TE>
<TE>   Those travelers expect "an efficient security process universally
across the entire system," said McInerney, whose organization
represents corporate travel departments at companies such as
Coca-Cola Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gap Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Travel is a huge economic driver in our economy," McInerney said.
"So if companies stand to lose $12 billion a year, and the traveler
knows it will take two to three hours for the travel experience, is
there a better alternative? Yeah. Are they going to stay home?
Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and James F. Peltz
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Stephen Longstreet, an artist, screenwriter and author of more than

<LD>   Longstreet, a longtime Beverly Hills resident whose best-known

world of jazz during the 20th century, died Wednesday of pneumonia
and congestive heart failure at Century City Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   An artist by training, Longstreet turned to writing to make a
living during the Depression. His career as a writer, which continued
into his 80s, was as varied as it was long.</LD>
<TE>   He wrote detective novels in the mid-1930s under a variety of pen
names before writing fiction under his own name, including "The
Pedlocks" and "The Flesh Peddlers."</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote radio scripts, served as a film critic for the
Saturday Review and wrote syndicated book reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Under contract at Warner Bros. in the 1940s, Longstreet wrote "The
Jolson Story" and also "Stallion Road," based on his novel of the
same name and starring Ronald Reagan. He later wrote "The Helen
Morgan Story," and as a television writer in the '50s and '60s he
wrote for "Playhouse 90."</TE>
<TE>   He even wrote the book for the hit 1947 Broadway musical "High
Button Shoes," which was based on his novel, "The Sisters Liked Them
Handsome."</TE>
<TE>   Longstreet's extensive list of nonfiction works includes "San
Francisco, '49 to '06," and "Chicago: 1860 to 1920," as well as "A
Century on Wheels, the Story of Studebaker" and a Jewish cookbook
that he wrote with his wife and occasional collaborator, Ethel.</TE>
<TE>   A number of his books dealt with jazz, including "Jazz From A to
Z: A Graphic Dictionary," his 100th book, published in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The world of jazz was a constant theme throughout Longstreet's
life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City in 1907, he grew up in New Brunswick, N.J.,
where he was introduced to ragtime and jazz by future singing legend
Paul Robeson, then an All-American football player at Rutgers
University.</TE>
<TE>   Their friendship began in 1918, when Robeson spotted the
11-year-old Longstreet sketching him as he practiced dropkicking.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1986 book "Storyville to Harlem: Fifty Years in the Jazz
Scene," Longstreet explained that Robeson made him "aware of the gap
between the music taught on paper and the 'razzmatazz' sounds of the
scratchy jazz recordings."</TE>
<TE>   While studying at the School of Fine and Applied Arts in New York
in the late '20s, Longstreet drew the musical scenes in Greenwich
Village, the speak-easies and the Cotton Club in Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hoped to capture with black marks on white paper, this
music created by these people, and set down what they looked like,
felt and did before they were gone," he later wrote.</TE>
<TE>   By the late '20s, Longstreet was furthering his artistic studies
in Paris, where he met Picasso, Matisse and other artists. He also
met and drew James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and the American "jazzmen"
who were, he later wrote, "escaping from Judge Lynch and the back of
the bus."</TE>
<TE>   After returning to the United States in 1930, he traveled south to
New Orleans, discovering the "strange and wonderful sounds" of
jazzmen playing in Storyville, the city's red light district, and
capturing them in his work.</TE>
<TE>   He later drew and painted Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie
Holiday, Duke Ellington and other jazz greats.</TE>
<TE>   Of Longstreet's depictions of the century's jazz scene, Louis
Armstrong wrote in 1971: "You want to feel the smell--the color--the
great 'OH MY' feeling of the jazzmen, and stomp around in the smoke
and dusk of the joints ... then you just go and locate some of the
drawings and paintings of this cat Steve Longstreet and steal you a
few."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Longstreet's jazz-era works, including collages,
watercolors and ink drawings, were exhibited in museums and
galleries, including the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian
Institution.</TE>
<TE>   But Longstreet's lifelong love of jazz was strictly from an
artistic sense, his son, Harry, believes.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved how it looked; he loved the colors," he said Thursday.
"I'm not sure he cared that much for the music--I confess to you, I
never heard him listen to jazz--but he loved the milieu and just
loved to draw and paint it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Longstreet is survived by his daughter,
Joan Tanney of Los Angeles; five grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm standing outside the Richard J. Riordan Central Library in
downtown Los Angeles, asking people if they know who's running for
governor of California.</LD>
<LD>   "The mayor is running," one guy tells me.</LD>
<LD>   What mayor is that? I ask.</LD>
<TE>   "Whatzisname. Bill Hahn is running."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been taking a look at the issues," says another man.</TE>
<TE>   But who's running? I ask again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's, no, wait a minute. Who's that one guy?"</TE>
<TE>   Two thoughts come to mind.</TE>
<TE>   First, I'm seriously reconsidering my belief that we need to get
more citizens involved in the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Second, if people at the Richard J. Riordan library in Los Angeles
don't know he's running for governor, what chance does Riordan have
in Yreka and Shasta?</TE>
<TE>   I talked to more than a dozen people at the library, half of whom
named Riordan as a candidate. But only two or three could associate
the candidates with any particular issue, and only one person was
able to name all four dogs in the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon and Bill Jones are with Riordan in the Republican
primary, hoping for a chance to take out Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of ignorance and indifference is another reminder that
running for statewide office in Balkanized California is no holiday,
particularly if you're the ex-leader of Los Angeles, which is viewed
as hell's parking lot in the part of the state where I grew up.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not as if Riordan's brain trust didn't have a decent
candidate to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that Riordan and his bush league team, on early
inspection, have no clue how to run a major league campaign. Not even
against a couple of stiffs like Simon and Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who breaks left on some things and right on others, is
working on his third marriage, has no interest whatsoever in
conventional governance and believes in God but breaks half the rules
of his church, could have been billed as a Californian for all
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Instead he's allowed himself to get sucked into a no-win ruckus
over his contradictory views on abortion. Then he attacked lobbyists
in a moment of desperation, and now he's acknowledged the ship is
listing by firing televised torpedoes at Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Can anything do more to boost Simon's candidacy than for Riordan
to demonstrate that he suddenly fears him? It's like Shaquille O'Neal
taking a poke at that scrubby Chicago Bulls center no one had ever
heard of.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the cocky self-confidence we all grew to expect from the
man who gladly used his own money or his rich friends to fix every
problem he encountered? Where's the unapologetic quipster who often
speaks of the underprivileged, but once said, "I'm taking lessons in
learning how to wave to poor people."</TE>
<TE>   Most people have to die before getting a building in their name,
but not Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   I stood in the audience the day of the ceremony at the library
last June, marveling at his chutzpah. Employees grumbled under their
breath as Rufus Von KleinSmid, the former library commissioner, had
his name replaced by Richard J. Riordan's. Unfortunately poor old
Rufus couldn't put up much of a fight. He's dead.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the kind of arrogance that can take you to the top, and
with Simon having sliced 20 points off Riordan's lead, now is the
hour for the ex-mayor to play to his strengths.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for him to start spending serious money from Yountville
to Yucca Valley and buy this thing fair and square.</TE>
<TE>   If I were running his campaign, I'd buy TV, I'd buy radio, and I'd
buy a billboard on every mile of California highway. But I'd start by
making that sign at the library much, much bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Back to my man-on-the-street interviews, I corner a crew member
from the TV show "Leap of Faith," which is shooting a scene downtown.
He's game to name the candidates, but this lifelong Angeleno can't
think of one to save his life. How about some clues? he pleads.</TE>
<TE>   All right, I say. A major downtown building is named after one of
them.</TE>
<TE>   I toss a look over my shoulder, but he gazes past the "Richard J.
Riordan" sign and across the skyline.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, wait a minute," he says. "Isn't Magic Johnson running?"</TE>
<TE>   No, I say.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea doesn't sound all that bad.</TE>

<HD>Judge Issues Gag Order to Attorneys in Luster Date-Rape
Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing concerns about locating neutral jurors, a judge Thursday
issued a gag order in the trial of millionaire date-rape suspect
Andrew Luster, barring attorneys in the case from commenting outside
the courtroom about the proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   "You can imagine the nightmare it will be trying to select a
jury," said Superior Court Judge Ken Riley in explaining his ruling.
"I want this case tried in the courtroom."</LD>
<LD>   Riley set a July 15 trial date for 38-year-old Luster, the
great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, and said he would issue
a ruling today on one of two motions filed by Luster's attorneys
seeking to enter into evidence additional items they say will
exonerate their client.</LD>
<TE>   Luster, a Mussel Shoals resident, is accused of sexually
assaulting three women after allegedly rendering them unconscious
with a date rape drug known as gamma hydroxybutrate, or GHB. He was
arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported being raped.</TE>
<TE>   Riley's ruling came a week after prosecutors requested the gag
order, saying that previous out-of-court statements by Luster's
attorneys could taint the jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have accused police and prosecutors of
withholding evidence and of not properly investigating the claims of
the alleged victims before filing charges. Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony
Wold has denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Jon Diamond, an attorney representing Luster, told Riley
that prosecutors were the first ones to speak to the media about the
case "and we simply responded."</TE>
<TE>   "The day Mr. Luster was arrested prosecutors issued a press
release and they have been continuing to contaminate the jury pool,"
Diamond said. "They are pursuing an innocent man here."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Mahony Vows Hard Line on Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH>Church: Archdiocese policy requires investigation of any
allegations, especially involving children, and guilty priests will
not be reassigned, he reiterates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has promised the Los Angeles Archdiocese
that any allegation of sexual abuse by clergy, especially child
molestation, will be investigated and abusers will not simply be
reassigned.</LD>
<LD>   "The sexual abuse of minors is the most heinous of all," Mahony
wrote in a lengthy pastoral statement on archdiocesan policy
published in today's editions of the Tidings, the archdiocesan
newspaper. He said the policy has been promulgated since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the archdiocese said Mahony did not plan to grant
press interviews on the topic.</LD>
<TE>   The cardinal wrote that the archdiocese "will not knowingly assign
or retain a priest, deacon, religious or layperson to serve in its
parishes, schools, pastoral ministries, or any other assignment when
such an individual is determined to have previously engaged in the
sexual abuse of a minor."</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Los Angeles and Orange dioceses paid $5.2 million to
settle sexual molestation allegations made against a high-profile
priest. Several similar scandals--including one that ended with a
prison sentence Thursday for a Roman Catholic priest in Boston
accused of molesting a 10-year-old --have heightened public concern.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II last year raised his voice on the issue. Earlier
this year, it was revealed that the Vatican had issued new guidelines
for pedophilia cases. However, critics noted that they do not require
church officials to notify law enforcement officials in response to
complaints or findings of priest behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Archdiocese spokesman Tod M. Tamberg said that, given
the focus on sex abuse by priests, Mahony wanted "to reiterate ...
that we have comprehensive policies."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony wrote: "Tragically, some who have ministered in the name of
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles have preyed upon the most vulnerable
members of the flock and have caused them incalculable harm." He said
violation of young people while in the care of the church "is the
most despicable breach of trust" and that it is crucial for the
church to "honestly" confront the reality of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "If the archdiocese determines that a priest or deacon has engaged
in such conduct, that person will be removed from all clerical
offices and all pastoral or educational ministry and will not be
reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he will never return to active ministry, he will be
encouraged to seek a dispensation from the obligations of the
priesthood or the diaconate and to return to the lay state," Mahony's
letter added.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony became archbishop of the three-county archdiocese in 1986.
Two years later he issued "zero tolerance" written policies on how to
proceed if there is sexual abuse by clergy. One states: "Never deal
with a problem of sexual abuse on the part of a priest or deacon by
simply moving him to another ministerial assignment."</TE>

<HD>Couple's Tie to Vicious Dog Ring Alleged</HD>
<DH>Courts: The two aided prison inmates in raising killer
animals, a state corrections official says. The pair's lawyers deny
the accusation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco couple charged in their neighbor's fatal
dog-mauling were associates of a white supremacist prison gang and
helped inmates run a killer dog breeding ring, a state corrections
official testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants, Robert Noel and Marjorie Knoller, "were actively
involved in raising, breeding and training dogs ... with these
members of the Aryan Brotherhood," said Devan Hawkes, a special agent
with the California Department of Corrections.</LD>
<LD>   Two of their dogs, Presa Canarios weighing more than 100 pounds
each, attacked college lacrosse coach Diane Whipple outside her
apartment door Jan. 26, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Noel, 60, and Knoller, 46, are charged with involuntary
manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog. Knoller also faces a
second-degree murder charge and could receive a sentence of 15 years
to life. Her husband, Noel, faces a possible sentence of four years.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles Superior
Court because of publicity in the Bay Area. Opening statements and
testimony began Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkes, who has investigated prison gangs for more than 15 years,
told the jury Thursday that a series of letters, drawings and books
showed that inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison were running a
business breeding dogs for profit. Noel and Knoller played a
significant part in the operation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was found in both the cell shared by inmates Paul
Schneider and Dale Bretches and the apartment where Noel and Knoller
lived, Hawkes said.</TE>
<TE>   The inmates named the operation "Dog O' War" and set up a Web site
to advertise the dogs, he testified. Bretches also bought books
titled "Gladiator Dogs" and "Manstopper: Training a K-9 Guardian" and
mailed pages of both to Noel and Knoller, Hawkes said, adding that
one flier displayed photographs of Presa Canario dogs alongside the
words "Bane--death: ruin: destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, maintain that their clients did not
take part in any dog breeding business. The attorneys said the dogs
involved in the Whipple attack, Bane and Hera, could not be used for
breeding because they had medical problems. Both dogs have been
destroyed since Whipple's death.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination of Hawkes, both defense attorneys
challenged Hawkes' statement that their clients were associated with
the gang. The attorneys, Bruce Hotchkiss and Nedra Ruiz, suggested
that their clients, who adopted Schneider as their son, may have
helped the inmates as friends without intending to help the gang.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor James Hammer displayed enlarged copies of several
letters stamped "Confidential Legal Mail," including one in which
Noel wrote that neither he nor Knoller would stop Schneider from
escaping from prison if he attempted to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "If you went for the door, all she or I would do was to wave you
good bye," the letter read.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkes testified that in another letter, Noel identified the
location of two former Pelican Bay inmates identified as enemies of
the Aryan Brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   That letter, addressed to Bretches, may have put those inmates in
danger, Hawkes said. Noel signed that letter, "With warmest regards
and best wishes, your friend, Robert," Hawkes said.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony, David Moser, a former neighbor of the
defendants, said one of the dogs bit him on the buttocks in the lobby
of the same apartment building in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I jumped a few feet away and exclaimed, 'Your dog just bit me!'"
Moser testified. "[Noel] just looked and said, 'Hmm. Interesting' and
just walked away."</TE>
<TE>   Moser said he did not report the incident until after Whipple's
death.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Knoller's mother said she resented the
prosecutors' attempt to portray her daughter and Noel as Nazis. She
said they are Jewish and were married in a temple.</TE>
<TE>   "What would a Jewish girl be doing with the Aryan Brotherhood?"
Harriet Knoller asked.</TE>

<HD>Simon Attack Ad Says Riordan Is Ashamed to Be a Republican</HD>
<DH>Politics: Accusations intensify in governor's race as the
March 5 primary approaches.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financier Bill Simon Jr., who for months had been reluctant to
criticize Richard Riordan, on Thursday unleashed his first attack ad
against his friend and GOP rival, accusing the former Los Angeles
mayor of being "ashamed to be a Republican."</LD>
<LD>   The sharp-edged Simon spot opens up a second front for Riordan,
who already is facing a $7.5-million television advertising blitz by
Gov. Gray Davis, the incumbent Democrat in the race for governor of
California.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last month, Davis has engaged in an unusual strategy to
influence the Republican contest.</LD>
<TE>   He has pumped millions into his ad campaign attacking Riordan on
the emotional issues of abortion and the death penalty, even though
Davis has no serious opposition in his own primary.</TE>
<TE>   The paid television campaign is heating up as the race enters a
pivotal phase, with strategists making the tactical decisions that
will carry them through election day.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign disclosure reports filed Thursday indicate that Simon and
Riordan dramatically stepped up their fund-raising over the last few
weeks, pulling in several million dollars in February. Secretary of
State Bill Jones trailed far behind the other two.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the three Republicans have raised more than $23 million
for their campaign efforts to unseat Davis.</TE>
<TE>   From Jan. 20 through Saturday, Simon, a multimillionaire, led the
pack with $2.4 million, mostly in loans to himself. Riordan raised
$2.1 million, while Jones collected $532,000.</TE>
<TE>   Simon turned his financial advantage into a major advertising
purchase on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign placed orders for more than $1 million in spots over
the next week--with sources saying that is just the beginning of a
stepped-up effort ahead of the March 5 primary. Simon also loaned his
campaign an additional $1 million this week.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's ads Thursday came in response to a spot Riordan began
airing 24 hours earlier. The Riordan ad took aim at the wealthy
Pacific Palisades businessman by questioning Simon's business acumen
and involvement with a failed savings and loan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the airwaves were thick with activity Thursday, two of
the three major Republican candidates stayed largely out of view.</TE>
<TE>   Simon had no public events, and Jones scheduled an event near a
San Jose fund-raiser featuring Vice President Dick Cheney, but
canceled it due to scheduling difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, meanwhile, campaigned at a conference of electrical power
traders at a resort outside Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you make too much on the backs of the public, it's not good
policy,'' Riordan told the group, adding that he would seek to
renegotiate some of the contracts that the Davis administration
entered into with power suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's certainly not being a good citizen, and I think it's not
even good business in the long run for your companies,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the airwaves, the new Simon ad capitalized on Riordan's past
support of Democrats, an issue that has dogged the former mayor
throughout the Republican primary campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The ad opens with an image of Riordan and President Bill Clinton
jogging together, as a male announcer quotes the former mayor calling
Clinton "the greatest leader of the free world."</TE>
<TE>   Simon then addresses the camera. "There sure are some differences
between myself and Dick Riordan," the candidate says.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a conservative Republican. My political heroes are Ronald
Reagan, President Bush and Rudy Giuliani--certainly not Bill
Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's parting line is: "Unlike Dick Riordan, I'm not ashamed to
be a Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's consultant, Sal Russo, said the new 30-second spot is the
first in a series.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign responded by ignoring Simon's charges and
reiterating its criticisms of Simon's voting record and his business
history.</TE>
<TE>   The spate of television advertising has been paid for by a flurry
of fund-raising that has gained in intensity as the race has
apparently tightened.</TE>
<TE>   The reports show that Riordan spent $5.8 million from Jan. 1
through Saturday, the end of the latest reporting period. Of that,
almost $4.5 million went for advertising, or about 77% of his
expenditures during that period.</TE>
<TE>   Simon reported campaign expenses of $4.9 million during the same
period, with almost $3.1 million going to air or produce television
ads.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's most recent report further illustrates the maverick
Republican's diverse base.</TE>
<TE>   One of Riordan's major donors, for instance, is a prominent
Hollywood executive who usually supports Democratic causes.</TE>
<TE>   Television syndication pioneer Michael King of CBS Enterprises
gave Riordan $50,000. King, who made a fortune with his brother Roger
syndicating ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Jeopardy,'' has contributed
more than $200,000 to the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Jerrold Perenchio, chairman of Univision, the nation's
largest Spanish-language television network, gave Riordan $250,000 in
the latest period. Perenchio has also been a leading contributor to
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also raised $150,000 from 15 insurance companies that gave
$10,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Riordan's contributions, which came from an array
of sources, Simon was the largest single contributor to his own
campaign, loaning $1.72 million during the most recent period. That
brought his total loans to himself to $4 million, which increased to
$5 million with the money he added this week.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Simon's largest campaign contributors are relatives and
friends from the New York-New Jersey area, where his father, former
Treasury Secretary William Simon, built the family's investment
business.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a rancher from the Central Valley, is drawing many of his
larger contributions from agricultural interests and Central Valley
residents.</TE>
<TE>   His largest contribution during the recent period was a $50,000
donation from the California Farm Bureau Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has struggled to keep up with the other Republicans in
raising money, is the only candidate in recent weeks who has been
unable to engage in extensive television advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he sent a letter to Republican voters from former Gov.
George Deukemjian, also questioning Riordan's loyalty to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mark Z. Barabak and Michael Finnegan and
researcher Maloy Moore contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>A Disneyland monorail stalled on a 25-foot-high track Thursday,
briefly stranding about 65 passengers, park officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The guests were led to the ground by firefighters, and no injuries
were reported, Disneyland spokesman Ray Gomez said.</LD>
<LD>   An Anaheim fire-and-rescue crew called to the theme park about
2:30 p.m. used three ladders to take passengers one by one from the
train, which stopped along a tree-lined path near the It's a Small
World ride in the park's northeast corner.</LD>
<TE>   "They all seemed very calm," Fire Department spokeswoman Maria
Sabol said of the guests.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said the electric-powered monorail has lost power before,
though such incidents are uncommon. The cause of Thursday's outage
had not been determined, he said, and no other park attractions were
affected.</TE>
<TE>   The Monorail, which carries passengers on circuits through the
Disneyland complex, opened in June 1959 and is continually upgraded,
Gomez said.</TE>

<HD>Davis May Delay Ban on Gas Additive</HD>
<DH>Pollution: The governor cites possible shortages if MTBE is
removed by December deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Concerned that California could face gasoline shortages by year's
end, Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday he is considering delaying a ban
on the gasoline additive MTBE, a substance that has fouled ground
water but also makes up a large amount of the state's gasoline
supply.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' announcement Thursday was aimed at pressuring the Bush
administration and Congress to intervene on California's behalf. The
state wants more time to comply with what amounts to a federal
requirement that it replace MTBE as a gasoline additive with ethanol,
a product pushed by influential Midwestern corn growers.</LD>
<LD>   Davis said he intends to make a final decision whether to delay
the ban within 40 days. His comments followed a California Energy
Commission report issued earlier this week warning that the MTBE ban
would lead to "prolonged shortages" and a doubling of pump prices.</LD>
<TE>   "I do believe we have to look at the economic consequences," Davis
said. "Do we have the infrastructure in place to ship all the ethanol
from the Midwest to California?"</TE>
<TE>   In one of his first acts in office, Davis in March 1999 ordered
that MTBE be removed from gasoline by December 2002. The move,
cheered by environmentalists, came as evidence mounted that the
additive was leeching into ground water and had forced the closure of
wells in Santa Monica and Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Davis contended that California refineries could
produce gasoline without using MTBE or similar additives and still
exceed federal clean-air standards. The Democratic governor asked the
Bush administration for a waiver from a federal requirement that
states add so-called oxygenates to gasoline to help reduce auto
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the Bush administration refused to grant the
exemption--leaving the state with no alternative but to replace MTBE
with ethanol, a substance that serves the same function, or continue
using MTBE. Given California's dependence on cars, the state would
need 580 million gallons of ethanol a year, or one-third of the U.S.
production.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason scientifically or economically that we should
have to have 2% ethanol by volume in every gallon of gasoline sold in
California," Davis said Thursday. "This decision is totally driven by
politics of the Midwest. While I respect that, I'm going to continue
to fight for the interests of California."</TE>
<TE>   California refineries began adding MTBE in the 1990s to help clean
the air. But although clean air advocates have said the additive has
had dramatic effects on air quality, MTBE leeches into ground water
from leaking tanks, and does not dissolve. It spills into lakes ,
from two-stroke engines.</TE>

<HD>Planners Approve Oakmont Report</HD>
<DH>Glendale: Residents say their views were ignored in
environmental statement for proposed hillside development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA and KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Glendale environmental planners approved a consultant's report
detailing increases in traffic and pollution that a proposed housing
development would bring, homeowners and environmentalists argued that
alternatives to Oakmont View V were given short shrift or ignored
altogether.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a strong appearance of favoritism toward the applicant,"
said Steve Larson, who spoke on behalf of the Oakmont Woods
Homeowners Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Oakmont View V is a proposed development of 572 luxury homes in
the Verdugo Mountains above Oakmont Country Club.</LD>
<TE>   The environmental impact report, a four-volume tome of more than
2,000 pages, is the second version submitted after the City Council
denounced the first one as lacking public comment. It was released
last week by Jones &amp; Stokes, an Irvine-based consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   The report concluded that the project would harm the air, wildlife
and scenic vistas. Thirty-three so-called "unavoidable environmental
impacts" were listed in the report. They included increased traffic,
noise and pollution and a reduction in open space.</TE>
<TE>   But the report said the development would not significantly
increase the city's population or require building community
facilities to accommodate growth.</TE>
<TE>   Senior City Planner David A. Bobardt emphasized that the
Environmental Planning Board was not making a recommendation on the
Oakmont project itself but only on the environmental impact report.
The City Council will have the final decision on the development.</TE>
<TE>   "The planning department staff believes the EIR exceeds
requirements contained in [the California Environmental Quality Act],
state and city guidelines," Bobardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The report outlined at least seven alternatives to the existing
Oakmont plan, ranging from building 482 units to none at all or
setting aside the space for a cemetery. Homeowners in attendance said
the report did not adequately examine those and other alternatives,
including dedicating the area to recreation space.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners said they came forward with numerous complaints when a
previous environmental report was prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the most troubling aspect with the final EIR is its
failure to respond to [public] comments," Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of hundreds of homeowners and environmentalists
filling the second-floor council chambers, city staff members had set
up extra seating and a sound system on the first floor of City Hall.
But only about 50 people were in Thursday night's audience.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakmont development would replace woodlands of oak and
sycamore trees, acorn woodpeckers, deer and other wildlife in
Glendale's Verdugo Mountains. Previous Oakmont phases produced
three-story mansions on the hillside, often just 10 feet apart.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed federal legislation calls for a study to expand the Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the Verdugos. It
would allow the Oakmont land to be used as recreational space.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved $8 million toward the purchase of
the Oakmont tract, but Oakmont developer John L. Gregg said the land
was appraised at $46 million more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg said his company, Gregg's Artistic Homes, proposed the
project in 1992, a year before Glendale adopted a hillside law that
would have limited the number of homes to about 50. Gregg sued the
city, ultimately agreeing to drop the lawsuit if officials allowed
the proposal to proceed under the earlier, less restrictive
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision on Oakmont is scheduled next month.</TE>

<HD>Evaluation Criteria for Chief Listed</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Eight topics are outlined by panel, which vows
open-mindedness in deciding Parks' future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks will be evaluated
on criteria ranging from crime prevention to officer morale to
determine whether he deserves another five years at his post, the
Police Commission said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the criteria at a news conference, commission
President Rick Caruso said a decision could be reached within 45
days. He also stressed that commission members have not made up their
minds, despite the recent announcement by Mayor James K. Hahn that he
opposes Parks' reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Under the City Charter, which allows the police chief to serve a
maximum of two five-year terms, the reappointment decision falls to
the commission, not the mayor. The commission's decision is subject
to a City Council veto, which would require a two-thirds vote.</LD>
<TE>   Several of the eight criteria cover issues that Hahn raised in his
statements in opposition to the chief--among them, officer morale and
recruitment.</TE>
<TE>   But commissioners' oft-voiced concerns about crime are also
reflected, as are what one commissioner termed the "standard stuff"
of personnel evaluations, such as whether Parks manages effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso took the opportunity Thursday to brush off speculation that
the panel is politically beholden to the mayor, emphasizing that
commissioners would make independent decisions based on a "thorough
and fair" evaluation of Parks' tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Although commissioners are mayoral appointees, Caruso stressed
that their charge is to represent city residents, not Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "Personalities, politics and spin have no place in our process,"
Caruso said, adding: "The commission's guiding principle is what is
in the best interests of the residents of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Cmdr. Gary Brennan, an LAPD spokesman, said Parks had
received the criteria but had not yet been versed in the procedure
the commission will follow. Nonetheless, "he is preparing to address
each one of the issues in the criteria, and he looks forward to
having that opportunity," Brennan said. "He feels confident that each
can be thoroughly and adequately addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Parks, speaking of the commission at an unrelated news conference
in the San Fernando Valley, said Thursday: "They say they're
independent. All we can do is go by their judgments and their word."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the commission had put together "a good set of
criteria." He added that the decision "is in their hands, and I want
them to hear from other officials, the community and other interested
people and really take this job seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether to reappoint Parks or replace him became
more clouded this month when Hahn declared his opposition. The
announcement angered many prominent leaders of the city's African
American community, who support the chief, himself African American,
and who provided Hahn with a key base of support during his mayoral
campaign. The decision was applauded by various detractors of the
chief, including some longtime civilian critics of the LAPD and
police union leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Chief's Term Marked by Strife With Union</TE>
<TE>   Parks, a 37-year department veteran, is considered a strong
disciplinarian, and the number of officers investigated for
misconduct has expanded greatly under his watch. His term has been
characterized by bitter controversies with the officers union, which
criticizes his discipline system and says most of its members do not
have confidence in his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The chief was appointed in 1997 under former Mayor Richard
Riordan, now a Republican gubernatorial candidate. Caruso said the
commission will try to decide whether to reappoint Parks within the
next 30 to 45 days, but may postpone the decision up to the statutory
deadline in mid-May if members feel more time is needed.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is personally "on the fence" about Parks. The chief
will have the opportunity to meet with the commission and make his
case, Caruso said, adding: "We will give him as much time as he
wants."</TE>
<TE>   Although comments on the reappointment question will be taken
during regular commission meetings, which are open to the public,
most of the proceedings will take place out of the public eye in
closed sessions to consider personnel matters, said Joe Gunn,
executive director of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Criteria Termed Deliberately General</TE>
<TE>   The eight criteria released by the panel are deliberately general,
Caruso said. They are: vision and leadership; control and prevention
of crime; management; police reform; strategies for community
policing and programs; communications; personnel administration and
employee relations; and relations with the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Under each of these categories, the panel has listed a number of
questions.</TE>
<TE>   For example: "Has the chief developed an overall vision and image
of the [LAPD] that has enhanced its accountability, integrity and
professionalism?" and "Has the chief developed annual budgets over
the past five years that maximize ... resources?"</TE>
<TE>   Several of the issues, such as community policing and
communications with prosecutors, have been the focus of high-profile
debate during Parks' tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will ask, for example, "How has the chief
effectively utilized the senior lead officer program during his
tenure?" according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has alleged that Parks has not pushed to use senior lead
officers--specially designated outreach officers--as well as he might
since reinstating the program under community pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner David Cunningham said the panel used a consultant to
help develop its criteria. Methods employed to evaluate former Chief
Willie Williams, and the 1991 Christopher Commission report on police
reform, were also considered as guides, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the mayor's opposition to Parks "made our job more
difficult," but he stopped short of criticizing Hahn, saying the
mayor offered "a valued opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Asked later why Hahn would go public with his opposition to Parks
if he was not assured that a majority on the commission would support
him, Caruso answered: "That's a risk he's running. We may reappoint
the chief."</TE>

<HD>Doubt That All Roads Lead to El Toro? Listen In on D.A.
Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan recently came under heat because he's all conflicted
over abortion. Once upon a time, he deplored it as murder. Now that
he's running for governor and realizes that such a take riles up
untold thousands of voters, he's got a whole different view, which is
that people should make up their own minds.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County D.A. Tony Rackauckas has had a similar epiphany, as
he defends his turf against challenger Wally Wade, a deputy D.A. who
lost to Rackauckas in 1998 and is trying again to knock him off his
perch.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas has let it be known he'll vote for Measure W, the
anti-airport initiative on the March ballot that would scrap plans to
build an airport on the abandoned El Toro Marine base and replace it
with the so-called Great Park.</LD>
<TE>   As abortion is to many voters, so is El Toro to South County.</TE>
<TE>   For Rackauckas, the view from Saddleback Valley and environs now
makes an El Toro airport look like a lousy idea. The view was
different in March 2000 when he opposed Measure F, the county's last
anti-airport plebiscite. He says his opposition then centered on the
part of Measure F that would have limited future jail construction.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas had every right to oppose Measure F. And he has every
right to tell people now that his vote then had nothing to do with El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   And we have every right to scoff and assume he's cozying up to the
South County anti-airport folks.</TE>
<TE>   If you think it's ridiculous that voters should link El Toro to
the district attorney's race, you're today's grand prize winner.</TE>
<TE>   But that's life in South County.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're pro-airport, you're probably going to lose a lot of
votes down here," says one longtime South County officeholder. "It
doesn't make sense, but both sides are so polarized now that it's
almost like religion and it's senseless to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, who lives in Santa Ana, has never been identified with
anti-airport forces. When he told them on a Web site that he'd vote
for a Great Park, he said it shouldn't be construed as an endorsement
of Measure W, just a statement as to how he'd vote.</TE>
<TE>   Inquiring minds want to know what Wade says about all this. He's
claimed throughout the campaign that Rackauckas has politicized the
office. Predictably, the news release that came flying out of the
Wade campaign says Rackauckas' sudden embrace of a great park is but
the latest example.</TE>
<TE>   Wade hasn't taken a public position on Measure W and says he
won't. Becoming publicly linked with a position on bond issues or
major initiatives such as Measure W, Wade says, could lead to a
perception the D.A.'s office won't be objective if legal challenges
come later or if advice is sought.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, he notes the controversy surrounding the
county's spending for the pro-airport cause.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, who lives in San Juan Capistrano in the midst of
anti-airport sentiment, says he's been asked to speak out against the
airport but has declined.</TE>
<TE>   I ask if that might hurt him in South County. "It might," he says.
"In the last election, when Tony and I ran against each other, they
offered to put me on an anti-airport Web site as the anti-airport
candidate. I said I didn't think it was appropriate. Four years
hasn't changed the inappropriateness of it."</TE>
<TE>   Wade says the issue is what he calls Rackauckas' flip-flop. Wade
says it's "tempting" to come out for Measure W, but that he is
resisting it.</TE>
<TE>   I score this one for Wade and deduct points from Rackauckas for
his blatant pandering. But Wade is a bit more wily than he lets on.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he's from South County and carries the presumption
of being anti-airport. He's also got a pro-Measure W sign in his
frontyard.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't put it up, he says--friends did--and its presence
doesn't constitute a public position, inasmuch as someone would have
to know where he lives and drive by his house to see the sign.</TE>
<TE>   A little cagey, but on balance, he's right.</TE>
<TE>   You could always take it down, I say.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he says, he could. But for now, he doesn't plan to.</TE>

<HD>City Terrace Gets a 'Smart Crosswalk'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials unveiled a pedestrian-safety project
Thursday in City Terrace in an area notorious among local residents
for its fast traffic rushing in front of two elementary schools.</LD>
<LD>   The project on City Terrace Drive features a "smart
crosswalk"--the first in an unincorporated area of the county.
Officials hope to replicate it elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Smart crosswalks warn motorists of pedestrians in the intersection
with quick laser-like flashes of light coming from the pavement and
metal signs.</LD>
<TE>   Officials are working on plans to install the next one in an
unincorporated part of the county on Foothill Boulevard in La
Crescenta.</TE>
<TE>   The smart crosswalk at City Terrace Drive and Hicks Avenue is just
one component of the project meant to address long-held complaints
about pedestrian safety in that area.</TE>

<HD>Predatory Lending Woes Discussed</HD>
<DH>Consumers: Hearing is packed by homeowners citing high
hidden costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeowners packed a hearing room in South-Central Los Angeles
Thursday to complain about aggressive lending practices that leave
them struggling to pay their monthly mortgages.</LD>
<LD>   The speakers, many of them elderly and members of minority groups,
told a Los Angeles City Council committee that they were solicited by
lenders to refinance their debt, only to find themselves with
payments they could not afford because of exorbitant interest rates,
steep prepayment penalties or a dramatic loss of equity in their
homes.</LD>
<LD>   "If my loan had been covered by a city ordinance, I don't think
this would have happened," homeowner Lena Jones told the committee.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council's Housing and Community Development
Committee Thursday held the first of three public hearings to
determine whether a municipal law is needed to protect residents from
predatory lending practices.</TE>
<TE>   A state law that takes effect in July would curtail many predatory
lending practices. Those include originating mortgages when there is
no demonstrated ability by the borrower to repay; adding costly and
unnecessary insurance to a loan; repeatedly refinancing a second or
third mortgage to generate higher fees for the lenders with no
benefit for the homeowner; and steep prepayment penalties that lock
borrowers into the deals for years.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer activists argue that the state law does not go far
enough. The city ordinance, first proposed by City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas last summer, would require that counseling be made
available to recipients of all high-cost loans; the state law has no
such provision.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance would also curtail the amount of prepayment
penalties, whereas the state law limits only the duration of such
fines. It would also lower the definition of a "high-cost" loan to
encompass more sub-prime borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   The committee plans to hold two more public hearings on the matter
elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Cities including Oakland, Chicago and Atlanta have passed laws to
curtail predatory practices. But mortgage lenders have balked at the
patchwork of ordinances, arguing that they create unequal access to
credit, in some cases for homeowners who live across the street from
one another.</TE>

<HD>Regulator OKs Deal on Bonds for Buying Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- After months of delays and debate, the state's chief
utility regulator approved a key agreement Thursday that helps pave
the way for California's sale of bonds to repay billions of dollars
spent to purchase power during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The Public Utilities Commission reached an accord with the
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for
the customers of financially troubled utilities for the past year.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is designed to assure Wall Street that the water
resources agency will have a guaranteed revenue stream to repay up to
$11.1 billion in bonds the state plans to sell later this fiscal
year.</LD>
<TE>   The commission also approved the department's request that utility
customers pay $9 billion--or roughly half of the agency's projected
power costs through December.</TE>
<TE>   The allocation among the customers of Southern California Edison
and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is slightly lower than what they have been
paying since the record rate increases approved last year by the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the department's charges for power supplied to
Southern California Edison customers will decline from 10.28 cents
per kilowatt-hour to 9.74 cents. For PG&amp;E customers, who received
almost half of the state's power purchases, the price will drop from
9.47 cents to 9.29 cents. For San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the price
will fall from 9.02 cents to 7.29 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Commission officials say that no rate increase appears necessary
to meet the department's costs.</TE>
<TE>   The actions taken by the commission are key to California's hopes
for one of the biggest municipal bond sales in history. The state's
Wall Street advisors say these steps and others are necessary to
assure the state good interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   After legislation authorized the department to get into the
power-buying business, the state has borrowed $6.1 billion from the
general fund and $4.3 billion from private lenders, and it has
entered into $43 billion in long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The state treasurer and the governor have been urging the
commission to take action on the rate agreement for months. But the
commission voted 4 to 1 in October to reject the deal, largely
because it required the commission to rubber-stamp the department's
power costs and pass them on to ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure for an agreement has intensified as the state's financial
problems have deepened with the recession and economic impacts of
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Loretta Lynch, who has been negotiating with
the department, recently reached an agreement that she says contains
a number of improvements over the rejected one, including provisions
requiring the department to share more information on its costs with
the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement is better," she said, "in that it requires DWR to
try to renegotiate" controversial and costly long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, who has criticized the commission's past
inaction, issued a statement praising the agreement. "This is good
news for California, because rates will not rise."</TE>
<TE>   Department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said, "We're still not out of
the woods yet, but this is a big step in the direction of making the
general fund whole again."</TE>
<TE>   State Treasurer Phil Angelides said several steps must be taken
before the bonds can be sold, including addressing any legal
challenges by utilities, consumer groups or others.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups immediately criticized the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "The PUC told ratepayers, 'We quit,'" said Doug Heller, a consumer
advocate for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa
Monica. "In bowing to Gov. Davis, the PUC has shirked its
constitutional obligations to be the independent regulator of
consumer rights."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch scoffed at such criticisms, saying state law requires the
commission to cover the department's cost of buying power for
customers and that the panel retains authority to set and define the
rates to meet those costs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of embattled California Rep. Gary Condit filed a $10-million
lawsuit against the National Enquirer Thursday, alleging the tabloid
newspaper libeled her when it said that she had "attacked" missing
intern Chandra Levy.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit filed in U.S. District Court here, Carolyn Condit said
the National Enquirer's Aug. 7 story falsely insinuated that she had
played some role in Levy's disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   "Carolyn Condit, however, has never attacked, met nor spoken to
Chandra Levy, ever," her lawyers said in a statement.</LD>

<HD>Officials Move to Help Families Losing Homes in Mass
Eviction</HD>
<DH>Housing: Politicians scramble to buy time for tenants of
nearly 600 properties in Northern California that are being sold by
the owner, a Japanese investor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State officials and private business groups stepped up efforts
Thursday to help nearly 600 Northern California families being
uprooted from their rental homes by the Japanese billionaire who owns
the properties.</LD>
<LD>   The California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers announced that its
members will waive home sale fees and commissions to any of the
displaced tenants who seek to buy homes.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined the chorus of
politicians--including Gov. Gray Davis--asking the Japanese Embassy
to plead with owner Gensiro Kawamoto to give the tenants more time.</LD>
<TE>   About two weeks ago, property managers for Kawamoto delivered
eviction notices to tenants in 420 homes in the Sacramento region and
an additional 150 in Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants, some of whom have lived in the homes for years, were
given 30 days to move out.</TE>
<TE>   The threatened mass eviction caused a firestorm of protest and
fear, as residents of whole neighborhoods faced being uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for Kawamoto, who leads a reclusive lifestyle,
said the Japanese investor needed to unload the houses quickly to
finance investment opportunities that become available only every few
decades, but did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Other local landlords, facing a public relations nightmare as
tenants flood an already tight rental market, stepped up in the early
days of the crisis to offer reduced rents and deposits to ease
relocation. Real estate agents, meanwhile, swooped down on the
neighborhoods, offering mortgages with no down payment.</TE>
<TE>   The state mortgage brokers association weighed in with its offer
to waive commissions and closing costs. That could save $3,000 to
$5,000 for each of the hundreds of tenants whose "lives have been
turned upside down," said Michael McGee, president of the group,
which represents 2,000 brokers. "Those are not insignificant
dollars," said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks).
Cox's district includes many of the tenants affected in the
Sacramento-area communities of Citrus Heights, Orangevale, Antelope
and Rocklin.</TE>
<TE>   But the tenants will be pressed for time to take advantage of such
savings. Though some have the income and credit to purchase a
low-cost house, such deals usually take months to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what kind of ideal arrangements they get from lenders
they're not going to be able to swing it in 21/2 weeks," said David
Swanson, a spokesman for Assn. of Community Organizations for Reform
Now, a national grass-roots group.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be an interim solution. Mr. Kawamoto has to cut
these people a little slack."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Cox and several other lawmakers contacted the
Japanese ambassador, hoping that pressure could be put on Kawamoto to
give tenants more time.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Feinstein, said the senator
dispatched a letter to the ambassador Thursday asking for help.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's staff is also checking with federal housing and
mortgage lending authorities to see what assistance they can provide,
Gantman said.</TE>

<HD>Shooting Near School Leaves 2 Boys Wounded</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two boys were seriously wounded Thursday when five men in a black
pickup opened fire on a group standing across the street from a San
Fernando continuation school, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The boys had left Mission High School about 12:50 p.m. when the
men drove past in the 11000 block of O'Melveny Avenue, said Los
Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman Monica Carazo.</LD>
<LD>   "They were standing on the street corner across from the school
when the suspects in the pickup drove by and began firing," police
spokesman Jack Richter said.</LD>
<TE>   One student was hospitalized with a gunshot wound in his back, the
other with a wound in his stomach, Carazo said.</TE>
<TE>   Police were searching for the shooters late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Few students witnessed the incident, Carazo said.</TE>
<TE>   Mission High School serves about 60 students over age 16 with
academic, behavioral or disciplinary problems.</TE>
<TE>   A Francis Polytechnic High School freshman was shot in a
gang-related incident in mid-December while walking with friends a
few blocks from the Sun Valley campus.</TE>
<TE>   In another recent incident, gunfire erupted earlier this month
during an attempted robbery at Gardena High School, wounding two
students and prompting a daylong campus lockdown.</TE>

<HD>Stolen Gauge Is Truly 'Hot,' Officials Warn</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TIPTON BLISH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators warned Thursday that equipment stolen from a
construction site in Chino Hills contains a radioactive heavy metal.</LD>
<LD>   Thieves broke into a storage container at a construction site for
Standard Pacific Homes and took a generator and a device with a probe
containing a metal core that emits radioactive gamma rays.</LD>
<LD>   The probe uses the isotope cesium 137 to measure soil density to
determine, for example, whether it can support a road or a building.</LD>
<TE>   "We are trying to warn the public in case someone leaves this
thing by the side of the road, and a youngster picks it up and tries
to break it. They could be exposing themselves," said Sgt. T.A.
Peters of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The metal inside the device is highly radioactive, about 1,000
times more than materials typically used in college physics labs but
100 times less than what is used in medical applications, said Doug
Carter, technical support manager for CPN International, which made
the instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said that the cesium 137 is encased in stainless steel and
that there is no record of any of his company's devices rupturing or
of someone releasing the cesium, even accidentally.</TE>
<TE>   A person within about 4 inches of the cesium 137 in the device
would be subject to a radiation dose equivalent to about two dental
X-rays per hour, said Dan Peterson, professor of physics at Harvey
Mudd College. "Not an insignificant amount," Peterson said. The dose
lessens dramatically as the distance increases, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the probe contains radioactive material, operators are
required to undergo special training and its owners need a license
from the state. Stolen or lost equipment must be reported to state
officials.</TE>
<TE>   An official from GeoSoils, a Santa Ana company that owns the
equipment, said it would cost $6,000 to replace the instrument. The
probe was being used to study a hillside for grading.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen generator is worth about $2,000.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Push for Broader Role in Policy</HD>
<DH>Education: A union-backed bill would give instructors more
say on textbooks, curricula and programs. It's widely opposed by
school district officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's largest teachers union is seeking to expand the power of
public school faculties to help choose textbooks, set curricula and
run academic programs--a proposal that is sparking sharp criticism
from school district leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The California Teachers Assn. is behind new legislation that would
require local school districts and their teachers unions to negotiate
over the ways to improve student performance.</LD>
<LD>   School boards and district administrations now set policies on
everything from textbooks to course work, and are required by state
law only to consult teachers unions.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters say the proposed measure, introduced this week in the
state Assembly, is necessary to give teachers a greater voice in the
policies that affect their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is more qualified to make education decisions than veteran
teachers who deal with children every day," CTA President Wayne
Johnson said Thursday. "Right now we have decisions being made by
bureaucrats in central offices."</TE>
<TE>   But superintendents from Los Angeles to Sacramento condemn the
move as a power grab and vow to fight the measure, which they say
would undermine educational reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine a more disastrous step for California to take
than to pass this bill," said Los Angeles Unified School District
Supt. Roy Romer. "It's way out of bounds."</TE>
<TE>   Romer and other critics argue that teachers already are included
in decisions in key areas. They say that formally including such
discussion in labor negotiations--which take place behind closed
doors and are often adversarial--would shift focus away from student
achievement and cut the public out of important policy debates.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business for 36 years and it's the most
dangerous piece of legislation I've ever seen," said Jim Sweeney,
superintendent of the Sacramento City Unified School District. "It
could create pure havoc."</TE>
<TE>   The fight comes at an awkward moment for Democratic legislators
and Gov. Gray Davis, who count on CTA's support as they seek
reelection. Some political observers now question whether union
leaders are pressing their cause at a time when the governor is
politically vulnerable, a suggestion they deny.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis aide said the governor had not yet taken a position on the
legislation and would not predict its fate in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [CTA leaders] are doing what they are paid to do, which
is lobby for their cause. We understand that," said Russ Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   State law now gives teachers the right to negotiate with districts
over wages, hours and working conditions. The proposed legislation
would expand the menu of negotiated items.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides would have to agree on the "procedures" for selecting
new textbooks, developing academic programs to enhance student
performance, setting curricula and choosing teacher training, among
other things.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation does not spell out precisely what those procedures
would be.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the bill argue that it will motivate teachers to work
harder by giving them a say in the policies they are asked to
implement. The bill's primary author, Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles), lashed out at the opponents of the bill, which she
said would foster better cooperation between labor and management.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their reaction is absolutely knee-jerk," said Goldberg, a
former high school teacher and school board member in Los Angeles.
"It tells you that they don't have a lot of respect for the people
who are teaching in the schools they are running."</TE>
<TE>   Another of the bill's sponsors, Assemblywoman Virginia
Strom-Martin (D-Duncans Mills), said the measure would send a message
that school districts respect the opinions of teachers.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, would help districts recruit more young people as
teachers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are on the front lines," said Strom-Martin, who chairs
the Assembly Education Committee and is a former schoolteacher and
union leader.</TE>
<TE>   "They know best what works."</TE>

<HD>John Thaw, 60; Starred as Popular 'Inspector Morse'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>John Thaw, known to millions of TV viewers worldwide as the grumpy,
music-loving detective in ''Inspector Morse,'' died Thursday at his
home in London. He was 60 and had been battling throat cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Thaw was a respected stage actor and had been a leading television
actor for many years. But he was indelibly identified with
''Inspector Morse'' after creating a complex character whose flaws
appealed to fans as much as his better qualities did.</LD>
<LD>   The highly praised British series began in 1985 and lasted for 33
two-hour episodes that aired over 15 years. ''Inspector Morse'' had a
13-year run in the United States on PBS' ''Mystery'' series,
beginning in 1988, and was shown in many other countries.</LD>
<TE>   Thaw announced last June that he was undergoing treatment for
cancer of the throat, but said that he intended to get back to work.</TE>
<TE>   ''He loved work,'' said ''Morse'' creator Colin Dexter. ''He was a
perfectionist.... That's how I will remember him, I think, giving
100%.''</TE>
<TE>   David Liddiment of ITV, the network that broadcast ''Morse,'' said
after learning of the actor's death, ''Throughout his distinguished
career, John understood the power of the small screen. He was the
consummate television actor.''</TE>
<TE>   Thaw was born in Manchester, northern England, the son of a
long-distance truck driver. His mother left the family when he was 7.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving school, Thaw worked as a baker and a laborer until a
teacher who had seen him in school plays encouraged him to audition
for the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He won admission
at 17.</TE>
<TE>   His career began with a number of stage roles, followed by
television work--often as a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   His first big success came as a belligerent, foul-mouthed cop in
''The Sweeney,'' a popular police series that started in 1975 and
lasted three years.</TE>
<TE>   Thaw's marriage to actress Sheila Hancock in 1973 was his second
and her first. Between them, they had three daughters--Melanie Jane,
from Hancock's first marriage, Abigail from Thaw's first marriage,
and Joanne. All three survive.</TE>
<TE>   Thaw was honored in 1993 as a Commander of the Order of British
Empire and last year won a British Academy Television Awards
fellowship. He received the academy's best actor award in 1990 and
1993 for ''Inspector Morse.''</TE>
<TE>   Funeral plans were not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Elected Judges Are a Rare Breed Indeed</HD>

Judicial Council study.</DH>

<LD>When David M. Mintz wanted to become a judge, he didn't wait for the
governor to call him. And he didn't feel he had the political clout
for an appointment.</LD>
<LD>   So the veteran prosecutor ran for an open seat, beating out five
other candidates for the post.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Superior Court judge is among a small group
of lawyers who become state trial judges by running for open seats or
challenging incumbents.</LD>
<TE>   Fewer than 10% of all judgeships in California were filled in
contested elections in 1996, 1998 and 2000, according to a 2001
Judicial Council study. Fewer than half of those involved incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   It's what Robert M. Stern of the California Commission on Campaign
Financing calls "the myth of elected judges."</TE>
<TE>   On the March 5 ballot, just two of 142 Los Angeles County Superior
Court judges up for reelection face challenges. The others are
unopposed, so their names will not even be placed before voters.</TE>
<TE>   There are also five open seats, with 17 attorneys vying to fill
them.</TE>
<TE>   Most Judges Never Face Election Test</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, 11 candidates are vying to replace four retiring
judges. The name of Judge Ronald C. Kline, who is charged with child
molestation and possessing child pornography, also will be on the
ballot due to an unusual write-in campaign effort. Under state law,
write-in challengers who collect enough signatures can force an
otherwise unopposed judge's name to be placed on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Most state judges are appointed by the governor when judges retire
or die during their six-year terms. As a result, most never face an
election race.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's staff vets candidates, as does the state Bar Assn.
But other factors enter into the equation, including the political
philosophy and experience of the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. George Deukmejian, for example, appointed mostly
deputy district attorneys. During his tenure, some lawyers without
prosecutorial experience believed they were more likely to be elected
than appointed to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Harris decided in 1984 that the only way he would become a
judge in Los Angeles County was by election. He won an open seat and
began informally advising others on campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Races Take Back Seat</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult, uphill, arduous and frustrating path," Harris
warned.</TE>
<TE>   On election day, judicial races are traditionally overshadowed by
big-budget contests. Elections for judge appear dull to almost anyone
outside the legal community and receive scant media coverage, partly
because the candidates are ethically barred from discussing most
hot-button issues.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they focus on their often-similar career accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "The sole message [is] that you are the best-qualified candidate,"
Mintz said.</TE>
<TE>   That can frustrate voters who are being asked to make decisions
based on little more than resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't talk about cases," Harris said. "We can't promise what
we will do if we have a death-penalty or abortion-rights case."</TE>
<TE>   Engaging voters became more difficult and costly this year under
state trial court unification.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are municipal court districts, like those that existed in
Beverly Hills and Inglewood, where judicial candidates could walk
precincts to meet voters.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, for the first time, all judicial elections will be
countywide, a daunting prospect for Los Angeles County's 400-plus
judges.</TE>
<TE>   How do you communicate with 4.2 million voters? "It's next to
impossible," said Joe Cerrell, a campaign consultant who has
represented 300 judicial candidates since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Cerrell said he charges $25,000 to run a judicial campaign--some
of which cost more than $100,000 in total--and has watched over the
years as the number of races has dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   The winning strategy, however, has not changed much. Mintz hired a
consultant and raised thousands of dollars from lawyers and judges to
finance his successful 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz used the funds to pay for a statement in the official ballot
booklet and also got his name on as many slate mailers as he could
afford.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a ballot statement in the primary will cost an
estimated $26,000, election officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It's twice as much to have it printed in both English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Cerrell said he did not buy a ballot statement for a client in the
current Los Angeles County election, Judge Robert Simpson, because
opponent Kenneth E. Wright did not buy one.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will use the money instead to put Simpson's name on
more slate mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Ballot Designation Can Spell Trouble</TE>
<TE>   Another important campaign decision is how one's name appears on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Cerrell and others blame Judge Roberta Ralph's 1988 defeat on her
poor choice of a ballot designation. She listed herself as
"incumbent" on the ballot and lost.</TE>
<TE>   She should have used the word "judge," Cerrell said, noting that
it is a simpler and clear designation that has long offered a proven
advantage at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason so few judges face serious challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Most lawyers also do not want to risk alienating judges by
threatening the livelihood of one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, a single controversial call can lead to an
election loss for a sitting judge. Veteran jurists vividly recall the
1970 defeat of Judge Alfred Gitelson after he ordered the
desegregation of Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   But even a controversial judge can avoid a challenge by raising a
large campaign war chest.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Judge Lance Ito
was certain he would be challenged. So much so that he collected
pledges of $1 million for his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Ito also bought what judges call "an insurance policy." He
retained Cerrell to run his campaign even before he knew whether or
not he would need to organize one.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, no one ran against him.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Joyce A. Karlin, meanwhile, survived a tough challenge in
1992 after she drew the ire of the Los Angeles African American
community for sentencing a Korean grocer to probation in the shooting
death of a young black girl.</TE>
<TE>   Karlin, who later resigned from the bench, was unable during the
campaign to discuss the case because of ethical prohibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his campaign, Mintz said he was asked by voters for his
position on gun control, the death penalty and abortion.</TE>
<TE>   He said he tried to explain that he could not respond. To be fair
and impartial, judges must follow the law, regardless of their
personal beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   As a public service, the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. conducts
extensive investigations of judicial candidates and rates each of
them. The findings are posted online at www.lacba.org.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsements and Editorials are Keys</TE>
<TE>   Voters also rely heavily on the endorsements of elected officials,
organizations and newspaper editorial pages. A few attend community
forums to size up candidates for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a lot of evenings at banquet halls, at neighborhood
meetings," Mintz said.</TE>
<TE>   He also took an added step: He distributed campaign literature in
busy shopping malls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how effective that is in such a big race," Mintz
conceded two years later. "But I didn't want to leave anything to
chance."</TE>

<HD>Willie Thrower, 71; First Black Quarterback in NFL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willie Thrower, who broke pro football's color barrier as the NFL's
first black quarterback, has died. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Thrower died Wednesday of a heart attack at his home in New
Kensington, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   His NFL career was as brief as it was meaningful. He played one
season for the Chicago Bears and saw action in only one game, against
San Francisco on Oct. 8, 1953. He relieved George Blanda, completing
three of eight passes for 27 yards with an interception in a 35-28
loss.</LD>
<TE>   "It absolutely wasn't a story at the time," said Ed Sprinkle, a
receiver and defensive end for the Bears from 1944 through 1955.
"Nobody even thought about it. He was just one of the guys."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL had 12 teams and only 15 black players in 1953. Thrower
was the only black player on the Bear roster.</TE>
<TE>   He was also the first black quarterback to play in the Big Ten,
helping Michigan State to a national title in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   He went undrafted, though, and signed with Chicago for $8,500.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches didn't think a black quarterback had the knowledge or
the know-how to run a team," Thrower told the Associated Press last
year. "They felt a black quarterback didn't have the leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears invited Thrower back for the 1954 season, but they had
just given rookie quarterback Zeke Bratkowski a $75,000 signing
bonus--astronomical in those days--and that led Thrower to try his
luck in the Canadian Football League. He spent three seasons with the
Winnipeg Blue Bombers and played some semi-pro ball in Toronto before
a separated shoulder ended his career at 27.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from football, Thrower became a social worker in
New York and New Kensington. He eventually owned two taverns.</TE>
<TE>   Thrower's accomplishment is memorialized in an exhibit at the Pro
Football Hall of Fame, and he figured prominently in an ABC
television special about black quarterbacks. Until that point, he was
essentially anonymous--even in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people called me a liar," he said after the special
aired. "Now ... they say, 'Gee whiz! Here's a guy living in our
hometown. We didn't know he was the first black quarterback. Just
like they didn't know, the rest of the country didn't know."</TE>
<TE>   One of Thrower's favorite NFL memories didn't occur on the field,
but in a train compartment on a trip from Baltimore to Chicago when
he received some kind words from Blanda.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'You know what, Will? If I could throw a football as
good as you, I'd be playing for the next 35 years,'" Thrower told the
Chicago Tribune. Interestingly, the weaker-armed Blanda played 26
years in pro football and wound up in the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Former Denver Bronco Marlin Briscoe, who in 1968 became the first
black quarterback to earn a starting NFL job, has long viewed Thrower
as an inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, I would only see the Johnny Unitases, the
Bart Starrs, the Y.A. Tittles on TV," Briscoe said. "All of them were
white.... It wasn't until later that I found out what Willie Thrower
had done, that he had actually played in a game. It gave me hope."</TE>
<TE>   In the just-completed season, there were 23 black quarterbacks on
NFL rosters, seven of whom were starters. Thrower said he understood
the significance of his appearance in that 1953 game when it
happened, even if some of his teammates didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I was aware," he told the Chicago Tribune in 1988. "I knew there
had never been a black quarterback. I was proud of it, and I still am
today. It was a Jackie Robinson-type thing. It was pioneering. It was
a step forward."</TE>

<HD>Pedestrian-Friendly Town Centers Seen as Key to Valley's
Future</HD>
<DH>Community: Leaders outline ideas for the area's future,
secession or no, in 'Vision 2020' mission statement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Fernando Valley of 2020 should revolve around town centers
where residents can park easily and walk to restaurants, shopping,
schools and high-speed transit.</LD>
<LD>   Each town center should feature "distinctive architecture" and
public art, according to "Vision 2020," a mission statement released
Thursday by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Higher-density housing should be built near the centers and the
transit routes, preserving the character of single-family
neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   Vision 2020 came out of months of discussions with about 400
leading Valley residents, according to Saul Gomez, the nonprofit
organization's director of economic development. It is a wish list
that the group hopes will set priorities for the Valley's growth.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said a long-term vision is necessary whether or not the
Valley secedes from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan involves separate cities such as Burbank and Glendale,
so it has to be secession-free, without political boundaries," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The next step, he added, is to create committees to focus on
specific options.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll try to attain those objectives that are based on reality,"
Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd all like to see streets paved in gold.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're going to grab onto those ideas that are achievable and
make them real."</TE>

<HD>Cities Seek Restitution for Tainted Well Water</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Traces of a carcinogen are found. Newport and
Costa Mesa bill the district for replacement water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Local officials have put the Orange County Water District on notice
that they expect to be reimbursed for the cost of buying replacement
water after the agency inadvertently added a possible carcinogen to
wells that serve Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Testing last month found low levels of dioxane, an industrial
solvent, at nine wells that serve those cities, as well as Fountain
Valley, which did not bill the water agency. All the affected wells
were closed.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the district's board of directors approved in
concept building treatment facilities to cleanse the water of the
solvent. That will cost millions of dollars and take up to 22 months.</LD>
<TE>   But if the wells remain shut until the treatment facilities are
built, local officials will be forced to spend millions buying more
expensive water from Northern California and the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of those shutdowns, our city will likely incur
additional water purchasing costs of $3.9 million annually," wrote
Tod Ridgeway, mayor of Newport Beach, in a Feb. 14 letter to the
water agency.</TE>
<TE>   The bill from the city does not mention a specific amount but says
Newport Beach would hold the agency accountable for any increased
costs, which could take the form of cash payments, credit to the city
or other options.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new testing revealed dioxane at a Santa Ana well that
serves Irvine and parts of Tustin, Orange and Santa Ana Heights,
though that well is not in use. The county water district is among
the first in the state to test for dioxane, a new contaminant that
has no state or federal limits.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the contamination is highly treated sewage water
that the district injects into the ground to keep seawater from
intruding into the freshwater aquifer beneath northern and central
Orange County. While this has kept saltwater out, the sewage water
contained dioxane. The agency is now treating the sewage water it
injects with higher levels of peroxide to keep more dioxane from
being added to the groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   However, the district must eliminate the existing dioxane. The
district has tested 37 of its 230 wells, and found levels above 3
parts per billion in 10, including the most recent one in Santa Ana.
No agencies were required to shut wells but chose to do so to retain
public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   All four of Newport Beach's wells are closed, meaning the city is
relying entirely on imported water, which costs about 52% more than
groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   "Because this is something that [OCWD added] to the groundwater
basin, we believe we're entitled to ask for payment for our costs ...
rather than passing that on to consumers," said Dave Kiff, assistant
city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa Consolidated Water District, which serves Costa Mesa, closed
the three contaminated wells; it has six other wells. Diana Leach,
general manager of the district, wrote in a Feb. 15 letter that she
anticipates spending $397,600 for water this fiscal year, which ends
June 30, and $852,000 during the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Fountain Valley's seven wells also were closed, but the
city hasn't had to increase use of imported water, said Robert
Kellison, field services manager.</TE>
<TE>   Increased water usage during summer months would force the city to
buy more imported water--costs that Kellison said would be passed on
to the district if they occur.</TE>
<TE>   The county water district's board of directors is scheduled to
discuss the issue at its March 6 meeting. Little is known about the
long-term health effects of exposure to dioxane, but federal
environmental officials have classified it a probable human
carcinogen and the state recently deemed it a "contaminant of
concern."</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley officials will be meeting with state health
officials Wednesday to discuss the issue. The wells showed levels of
3 to 20 parts dioxane per billion; the state recommends closing the
wells at 300 parts per billion.</TE>

<LD>Why do white American women line up in large numbers to subject their
faces to knives and hypodermics filled with poison?</LD>
<LD>   Why are they willing to spend approximately $400 every few months,
risking drooped eyelids and frozen features, for a four-month
sabbatical from wrinkles?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is simple: power and anxiety.</LD>
<TE>   Aging women are among the least powerful segments of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   One must look long and hard to find women older than 50 leading
the way in business, academia, medicine, media or entertainment.
Thumb through a history book, literary anthology or film library and
elder female wisdom and image are hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the many achievements won by women in the United States
over the past 30 years, youthful beauty remains the ultimate form of
power for women.</TE>
<TE>   "Elder" and "beauty" rarely appear within the same sentence; when
youthful beauty fades, personal and professional options usually
narrow.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, American girls and women spend billions of dollars
each year to achieve, enhance and maintain the youthful standards of
beauty so clearly defined and marketed by our culture.</TE>
<TE>   And for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking just beyond those wrinkles are troubling social and
medical statistics that serve as a warning about being old and
female: Nearly 75% of the nation's elderly poor are women; advances
in research on female diseases such as osteoporosis and low bone mass
are relatively recent.</TE>
<TE>   Female disintegration from the inside out was long considered a
normal part of aging.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to maintain cultural standards of beauty begins very
young and lasts for a lifetime. The 8-year-old worried about being
fat travels through her teen years and into adulthood piercing,
purging, plucking, painting, perming and pumping iron.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she is in her 30s, 40s or 50s, the slice of a plastic
surgeon's knife or a needle pushing poison into her face seems
acceptable, a natural part of a lifetime of anxiety about personal
beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Where money is no object, these medical interventions become even
easier.</TE>
<TE>   So no one questions why Barbie might want Botox. Or why
television's Greta Van Susteren would go on the cover of People with
her new face lift.</TE>
<TE>   Appearance junkies are made, not born.</TE>
<TE>   Our economic system and the mass distribution of female images
work together to make the body the primary project in the lives of
too many American women and girls.</TE>
<TE>   When our culture ascribes power to women on the basis of their
wisdom, moral character, creativity and strength--and not just
appearance--8-year-olds will stop worrying about their thighs, and
the 50-year-old will no longer view plastic surgery or poison as a
rational or necessary personal choice.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Jacobs Brumberg is a historian at Cornell University and
author of "The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls"
(Vintage Books, 1998). Jacquelyn Jackson is executive producer of the
documentary "The Body Project" and is a women's health advocate in
Washington, D.C.</TE>

<HD>Let's Accent the Positives on Retaining the Valley in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE FEUER</AU>
<BD>Mike Feuer is an attorney in Los Angeles. He
represented Valley and Westside neighborhoods as a councilman for Los
Angeles' 5th District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The advocates of one Los Angeles have allowed the campaign for a
separate San Fernando Valley city to define the terms of debate. On
those rare occasions when one-city forces have fired back, it's
generally been in defensive, negative terms.</LD>
<LD>   But there are many positive reasons why Los Angeles voters--and
Valley voters in particular--should support staying together:</LD>
<LD>   * The Valley could gain political muscle anyway through
redistricting.</LD>
<TE>   The Valley comprises slightly more than one-third of the city's
population. But the commission recommending new City Council district
boundaries is poised to create five all-Valley seats on that
15-member body and probably two more districts with Valley
constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   That's just one seat away from a council majority and more than
enough to override a mayoral veto.</TE>
<TE>   * Local controls mandated by the new Los Angeles City Charter are
taking effect.</TE>
<TE>   For example, neighborhood councils are slowly emerging. Yes, their
input is only advisory for now. But if the work of these councils in
my former district is any indication, they hold great promise as
catalysts for quality of life improvements on neighborhood streets
and as watchdog organizations holding elected officials accountable.
Similarly, through area planning commissions, local panels made up of
residents from affected neighborhoods have begun making land-use
decisions at a local level.</TE>
<TE>   * Size is influence.</TE>
<TE>   As the nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles enjoys clout in
Washington and Sacramento. It's no secret that the impressive federal
and state responses to disasters like the 1992 civil unrest and the
1994 Northridge earthquake were directly tied to Los Angeles' size
and the influence it wields. Mayor James Hahn's successes in
Washington and Sacramento demonstrate that this axiom still holds.</TE>
<TE>   * When it comes to vital services, owning provides more control
than renting.</TE>
<TE>   Valley residents have a major impact on city policy, accounting
for one-third of the commissioners governing decision-making in key
city departments. Secession blueprints, though, typically envision
Valley residents renting key services, such as fire and police, from
the existing city.</TE>
<TE>   As customers rather than owners, Valley residents would lose their
say in how these agencies, including the police and fire departments,
are run.</TE>
<TE>   * Nothing inherent in secession puts more police on the street or
trims more trees.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, secession plans contemplate essentially the same public
staff doing these jobs as now, with few if any additional resources
and arguably less Valley-based control.</TE>
<TE>   * Smaller is neither small nor necessarily better.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists like to compare the Valley to Burbank and argue that
smaller cities are more accessible and efficient. But the Valley
would become the nation's sixth-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, truly small may be better for some purposes but not for
others: Los Angeles residents not only benefit from size when seeking
federal or state aid but also, for example, from economies of scale
in some kinds of services and programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Our sources of water and energy are dependable.</TE>
<TE>   California's recent energy crisis and the constant struggles over
water supply remind us of the stability Los Angeles enjoys as one
city--and of the uncertainties in splitting apart.</TE>
<TE>   * Civic pride matters.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. residents have a lot to be proud of and for all our
self-criticism, we know it. Our resilience, our place as a worldwide
testing ground for how diverse peoples can come together and the
civic patriotism and common connections we express when the chips are
down--as during the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake--all
display the raw material from which we can build a great city.</TE>

<LD>Amazing. The Times recommends sitting jurists or prosecutors
waiting to be jurists for election in the upcoming March primary
(editorial, Feb. 20). No wonder our justice system is so skewed toward
prosecution. A defendant has to face two prosecutors-the district
attorney and the district attorney in robes (the judge).  A law should be
passed to prevent district attorneys from ascending to the bench. If
passed, that law could prevent the overabundance of malicious and
entirely unwarranted prosecutions conducted by the L.A. County district
attorney and his cronies, the prosecutor (judge) in robes.</LD>

<LD>Re 'Killer Dogs' Owners Ignored Danger Warnings, Jury Told,' Feb.
20: What's surprising to me is not that Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel
had almost 30 prior warnings and incidents with regard to their dogs; the
surprising thing is that after the first two or three warnings they were
allowed to continue staying in that apartment building. The apartment
owner and manager should be put on trial too. When is Sacramento going to
get it? Certain breeds of dangerous dogs need to be outlawed in
California. A good first step in the meantime might be to require owners
of these breeds to carry $5 million worth of liability insurance per dog.</LD>

<TE>   I knew that Knoller and Noel had been indicted for involuntary
manslaughter in the death of Diane Whipple, but until reading your
article I had no idea they'd also been hit with the charge of keeping a
'mischievous' dog. Who comes up with these things? A mischievous dog, I
suspect all sane people would agree, was one who gnawed on your socks,
not on your neighbors.    Burt Prelutsky</TE>

<HD>'Corporations Became Playpens for Hogs'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Friedman has an excellent review of the broadband bubble
(Opinion, Feb. 17). However, the story is much bigger than that. On Feb.
10 (Business), James Flanigan quoted Peter Drucker: 'J.P. Morgan, no
enemy of wealth, once said that a reasonable ratio of management pay to
that of the average worker would be 20 to 1. But in U.S. business today
it is 500 to 1.'  This story is Wall Street, the accounting industry and
corporate America gone crazy. There is a consistency to this bubble.
Standards were changed (always lowered). Public corporations became
playpens for hogs, if you will. Stock options were provided to the
corporate leaders. These option costs were not even calculated correctly
as an expense on a balance sheet. Perfectly legal. If the executives
could boost the stock, either with hype or swift accounting tricks (even
if legal), Wall Street would help. Boost the stock, exercise the options,
pay the taxes and run. Of course, California and federal tax receipts
also ballooned to bubble proportions. These windfall tax receipts will
not be repeated.  The '90s will go down in history as 'hot air.'
Drucker's figure of 500-1 says it all. Our capitalistic system is in
great need of reform. Enron is only the tip of the iceberg. Global
warming is real on Wall Street. There is more meltdown to come. Hot air
does that.</LD>

<TE>   We've had presidents and Congresses, both Republican and Democrat,
representing our best interests over the years. We have a hard-working
free press to keep an eye on the whole thing while we enjoy our freedoms
and remain productive. With all this top-notch representation and
oversight, the following is somehow OK: Companies issue stock options to
employees. They deduct the expense of issuing these stock options and
avoid paying taxes (sometimes paying nothing). At the same time they
don't show this expense on their income statements, thus artificially
inflating the value of their company and their stock.  It's stunning that
this level of institutional scheming has gone on for so long. How much
more organized misrepresentation and fraud is there? Do we live in a
house of cards?</TE>

<HD>Scheer's Hatred for the Bush Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re 'Making Money, the Bush Way,' Commentary, Feb. 19: The hatred
Robert Scheer has for the Bush family must keep him awake at night. His
latest column attacks Bush Sr. and yet does not lay a glove on him.
Scheer starts by noting that he took $80,000 in Global Crossing stock for
a Tokyo speech in 1998 that grew to a value of $14million. Now that
Global has gone belly up he suggests that maybe Congress should
investigate to see if Bush sold any of the stock before it went south.
Not that he did, but just to see if he did. Not an accusation, just a
thought.  Now warmed up, he notes that Bush is a highly paid consultant
to the Carlyle Group and that they are so well connected internationally
they invested funds for the Bin Laden family. He assures us that the son,
the bad-seed son, was not involved and then he goes on to tell us who
that bad seed is as if we didn't know. But in telling us this he links
Bush to the black sheep.     Last year, Scheer goes on to say, the elder
Bush was welcomed along with his Carlyle Group when they went to Saudi
Arabia to sign a new oil contract. This, according to Scheer's convoluted
thinking, was payback for saving the sheiks' bacon in the Persian Gulf
War. That is the war that was over eight years ago. Another cheap shot.
The venom that drips from Scheer's pen has become old hat. My advice to
him is to let it go. Relax.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer is a fine, often provocative columnist. But he goes too far in
writing that 'Bush the senior had saved the sheiks' bacon and now they
give him a slice.' Scheer should know that the word 'bacon' is almost
blasphemous in Islamic cultures, which forbid the eating of pork. No
sheik would be caught giving anyone a slice of bacon-really or
metaphorically.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every week I read a new poll that shows 85% of the American people
support President Bush and the way he is handling the war and the
country. The reports say that the American people are pleased with the
direction that our country is headed. Then I read your letters to the
editor and I realize that these numbers have to be false (Feb. 20).
Apparently the pollsters have their numbers reversed. It seems from the
letters that are printed that only one out of every 90 people support the
president and the war on terror. Keep up the good work in presenting the
thoughts of the community (and in case you didn't get it, that last part
was called sarcasm).</TE>

<LD>I say to each of the gubernatorial candidates (Richard Riordan,
Bill Jones, Bill Simon and Gov. Gray Davis) that if you are so
dissatisfied with public education, become a teacher yourself. Perhaps
you should obtain a teaching credential and gain some valuable firsthand
experience.  If any one of these men walked onto a campus as a new
teacher, armed with an emergency permit, do you seriously think that the
faculty would listen with bated breath to his ideas? Yet we are so eager
to hear these suggestions when they come from political candidates.  If
education is your No. 1 priority, as you purport, then please join our
staffs! But I suppose it's just more convenient and more politically
rewarding to 'reform' schools with a hearty dose of criticism. And
gentlemen, let me tell you, it's going to take longer than three years to
see improvement.</LD>

<HD>Weren't Scientists Once Teenagers?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Teenagers have always been described as impulsive, irresponsible,
immature and difficult ('The Latest Assault on Teens: It's Their Brains,'
Opinion, Feb. 17). Yet one shouldn't be too quick in generalizing about
teenagers. As an 18-year-old freshman college student, I feel that
teenagers can sometimes show more responsibility and maturity than many
adults. It's difficult being a full-time student and juggling a part-time
job while also confronting day-to-day responsibilities at home, but this
only demonstrates the enormous amount of discipline and maturity that
many teenagers have.  Instead of wasting valuable time attacking
teenagers, scientists should spend more time investigating more important
issues and just allow teenagers to live their lives; after all, everyone,
including teenagers and adults, grows with experience.</LD>

<LD>Reading 'The Bilingual Schooling Battle Flares Anew' (Feb. 20),
about the confusion over implementing Proposition 227, was like reading
the proposition for the first time four years ago. The voters thought
they knew what they wanted; unfortunately, they did not realize the
repercussions of passing Proposition 227.  Why not teach all our children
a second language? Everywhere else in the world children are taught one,
two and sometimes three other languages. All of our classrooms should be
bilingual in some way. Yes, every child in California and the U.S. needs
to learn to read, write and speak English. No one denies this.    It is
time for us to put away our discrimination against anything that is not
deemed 'American' and truly embrace the real America. We are a country
that has melded many cultures into its own and also added a unique
spirit. Let's get back to educating our children and include other
languages, starting in kindergarten.</LD>

<TE>   I am an American Hispanic. I raised three children speaking only
English at home. All three of them were always academically ahead of
their classmates. They all have university degrees and make a good
living. I have a daughter who is a professional writer. I am convinced
that there is a Hispanic element that does not want Hispanic children to
get ahead in school. Keep Hispanics ignorant and they will make good
followers and be easy to control politically-that's the idea.  If
Hispanic children are going to grow up in the United States and make a
living here, they should be immersed in English as soon as they enter
school. Bilingual education will slow down the learning process both
academically and with the English language. A child born here or raised
here should not sound like a foreigner.</TE>

<LD>Re 'Ken Lay: A Prisoner of His Own Success,' Commentary, Feb. 18:
Steven Berglas' analysis of Ken Lay's motivations is as flawed as his
misuse of Freud's famous cigar comment to justify it. If poor Lay was
merely a victim of his own rose-colored glasses, why is it that he sold
$100 million worth of his own Enron stock in 2001, including $16.3
million worth after Sherron Watkins' warnings and before announcing to
his employees that the company was in great shape? Mr. Berglas, sometimes
a cigar is indeed just a cigar.</LD>
<LD>   Alitta Kullman</LD>
<LD>   Laguna Hills</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In saying that Lay 'elect[ed] to stay the course' far longer than he
should have and that this was a normal 'escalation of commitment' on the
part of an executive, Berglas fails to see that this is like saying that
the captain of the Titanic stayed his course even when confronting the
iceberg. Lay, seeing the 'iceberg' of collapse, prepared his own lifeboat
by selling his stock while telling his 'crew' to stay the course.</TE>
<TE>   Don Shulman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The question isn't whether there are more Enrons out there. The true
question now is, how can we trust the way businesses are run anymore? Big
businesses aren't run by people who care about employees. Rich execs line
their pockets with cash but don't do a damn thing to better the company
or its staff. Execs have no problem firing employees while also
collecting large bonuses or severance packages. Businesses that want my
investment dollar are going to have to do a much better job running their
companies.</TE>

<LD>Working Wardrobes, the nonprofit agency that helps battered and

quarters in Garden Grove.  The new temporary site is an
11,000-square-foot warehouse in Rancho Santa Margarita provided by Cox
Communications. 'It's a very generous offer,' Jerri Rosen, the agency's
founder and executive director, said of the donated space. The agency
will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturdays at the warehouse behind
Cox's facility at 22947 Avenida de las Banderas.  Working Wardrobes will
continue to seek permanent quarters, Rosen said.</LD>

<LD>A 3-year-old playing with a barbecue lighter started a fire that
gutted his family's home Thursday, officials said. The boy and his mother
were not injured in the blaze, but it destroyed the home in the 29000
block of Preston Drive, said Capt. Steve Miller of the Orange County Fire
Authority. The fire started about 8:30 a.m. when the child ignited items
under a bed, Miller said. The boy's mother tried to put out the blaze,
but the home's fire extinguisher was not working, Miller said. Though
firefighters controlled the blaze within 20 minutes, flames caused an
estimated $200,000 in damage, investigators said.</LD>

<HD>'Reality' TV Eagerly Marches Off to War</HD>
<DH>Media: Shows are getting precious access to battle fronts.
Producers reject warnings that they'll be tools of the Pentagon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Call it "When Reality TV Goes Patriotic."</LD>
<LD>   Desperate to attract viewers to what is fast becoming a struggling
genre, networks and producers of so-called reality television have seized
on a new concept: heartwarming stories from the front lines of the war on
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But the Pentagon's decision to allow coveted war access to
entertainment producers in order to promote its war effort is raising
eyebrows among observers who worry the shows will be propaganda. On one
project, the Pentagon is actively involved with developing story lines.
There are also concerns from news organizations that have been frustrated
for months over strict limitations the Pentagon has placed on reporters'
coverage of operations in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The cable music channel VH1 said Thursday it has teamed with producer
R.J. Cutler, whose credits include the political documentary "The War
Room," for a series of video diaries from military personnel. The
"Military Diaries Project"--its tentative title--will put digital cameras
in the hands of 60 soldiers to "tell the story of what it's like to be a
young man or woman in the armed forces right now," Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the horizon is "Profiles From the Front Line," an ABC series
from Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of feature action films such as "Pearl
Harbor," and Bertram van Munster, whose TV credits include the reality
series "Cops." While those two series won't be on the air before summer,
CBS will debut "American Fighter Pilots" on March 29. Produced by Tony
Scott ("Top Gun"), it was in the works well before the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks but is being updated to reflect the new reality.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has pre-screening rights over the ABC and VH1 material
for national security reasons, as does the Air Force over CBS' show. But
CBS and Cutler both said their series retain editorial control. The
Pentagon is "not at all interested in editing the stories we're telling,"
Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find people who are articulate, good at what they do,
have a sense of humor and want to work with us to tell a story."</TE>
<TE>   Van Munster also rejected the possibility that his ABC series would in
some way be propaganda. "I think they're pretty realistic at the
Pentagon. This is not aimed at propaganda. We're trying to do something
balanced, tell real stories about Americans and the allies who are out
there while we're sitting at home."</TE>
<TE>   One producer of "reality," or unscripted, television has concerns,
however, over just how much reality will be portrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our fighting men and women have a difficult enough job to do
without being asked to perform on camera--as everyone who makes a reality
show knows, there is always some performance involved," said Erik Nelson,
whose credits include the History Channel's "Nazi America: A Secret
History." "And with the obligatory Pentagon public information officers
looking over everybody's shoulder, that reality could become even more
unreal."</TE>
<TE>   The new programs come at a time when ratings for reality series have
sharply declined, with only CBS' "Survivor" continuing to draw strong
prime-time audiences. Network programmers have continued to experiment
with new variations on the theme, including NBC's "Fear Factor," which
has ordinary people tackling death-defying or merely disgusting stunts;
and ABC and Fox's competing quiz shows, "The Chair" and "The Chamber,"
respectively, which subject contestants to physical and mental
challenges, including extreme heat and cold.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson called such shows "the equivalent of flu viruses. Every year
there is a different strain. Only this time, the reality is much more
serious--and gravely consequential." He said he is concerned "that this
unreality could ultimately give people a simplistic impression about how
easily this war can be won. War is always horrifically surprising, and
surprising is the one thing that prime-time entertainment seldom is."</TE>
<TE>   News producers have other worries. ABC News lodged a complaint with
the network's entertainment executives over the "Profiles" series,
according to an executive there. (ABC News declined to comment.) Other TV
news executives said they were taking a wait-and-see attitude. "If
they're getting access we're not getting, then there is something wrong,"
said one senior news executive at another network.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pentagon, "the whole issue really boils down to one size does
not fit all," said Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, the spokesman for Central
Command, which directs the military effort in Afghanistan. "There are a
variety of ways of providing information to the American people. This is
a great way."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement with the Hollywood producers comes after five months of
acrimony between the Pentagon and news organizations over the strictest
rules the military has ever imposed on news coverage.</TE>
<TE>   For months after the U.S. bombing began on Oct. 7, reporters were
allowed no access at all to U.S. troops operating inside Afghanistan, and
they were barred from traveling to neighboring countries where the
Pentagon was setting up air bases. As various units headed for the
region, the Pentagon refused to confirm the deployments.</TE>
<TE>   When reporters were allowed to accompany troops inside Afghanistan for
the first time, they were for days not permitted to quote soldiers by
their full names, and at one point several reporters were locked inside a
metal shed for an afternoon to prevent them from covering something.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has begun to waive some of the most stringent
restrictions and since January has permitted several news organizations
to accompany special operations forces on a mission in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Saltzman, associate dean of the USC Annenberg School for
Communication, called the programs "a perfect vehicle for the
government," giving the Pentagon "a certain amount of control" over shows
that will "likely emphasize patriotism and good soldiering." As long as
they are labeled clearly as not being news, "I don't have a problem with
them."</TE>
<TE>   As for the frustration of news organizations, he said, "I don't think
anybody is going to be fooled by this." Some viewers will find the
material interesting, and "citizens who feel they're not getting the
complete picture will be just as frustrated, whether these shows go on
the air or not."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says Mammograms Help, and That's Final</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Seeking to put to rest a growing controversy, a federal health task
force declared Thursday that mammograms remain an effective
cancer-detection tool and for the first time recommended the procedure
every year or two for women in their 40s.</LD>
<LD>   "Our bottom line is that mammography reduces deaths from breast
cancer," Janet Allan, vice chairwoman of the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force, said at a news conference. The task force--an independent
panel of medical experts--advises the Department of Health and Human
Services on the effectiveness of clinical procedures.</LD>
<LD>   HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson called the results a "powerful
message" to American women, who were administered about 30 million
mammograms last year.</LD>
<TE>   The report follows the publication of European studies concluding that
there was no clinical proof the sometimes-painful exams have any benefit
in preventing cancer deaths. Each year about 190,000 women in the United
States are diagnosed with breast cancer; more than 40,000 die.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts raised by researchers in Denmark, since echoed by some advisors
to the National Cancer Institute, have led to widespread confusion about
the procedure--confusion that U.S. health officials say is unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's recommendation marks the second time in a month that women
have been urged to continue getting the X-rays of the breasts. A study
published Feb. 2 in the Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, reinforced
the value of the screening.</TE>
<TE>   The task force has twice before spoken out on the value of
mammography, which involves flattening the breast as much as possible
between two metal plates and taking X-rays from two angles.</TE>
<TE>   Its two earlier statements, issued in 1989 and 1996, urged women older
than 50 to get regular mammograms, and the new results concluded that
women ages 50 to 69 remain the most likely to benefit from regular
screening.</TE>
<TE>   But because, as Allan said, "the evidence supports the results of
reduced mortality," the task force expanded its recommendation to include
women 40 to 49, a group already urged by major medical associations to
seek regular mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   The task force, which looked at the same clinical studies reviewed by
the Danes, determined there is "fair evidence" that regular mammograms
can reduce by 20% the chances of dying from breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Allan said the task force disagreed with the Danish researchers'
conclusion that there were fatal flaws in the clinical studies--largely
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s--backing mammograms. The panel
acknowledged that the studies did have problems but said any such flaws
did not erase the conclusions drawn about the benefits of mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   Because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue, which is more
difficult for radiologists to interpret, researchers have found that they
are more likely to have false-positive results from mammograms, leading
to possibly unnecessary biopsies or surgery.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the task force said women 40 to 49 should consult
with their physician to determine when to begin and how regularly to get
mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   Cancer specialists widely acknowledge that mammograms are imperfect,
but most major research groups and advocacy organizations argue that they
remain the best option for catching cancer in its early, most treatable
stages.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, have questioned the value of the screening.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Donald Berry of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston said
he was not sure how the panel reached its conclusions, but he remained
unconvinced that clinical data support a widespread recommendation for
women 40 and older to get mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many women writing to me who say, 'Mammography saved
my life,' and I'm not going to write back to them and say, 'That isn't
clear.' But it really isn't clear," Berry said, likening the belief in
mammograms to a religion.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dr. Larry Norton, president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncologists, said that without diagnostic tools to determine
with certainty which cancers will spread, early detection and treatment
remain the best weapons against the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a law enforcement official and I see someone standing in front
of a bank wearing a mask and carrying a gun and a money sack, should I
wait to intervene until I see the guy break in?" Norton asked.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, whose wife, Sue Anne, survived breast cancer that was
detected in a routine mammogram, said that he felt weighing in on the
matter was "the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Asked at Thursday's news conference if his announcement is the "final
word," Thompson replied: "Yes, it is."</TE>
<TE>   "Women are confused as to whether they should have their mammograms
done or not," he said. "I wanted to make sure those women will go in and
receive their mammograms."</TE>

<HD>Hughes Makes the Leap From Fourth to Golden</HD>
<DH>Skating: Kwan falls, wins bronze. Russians threaten to pull out of
Games over judging, drug testing.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Returning the spotlight to the drama of individual triumphs that
are the foundation of the Olympics, Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y.,
staged a stunning comeback Thursday to win the marquee event of the
Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes performed a technically demanding yet lyrical 4-minute routine
at the Salt Lake Ice Center to win the women's figure skating gold medal,
providing these Games with a much-needed break from controversy.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, 16, had to wait until favorites Michelle Kwan and Irina
Slutskaya skated before she knew her fate. When the scoreboard flashed
that Slutskaya had finished second, Kwan a shocking third and Sasha Cohen
of Laguna Niguel fourth, Hughes gasped in disbelief, fell to her knees,
then embraced Robin Wagner, her coach and choreographer.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something I've always dreamed of," Hughes said. "Just to be able
to skate tonight. I didn't want to skate for a gold medal. I went out and
had a great time.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'This is the Olympics. I want to do the best.' "</TE>
<TE>   So she did, turning in one of the biggest upsets in Olympic figure
skating history.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, 21, was the leader before Thursday's long program but fell on a
triple flip and didn't do a triple-triple combination. Instead she did a
triple toe-double toe loop.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes did two triple-triples.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya did a triple salchow-double toe loop-double salchow. Cohen,
third entering the finale, fell on her triple lutz-triple toe loop
combination.</TE>
<TE>   The gold and bronze finish in skating gave the United States 30
medals, 10 more than the team's stated goal, with three days to go in the
Games. Earlier in the day, Bode Miller won his second silver medal, this
one in the men's giant slalom. Silver also went to the U.S. women's
hockey team, which lost, 3-2, to Canada in the gold medal game.</TE>
<TE>   Before these Games, the best U.S. performance in a Winter Olympics was
the 13 medals it won at Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994, and again at
Nagano, Japan, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But while Americans may remember the Games for the medals won,
International Olympic Committee members may recall them for the
controversy they stirred.</TE>
<TE>   New turmoil erupted Thursday when Russian Olympic officials, using
rhetoric some observers compared to that of politicians from the Cold War
era, said in an afternoon news conference that they would pull their team
out of the Games if Olympic officials don't investigate "unfair" judging
and officiating, and a failed drug test by a highly decorated Russian
cross-country skier.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's complaints center on several decisions at these Games,
including the awarding of duplicate gold medals to figure skaters Jamie
Sale and David Pelletier of Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian duo finished second in the pairs competition, behind
Russians Anton Sikharulidze and Elena Berezhnaya, but were given golds of
their own after a public outcry and protests by Canadian officials about
the judging.</TE>
<TE>   Russia also complained about the refereeing in Wednesday's men's
hockey game against the Czech Republic, a game they won, 1-0, despite 22
minutes of penalties.</TE>
<TE>   But the incident that appeared to have triggered Russia's threats was
a failed drug test by cross-country skier Larissa Lazutina, a nine-time
Olympic medalist.</TE>
<TE>   Lazutina's hemoglobin count was just above the legal limit in testing,
and her bid for a record-tying 10th medal ended with her
disqualification, knocking Russia--the four-time Olympic champion--out of
Thursday's relay event.</TE>
<TE>   Tyagachev said Lazutina was not guilty of doping.</TE>
<TE>   Results are expected today on a urine test that will determine whether
her case will be considered a drug positive.</TE>
<TE>   In another dispute, South Korea, still smarting from an referee's
decision that took away a gold medal the night before, lodged a protest
and threatened a boycott on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The South Koreans protested to the International Skating Union that an
Australian referee erred in awarding the victory in Wednesday's
1,500-meter short track speedskating race to American Apolo Anton Ohno
instead of their own Kim Dong Sung.</TE>
<TE>   The official gave the gold to Ohno, ruling that Kim illegally blocked
Ohno with about a half-lap to go.</TE>
<TE>   If the ISU fails to overturn the decision, South Korean officials
said, they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and possibly
sue the referee.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials also said they were considering pulling their
athletes out of other events.</TE>
<TE>   Some 16,000 anti-Ohno e-mails, mostly from South Korea, crashed the
USOC's Internet server early Thursday, spokesman Mike Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   With that tumult as a backdrop, the pressure shifted to the ice
Thursday night for the most anticipated event of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, who was in fourth place after the short program, certainly
didn't disappoint, turning in a near flawless performance that forced the
three skaters who followed her to be at the top of their games.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, third after the short program, fell early in her routine.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, winner of the short program, fell once and turned a triple into
a double.</TE>
<TE>   She seemed resigned afterward, saying, "I made a few mistakes, but I'm
just going to keep on going strong. It just wasn't meant to be."</TE>

<HD>Enron a Rerun of History</HD>
<DH>Financial fiascoes and 'creative accounting' are nothing new to
American investors. Booms often can set the stage for scandals.</DH>

<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay invoked the 5th Amendment
against self-incrimination last week, he seemed to put the finishing
touch on the energy trader's transformation into the biggest, baddest
corporate scandal ever to befall the nation.</LD>
<LD>   But America has a rich history of financial fiascoes that foreshadowed
Enron's, and could even have provided the firm its playbook. Most
involved extravagant claims of never-before-seen strategies. Many
required "creative accounting" to turn losses into gains. Some featured
generous campaign contributions. Virtually all came after long stock
market run-ups.</LD>
<LD>   More is at stake today: Three times as many Americans have money in
stocks now as did during the last truly big bust in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. But don't count on legions of bruised shareholders to push
through reforms that will put a stop to financial debacles. In the end,
policymakers, economists and historians suggest, debacles may be the
largely unavoidable price of America's anxious love affair with its
wide-open financial markets and their booms and busts.</LD>
<TE>   "Booms bring out situations that breed financial scandal," said former
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. "A culture
of what-can-we-get-away-with takes hold."</TE>
<TE>   When that happens, Levitt said, regulators come to be viewed as
"professional naysayers and doomsday predictors, and they lose
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "That's unfortunate," he said. But, he added, "there is not much you
can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   In its heyday, Enron went to considerable lengths to portray itself as
something unfathomably new and, at least implicitly, deserving of special
treatment. But its techniques came straight from the history books.</TE>
<TE>   To help clear away what the company viewed as outmoded regulations
that blocked progress, executives flooded politicians with campaign
contributions, almost $2.5 million in 2000--most to now-President
Bush--and almost $6 million since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   To drive home the notion of the company's uniqueness, executives
adopted the latest business lingo, a nearly impenetrable "new
economy-speak."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey K. Skilling, the Harvard Business School graduate and one-time
consultant who became the company's chief executive, regularly described
Enron as an "asset- light" market maker and risk manager able to trade
anything from energy to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, he glanced over the company's distinctly heavy investment
in such things as an Indian power plant, an English water business and a
Brazilian electricity distributor. For those who sought to square the
mismatch, he reserved a special kind of generational scorn.</TE>
<TE>   His views were summed up in an explanation he offered for hiring the
unusually young Andrew S. Fastow as chief financial officer: "We didn't
want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no
longer."</TE>
<TE>   On such talk, Enron eventually ballooned from a mid-size regional
company into one of the largest corporations in America.</TE>
<TE>   So did the highfliers of a previous era: the conglomerates of the
1960s. Both the men and the methods behind Textron, ITT,
Ling-Temco-Vought and other hot stocks of the "Go-Go Years" bear a
remarkable similarity to Enron's.</TE>
<TE>   In each instance, the players claimed they had hit on something
entirely new. In the conglomerates' case, it was the then-unheard-of idea
of plastering totally unrelated businesses together.</TE>
<TE>   In each, executives offered elaborate rationales for what they were
doing. The conglomerators talked about "synergy" and
claimed--wrongly--that their companies were more stable than conventional
ones.</TE>
<TE>   The results ranged from disappointing to disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Royal Little took a placid New England thread-spinning company
called Textron and turned it into a corporate behemoth by snapping up
producers of zippers, pens, snowmobiles, eyeglass frames, silverware,
golf carts, metalwork machinery, helicopters, rocket engines, ball
bearings and gas meters.</TE>
<TE>   The company survived, but only after spending the last two decades
selling off most of what Little had bought. Investors who purchased their
shares at the height of the conglomerate craze took a bath.</TE>
<TE>   Harold S. Geneen at ITT carried the conglomerate approach so far that
by 1972 Time magazine was noting that a consumer seeking to avoid the
company "could not rent an Avis car, buy a Levitt house, sleep in a
Sheraton hotel, . . . use Scotts fertilizer or seed, eat Wonder bread or
Morton's frozen foods."</TE>
<TE>   Like Enron, ITT was a big campaign contributor. But Geneen's idea of
how to use political influence made Lay and associates look like choir
boys. In 1970, the company offered Republicans $1 million and consulted
heavily with the Nixon White House and the CIA when Chile's new socialist
president, Salvador Allende, threatened to seize the ITT-owned Chilean
Telephone Co. Allende was overthrown with U.S. aid.</TE>
<TE>   ITT started selling off parts of itself in the mid-1980s and split in
three in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma electrician Jimmy Ling discovered the wonders of stock by
selling shares in his contracting business from a booth at the Texas
State Fair in the mid-1950s, and in just more than a decade turned
Ling-Temco-Vought into the 14th-largest industrial company in the nation
with 120,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Like Skilling, Ling insisted that only young, fresh minds could
appreciate his strategy. When a leading Wall Street analyst questioned
his methods, Ling demanded the man appear before him and, discovering he
was middle-aged, dismissed him with a contemptuous, "What could I expect
from someone over 40?"</TE>
<TE>   By 1969, LTV was selling $1 billion of meat, $1 billion of steel and
$700 million of planes and aerospace hardware. It had become the world's
largest manufacturer of sports equipment. It made chemicals, cable, drugs
and stereos. Its stock reached $136 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Today, all that's left is a bankrupt steel producer.</TE>
<TE>   Few things about Enron have attracted as much attention as the
company's extraordinary talent for painting whatever financial picture it
wanted by hiding debt, converting losses to gains and making whole
operations vanish at will.</TE>
<TE>   Unluckily for ordinary investors, the company's off-the-books
partnerships, stock-backed deals and less-than-arm's-length transactions
were not unique to it. A substantial number of companies use similar
practices, despite the fact that some contributed to many of the greatest
corporate crackups of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the clearest link to past debacles involves Samuel L. Insull,
the British-born onetime private secretary to inventor Thomas Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Insull is widely credited with figuring out how to make money from the
new electrical technology of the early 20th century, and with assembling
one of the largest regional power distribution systems in the country
during the 1910s and 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, Skilling and Enron could rightfully claim to be Insull's
historical heirs. They, more than anyone, pressed for taking the next
logical step from where Insull left off, linking the country's disparate
regional distribution systems into a single national power grid. Their
proposal, for which they lobbied heavily with the Bush administration,
lies buried in the fine print of the president's yet-to-be-acted-upon
energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron executives were much more interested in following Insull's
lead in another area, creative accounting, and the result was a tottering
financial structure that ultimately collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the two groups' methods differed. But their aims were the
same: to ensure that insiders maintained control over their respective
empires, to ensure that they did so with other people's money, and to
attract as little unwanted public or government notice as possible. Their
fates were also the same.</TE>
<TE>   Insull's debt-laden empire crumbled in September 1931 in what
newspapers at the time said was "the biggest business failure in the
history of the world." The collapse took 600,000 shareholders and 500,000
bondholders down with it.</TE>
<TE>   "People felt so swindled they never went near the market again. There
was a lost generation of investors," business historian Ron Chernow said.</TE>
<TE>   More than Enron's political clout or its dubious accounting practices,
what most outrages the public about the company's collapse is the idea
that top executives could walk away with millions of dollars while
ordinary employees lost their jobs and retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans have always been deeply ambivalent about capitalism,"
Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley said. "Most people see it as
fine as long as it is working for everyone. But they get very distraught
if it is not working well or seems to be serving only the top few."</TE>
<TE>   That distress was fed mightily by news that Lay, Enron's former
chairman, sold $100 million of company stock last year even as he was
trying to persuade company employees to hold on to their shares. That was
substantially more than previously reported.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the latest report, the executive who ultimately could
come in for the nastiest criticism may not be Lay or Skilling, but former
finance chief Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   That's because in addition to designing many of the off-the-books
partnerships that fooled the public about Enron's true financial
condition, Fastow and an associate are accused by their own board of
tweaking the arrangements to draw tens of millions of dollars out of the
company for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In authorizing Fastow to set up key partnerships, the Enron board
appears to have allowed him to treat them almost as personal property,
even letting him name them after his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   If board members had looked at similar deals from the past, they might
have seen what was coming.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1920s, Albert H. Wiggin, the head of New York's giant Chase
National Bank, created a series of private companies, including two named
for his daughters, to speculate in Chase stock.</TE>
<TE>   When the 1929 crash occurred, Wiggin was put in charge of propping up
the bank's share price. But he used his private firms to take out loans
from the bank with which to bet against the stock. During the darkest
period of the crash, September through November, he made more than $4
million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agree that stopping the likes of Wiggin in advance may be
nearly impossible, but some argue that the addition of new laws and
regulations over the years has helped discourage fraud by raising the
cost of getting caught.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt any of the principals of Enron or the partnerships are going
to look back on this and say, 'Boy was that a wild ride, but was it worth
it,' " UC Berkeley economic historian Brad DeLong said.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether anyone forfeits his fortune. Ex-junk
bond king Michael Milken, who spent almost two years in federal prison
for securities fraud and paid more than $1 billion in fines and
penalties, was recently estimated to be worth $800 million.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Enron hearings underway on Capitol Hill are to help
members of Congress decide whether new laws are needed to prevent such a
collapse from happening again. But as almost everyone involved
understands, they are really morality plays intended to reward good and
punish evil.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the executives who have been paraded before the committees and
the cameras, including Lay and Fastow, have taken the Fifth and endured
hours of insult. Skilling took a different tack and denied knowing of any
improper activities or even financial problems, and was ridiculed for his
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and historians say that such public pillorying helps build
momentum for political change. In Enron's case, the company is quickly
emerging as a symbol of business excess that's already helping to prod
passage of campaign finance reform, and probably will result in new
controls on corporations, pensions and accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the regulators who have won broad new powers through the
hearing process argue that, in the final analysis, it is not the extra
laws or regulations that are most important, but the public glare on the
rich and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever rules we pass will not assure us that we will not have
another cycle" of Enron-like scandals, Levitt, the former SEC chairman,
said last week. "In America, humiliation and embarrassment tend to change
behavior faster."</TE>

<HD>Justices Gut State's 'Son of Sam' Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a state law
that prohibits felons from cashing in on their crime stories in a case
that pitted freedom of speech against victims' rights.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision, a victory for book publishers and the movie
industry, found that the state's 16-year-old ban on profiteering from
crime was overly broad and violated free-speech rights guaranteed by the
U.S. and state constitutions.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was the first of its kind since the U.S. Supreme Court in
1991 overturned the original "Son of Sam" law in New York state, saying
it was too broad and violated the right to free speech.</LD>
<TE>   The New York law was named after the moniker used by serial killer
David Berkowitz, who terrorized New York City in the late 1970s. It had
applied to anyone who had committed, or admitted to having committed, a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1991 ruling, the state Legislature limited California's law,
making it apply only to convicted felons, in hopes of making it
constitutional. The California high court, however, said Thursday that
the state law still was too sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   California's prohibition was one of more than 40 laws across the
nation that required felons to turn over proceeds from such projects to
the victims of their crimes or the state. The latest ruling makes such
laws more vulnerable to legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Frank Sinatra Jr. over a
movie about his infamous kidnapping in 1963. Sinatra wanted to stop Barry
Keenan, the mastermind of the crime, from earning money from the sale of
"Snatching Sinatra" to Columbia Pictures. Keenan said he would turn over
all proceeds to charity. The movie project is now stalled.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Sinatra complained that the ruling makes it "open season"
on criminal memoirs for the movie industry and will be a "death knell"
for similar laws in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the movie capital," said Richard B. Specter, Sinatra's
lawyer, "and because more movies are made here than anywhere else, this
is extremely significant."</TE>
<TE>   Victims'-rights advocates said they will lobby the Legislature to pass
a new law that is constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "This sends a message that there is profit in crime," complained Marc
Klaas, father of Polly Klaas, who was 12 when she was kidnapped and
murdered in 1993.</TE>
<TE>Ban Described as Too Broad</TE>
<TE>   The court's decision, written by Justice Marvin Baxter, said the ban
on profits from books, movies and magazine articles was overly broad
because it could be applied to any book or movie that dealt with a
felon's recollection of crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The law gives crime victims the proceeds from a wide range of works by
convicted felons "simply because those works include substantial accounts
of the prior felonies," Baxter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "A statute that confiscates all profits from works which make more
than a passing, nondescriptive reference to the creator's past crimes . .
." Baxter said, "sweeps within its ambit a wide range of protected
speech."</TE>
<TE>   The court said such a law also discourages the discussion of crimes in
even "nonexploitative" contexts. The ruling noted that works by such
authors as the political activist Emma Goldman and Martin Luther King Jr.
could have been subject to the California law if it had been in effect at
the time of their writings.</TE>
<TE>   Book publishers and writers' groups had urged the court to rule
against Sinatra in the case. They had argued that without the incentive
of money, many convicted felons would not tell their stories. Volumes of
importance to historians, psychologists, criminologists and law
enforcement would be lost, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a stretch to say that these laws probably have had the
effect of shaping the way book projects have been done and may well have
kept certain books from being published," said Jonathan Bloom, a lawyer
for the Assn. for American Publishers, who argued in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Many states, including New York, have revised "Son of Sam" laws to
avoid constitutional problems, Bloom said. But he said he believes they
still are vulnerable to constitutional challenges, particularly following
Thursday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In a concurring opinion in Keenan vs. Los Angeles Superior Court,
Justice Janice Rogers Brown said California may still pass a law that
calls for the seizure of the assets of a convicted criminal for the
benefit of his or her victims.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1st Amendment protects schlock journalism as well as great
literature," Brown said. "Thus, Mr. Keenan has every right to tell his
story. That does not mean the 1st Amendment guarantees he can keep his
money."</TE>
<TE>Criminals Can Be Sued Over Suffering</TE>
<TE>   She noted that victims can sue criminals and obtain damages for their
suffering. "A state may thus seize a defendant's assets in a
content-neutral manner to ensure compensation," Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But Specter, Sinatra's lawyer, said such lawsuits take time and the
felon may hide his or her money before the victims' litigation is
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "Convicted felons tend not to keep bank accounts at Wells Fargo with
the money sitting in there," Specter said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) said he will introduce
legislation to cure the constitutional defects in the stricken law.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think the people of California should allow criminals to
profit from their misdeeds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Eliasberg, managing attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California, said "It will be difficult if not
impossible" for the Legislature to write a constitutional law that taps
the profits of felons' writings.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature in 2000 added a section to the "Son of Sam" law to bar
any profiteering from criminals' memorabilia sold for prices enhanced by
the notoriety of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, notorious criminals in prison were selling everything
from their fingernail clippings to their autographs over the Internet.
That section of the law was not at issue in the Keenan case, and
Thursday's ruling leaves it on the books.</TE>
<TE>   "We have often said the 1st Amendment does not protect fingernail
clippings," said Stephen F. Rohde, an attorney for Keenan. "But
unfortunately, the memorabilia section could sweep within it diaries,
poems, drawings, paintings and other material of an expressive nature.</TE>
<TE>   "So it remains to be seen whether aspects of the law that the court
didn't reach today would also be vulnerable to a constitutional
challenge."</TE>
<TE>Precedent for Other States Seen</TE>
<TE>   Rohde and other lawyers in the case said the ruling imperils similar
laws in other states because it establishes a precedent that may guide
other state high courts.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan, 61, who said he works as a criminal justice reform advocate,
said Thursday he was glad he won the case but bitter that Sinatra had
pursued it even after he had pledged to donate all proceeds to charity or
to Sinatra himself.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan, who until recently worked as a developer, said he sought a
movie deal because he wanted the story to be told correctly for the sake
of Sinatra and two of Keenan's friends who played roles in the
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   "There were three scripts we knew of floating around Hollywood,"
Keenan said, "and we were concerned that if we didn't participate in the
process, it would perpetuate a misrepresentation of the facts surrounding
the case."</TE>
<TE>Served 4 Years for Kidnapping</TE>
<TE>   By his account, Keenan was in financial trouble and high on drugs when
he concocted the plot to kidnap Sinatra, who was 19 at the time. He had
known Sinatra's sister, Nancy, in high school, and says he hoped to
invest the ransom, make millions of dollars and eventually repay the
Sinatra family.</TE>
<TE>   He and an accomplice snatched the young entertainer at gunpoint from a
hotel in Lake Tahoe in 1963 and held him a couple days before he was
freed unharmed. Keenan served four years in prison for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   He was paid $485,000 for the movie rights to the story.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet Salarno, chairwoman and president of Crime Victims United of
California, said she was stunned by Thursday's ruling. Salarno, whose
daughter was murdered in 1979, said:</TE>
<TE>   "So now they can make money on their crimes and our grief?"</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Addresses 'Unfortunate' Attack</HD>
<DH>War: Targets of a raid last month were not Taliban or Al Qaeda, but
they fired first, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday that it is
"unfortunate" that more than a dozen Afghan fighters were killed by Army
Special Forces last month in a nighttime attack on what U.S. troops
thought were Al Qaeda or Taliban compounds.</LD>
<LD>   But he insisted that the raid, which targeted two enclaves in the
Hazar Qadam Valley before dawn Jan. 24, was "no mistake" because the
Americans fired in self-defense after fighters in one of the compounds
began shooting at them.</LD>
<LD>   Afghans in the other compound did not open fire, and more than two
dozen were taken into custody without loss of life, according to
Rumsfeld.</LD>
<TE>   "The forces that went in, in the instances where they were not fired
on, they did not use lethal force," he said. "In instances where they
were fired upon, they did use lethal force, which is exactly what their
rules of engagement provide. . . . They used good judgment throughout the
process."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the raid, Rumsfeld and other Pentagon officials
described it as a successful step in the campaign to ferret out rogue
forces. The 27 men taken into custody for interrogation included several
senior Al Qaeda or Taliban leaders, they suggested.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has since released the detainees, saying they were wrongly
captured. Senior U.S. officials have said CIA operatives paid $1,000 or
more to each family that lost a relative in the incident. And unofficial
apologies have been offered to victims' relatives, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command, said earlier this
month that American commanders have been ordered to tighten coordination
with Afghan government officials to prevent confusion on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I've asked everybody to be sure our coordination is OK," Franks told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers say those killed and captured were partisans of a local
anti-Taliban commander who supported the U.S.-backed interim government
of Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers claim that some died in their beds while others were
handcuffed with heavy plastic strips, then beaten by American soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Rumsfeld confirmed that the dead were not connected to
terrorists or the deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   But he denied that prisoners were beaten, or killed after being
handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Some may have been wounded or injured while being subdued before being
handcuffed, said Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, who also participated in Thursday's briefing to announce
preliminary results of an investigation into the incident.</TE>
<TE>Secretary Says Army Staked Out Sites</TE>
<TE>   Under close questioning at his daily news briefing, Rumsfeld rejected
a suggestion that the Afghans who were killed were innocent victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not call them innocents. We don't know quite what they were.
They were people who fired on our forces," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some Afghans and others have suggested that U.S. forces were
tricked by one warlord's supporters into attacking those of a rival,
Rumsfeld said he understood the decision to strike was based entirely on
information compiled by American operatives.</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks before the raid, Rumsfeld said, U.S. observers
watched the two sites. Using criteria that he declined to describe, they
concluded that the compounds were terrorist-related.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was "persuasive and compelling," Rumsfeld said, but not
strong enough to justify an airstrike, so ground action was ordered
instead.</TE>
<TE>   Under cover of night, two Special Forces teams were flown by
helicopter to the Hazar Qadam village of Oruzgan. When one of the teams
was spotted and fired upon, it returned fire, Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 14 and 21 fighters were killed and a number wounded in the
ensuing firefight. One American soldier suffered a minor ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Although the subject of civilian casualties has become a sensitive one
for the Pentagon, Rumsfeld staunchly defended the Hazar Qadam raid.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think it is a mistake for people to observe carefully and
make a judgment about behavior on the ground," or to order a ground
action when the evidence of terrorist links was not sufficient to support
an airstrike, he said.</TE>
<TE>No Disciplinary Action Expected for Soldiers</TE>
<TE>   "And once on the ground, it seems to me it is no mistake at all, if
you're fired on, to fire back."</TE>
<TE>   Would disciplinary action be taken against some participants in the
assault? he was asked. "Why would there be?" he replied. "I can't imagine
why there would be any.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's an error. I think it's just a fact that
circumstances on the ground in Afghanistan are difficult. It's untidy. It
is not a neat situation where all the good guys are here and all the bad
guys are there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces are under orders to "lean forward, not back" in the hunt
for Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, he said, and must rely on their
experience and best judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Some news reports have suggested that the decision to move on Hazar
Qadam may have been influenced by the fact that some local tribesmen
traditionally wear black or white turbans of the kind once used by the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the large quantities of weapons and munitions seized--and
presumably observed being taken into the two compounds before the
raid--may have come from a local program to disarm the populace.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he had no further information on several other incidents
in which U.S. forces have been accused of hitting groups of people who
were not affiliated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban.</TE>

<HD>Reporter Held Captive Is Dead, Videotape Shows</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Daniel Pearl was executed shortly after being kidnapped
while pursuing terror links, officials say. Colleagues are in mourning.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Terrorism claimed another U.S. victim Thursday when a videotape
recovered in Pakistan showed that Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl had been killed by his captors.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues said the gruesome video indicated that Pearl was executed
shortly after several U.S. newspapers received e-mail photographs in late
January showing the journalist in chains and with a pistol to his head.
The e-mails came from a group of self-described Pakistani nationalists.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl, 38, was abducted in the Pakistani port city of Karachi on Jan.
23 while investigating local ties between alleged "shoe bomber" Richard
C. Reid and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<TE>   An intense investigation by Pakistani officials, backed by the FBI and
the CIA, had raised hopes as recently as this week that Pearl would be
rescued or released unharmed. But officials said the videotape showed
Pearl's throat being cut several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty awful, and I hope no one ever sees it who hasn't had to
see it already," said a Journal editor familiar with the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Steiger, the Journal's managing editor, announced the news to the
paper's Washington bureau about 4 p.m. Thursday. In response to
questions, Steiger refused to say whether Pearl had been tortured but
said his body would not be returned to the United States. Pakistani
officials said separately that Pearl's body had not been recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people were crying," one Journal reporter said. "Danny had a
lot of friends here."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department expressed outrage at Pearl's death. "Both the
United States and Pakistan are committed to identifying all the
perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice," spokesman
Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   In Beijing, a somber President Bush expressed condolences to Pearl's
family and warned that such "criminal barbaric acts" only stiffen
America's resolve to "rid the world" of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really sad for his wife and parents, and his friends and
colleagues, who have been clinging to hope for weeks that he would be
found alive," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he was "especially sad" for the couple's unborn child, "who
will now know his father through the memory of others."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's French-born wife, Mariane, is seven months pregnant with their
first child. She had remained in Karachi and made several emotional
appeals to her husband's captors after he disappeared. Colleagues said
she planned to fly home today to her family in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "We are heartbroken by his death," Peter Kann, publisher of the
Journal, said in a statement. "Danny was an outstanding colleague, a
great reporter and a dear friend of many at the Journal."</TE>
<TE>   Kann said Pearl's "murder is an act of barbarism that makes a mockery
of everything Danny's kidnappers claimed to believe in. They claimed to
be Pakistani nationalists, but their actions must surely bring shame to
all true Pakistani patriots."</TE>
<TE>   A family spokesman, Gary Foster, told reporters outside Pearl's
parents' home in Encino that his "senseless murder lies beyond our
comprehension."</TE>
<TE>   He described Pearl as "a musician, a writer, a storyteller and a
bridge-builder."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes the
Journal, said Pearl's family was setting up a foundation to support
charities focusing on causes "that Danny has dedicated his life to."</TE>
<TE>   He said contributions could be sent to the Daniel Pearl Family
Foundation, care of the Wall Street Journal, P.O. Box 300, Princeton, NJ
08543.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Princeton, N.J., Pearl graduated from Birmingham High School
in Van Nuys and Stanford University. He joined the Journal 12 years ago,
working in the paper's Atlanta and Washington bureaus before being
assigned to London and then Paris. He moved in 2000 to Bombay, India, as
the paper's South Asia bureau chief.</TE>
<TE>Case Cast Shadow on Pakistani Leader's Visit</TE>
<TE>   He disappeared in Karachi after he apparently was lured into a trap by
his abductors, who used false identities and Internet accounts to hide
their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   His case partly overshadowed the visit to Washington last week of
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Bush and Musharraf discussed the
case, and two Journal editors met privately with the Pakistani leader to
plead for his assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Mukhtar Ahmed, home secretary of Sindh province, where Karachi
is located, said a videotape was received by the U.S. Consulate in
Karachi about 11 p.m. there Thursday. Ahmed said the video "contained
scenes of Mr. Pearl's captivity and scenes of his murder."</TE>
<TE>   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark
Wentworth would not comment on the contents of the tape other than to say
"the evidence provided is conclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Until Thursday, Pakistani officials and Journal editors proceeded as
if Pearl were alive even though his kidnappers had not directly
communicated since sending the two e-mails Jan. 27 and Jan. 28. The first
message included a photograph showing Pearl holding up a Karachi
newspaper dated Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   The group demanded, among other things, the immediate release of
Pakistani prisoners who had been captured in Afghanistan and are being
interrogated at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities repeatedly announced that they were about to
break the case. But several later e-mails proved to be hoaxes, and U.S.
investigators privately voiced growing doubts as days turned to weeks
without additional word from Pearl's captors.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, those doubts became public when the chief suspect in the
case, a British-born Muslim militant named Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, told
a Pakistani judge that "from what I understand, he [Pearl] is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, whose story reportedly changed several times during his
interrogation, also allegedly told investigators that he had telephoned
Pearl's captors Feb. 5 and they then told him in code language that Pearl
was dead. Sheikh later claimed that the reporter had been killed in an
escape attempt around Jan. 31, but investigators said they didn't believe
that account.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh told a court hearing that he had engineered Pearl's abduction
to protest Pakistan's close support for the United States in the war on
terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks. "Our country shouldn't be catering
to America's needs," Sheikh said.</TE>
<TE>3 Other Suspects Charged in Kidnapping</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities have charged three other suspects with helping
Sheikh send the two e-mail messages and photographs that confirmed
Pearl's kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers initially claimed that Pearl was a CIA agent. A day
later, however, they said they had decided that he worked for Israeli
intelligence. The Journal, and both governments, vehemently denied that
Pearl was anything but a journalist.</TE>
<TE>   One suspect, Fahad Naseem, told a Pakistani judge Thursday that Sheikh
had told him that he wanted to seize someone who is "anti-Islam and a
Jew."</TE>
<TE>   The tape was sent just as Pakistan and the rest of the Muslim world
began the celebration of Eid al-Adha, which marks the end of the hajj, or
pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   Additional suspects who allegedly were involved in setting up the
false meeting that led to Pearl's kidnapping and death are still being
sought. All are believed to be members of radical Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh has boasted that he was involved in several terrorist attacks
in India, including an assault last December on the Parliament in New
Delhi.</TE>

<DH>Latin America: Ground troops surround zone ceded to guerrillas, as
all-out war erupts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Colombia plunged into all-out war Thursday, promising a bloody new
chapter in the nation's history that heralds a violent and uncertain
future for South America's oldest democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Air force jets dropped 1,500- and 500-pound bombs on rebel airstrips,
camps and supply depots in the Switzerland-sized zone the government
ceded to the main guerrilla group three years ago for peace talks.</LD>
<LD>   Ground forces had not entered the zone by late Thursday, although
about 13,000 troops, including 5,000 Colombian special forces, were
reportedly surrounding the region. Rumors flew as to the timing of an
invasion, but there was little doubt that it was coming.</LD>
<TE>   Colombia's four-sided conflict includes the national government, two
leftist rebel armies and right-wing paramilitary forces. The United
States has long provided the government with aid to fight the drug trade,
but it has become increasingly involved in the war as the rebels and
paramilitary groups depend more and more on revenue from drugs.</TE>
<TE>   There were unconfirmed reports, denied by the government, that a stray
bomb had killed several people in a hamlet late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We hit our targets with certainty. There were no civilians affected,"
said Gen. Fabio Velasco, the head of the Colombian air force. "We are
still conducting operations so that the army can enter later."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's actions spelled the end of Colombia's roller-coaster peace
process and signaled the opening of a new surge in violence in this
country's nearly 40-year-old conflict.</TE>
<TE>   President Andres Pastrana abandoned peace talks late Wednesday. He
ordered troops to retake the demilitarized zone from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, after a rebel offensive that
culminated with the hijacking of an airplane and kidnapping of a senator.
In a national address, Pastrana, who had staked his political career on
peace, for the first time termed the rebels "terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   The war seems likely to become far more bloody and dangerous than its
previous incarnation, a low-intensity conflict fought in mostly rural
areas. About 40,000 people have died during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Three years of talks had produced almost no results, frustrating many
in this nation of 40 million people. A recent rebel offensive that
included attacks against reservoirs, electrical transmission towers,
restaurants and shopping areas angered Colombians.</TE>
<TE>   The first round of Colombia's presidential election is scheduled for
May, further imperiling what small chance remains for renewed talks.
Conservative candidate Alvaro Uribe, who has taken a hard line against
the guerrillas, leads his rivals by a 2-1 margin. He favors direct U.S.
intervention in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Both the military and rebels used the three years of talks to build up
their forces. The Colombian army now has nearly 50,000 professional
soldiers, compared with about 18,000 rebels for the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has provided nearly $2 billion in aid to Colombia in the last
few years, most of it to train troops and supply helicopters to fight the
drug trade. Colombia produces 90% of the cocaine consumed in the U.S.,
and money from the illegal drug trade is a main source of rebel income.</TE>
<TE>   The troops and equipment are supposed to be used only for
counter-narcotics purposes, though Colombian and U.S. officials have
recently indicated a willingness to loosen those restrictions in some
cases.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Bush administration has included $98 million in next
year's budget to train and equip troops for direct military confrontation
with rebels that attack a pipeline used by Los Angeles-based Occidental
Petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC allegedly received instruction in bomb-making from rebels
from the Irish Republican Army. As talks dragged on, they oversaw a
flourishing cocaine trade in the zone they control and a sharp increase
in the amount of land growing drug crops.</TE>
<TE>   A FARC commander, speaking earlier in the week in a town a few hours
south of the zone, said the army was ready to retake Colombia by force.</TE>
<TE>   "We are well trained. We are prepared to die. And we are ready," said
Comandante Jhony, a commander in the FARC's 49th Front.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what effect the renewed hostilities would have on
Colombia's other armed groups. The army is also engaged in a
low-intensity war with about 4,000 rebels from the National Liberation
Army, or ELN.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest unknown is the country's right-wing paramilitary army,
which has leaped from a few hundred men in the early 1990s to an
estimated 11,000.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary groups, long linked with the Colombian army, are
responsible for the majority of massacres of civilians. Paramilitary
leader Carlos Castano has said he is prepared to enter the zone to help
purge it of rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana received nearly unanimous approval, both nationally and
internationally. U.S. State Department officials said they supported
Pastrana's choice to invade.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of a small village called the mayor's office in San Vicente
del Caguan, a gritty town that is the rebel zone's de facto capital,
Thursday afternoon to say a bomb had killed six to eight people and
wounded several others, including children. The hamlet is near a large
rebel encampment, locals said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither doctors nor government officials were able to reach the
hamlet, located about three hours away. One nun, her face twisted in
worry, shuttled among city offices, begging for help.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to find a doctor right now, but we have not been able
to do anything," said Samuel Sanchez, the local human rights director.</TE>
<TE>   There were few signs of the rebels. They have said repeatedly that
they would peacefully hand over the zone's five cities if talks ended,
but there was widespread speculation that they would fight for the
surrounding jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Air force officials reported seeing rebels moving through extensive
trench networks. FARC soldiers were also seen burning documents and
papers at an office near this town.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas left behind dozens of stolen cars and motorcycles, throwing
some into local rivers. Local people stripped many of the vehicles, most
of them luxury four-wheel-drives stolen by FARC rebels and brought to the
zone, a vast and mostly unpopulated region of dirt roads, thick jungle
and rolling hills.</TE>
<TE>   "The guerrillas are going to engage in small but significant and
dispersed military actions," predicted Alfredo Rangel, a leading defense
analyst. "The big offensive will come once the population and the
military have dropped their guard."</TE>
<TE>   The town itself was in the grip of panic. More than 30 national
government officials who had been involved in peace talks were evacuated
on emergency flights, leaving many people fearing for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   Trucks and buses crammed with furniture, suitcases and chickens could
be seen on roads leading out of the zone.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have taken off," said cabdriver Carlos Torres. "There
is no reason to stay. They'll kill you like they do a chicken or a
rooster."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the mayor's office started planning for the arrival of up
to 2,500 refugees from outlying villages. The town was under a 7
p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, and alcohol sales were banned.</TE>
<TE>   Town officials decided to convert the tents at the former site of
peace talks into emergency shelters for the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest worry in the zone right now is the safety of its
citizens," said Nestor Leon Ramirez, the mayor. "People feel like they
have been abandoned because they have seen no sign of the [national]
government's presence."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the town's civilian police force, created as a compromise
with the FARC, found themselves isolated and alone. They said they wanted
to be evacuated, since their contacts with guerrillas would make them
prime targets for the paramilitary groups.</TE>
<TE>   'We feel totally abandoned. Where is the government?" said Oscar
Morales, a 27-year-old member of the unarmed force. "We are exposed to
every kind of danger."</TE>

<HD>Sharon Asks Israelis to Stand Together</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Prime minister announces plans for buffer zones along
borders. Palestinians arrest three suspects in official's killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, under mounting criticism for failing
to halt Palestinian attacks on Israelis, urged a war-weary nation
Thursday to be patient, calm and, above all, united as Israel presses
ahead with a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon also demanded that Palestinians disarm completely, and he
announced plans to build buffer zones along Israel's borders with the
West Bank as a way to separate Palestinians and Israelis--a unilateral
action that is not a new idea but will likely further inflame tensions.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, announced the arrest of three
suspects in the October assassination of a right-wing Israeli Cabinet
minister. Israel had demanded the capture and prosecution of the
Palestinian gunman and his accomplices as a condition for lifting a
3-month-old travel ban on Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   In what is shaping up to be the deadliest week here in 17 months of
conflict, seven more Palestinians and one Israeli Arab were killed by
Israeli troops Thursday; two Israeli soldiers were wounded in a
Palestinian ambush.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to rally Israelis, who are increasingly despondent over the
seemingly unending strife, Sharon went on national television and
promised that he will "not rest" until Palestinian "terrorist
organizations" are dismantled and disarmed. Sharon regards Palestinian
militias as well as some regular police forces as terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "To those who speak about a collapse, despair and loss of hope, this
is not the time to utter words of disaster," Sharon told citizens who
elected him in a landslide a year ago but who are increasingly expressing
doubts about his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of Israel is not collapsing," he said. "This is the time
for demonstrating the unity which is at the core of the character of the
Jewish people."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's speech was aimed at caulking the cracks that have emerged in
Israeli society in recent weeks. The right wing is demanding an all-out
war on Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, while the left insists that
there can be no military solution and that only negotiations and an end
to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip will halt
hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to Sharon's comments fell predictably along ideological
lines. No one was satisfied, and some were alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Great expectations, great disappointment," proclaimed Yitzhak Levy,
head of the National Religious Party, which represents the right-wing
Jewish settlers who have traditionally been the bastion of Sharon's
support. "Empty drama, wasted air time. A leader in wartime is expected
to present plans with depth, not preach to his nation."</TE>
<TE>   Yossi Sarid, head of the leftist opposition Meretz Party, also
complained that Sharon offered no concrete ideas or vision for a way out
of the crisis, and no incentives for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said they had hoped that Sharon would offer a
diplomatic initiative, but instead he pledged more war. Nabil Shaath, a
Palestinian Cabinet minister, said the buffer zones will not enhance
security and will only deepen suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Pointedly avoiding any mention of Arafat by name, Sharon insisted
again he would refuse any dialogue with the Palestinian leader. But he
did appeal directly to the Palestinian people, urging them to choose a
new leadership or suffer the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "I suggest that you think long and hard about what you and your
children would want to achieve in the coming years," he said, referring
to the remarkable industrial, economic and agricultural development
achieved by Israel in its 53 years of existence.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you continue to follow those who lead you to ruin, destruction
and despair? Will you continue to be misled by those who call upon your
sons to commit suicide, or will you follow those who choose to progress
and to thrive?"</TE>
<TE>   At his besieged West Bank headquarters in Ramallah, Arafat reiterated
a Dec. 16 call for a cease-fire. Citing a long list of violated
cease-fires, Israelis scoffed at his proposal. After the Dec. 16 speech,
however, the region entered several of the quietest weeks since the start
of the conflict in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon repeated his familiar position that he is eager to reach a
truce by "talking to those Palestinians that one can talk to," but he
said he would not negotiate under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Palestinians' arrest of suspects in the Oct. 17
slaying of right-wing Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, Sharon said he was
awaiting confirmation that the men were truly in detention. He seemed to
hint, however, that the government was willing to ease restrictions on
Arafat's movements, saying the Cabinet would review the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Agents of the Palestinian intelligence service rounded up the three
men in a predawn raid Thursday in the West Bank city of Nablus where they
had been in hiding for months, Palestinian officials said. Col. Talal
Dweikat, head of intelligence in Nablus, said the arrest order came from
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects belong to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a radical faction that claimed responsibility for Zeevi's
slaying. The group said Zeevi was killed in retaliation for Israel's
assassination of its leader.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men arrested, Hamdi Quoran, has been identified by Israel
as the shooter who confronted Zeevi, 75, in a hotel hallway and fired at
him point-blank.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials were reacting cautiously to the report of arrests,
because Palestinian authorities have in the past arrested suspected
killers only to free them later.</TE>
<TE>   About half an hour before Sharon went on television, Israeli forces
launched yet another round of punishing aerial bombardments on
Palestinian targets. Missiles slammed into Arafat's headquarters in Gaza
City for the third consecutive night and destroyed a police station in
the southern Gazan town of Rafah.</TE>
<TE>   In violence earlier Thursday, Palestinian gunmen attacked an Israeli
army checkpoint. One Palestinian leaped from a car and opened fire at
close range at soldiers, who returned fire, killing the assailant as well
as an Israeli Arab man. The army said it was investigating whether the
second man was involved or was a passerby, as his family claimed. Two
soldiers and four passersby were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   At the Kalandiyeh checkpoint on the main road from Jerusalem to the
West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli soldiers and rock-throwing
Palestinians skirmished on and off throughout the day. At one point,
soldiers opened fire on Palestinians who were walking over a back road to
skirt the closed checkpoint, the only way out of Ramallah for most
residents. A 30-year-old man was shot in the eye. He later died.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli helicopters fired missiles at an apartment building in
Ramallah used by members of Arafat's Force 17 presidential guard. There
were no serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramallah attack occurred at almost the same moment that U.S.
Consul General Ronald Schlicher was paying a call on Arafat at his
Ramallah offices.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the creation of buffer zones, Sharon refused to detail
how they will be set up and whether Palestinian land will be confiscated
to create them. The idea is to prevent suicide bombers from entering
Israel, but similar security zones in the past have not worked.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon offered little in the way of concrete plans, analysts
here said it was crucial for the prime minister to try to assuage the
fears of his public and offer some explanation at a time of growing
dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Israel needs "courageous and visionary leadership that will know how
to restore its ability to deter [Palestinian attacks], but without being
dragged into a dangerous military escapade," the daily Maariv newspaper
said in an editorial Thursday. "In the absence of such leadership, it is
currently difficult to see even the light at the end of the tunnel."</TE>

<HD>Annan Urges Mideast Intervention</HD>
<DH>U.N.: At a Security Council meeting convened at the insistence of
Arab states, he warns that the region is nearing 'the edge of the abyss.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Middle East risks "sliding toward full-fledged war" unless
Western powers intervene in the conflict, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan warned the Security Council in unusually blunt language Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Truly, we are nearing the edge of the abyss," Annan said, noting that
more than 60 Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in political
violence in the last seven days, in what looks to be the highest weekly
death toll since fighting broke out in the region 17 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The "breakdown of trust is so total" and "the clamor on both sides for
revenge" so intense that third-party mediation is essential, Annan told
the council in a meeting that was convened Thursday morning at the
insistence of Arab states.</LD>
<TE>   But Israel, with the crucial backing of the United States, remains
strongly opposed to new U.N. negotiating initiatives. And many Security
Council members want to avoid a public confrontation with Washington over
the Middle East, diplomats here said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan spoke to the council shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon went on television and announced plans to build buffer zones
between Israelis and Palestinians. Hours before that, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat had appealed to Palestinians to honor
his earlier calls for a halt to armed violence, an appeal that some of
his followers said does not apply to attacks on Israelis inside the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council discussed the conflict behind closed doors before
Annan's public remarks and agreed to convene an open debate on Middle
East policy early next week. Some members are asking the council to
dispatch an emergency mission to the region, a proposal opposed by Israel
and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said Thursday that Western governments must "move beyond" their
repeated calls for the Israelis and Palestinians to implement CIA
Director George J. Tenet's cease-fire plan and former Sen. George J.
Mitchell's "confidence-building" proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "As we know, the parties have not implemented either of these plans,"
Annan said. "If Tenet and Mitchell have not failed, they can certainly
not be said to have succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council was pulled back into the Middle East conflict at
the request of Arab diplomats here, who formally asked the council to
"consider the extremely dangerous situation in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including Jerusalem, and take the necessary action."
Palestinian envoys, in a separate appeal, also asked the council to
intervene.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot leave this situation, deteriorating as it is on a daily
basis, Israeli action becoming more brutal day after day, and the
Security Council sitting idle and not doing anything about it," said
Hussein Hassouna, a representative of the League of Arab States.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department reacted coolly to the calls for U.N.
intervention, with U.S. diplomats anticipating yet another round of
Arab-backed draft resolutions and American veto threats. The Bush
administration wielded its veto power in March and December 2001 to block
proposed resolutions urging international mediation and "monitoring
mechanisms" in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always felt that the focus needs to remain on the efforts of
the parties in the region, and particularly at this moment on the efforts
of Mr. Arafat to stop the violence," Richard Boucher, the State
Department's chief spokesman, said in Washington. "But we have always
been willing to discuss things with others [at the U.N.], and we are
consulting them."</TE>
<TE>   European diplomats here, increasingly open in their criticism of
perceived U.S. detachment from the Middle East dispute, have begun to
coalesce behind a French proposal to jump-start peace talks with the
preemptive recognition of a Palestinian state. The German and Spanish
foreign ministries have voiced tentative support for the plan, which the
French have said would include new Palestinian elections and Palestinian
recognition of Israel's sovereignty within its pre-1967 borders.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, the closest U.S. ally on the council, is working to avert a
collision with Washington on the Middle East. But even British diplomats
said Thursday that they are hoping the council will call for new
negotiations next week, despite U.S. misgivings about further U.N.
resolutions on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Violence is being used as part of a deliberate policy on both sides,
and it is pointless," said Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's chief U.N. envoy.
"I hope the council will collectively be saying that."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Suspends Peace Efforts in Sudan After Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. announced Thursday that it was suspending efforts to help
broker an end to Sudan's nearly two-decade civil war after government
helicopter gunships attacked civilians waiting for food at a U.N. site,
killing at least 17 people.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's attack on the World Food Program depot in Bieh, in the
oil-rich western Upper Nile area, was swiftly condemned by United Nations
officials and the United States, which has tried unsuccessfully in recent
months to get Sudan to halt bombardment of civilian targets.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't see how we can pursue [peace efforts] if these kinds of
attacks are going to continue," State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said in Washington. "But we want a full explanation." The
Sudanese government offered no immediate comment.</LD>
<TE>   Boucher said the administration would consult with President Bush's
special envoy, former Sen. John C. Danforth, about how he wants to
proceed with his peace mission.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday afternoon, two helicopter gunships hovered above 4,000
people lined up for rations of beans, vegetable oil and corn porridge for
their children. As soldiers in one helicopter kept guard, their comrades
in the second aircraft fired at least five rockets into the crowd,
according to World Food Program spokeswoman Laura Melo. A soldier in the
second helicopter reportedly fired his machine gun indiscriminately at
women, children and aid workers.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third such attack on civilians in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 10, a Sudanese government plane dropped several bombs on the
southern village of Akuem, killing two children and injuring 12 others.
The bombing occurred as villagers collected food that aid workers had
airdropped.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, a Sudanese health worker and four civilians were
reported killed in a government bombing in the village of Nimne.</TE>
<TE>   "These attacks raise serious questions about the Sudanese government's
commitment to peace and the lives of its people," Boucher said. "In
addition, we have asked for an explanation of how one part of the
government can negotiate with the United States an agreement to end
attacks against civilians, while another part of the government is
deliberately targeting civilians."</TE>
<TE>   World Food Program chief Catherine Bertini said its aid distribution
had been approved by the Sudanese government. She called Wednesday's
attack "an intolerable affront to human life and humanitarian work."</TE>
<TE>   "Such attacks, deliberately targeting civilians about to receive
humanitarian aid, are absolutely and utterly unacceptable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats and Sudan watchers say that the latest attack was
the most direct assault in recent months against a humanitarian operation
and that it proves that Sudan's government is increasingly targeting
civilians who sympathize with the rebels fighting for autonomy in the
south.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter assault indicates that Sudan is pressing the war even
as it has been talking peace and attempting to improve its image in the
international arena--and especially with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan has been named by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism. The
African nation has recently turned over files on Osama bin Laden, whose
Al Qaeda network was once headquartered in Khartoum, the Sudanese
capital.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Sudan had agreed to cooperate with Danforth, who has been
trying to bring an end to the country's nearly 19 years of ethnic and
religious warfare.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict--which has claimed an estimated 2 million lives, largely
from famine and hunger--pits Sudan's Islamic government in the north
against militias in the mainly Christian and animist south.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Sudan agreed to a limited cease-fire but rejected
Danforth's proposal to halt all bombing of civilian targets and have
international monitors investigate such attacks. Investigations into the
raids, the government said, would give the rebels a military advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Government troops stepped up attacks in the western Upper Nile, the
site of most of Sudan's oil fields, after a local militia once cordial
with Khartoum merged in January 2001 with the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, the main rebel group led by John Garang.</TE>
<TE>   Garang and others say Khartoum has used money from oil exploitation,
conducted by Canadian, European and Asian companies, to fund its war in
the south.</TE>
<TE>   After the United States called the Akuem bombing "horrific and
senseless," the Sudanese government issued a rare apology, saying the
attack was a "regrettable accident."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, however, said the
Sudanese government was unlikely to abandon its strategy of attacking
civilian targets.</TE>
<TE>   "If people die and starve, they don't make good guerrillas," one
diplomat said. "That's the government's strategy--to deny civilians all
food resources and safe havens."</TE>

<HD>Dissent Grows Over AIDS Policies</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors, clergy and most provinces defy the South African
government's limited use of drugs to fight the growing epidemic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The government's AIDS policy is facing a serious challenge as key
South African politicians, medical specialists and church leaders rebel
against state restrictions on the distribution of drugs that could curb
the spread of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, five of the country's nine provinces have either
ordered their doctors to administer the anti-retroviral drug nevirapine
to pregnant women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
or have announced their intentions to make the treatment widely
available.</LD>
<TE>Mandela Among Those Voicing Concern</TE>
<TE>   Citing the Hippocratic oath that obliges them to do their utmost to
assist patients, doctors have also defied the drug restrictions, while
church leaders have thrown their support behind the dissent and implored
the government to rethink its policy. Prominent politicians, including
former President Nelson Mandela, have also joined the chorus, lambasting
what they view as a lackluster national response to tackling the AIDS
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   South African President Thabo Mbeki has drawn criticism for
questioning the link between HIV and AIDS and for downplaying figures
that show AIDS to be the country's leading cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Citing costs, drug toxicity and inadequate infrastructure, the
government has declined to provide the medications--in particular
nevirapine--at public clinics. It has authorized experimental trials of
nevirapine at 18 treatment centers.</TE>
<TE>   The uprising against the government's AIDS policy was an inevitable
response to the growing severity of the problem, medical experts said.
They warned of a snowball effect as the pandemic continues to rage out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   "As the disease starts to affect more people, the rebellion will grow
and people will begin to demand treatment," said Debbie Mathew, executive
director of the Durban-based AIDS Foundation of South Africa, which helps
support community organizations with funding and technical support.</TE>
<TE>   At least 4.7 million South Africans, or more than 10% of the
population, are infected with HIV. A study last year by the state-funded
Medical Research Council found that as many as 7 million people could die
here by 2010 if efforts to combat AIDS aren't intensified.</TE>
<TE>   During his State of the Nation address earlier this month, Mbeki said
that monitoring the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs will continue
at the 18 pilot sites. On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry allocated an
additional $357 million toward fighting AIDS over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   But the government has made it clear that it will not make the
anti-retroviral treatment available at state hospitals until the research
has been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Widely accepted medical studies indicate that nevirapine--which costs
as little as $1 per dose--can significantly reduce the chances of a woman
transmitting HIV to her baby at birth.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the government's policy gained momentum this week when
Gauteng province, the first to be fully governed by the ruling African
National Congress, announced that nevirapine would be made available to
HIV-positive women at all public hospitals and community health centers
during the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape have begun issuing
anti-retroviral drugs, while last week Northern province said it was
examining the possibility of expanding its nevirapine treatment program
beyond its pilot sites. Eastern Cape has also indicated that it will
train nurses in anticipation of extending its project.</TE>
<TE>Local Officials See Disease's Impact</TE>
<TE>   Mark Heywood, secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign, a group
lobbying for the widespread distribution of anti-AIDS drugs, said that
provincial officials were much more aware of the impact of the disease at
the grass-roots level and that this had contributed to the groundswell of
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "The AIDS epidemic is real," Heywood said. "It builds its own
pressures in terms of what people witness, in terms of the suffering
caused by HIV and people dying."</TE>
<TE>   Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang accused Mbhazima Shilowa, the
premier of Gauteng province, in which Johannesburg and Pretoria are
located, of contradicting national policy.</TE>
<TE>   The South African Communist Party, an ANC partner, called
Tshabalala-Msimang's criticism of Shilowa "regrettable and
disappointing," and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, or
COSATU, condemned the health minister's stance Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Popular opposition to the government policy escalated in December
after activists won a court case forcing the government to expand its
distribution of nevirapine. The state has appealed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has begun importing
anti-AIDS drugs from Brazil for distribution in township clinics, and
earlier this month, the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa, which
represents thousands of the country's doctors, declared the government's
delay in providing nevirapine unethical.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors are known to be using funds from private donors in South
Africa and abroad to buy anti-AIDS drugs. Others have delved into their
own bank accounts to buy the medication.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent politicians have added their voices to the mounting public
fury.</TE>
<TE>   In a Feb. 7 speech, Mandela called for greater action on tackling the
AIDS issue. He said that preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV
must be central to any government AIDS intervention program.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last weekend, the Sunday Times of Johannesburg quoted Mandela as
saying: "This is a war. It has killed more people than has been the case
in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters. We must not
continue to be debating, to be arguing, when people are dying."</TE>
<TE>   Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the
Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party, has also thrown his weight behind
the uprising.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nation is dying of AIDS," Buthelezi said in a speech to
Parliament this month. His home province, KwaZulu-Natal, is South
Africa's most AIDS-stricken. "We can no longer hesitate or falter. This
is the time to act in the full measure of our capacity."</TE>
<TE>   But despite the national outcry, activist Heywood cautioned that
securing widespread distribution of anti-AIDS medication is likely to
continue to be an uphill struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not over the hill yet," he said. "We need a comprehensive
national treatment plan, and that is not yet something that is being
seriously entertained."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>As investigators tried to uncover the cause of a fire that turned a
train into an inferno, a growing number of voices Thursday demanded
punishment for those to blame for Egypt's worst train disaster and
criticized the government for negligence.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll was 363 in the Wednesday disaster, and a team of 70
government investigators and coroners led by Egypt's top prosecutor began
its inquiry into the cause, interviewing the driver, railway engineers,
ticket conductors and other witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   The train's conductors and engineer defended their response, saying
they had done all they could to stop the burning train and fight the
fire.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid said his investigators would look
not only into the causes of the blaze but also into "those who were
behind" the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Demands for punishment of officials and an overhaul of the rail system
grew more feverish.</TE>
<TE>   "Put those responsible on trial, whoever they are," the opposition
newspaper Al-Wafd wrote.</TE>

<HD>Bush Calls On China to End Religious Persecution</HD>
<DH>Asia: In a televised speech to university students, the president
sends a strong message extolling democracy and 'the real America.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>President Bush today called for an end to religious persecution in
China, less than 24 hours after Chinese President Jiang Zemin asserted
that "religious faiths are protected by our constitution."</LD>
<LD>   In a nationally televised address here, Bush also called for free
elections "all the way to the national level."</LD>
<LD>   The president spoke at Qinghua University, one of China's most
prestigious colleges, telling his mostly young audience of several
hundred that the changes he advocates will lead to "a stronger, more
confident China"--a nation Bush has described as a "strategic
competitor."</LD>
<TE>   Although the president sought to soften his words by singing the
praises of China, the import of his remarks was unmistakable: The nation
would do well to follow America's example on democracy and religious
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's interest is served by not speaking forthrightly and honestly
about our differences," one senior administration official said of Bush's
comments.</TE>
<TE>   After his formal remarks, the president fielded questions from
students.</TE>
<TE>Blame Called Bilateral</TE>
<TE>   Bush believes that much of the world doesn't understand the United
States and what it stands for, so he chose a prominent
platform--Communist-ruled China, his last stop on a six-day Asian
tour--to speak about American values.</TE>
<TE>   As he put it here today, "I am concerned that the Chinese people do
not always see a clear picture of my country."</TE>
<TE>   Then Bush blamed both nations for that gulf, citing, for instance,
"our movies and television shows [that] often do not portray the values
of the real America I know."</TE>
<TE>   He also denounced as "misleading and harmful" some Chinese textbooks
that talk of Americans "bullying the weak and repressing the poor" and
allege that FBI agents "repress the working people."</TE>
<TE>   Bush acknowledged that the United States "has its share of problems
and faults," but he stressed that America, in his view, leads the world
on a journey toward the universal ideal of "equality and justice."</TE>
<TE>   The president began his discussion on faith and religious freedom by
describing himself as among the 95% of Americans who believe in God--a
striking contrast to Jiang's declaration at their joint news conference
Thursday that "I don't have religious faith."</TE>
<TE>   Bush continued, "Freedom of religion is not something to be feared but
to be welcomed, because faith gives us a moral core and teaches us to
hold ourselves to high standards, to love and to serve others and to live
responsible lives."</TE>
<TE>   The president noted that "tens of millions" of Chinese are practicing
religion, and he said pointedly: "Regardless of where or how these
believers worship, they are no threat to public order; in fact, they make
good citizens. For centuries, this country had a tradition of religious
tolerance. My prayer is that all persecution will end--so that all in
China are free to gather and worship as they wish."</TE>
<TE>   According to White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, the Chinese
government agreed to broadcast Bush's Qinghua appearance live and in its
entirety.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's respectful demeanor belied the toughness of his words.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for national elections, for example, he observed that
"secret ballot and competitive elections at the local level" are already
a reality, noting that it was the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who
two decades ago said that eventually there would be nationwide elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to that day," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president exuded confidence and ease during the
question-and-answer period, even when two students pressed him on U.S.
policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rogue province. The
president broke no new ground, saying: "It's been my government's policy
for a long period of time. And I haven't changed it."</TE>
<TE>   When the Chinese interpreter mistakenly began translating one of
Bush's answers by also speaking English, Bush quipped: "She's correcting
my English."</TE>
<TE>   When another student suggested that Bush's twin daughters, also
college students, might study at Qinghua, the president demurred, joking,
"I'm afraid they don't listen to me anymore . . . if you know what I
mean."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added: "I hope they do come here. It is an amazing country."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech at Qinghua marked his second appearance on live
television during his 30-hour visit to Beijing. The broadcast was carried
by state-run China Central Television, which reaches hundreds of millions
of viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The network also aired the Bush-Jiang news conference Thursday
afternoon--an echo of the groundbreaking live news conference Jiang held
with then-President Clinton here in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But whereas that session lasted more than an hour and covered a wide
variety of issues, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings of
democracy demonstrators, Thursday's news conference was narrower in
scope, more muted in tone and lasted just 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the news conference, Bush and Jiang met for about 90 minutes.
They discussed an array of bilateral and global issues, agreeing on some
and disagreeing on others.</TE>
<TE>   But as Jiang put it afterward, China and the United States "should
step up dialogue and cooperation, properly handle their differences and
work together."</TE>
<TE>   Embracing that theme, Bush said, "We believe that we can discuss our
differences with mutual understanding and respect."</TE>
<TE>   As one sign of their commitment to broaden U.S.-China contacts, the
leaders announced that Jiang, as well as his likely successor, Vice
President Hu Jintao, will visit the United States. Jiang is expected in
October; no date has been set for Hu's visit to Washington, where he will
meet with Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Commerce Secretary Don Evans will lead a trade mission to
China this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed to vigorously carry out bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in such areas as economy and trade, energy, science and
technology, environmental protection, the prevention of HIV/AIDS and law
enforcement," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Jiang also held "an extensive discussion" of the war on
terrorism, according to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Bush later said that he had asked Jiang to consider helping convey
Washington's long-standing offer for dialogue to North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   Rice said Jiang made no specific commitment to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Bush administration's deliberations over a possible
military strike against Iraq, Jiang urged caution, saying, "The important
thing is that peace is to be valued most."</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address last month, Bush described Iraq,
North Korea and Iran as "an axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>Weapons Proliferation</TE>
<TE>   Rice told reporters that Bush also pressed Jiang to implement the
terms of a November 2000 agreement to help curb the proliferation of
weapons-related technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Until China cracks down on companies that export military equipment,
Rice said, the U.S. will not lift sanctions Washington has imposed on
several Chinese firms suspected of shipping dual-use technologies to
countries such as Pakistan and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   As he did during his first meeting with Jiang, in October, Bush
initiated a lengthy discussion of faith and religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   During their private talks, Bush didn't raise any individual cases
involving possible religious persecution but rather "talked more
institutionally . . . about China moving forward on a commitment to
religious freedom," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a friendly discussion," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the topic took on a different tenor during the news conference
when two U.S. reporters pressed Jiang about the degree of religious
freedom in China. After each reporter's question, Jiang stood mute and
stone-faced at the podium--producing a brief but awkward silence in the
vast auditorium of the Great Hall of the People. Then he signaled to the
Chinese officiator to call on a Chinese journalist for the next question.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang may have been caught off-guard by having questions posed to him
directly by foreign journalists. A source familiar with the arrangements
said Beijing had proposed that questions be limited to four total, two
for Bush from U.S. reporters and two for Jiang from Chinese journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The two U.S. reporters, however, asked questions of both Bush and
Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the incident, Jiang, 75, seemed no worse for the wear. At a
banquet Thursday night, he was in a partying mood, dancing with First
Lady Laura Bush, Rice and others, while Bush sat out the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Jiang summoned an accordion player and then with gusto sang "O
Sole Mio" in Italian.</TE>

<HD>From Historic Hall to Victim of New Economic Realities</HD>
<DH>China: Auditorium where Nixon met Chou En-lai has been replaced by
a modern meeting facility.</DH>

<DL>SHANGHAI
</DL>
<LD>To see how much China has changed since Richard Nixon flew here 30
years ago and shook hands with the Communists, look no farther than the
hotel where the famous Shanghai Communique was inked.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel's simple two-story assembly hall where history was made has
been bulldozed. Instead of saving it as a tribute to the rapprochement,
the Chinese tore it down five years ago to make way for a
state-of-the-art conference facility, complete with underground parking
and an indoor swimming pool.</LD>
<LD>   "Sure we care about what happened here in the past, but we also care
about staying competitive," says Qiu Huanxi, head of the general
manager's office at the Jin Jiang Hotel. "If we didn't tear down that old
building, we wouldn't be able to make a profit."</LD>
<TE>   The American side was perhaps more sentimental about the structure.
After leaving office in 1974, Nixon paid two nostalgic visits to the old
European-style hotel where he had spent a sleepless night finalizing the
terms of the communique. By recognizing differences and shared goals, the
document laid the foundation for bilateral ties. Its cornerstone was the
declaration that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China.</TE>
<TE>   "Nixon was very happy, and he kept asking for 'More Maotai! Maotai!' "
said Jiang Jinbao, now 77, referring to the name of a Chinese liquor.
Back then, Jiang was in charge of room service for the 16th floor
presidential suite.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush timed his first official state visit to China to
coincide with the 30th anniversary of Nixon's voyage to the Middle
Kingdom. The Chinese tend to pay attention to anniversaries, especially
the politically symbolic kind. But probably because Bush's trip is to
Beijing, Shanghai is playing it rather low-key.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the hotel staff members from three decades ago have either
died or retired. Those few who are still around play down their
involvement, perhaps out of habit from a bygone era.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told, 'Don't ask, don't tell. Let whatever you know or don't
know rot in your stomach,' " said Qiu, who was a 23-year-old front desk
clerk at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Wang Fengxian was a 25-year-old waitress. She served food to Nixon's
table during the banquet. But she was told not to breathe a word of it to
her relatives or even jot anything down in her diary.</TE>
<TE>   Those were politically charged times. China was in the midst of the
Cultural Revolution. The United States was considered by Chinese as an
imperialist evil, and its president was the symbolic public enemy No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   A state newspaper greeted Nixon's arrival with an editorial stating,
"The purpose of shaking hands with the enemy is to better destroy the
enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Decades of mutual animosity had been virtually the only common ground
between the two countries. The hotel staff, however, were told to swallow
their pride and play the good host. They were ordered to remove popular
slogans of Chairman Mao Tse-tung from the hotel rooms and replace them
with apolitical Chinese paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "We never detected any hostility," said Winston Lord, a former U.S.
ambassador to Beijing who was then an aide to Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's
national security advisor. "I'm sure probably the rooms were bugged, but
all of that's natural and we expected that."</TE>
<TE>   But according to a work report by the hotel's Revolutionary Committee
at the time, the Chinese hosts never relaxed their adherence to Communist
ideals. If they served the VIPs in the U.S. entourage adequately, they
treated their working-class American counterparts extra nicely. They
tried to show solidarity with the American officials' bodyguards and
camera crews, and during meals, they chose to serve a black American
first because they believed that he was a member of the oppressed class.</TE>
<TE>   After 30 years, times have certainly changed. Now anyone with $3,000
can spend the night in Nixon's old suite and flaunt his class privilege
as he wishes. Given this, it's hardly surprising that no one could stop
the destruction of the xiao litang, or "little auditorium" where Nixon
and Chinese Premier Chou En-lai took a major step toward diplomatic
normalization.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not the first time that the hotel has been remade by the
forces of history.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1900s, a European banker built the original structure as
a mansion for his family. In 1959, the Communists tore that down to make
way for a bigger, simpler conference hall. It housed that year's
Communist Party Congress headed by Mao and later played host to the Nixon
entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Those honors were not enough, however, to save it from the whims of
China's new market economy. In the late 1990s, the hotel needed room to
expand so it could upgrade to five-star status. But its two landmark
high-rises enjoyed historic preservation status and couldn't be touched.
So the little auditorium in the heart of the hotel grounds was tagged to
go.</TE>
<TE>   "The old architects were against tearing it down," Qiu said. "We are a
state-owned enterprise. But we can't afford to ignore market demands."</TE>

<HD>30 Years Later, U.S. and China Have Narrowed 'Gulf'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Washington's policy of engagement with Beijing, launched
by Nixon's 1972 visit, has transformed a once- hostile relationship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>On the first day of his historic visit here in 1972, President
Nixon proposed that China and the United States end their enmity and
start a "long march" together. "While we cannot close the gulf between
us," he said, "we can try to bridge it so that we may be able to talk
across it."</LD>
<LD>   Exactly 30 years to the day later, President Bush became the sixth
U.S. president to visit the Chinese capital, where he proclaimed Thursday
that relations are now "mature, respectful and important" not only to
both nations but also to the world.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the president's words barely described the impact of that 30-year
march--or the success of the U.S. policy of engagement.</LD>
<TE>   When Nixon visited Feb. 21, 1972, China was an isolated dictatorship.
The government tightly controlled everything from how people dressed--in
dreary Mao jackets--to what jobs they could take to the menstrual cycles
of women, a senior State Department official recalled recently. And only
two hotels put up the few foreigners, mainly other Communists, who were
granted visas to China.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Impact Evident</TE>
<TE>   When Bush arrived Thursday, the "gulf" had been narrowed to the point
that the state-run China Daily reported on a new subdivision called
Orange County that blends U.S. and Chinese architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about 80% of officials at the vice ministerial level have spent
at least six months abroad, most of it in the United States. A pink
Baskin-Robbins sign in Chinese is just one of dozens of familiar American
logos on Beijing streets. The gleaming towers of Marriott, Sheraton,
Hilton and other Western hotels cater to the tens of thousands of
businesspeople and tourists who visit here annually. And the Chinese have
some freedoms, from what they wear to the election of village
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very different kind of relationship, which has moved from a
state of open animosity and direct or indirect conflict in Korea and
Vietnam to a point where we share common views about strategic threats
like terrorism," said Bates Gill, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. "The change is really remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese President Jiang Zemin summed up the change at a news
conference with Bush on Thursday. "China and the United States now have
more rather than less shared interests," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not even mentioned here was the forced landing in China of an EP-3 spy
plane last April, in which the U.S. crew was held on Hainan island for 11
days before being allowed to leave. Nor did either side make an issue of
the fact that they haven't yet sorted out the disputed costs of that
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to bounce back so quickly shows how far we've both come,"
said a Bush administration specialist in China, who asked to remain
anonymous. "It hasn't affected the core relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Much is still deeply contentious between the world's most powerful
democracy and the world's most powerful Communist state. Nixon's words
still have a haunting truth, U.S. analysts caution.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has failed to win a key agreement on curbing weapons
proliferation, the top priority in talks with Chinese leaders and a basic
tenet of his foreign policy. And serious disagreements remain over
Taiwan, human rights, religious freedom, missile defense and possible
military action against Iraq. Commerce rather than a common vision has
marked the relationship during the past decade, since the Soviet Union's
demise removed the original reason for cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic interests are the driving force in Sino-U.S. relations and a
vital element that both sides have to take into consideration when
handling bilateral issues," Zhu Shida of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences said in the China Daily on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what started out as an uneasy marriage of political convenience
between the two nations has been transformed into a relationship that
includes $100 billion in annual trade, intelligence-sharing on terrorist
threats and cooperation in defusing regional tensions, most recently
between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "A candid, constructive and cooperative relationship is what we are
building with China--candid where we disagree, constructive where we can
see some daylight, and cooperative where we have common regional or
global interests," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in Senate
testimony this month.</TE>
<TE>Analysts Praise Policy</TE>
<TE>   U.S. analysts both inside and outside government credit American
foreign policy under both Republicans and Democrats--and the strategic
decision to engage China rather than confront it--for much of China's
transformation. Several rank Washington's China policy as one of its most
successful strategies of recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been "fundamentally important in fostering
China's steady reform and opening process," Gill said. Washington has
also played a pivotal role in helping integrate China into major
international organizations--on the condition that Beijing accept the
international rules and standards of each body.</TE>
<TE>   And it has nudged, prodded and pushed China into reversing course on
proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons. Beijing once advocated
nuclear weapons for developing nations as a way of breaking the
"hegemonic nuclear monopoly" of the superpowers, Gill said. "But today it
understands that nuclear proliferation is not a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   The one irony, both U.S. and Chinese analysts noted, is that the
anniversary of the Nixon visit launching the policy of engagement was
marked just as the United States appears to be backing away from
engagement as a means to encourage change elsewhere in the world. The
Bush administration has instead declared its intent to confront Iraq,
Iran and North Korea--labeled by the president an "axis of evil"--and
other "evildoers."</TE>

<HD>A High Interest in Low-Profile Official</HD>
<DH>China: The U.S. is eager to take the measure of Hu Jintao, who made
a quiet but meteoric rise to become President Jiang's heir apparent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>He's the man who launched a thousand puns, virtually all of them
the same, by writers who play on his surname by asking: "Hu's on first?"</LD>
<LD>   The man they're referring to is Hu Jintao, China's vice president, and
by all accounts, he is indeed on first, waiting in the wings to succeed
President Jiang Zemin as the man leading this nation of 1.3 billion
people.</LD>
<LD>   By spring next year, Hu is expected to be installed as both China's
president and the secretary-general of the ruling Communist Party, the
culmination of a quiet but meteoric ascent through the ranks from lowly
apparatchik to the country's No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Today, President Bush became the first U.S. official to meet Jiang's
heir apparent. Now No. 5 in China's political hierarchy, Hu introduced
Bush this morning to an audience of students at his alma mater, Qinghua
University in Beijing, where the U.S. president delivered a nationally
televised speech.</TE>
<TE>   The encounter between the two men was brief but nonetheless welcome
for U.S. officials, who have been eager for face time with Hu since his
status as presumptive heir began to crystallize in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   At 59 the youngest member of China's inner circle, Hu could be at the
helm of the world's most populous country well into the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his rising star, however, Hu has managed to remain an
international man of mystery, something of a cipher even to his
compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond some well-rehearsed details of his political career--and the
fact that he is supposed to be a polished dancer and have a
near-photographic memory--few people know much about him or what he
thinks about some of the most pressing issues facing China, from economic
policy to religious freedom to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are left to glean clues from his tenure as the top man in
Tibet a decade ago, his leadership of poverty-stricken Guizhou province
and his present stewardship of the Central Party School in Beijing, where
cadres receive ideological and practical training.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, experts say, Hu's low profile is deliberate, part and
parcel of Chinese political protocol, in which upstaging a more senior
leader can be a serious offense.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unwise for Hu Jintao to be in the spotlight too much or
to express his opinions too openly while his boss, Jiang Zemin, is still
in charge," said Cheng Li, a professor at Hamilton College in New York,
who has written a book about the coming shift in power in China. "Now it
is still the Jiang administration; it should be Jiang's show. It will be
Hu's show when he officially takes over."</TE>
<TE>   As vice president since 1998, Hu's most visible moment came in May
1999, during one of the most tense periods in U.S.-China relations in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Violent street protests had erupted after U.S.-led North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing was under siege. Hu
became the public face of the government, the Politburo member who went
before the cameras to say that the desire to protest was understandable
but that such activities should be conducted "in accordance with the
law."</TE>
<TE>   The statement underlined what some see as the main thread running
through Hu's career: loyalty to the Communist Party and its iron grip on
China.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't herald what others thought might be a lasting grudge toward
the West in general and the United States in particular. Last month, in a
meeting with a handful of U.S. academics and retired diplomats, Hu
stressed the need for better relations between Washington and Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   His expected elevation to the top job next year will come while Bush
is only halfway through his own term, ensuring that they will have to
deal with each other for at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   The two men are fairly close in age but worlds apart in their life
experiences.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, not long graduated from Qinghua with a degree in
engineering, Hu was shipped off to Gansu, a landlocked, dirt-poor
province deep in the Chinese interior where he spent more than a decade
as a construction official during the upheaval of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   He managed to attach himself to an influential patron and rose through
the 1980s to top positions in the provincial and then national Communist
Youth League, which remains his biggest power base.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, he became the country's youngest provincial party secretary,
assigned to Guizhou province in the south. And from 1988 to 1992, he was
the party boss of Tibet, where he made his name by imposing martial law
in 1989 to quell pro-independence protests. The crackdown succeeded, and
in 1992, Hu joined the party's Central Committee, or Politburo.</TE>
<TE>   His resume shows experience in a wide range of areas, from party
affairs to ethnic minority issues in Tibet. But glaringly lacking,
analysts say, is experience managing China's growing economy, of
paramount importance now that the country has entered the World Trade
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   But a Western visitor who has met Hu said the Chinese vice president
projected an air of confidence and capability and was at ease discussing
a variety of issues without referring to notes.</TE>
<TE>   "One has a sense he's been preparing himself for his future
responsibilities [and] preparing himself well," said the visitor, who
asked not to be identified. "One senses that he has the ability and
self-confidence to continue the reforms."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear, however, whether those reforms might encompass changes
to China's single-party political system.</TE>
<TE>   Although the party school, under Hu's leadership, has studied European
models of social democracy and the democratic transitions of former
Communist countries, no one has suggested that this indicates Hu's own
train of thought.</TE>

<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>Less than a week after their deadliest assault, Maoist rebels
attacked a police post in the remote midwestern hills of Nepal and killed
at least 32 police officers, authorities said today. The rebel attack in
Sitalpati, west of the capital, Katmandu, began Thursday night and lasted
into this morning.</LD>
<LD>   The battle came a day after the army killed at least 48 rebels in the
Achham and Doti districts in northwestern Nepal.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians
in an attack on the Achham district headquarters and a nearby airport. It
was the deadliest attack by the rebels since their campaign to topple the
constitutional monarchy began six years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Nepal's parliament Thursday extended a state of emergency by three
months as the rebels planned a nationwide strike to celebrate the
anniversary of their insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba won the backing of his political
opponents, who had demanded his resignation after the Sunday rebel
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The government also prepared for possible violence during the general
strike, which the rebels called for today and Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Reporter Had a Flair for the Offbeat</HD>
<DH>Media: Daniel Pearl, 38, was known for his lively personality and
his quirky feature stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Pearl of the Wall Street Journal, whose death at the hands
of Pakistani kidnappers was announced by the State Department on
Thursday, was never a typical business reporter, not even in his earliest
days at the country's premier business newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   As the Journal acknowledged in a story published five days after
Pearl, 38, was kidnapped last month, "the laid-back amateur fiddler with
a reputation for forgetfulness seemed an odd addition to a newspaper with
a buttoned-down corporate image."</LD>
<LD>   But Pearl's unconventional personal ways helped give him an eye and an
ear and a feel for the unconventional in journalism.</LD>
<TE>   In a 1994 Journal article, he wrote of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, "It's a place Franz Kafka would have loved." Three years
later, he went to Iran to cover elections and wound up writing about
people in "a small town in search of a really big floor" so they could
sell the largest hand-woven carpet in the world. He also wrote about
conflicting legends surrounding the Queen of Sheba and about Russian
attempts to make caviar without killing the sturgeon that provides the
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, who had a lively personality and an offbeat sense of humor, was
popular with his peers, dating back to his school days in the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Princeton, N.J., he graduated from Birmingham High School in
Van Nuys before going to Stanford, where he majored in communications. He
also edited the quarterly Stanford Commentary and programmed music for
the campus radio station before graduating in 1985. Pearl worked on small
daily newspapers in Massachusetts before leaving the Berkshire Eagle to
join the Journal in 1990, clearly marked for journalistic stardom,
according to his early editors.</TE>
<TE>   He started in the paper's Atlanta bureau, and on an early assignment
he lost his notes and had to do all his reporting over again. But he
quickly established himself as a good reporter and writer and was
initially known for producing what the Journal calls "A-heads," offbeat,
often quirky feature stories that run in the middle of the front page.</TE>
<TE>   Among Pearl's A-heads were articles on a revolutionary "pothole
plugger," on the grounding of a 72-year-old stunt flier and on the
disappearance and, 27 years later, the mysterious reemergence of a
235-year-old Stradivarius violin.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl moved from Atlanta to the Journal's Washington bureau in 1993
and then, in 1996, he was posted to London, where he began to write about
the Middle East. While on a weekend trip to Paris two years later, he
went to a party and met his future wife, Mariane, a French citizen and
freelance journalist, whose father is Dutch and whose mother is Cuban.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl moved to the Journal's Paris bureau in 1999, and the two were
married in August that year--in a wedding with a Cuban theme, in a
chateau in Normandy, with Pearl playing his new mother-in-law's favorite
Bach violin concerto. Mariane is now seven months pregnant with their
first child.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl continued to write about the Mideast from Paris and was posted
to Bombay, India, as the Journal's South Asia bureau chief in December
2000. He learned to speak a little Urdu and a little Arabic, and while
based in Bombay he wrote frequently about medical care for poor people in
countries with AIDS epidemics, about multinational drug companies and
about tensions between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Journal editors said Pearl was both cautious and experienced in
reporting from dangerous places, and they noted that he helped draft the
paper's safety guidelines for overseas reporters. At a pre-Thanksgiving
dinner in Peshawar, Pakistan, with other correspondents, most of them
eager to go to Afghanistan, Pearl was one of the few to demur. "It's too
dangerous," he said. "I just got married, my wife is pregnant, I'm just
not going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But two months later, Pearl did go to the crime-ridden southern
Pakistani port city of Karachi to investigate possible links between a
Pakistani Islamic militant leader, Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, and
Richard C. Reid, the British national accused of trying to blow up a
transatlantic airliner in December by detonating explosives hidden in his
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was kidnapped Jan. 23 at a restaurant to which he had presumably
been lured in pursuit of his story.</TE>
<TE>   After his disappearance, both his wife and Paul Steiger, the managing
editor of the Journal, issued personal appeals for his safe return.
Similar appeals were made by the U.S. and Pakistani governments, Amnesty
International, several national and international journalism
organizations and by individuals such as former heavyweight champion
Muhammad Ali, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and Yusuf Islam,
formerly known as pop star Cat Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   A petition urging Pearl's release was signed by more than 50 foreign
correspondents and distributed to many media outlets in Pakistan by the
Committee to Protect Journalists.</TE>
<TE>   In one message, Mariane Pearl offered to exchange her life for her
husband's. In another, Steiger asked the kidnappers to communicate with
him privately, and he urged them to "view Pearl as a messenger . . .
[and] provide him with a detailed list of the issues and grievances that
are important to you" and then release him.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl often sought assignments where there was "a lack of
understanding, so he could write about it," Mariane Pearl said in an
interview on CNN a week after her husband was kidnapped. "We are in
Pakistan today . . . because we wanted to know more about the people and
write about their views and keep working on that same idea of how we're
going to create a dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's last bylined story, published Jan. 14, began:</TE>
<TE>   "Tensions between Pakistan and India showed signs of easing after
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf outlined a broad crackdown on
religious extremists operating in his country."</TE>

<HD>Army Helicopter Crashes in the Philippines; 10 Aboard</HD>
<DH>Military: Fishermen rescue three people, but a search fails to
locate more survivors.</DH>

<DL>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Army helicopter carrying 10 troops crashed at sea early
today, U.S. military officials said, resulting in the first casualties in
Southeast Asia in the expanding war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Philippine Gen. Roy Cimatu, chief of the Southern Command, said three
people were rescued, apparently by fishermen, and the bodies of three
others were recovered.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. military planes and Philippine vessels were searching the
shark-infested waters in the southern Philippines where the helicopter
went down, but by midmorning Philippine coast guard Lt. Arnold Valino
reported that were no signs at the crash site of the wreckage or any more
survivors.</LD>
<TE>   Before the crash, the MH-47 Chinook had just finished ferrying dozens
of Special Forces troops to the island of Basilan, where they are
assisting and training Philippine troops combating the Abu Sayyaf, an
Islamic rebel group whose hostages include two American missionaries.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what caused the crash, but there were no reports of
hostile fire, the Pentagon and Philippine military officials said.
Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Diomedio Villanueva blamed the
crash on a systems malfunction, according to television reports.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no hostilities; there was no hostile ground fire," said
Col. Danilo Servando, spokesman for the joint U.S.-Philippine exercise in
Zamboanga on Mindanao island. "It would be more of a technical problem."</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft crashed in darkness en route to Mactan air base, a
Philippine facility in the central part of the country being used by U.S.
forces in the anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter went down about 150 miles northeast of Zamboanga at
2:30 a.m., U.S. Army Maj. Cynthia Teramae told reporters here. A second
MH-47 also returning to Mactan remained in the area, joining other
aircraft and ships to conduct a search, Teramae said, fighting back
tears.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon withheld the names of the victims until relatives could
be notified. Among the dead were the Army crew and members of other
services flying as passengers, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis said in
Washington. Philippine officials said the helicopter had an eight-man
crew.</TE>
<TE>   About 660 U.S. troops are to participate in the U.S.-Philippine
exercise aimed at destroying the Abu Sayyaf on Basilan, where the group
has been holding missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham of Kansas since
May.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise, known as Balikatan, or "Shoulder to Shoulder," which is
just getting underway, is scheduled to last at least six months and could
be extended up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   About 160 Special Forces troops will operate on Basilan island,
sometimes joining Filipino troops on patrol. Another 500 U.S. support
personnel will be in nearby Zamboanga and in the central city of Cebu.
About 6,000 Philippine troops will take part in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Today's crash was the third of a U.S. military helicopter this month.
On Feb. 14, two Marines from Camp Pendleton were killed and two were
injured in a crash in the Chocolate Mountains of Imperial County during a
training maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   The UH-1N Huey helicopter crashed at the southwestern end of the
mountain range, often used for training.</TE>
<TE>   Four days earlier, a Florida Army National Guard AH-64A Apache attack
helicopter with a crew of two crashed in northern Florida while on a
training mission, killing one crew member and injuring the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Times special correspondent Jacinto reported from Zamboanga. Schrader
reported from Washington and Paddock from Jakarta, Indonesia.</TE>

<HD>Suit on Detainees' Behalf Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Ruling: A group seeking U.S. court access for Guantanamo captives
has no right to represent them, a federal judge decides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit demanding that Afghan prisoners at Guantanamo Naval Base
in Cuba be given access to U.S. courts was dismissed Thursday by a
federal judge in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz said the civil-rights advocates who
brought the habeas corpus action had no relationship with the prisoners
and therefore no right to represent them.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, he wrote, U.S. courts lack jurisdiction because the
prisoners are being held on Cuban soil over which America has no
sovereignty.</LD>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who argued the petitioners' case
before Matz on Thursday, said the ad hoc group will appeal the ruling to
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that on each of the issues raised by Judge Matz, that the law
is on our side and that we'll prevail on appeal," Chemerinsky said
outside court.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-member Coalition of Clergy, Lawyers and Professors brought the
lawsuit Jan. 20, contending that the Afghan prisoners were being held
incommunicado and were denied access to legal counsel in violation of the
U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Convention articles governing the
treatment of prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   Organized by civil-rights attorney Stephen Yagman, the coalition
includes at least 10 other lawyers, two journalists, three rabbis and a
Christian pastor.</TE>
<TE>   Named as defendants were President Bush; Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld; Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Navy
Secretary Gordon R. England; and 1,000 military personnel at Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department has denied mistreating the nearly 300 captives
of various nationalities it transported to Guantanamo, but has refused to
classify them as prisoners of war. Such a designation would sharply
curtail interrogation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Matz said he would consider only whether the coalition had a right to
sue and whether a U.S. court was empowered to decide the case.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "nothing in this ruling suggests that the captives are
entitled to no legal protection whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Matz said there are circumstances under which a third party can file a
habeas corpus petition on behalf of a prisoner who is unable to act on
his own behalf.</TE>
<TE>   That person must have a "significant relationship" with the prisoner,
Matz said. In this case, he said, the coalition appears to have no
relationship at all with any of the Guantanamo prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   He questioned why the coalition made no effort to contact any
detainees or their relatives.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Aids Hunt for Notorious Mullah</HD>
<DH>Asia: Special Forces troops and Afghans are after Dadullah, a
Taliban leader who allegedly boasted of killing thousands of prisoners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAR-E-POL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Tajik and Uzbek soldiers are fanning out across the
mountains here in search of a one-legged former Taliban mullah infamous
for meting out medieval punishments and dispatching prisoners with his
own hands.</LD>
<LD>   Aided by a contingent of U.S. Special Forces troops, the soldiers,
some on horseback, others in tanks, are searching village by village for
Mullah Dadullah, the former Taliban deputy defense minister.</LD>
<LD>   American operatives intercepted a satellite phone call earlier this
week placing the mullah about 100 miles southwest of Mazar-i-Sharif. The
area is a Tajik and Uzbek stronghold, fiercely anti-Taliban. Each morning
young recruits with AK-47s slung over their shoulders trudge across wheat
fields on the outskirts of town, past farmers standing knee-deep in icy
mud, and begin their climb into the jagged Hesar Mountains to search for
Dadullah. So far, few clues have been found.</LD>
<TE>   "He has picked a good spot," Uzbek commander Gen. Majid Rozy said
Thursday, referring to the rugged terrain. "But he is in trouble because
he can't run and he can't climb."</TE>
<TE>   Afghans call the mullah "Dadullah lang," or Dadullah the cripple,
since he hobbles on an artificial leg because of an injury from a Soviet
mine. But that hasn't made him any easier to catch. Twice he has slipped
through Uzbek hands, most recently after last fall's standoff in the
northern city of Kunduz.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most ruthless of the Taliban, Dadullah was as loathed as
any in the extremist Islamic regime.</TE>
<TE>   In Mazar-i-Sharif in October, Dadullah is said to have ordered that
five prisoners be tied to cars pointing in opposite directions. At his
command, the cars accelerated and the rope decapitated the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "It was disgusting," said Moweeb Montasser, a student.</TE>
<TE>   Dadullah, thought to be about 40, bragged of killing thousands of
prisoners himself, sometimes slitting their throats, Afghans say. He
presided over public punishments in soccer stadiums, where doctors
amputated the hands of thieves and adulterers were stoned. As a military
commander, his signature tactic was to burn entire villages and slaughter
civilians suspected of colluding with anti-Taliban forces.</TE>
<TE>   "The way of the soldier, the name of Islam, nothing can justify what
Dadullah did," said Abdul Rahoul Azizi, deputy governor of Sar-e-Pol
province.</TE>
<TE>   How such a notorious mullah got away is still a subject of great
intrigue. Dadullah was the Taliban commander in Kunduz, one of the last
Taliban redoubts to surrender in November after thousands of Taliban and
Al Qaeda fighters vowed to battle to the death.</TE>
<TE>   But under terms worked out by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek
warlord and one of the leading Northern Alliance figures, Dadullah and
Afghan soldiers were allowed safe passage from Kunduz to Balkh, a city
near Mazar-i-Sharif. In exchange, Dadullah turned over 2,000 Arab,
Pakistani and Chechen fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Dadullah chose Balkh as a refuge because the city is one of the few in
the area with a community of Pushtuns, his ethnic group and that of most
Taliban leaders. He was supposed to be under guard once he arrived but
soon disappeared. Officials with Tajik and Uzbek factions, the two main
groups of the Northern Alliance, blame each other. They have also accused
local Pushtuns of helping hide the mullah.</TE>
<TE>   This was his second escape. Two years ago, after an intense battle in
northern Afghanistan, Dadullah was captured along with 2,000 Taliban
troops, said Northern Alliance commander Yar Mohammed. But after Uzbek
soldiers took his prosthetic leg, the mullah slithered under a pickup
truck and hid until he was eventually released with rank-and-file troops.
"It was a mistake," Mohammed said. "We didn't know who he was."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, U.S. Special Forces troops picked up a satellite phone call
made from the mountains near Sar-e-Pol and identified Dadullah through
voice-recognition technology, said Gen. Abdul Hak Sakra, commander of
Uzbek forces in the region. Maj. Martin Rose, a U.S. Army spokesman in
Mazar-i-Sharif, confirmed that a search for Dadullah was underway in
Sar-e-Pol but declined to discuss the role of American forces.</TE>
<TE>   Tajik and Uzbek commanders volunteered their best horsemen, who
ascended the mountains with six American soldiers, also on horseback,
several Afghan generals said. The group has searched from village to
village, hut to hut, sleeping in caves along the way, weathering
snowstorms and feeding their horses hay hauled up the mountainside on the
backs of shivering donkeys.</TE>
<TE>   The horsemen were said to be supported by tanks and nearly 3,500
troops in the valleys below, along with American reconnaissance planes.</TE>
<TE>   So far the search party hasn't found any sign of Dadullah, and
villagers in the area say they haven't seen him.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Americans insist he was here, so we will keep looking,"
Mohammed said Thursday. In addition to icy, forbidding terrain, the
search parties must navigate local politics. The area is sprinkled with
villages whose loyalties are divided between Uzbek and Tajik factions.
Just five months ago, the two groups joined sides to overthrow the
Taliban. But in the last several weeks they have clashed over turf and
killed each other's soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tajiks won't let us search their villages," said Sakra, the Uzbek
commander.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Mullah Nurradin, a Tajik commander in Sar-e-Pol, denied that and
said Uzbek leaders were using the manhunt as an excuse to flood the area
with Uzbek troops. "They want to push us out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities here believe that Dadullah, along with a small contingent
of soldiers who may be carrying him, is headed for the North-West
Frontier province of Pakistan, where some believe that Osama bin Laden
and former Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar are hiding.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a top priority to catch Dadullah," said Osman Khan, security
director for the Sar-e-Pol area. "We know this man. We have lived under
him. If he gets away, he will be a virus wherever he lands."</TE>

<LD>An unspecified threat against the Liberty Bell prompted authorities
to tighten security in Philadelphia's popular historic district.</LD>
<LD>   The National Park Service and city police added patrols at the
Independence National Historic Park, which includes the Liberty Bell
pavilion and Independence Hall, and nearby federal properties including
the U.S. Mint and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Park
facilities remained open.</LD>
<LD>   "We got information from our headquarters in Washington that there's
an unspecified threat to destroy the Liberty Bell," said FBI special
agent Linda Vizi.</LD>
<TE>   The bell was attacked last April by a mentally disturbed man wielding
a metal mallet. He told authorities that his act was intended to glorify

<LD>The murder trial of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel will be held in
Norwalk because a new courthouse in Stamford will not be ready, court
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John Kavanewsky Jr. had ordered jury selection to
begin April 2.</LD>
<LD>   Court spokeswoman Rhonda Stearley-Hebert said that Norwalk was the
best location to accommodate the families of Skakel, 41, and the victim,
Martha Moxley, as well as the nearly 50 media organizations planning to
cover the trial.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel, a nephew of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, has pleaded not
guilty to killing Moxley with a golf club in 1975.</TE>

<HD>Death Camp Suspect Loses His Citizenship</HD>
<DH>War crimes: John Demjanjuk, 81, again faces deportation. New
evidence shows he was a Nazi guard, judge rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A quarter-century after prosecutors first accused him of being a
Nazi death camp guard, retired Cleveland auto worker John Demjanjuk was
stripped of his U.S. citizenship Thursday by a federal judge who
concluded that the 81-year-old Ukrainian native concealed his wartime
activities when he immigrated to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Eyewitness accounts, along with recently unearthed documents that
include a Nazi identification card, photographs and handwriting samples,
show "unequivocally" that Demjanjuk was a guard at Nazi concentration
camps where hundreds of thousands of Jews were systematically murdered,
Paul Matia, chief judge in U.S. District Court in Cleveland, ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The decision puts the U.S. government one key step closer to deporting
Demjanjuk to Europe for the second time in a case fraught with
contradiction and emotion.</LD>
<TE>   Demjanjuk's citizenship was first revoked in 1981, after U.S.
authorities became convinced in a years-long probe that he was the
infamous Nazi guard "Ivan the Terrible." He was then extradited to
Israel, put on trial and sentenced to death for crimes against humanity,
only to be freed and allowed to return to his family in Cleveland in 1993
after officials determined they had the wrong man.</TE>
<TE>   Demjanjuk regained his U.S. citizenship in 1998 when Matia, citing
criticism of government lawyers by an appellate court panel, said the
lawyers had acted "with reckless disregard for their duty to the court"
by withholding evidence in 1981 that could have helped Demjanjuk's
attorneys. Matia restored Demjanjuk's citizenship but said he would allow
the Justice Department to reinstitute denaturalization proceedings based
on other evidence.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say that, although Demjanjuk may not have been Ivan the
Terrible, they are confident that he was a guard at four Nazi camps in
1942 and 1943, including the Sobibor camp in Poland, which Justice
Department official Eli Rosenbaum said Thursday was "as close an
approximation of hell as has ever been created on this planet."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged in presenting their case before Matia last spring
that Demjanjuk and other guards at Sobibor pushed Jews with rifle butts
and hit them as they were loaded off freight trains at the camp, then
later escorted them to their deaths in the gas chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Demjanjuk's family vowed to appeal Thursday's decision. He remains
free in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried our case and continue to believe the government is wrong. We
most respectfully believe that Judge Matia has made serious factual and
legal errors in his opinion," said Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law and
the family's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that judges have ruled against us in the past and public
opinion has been against us in the past," he said. "Nevertheless, we have
proven them wrong before and have been vindicated. We will appeal and
will prove them wrong once again."</TE>
<TE>   Although the details of his story have shifted repeatedly since
accusations were first leveled against him in 1977, Demjanjuk has
steadfastly denied that he was ever a guard at a concentration camp.
Demjanjuk, who was raised on a farm in Ukraine, says the Germans held him
in two POW camps after he was captured during the war and then sent him
to fight his former army, the Soviets, with a band of other Ukrainians in
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   "What is written here, how could it be me?" Demjanjuk said in one
deposition about the charges against him. He did not testify at his trial
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Matia said he did not believe Demjanjuk's explanations about where he
was and what he did during the war. In a 93-page opinion, the judge cited
extensive documentation, some from the Nazis' own macabre records, in
concluding that Demjanjuk was guard No. 1393 at Nazi camps in Trawniki,
Sobibor, Majdanek and Flossenburg.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has shown by clear, convincing and unequivocal
evidence that the defendant assisted in the persecution of civilian
populations during World War II," Matia wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the judge said that Demjanjuk was a "willing" participant in
the death camps, "as he was paid, he was eligible for leave and benefits,
and there is no evidence he sought to desert or flee."</TE>
<TE>   Based on these findings, Matia concluded that Demjanjuk had lied about
his past and concealed his Nazi involvement when he sought to enter the
United States after World War II. He immigrated to the United States in
1952 and became a naturalized citizen in 1958, raising a family in
Cleveland and working at a Ford auto plant. Matia said that had
Demjanjuk's true past been known, he would never have been allowed into
the country.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they were gratified that their relentless pursuit
of Demjanjuk might finally pay off.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the ruling] is a vindication of the Justice Department's
eager pursuit of anybody who came into this country under false
pretenses, having served the Nazis in any capacity, as a guard or
otherwise," said Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff.</TE>
<TE>   But officials acknowledged that with Demjanjuk's family vowing an
appeal, it could be years before he is deported.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, they're not taking him to the airport yet. It's a long
way to go," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Los
Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, which has been active in the
Demjanjuk case for years. "I must say John Demjanjuk has the luck of the
Irish. He's avoided the bar of justice for decades."</TE>
<TE>   The 1979 law authorizing the creation of the Justice Department's Nazi
war-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, allows the U.S.
government to deport Nazis but not try them for war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   No country has yet come forward to seek Demjanjuk's extradition, but
Hier said the Wiesenthal Center will now push to have Demjanjuk deported
to Russia, Poland or Israel to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling "is more a slap on the wrist than something real,"
Hier said. "Yes, he's going to give up a precious document--his
citizenship--but he has not yet paid for his crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Demjanjuk is the 67th U.S. citizen to be denaturalized as a result of
the work of the Nazi-hunting unit, with 54 people having been removed
from the country.</TE>

<HD>New Competition at Salt Lake Dailies</HD>
<DH>Newspapers: Owned by the Mormon Church, the No. 2 Deseret News sees
the Games as its chance to add respect and readers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The editor of the Deseret News, in a commentary on the eve of the
Winter Olympics, explained what he believes sets Mormons apart:</LD>
<LD>   "What the visitors are finding among the Mormons are kind and helpful
people, devoutly religious, whose moral principles make them an
anachronism in today's hedonistic society."</LD>
<LD>   If Mormons are an anachronism, then so too is the Deseret News itself,
singular in today's newspaper society for unabashedly embracing Mormon
values.</LD>
<TE>   The general circulation paper is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, yet it chronically struggles for respect and
acceptance even in a state that is 70% Mormon. It fights the
reputation--deserved or not--that it is an editorial mouthpiece for the
Mormon Church and spins its news accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   It is an afternoon newspaper that sells about 68,500 copies a day,
half that of the city's morning, secular newspaper, the Salt Lake
Tribune. It finds itself in only about 20% of the homes in the
metropolitan area from Ogden in the north to Provo in the south.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't take it because it's too slanted to the LDS church," said
Elizabeth Green, 57, a former president of a Mormon women's church group.
"The Tribune is more worldly. It's nice to see the other side of things."</TE>
<TE>   Connie Manwill, 63, a retired teacher who also is active in the
church, agreed. "The Deseret News is a bit too rigid for us. I prefer a
paper that's not slanted toward my church. We read stories in the Tribune
that wouldn't be in the Deseret News."</TE>
<TE>   Other Mormons say they take the paper only because its Saturday
edition includes a separate tabloid containing strictly church news.</TE>
<TE>   "If the paper were to allow readers to subscribe only to the Saturday
edition, they'd lose half their circulation for the rest of the week,"
said Andrew Day, 65, a retired investor and former president of an
overseas church mission.</TE>
<TE>   Its editor of five years, John Hughes, vigorously defends the paper,
noting that church President Gordon B. Hinckley wants the paper "to reach
all sections of the community--all religious groups, all ethnicities."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, editorials are first vetted by church officials, and they
predictably weigh in on behalf of sobriety, fidelity, family and other
quintessential Mormon values.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with that," Hughes said of the church's
oversight on editorials. "After all, they own the place."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, news coverage is weighed against moral standards. Recently, the
paper chose the most modest photograph of singing star Britney Spears so
as to not offend readers with too much bared skin.</TE>
<TE>   "We still got letters on that," Hughes said. "And I wrote a letter
back, explaining that we have youthful readers too--and that the picture
we published was the least offensive."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes previously was editor of the Christian Science Monitor, another
general circulation newspaper owned by a church. A Christian Scientist,
Hughes is the first non-Mormon to serve as editor of the Deseret News
since its founding in 1850.</TE>
<TE>   He initially was hired as a consultant on how to improve the paper's
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Among his first missions: to persuade reporters--about a third, he
estimated, who are active Mormons--to pursue stories that they might have
avoided for fear of stepping on church toes.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper's city hall reporter, Diane Ubani, said she arrived at
the paper nearly two years ago believing some issues would be taboo--but
found otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   She has written about the distribution of 250,000 condoms in Salt Lake
City during the Olympics and about a lesbian couple wanting to adopt a
child.</TE>
<TE>   "I hardly think the Mormon Church supports lesbian lifestyles," she
said. "But if the church was censoring the news, that story wouldn't have
run on Page 1."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly his point, Hughes said. "We need to eliminate the perception
that the paper is covering news through a Mormon Church filter. There's
no magic formula in accomplishing that. We have to show, through editing
and story selection, day in and day out, week over week, that we're a
credible newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   The paper no longer seems to publish spoon-fed church news, said Jim
Fisher, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah
and a former Tribune employee.</TE>
<TE>   "When the church would send out press releases, we used to see it the
next day in the Deseret News, verbatim, on the front page or the front of
the metro section," Fisher said. "They've quit doing that. But they still
treat church issues with kid gloves."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hughes' efforts, the News still stands accused of either
ignoring or downplaying stories that reflect poorly on church affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Salt Lake Tribune reported on how the church--and Gov.
Mike Leavitt, a Mormon--tried to cover up the role of Mormon militiamen
in the 1857 ambush killings of 120 Arkansas emigrants traveling through
southern Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Skulls, unwittingly excavated in 1999 as the site was prepared for a
church memorial, showed that the victims had been shot at close range,
implicating the armed Mormons--along with Indians--in the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune reported how Leavitt and church officials attempted to
have the bones reburied without examination in order to spare the church
embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   The Deseret News previously had reported that the California-bound
travelers, including women and children, had been murdered by Mormons
"for inexplicable reasons" but did not report the recent Mormon-driven
efforts to rebury the bones before they could be fully analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have them on credibility, on any story involving the Mormon
Church," Tribune Editor James E. Shelledy said. "They're very deferential
toward their church."</TE>
<TE>   The News, critics say, also gives short shrift to other topics
sensitive to the church, including polygamy, incest and welfare fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said his paper dodges nothing and that his competitor is guilty
of sniping at the church unnecessarily.</TE>
<TE>   While both newspapers reported the Olympic bidding scandal, Fisher
said the News underreported the "hypocrisy angle--that Mormons were
involved in the scandal" by plying Olympic organizers with money and
other gifts to win the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, who studies both newspapers, said the Tribune is the more
aggressive because it has little to lose--and the News has little to
gain.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no outrageous pressure at the News to push any envelopes,
rock any boats," he said. "That's part of the church culture, to not be
confrontational. The Tribune does rock the apple cart, though, and since
it's the paper of record, Mormon politicians have to suffer the Tribune."</TE>
<TE>   The News does not disclose in the paper that it is owned by the
church; its masthead reads, "Utah's locally owned daily newspaper." The
Tribune calls itself "Utah's independent voice since 1871."</TE>
<TE>   During the Games, the News is printing about 40,000 morning copies for
news rack sales and hopes to become a morning publication to build
circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts are stymied, however, by a convoluted and nasty lawsuit.
The two newspapers are partners in an agreement to share production,
advertising and circulation functions. Control of the Newspaper Agency
Corp., however, rests with the Tribune, which last year was sold by AT&amp;T
to MediaNews Group Inc., a Denver newspaper conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune managers sued to block the sale, which they say was
orchestrated with the blessing of the News in the hope of befriending the
new owners. That sale, attorneys for the Tribune managers say, violates
their option to buy back the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute remains unresolved in federal court and has for now
thwarted the News' efforts to publish in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go head-to-head with the Tribune," Hughes said. "We need
to get more people to pick up our paper. A lot of people haven't read us
for years and are operating on old assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   "But we know that there are people in this town who will never, ever
pick up the Deseret News."</TE>

<LD>Prospects for final congressional passage of campaign finance
legislation received a major boost Thursday when Sen. Gordon Smith
(R-Ore.) indicated he will oppose any filibuster by opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the bill said Smith could provide the 60th vote they
need to overcome any stalling tactics on the measure that is designed to
limit the influence of money in politics. The situation was still fluid,
with both sides hoping to attract undecided votes.</LD>
<LD>   The bill passed the House last week, and Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) has said he hopes to win quick passage when the Senate
reconvenes next week.</LD>

<HD>High False-Positives, Experts Say of Tests</HD>

<LD>Mammograms are a test with important limitations, and those limits
are especially pronounced for women in their 40s--exactly the group for
whom Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson is now urging
screenings at least every two years.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, medical experts say, mammograms have a high rate of
anxiety-provoking false-positives. In those cases, the test detects a
suspicious lesion that later turns out to be benign.</LD>
<LD>   "For every 100 women that have an abnormality, only 20 of them will
have cancer," said Dr. Melvin J. Silverstein, professor of surgery and
director of the Breast Center at the USC/Norris Cancer Center.</LD>
<TE>   The large number of false-positive readings is a key factor in the
debate over the usefulness of mammograms. The high rate of
false-positives means that many women are subjected to biopsies and other
forms of exploratory surgery that are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   That would seem a cost worth paying if early detection of tumors
clearly lead to more effective treatments. But, critics of mammograms
say, the record is not so clear. In many cases, they argue, the most
dangerous tumors simply cannot effectively be treated regardless of when
they are found.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the equation, while mammography often uncovers
tumors when they are small, the test only spots breast abnormalities 80%
to 90% of the time, which means 10% of tumors are missed. "There are some
types of breast cancers that can't be picked up by routine screenings,"
said Dr. Lawrence Bassett, director of the Iris Cantor Center for Breast
Imaging at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.</TE>
<TE>   In younger women, because their breast tissue is relatively dense,
detection rates are even lower, and mammograms can miss up to one-quarter
of tumors or early-stage cancers, which usually show up as white
calcification spots on an X-ray.</TE>
<TE>   On a mammogram, fatty tissue looks black, and everything else--glands,
tissue, tumors--looks white and stands out in stark contrast. But denser
tissue appears darker in a mammogram, so abnormalities don't show up as
clearly.</TE>
<TE>   Cancers in younger women tend to be more aggressive, which makes
earlier detection even more crucial. Because of the test's limitations,
doctors and breast cancer activists worry women will get lulled into a
false sense of security if they get a clean bill of health from a
mammogram. Consequently, the American Cancer Society recommends use of
three tests for breast cancer detection in women with no symptoms:
mammography, a monthly self-examination and a thorough breast exam at
least once a year by a physician or other health-care professional.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do a better job of educating women about what mammograms
can and cannot do," said Judy Perotti, director of patient services for
Y-Me National Breast Cancer Organization in Chicago. "We need to have
more realistic expectations."</TE>

<HD>Former Priest Gets Maximum Sentence for Molesting Boy</HD>
<DH>Scandal: A Boston case has led to widespread allegations of child
sexual abuse within the Catholic church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>An angry judge on Thursday sentenced defrocked Roman Catholic
priest John Geoghan to a maximum sentence of nine to 10 years in prison
for molesting a 10-year-old boy at a community swimming pool in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   "This defendant hid behind his collar and in the safety and sanctity
of the Roman Catholic Church," Judge Sandra Hamlin declared during a
25-minute explanation of how she reached her decision. "He engaged in
what this court can only characterize as reprehensible and depraved
behavior."</LD>
<LD>   The trial and conviction of the slight, graying ex-priest unleashed a
pedophilia scandal that has rocked the Boston Archdiocese and the heavily
Catholic population of Massachusetts. Disclosures that church officials
knew about Geoghan and other allegedly abusive priests prompted many in
Boston to call for the resignation of Cardinal Bernard F. Law, the most
senior Catholic prelate in America.</LD>
<TE>   While protesters picketed Law's residence in Boston, the uproar spread
to parishes throughout New England--and indeed, across the country.
Hundreds of adult men and women came forth to charge that they were
abused by priests as children. In many regions, priests were summarily
removed from their duties in response.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan, 66, will face additional, more serious criminal charges in
two pending cases. More than 130 people have accused Geoghan of molesting
them during his 30 years as a priest. In addition, more than 80 civil
suits stemming from sexual abuse allegations are pending against him.</TE>
<TE>   At least two civil suits have been filed against Law as a result of
information obtained during this first case against Geoghan. While
acknowledging that the church knowingly moved priests charged with
pedophilia to assignments where they would have contact with children,
Law has insisted repeatedly that he will not step down.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the Geoghan trial, documents were unsealed by court
order showing that over the last decade, the archdiocese has settled
child sex abuse claims against at least 70 priests. The diocese
reportedly has paid out more than $10 million in child sexual abuse
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the Geoghan case, the church has provided police with
the names of up to 80 priests accused over the last 40 years of molesting
children.</TE>
<TE>   Around New England, priests and parishioners alike have gathered for
"listening sessions" where the faithful vent anger and frustration about
the growing controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In issuing her sentence, Hamlin pointedly faulted Geoghan for failing
to take responsibility for his actions. She also criticized the former
priest for failing to show remorse for the anguish he caused his victim.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly troubling and of great concern for the court is that the
common thread running through the defendant's statements is that he
blames the victim and minimizes his conduct," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, now a 20-year-old college student, said in court Thursday
that he felt "nauseous" because Geoghan appeared so emotionless during
the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I need an expert opinion to tell me . . . that this
defendant is a serious danger to any preadolescent he comes in contact
with," Hamlin added.</TE>
<TE>   The judge was careful to tell the court that she was punishing Geoghan
for his deeds in this case only--not for pending charges or for the
firestorm the case has produced.</TE>
<TE>   "This defendant is not going to be punished for other priests or for
what the church may or may not have done," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, defense attorney Geoffrey Packard wasted no time in
pronouncing the sentence "draconian."</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan's sentence exceeded state guidelines for the charges, which
recommend a term of one to three years.</TE>
<TE>   Hamlin suspended all but six years of Geoghan's sentence. He will
remain on probation for life when released.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan's attorney argued that conflicting testimony from the victim
and his mother cast sufficient doubt on the charges against Geoghan to
justify an acquittal.</TE>

<HD>Where's the Mayor? In N.Y., There's No Telling</HD>
<DH>Privacy: Bloomberg says people don't have to know when he leaves
the city. But it doesn't quell public curiosity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>It's the City Hall version of "Where's Waldo?"</LD>
<LD>   After Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg disappeared from public view over the
Presidents' Day weekend without announcing his whereabouts, reporters
used to keeping close tabs on New York's chief executive fidgeted.</LD>
<LD>   The tabloid New York Post even ran a picture of Bloomberg on a milk
carton with his description and the headline "Have You Seen Me?"</LD>
<TE>   When he returned looking tanned and rested, Bloomberg--formerly a
billionaire businessman with no political background who was used to
controlling his privacy--was mum on his destination, declaring: "My
personal life is my personal life."</TE>
<TE>   People don't have the right to know when he departs the city, the
mayor stressed, as long as proper procedures are followed. He designated
Marc V. Shaw, who is the first deputy mayor, to temporarily run the city.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg emphasized that he was always reachable and that he would
not micromanage his office.</TE>
<TE>   But his remarks failed to quell the debate, and New Yorkers'
curiosity, about where he spent the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is the secrecy and misplaced assertion of privacy by the
mayor," said the New York Times in an editorial. "Mr. Bloomberg deserves
his long weekends away from the hubbub of the city, but New Yorkers
deserve to know where the mayor is headed, even if they can't watch him
at rest.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers shouldn't have to play a guessing game to determine if
the mayor is away," the newspaper lectured.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the mayor is required to notify the City Council
president whenever he leaves the city, during which time the council
president becomes acting mayor. If the mayor leaves on a private trip,
his office often doesn't announce it but will reveal his destination if
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch disagrees that a mayor always has
to reveal his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all a tempest in the eye of a needle," said Koch, who
occupied that office from 1978 to 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Koch said that Bloomberg had by executive order properly designated
Shaw, who presumably knew how to reach the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't these people know we have cell phones today?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Bloomberg was golfing in Bermuda, where he owns an
estate.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States is basking in record warm weather this winter.</LD>
<LD>   The national average temperature was 39.94 degrees for November
through January, 4.3 degrees above the 1895-2001 average, said Jay
Lawrimore, chief of the Climate Monitoring Branch of the government's
National Climatic Data Center.</LD>
<LD>   The previous record for the same three-month period--39.63
degrees--was in 1999-2000. Since 1976, the nationally averaged
November-January temperature has risen at a rate of 1.2 degrees per
decade, the data center reported Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   In the November-January period, the unusual warmth stretched from
Montana to the East Coast. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Massachusetts and
Vermont had their warmest November to January, and as many as 18 states
from the Plains to the Northeast recorded their second warmest
November-January, according to the climate center, a division of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of snow cover contributed to short-term drought conditions in
the northern Plains.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the United States, worldwide temperatures were also at
record levels, the agency reported, focusing on observations recorded in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Average temperatures across land areas were the warmest on record, or
2.43 degrees above the long-term January average. Ocean temperatures
ranked as the third warmest, or 0.74 degrees above the 1880-2000 mean.</TE>

<HD>Yates Sobs as Jury Sees Photos of Dead Children</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Forced to stare at photographs of five drowned children on
Thursday, members of the mostly female jury at Andrea Pia Yates' murder
trial rocked in their seats, chewed their lips and gulped visibly. A few
brushed away tears or pressed clenched fists to their mouths.</LD>
<LD>   As one macabre image after the next flickered onto a looming screen,
Yates slumped into her chair and shuddered with sobs. The 37-year-old
mother has confessed to systematically drowning her children in the
bathtub last summer. She has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</LD>
<LD>   Except for the muted weeping of witnesses, the courtroom was silent as
prosecutors showed the jury a series of photographs and a video shot by
detectives the afternoon of June 20, just hours after the children were
killed.</LD>
<TE>   The four youngest children were found curled together on their
parents' bed. Yates told detectives that she had carried their dripping
bodies down the hallway one at a time and tucked them beneath a sheet.
They looked like they had tumbled into bed and fallen asleep, heads on
their parents' pillows.</TE>
<TE>   The baby, 6-month-old Mary, was snuggled into the crook of 5-year-old
John's arm--her hand limp in his. At the other end of the bed, Paul and
Luke lay side by side. When prosecutors showed a close-up shot of Paul's
face, Yates let out a jagged sob.</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall, 7-year-old Noah floated face down in the milky bath
water. It was hard to kill Noah, his mother had told detectives. He
fought the hardest and had managed to slip his head above water more than
once.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Yates will testify in his wife's defense. He spent Thursday
morning seated on a wooden bench outside the courtroom. As witnesses and
journalists emerged, red-eyed and sniffling, he looked on with interest.
"Looks like they're having a pretty rough time in there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, the jury listened to a recording of the stilted,
often monosyllabic confession that Andrea Yates made to homicide
detective Eric Mehl on the afternoon of the drownings. In a flat voice,
the mother described her morning: She woke up, ate cereal with the
children and waited for her husband to drive off to work.</TE>
<TE>   "After Rusty left, you filled the tub with water, correct?" Mehl
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   "How high did you fill it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Three inches from the top."</TE>
<TE>   "What was your intent?" Mehl asked. "What were you about to do?"</TE>
<TE>   "Drown the children," Yates replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Why were you going to drown the children?" Mehl asked.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't answer; about 15 seconds passed.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it because the children had done something?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Yates said.</TE>
<TE>   "You weren't mad at the children?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   Yates told Mehl that she had been thinking of drowning the children
for two years. "Probably since I realized I had not been a good mother to
them," she said. "They weren't developing correctly."</TE>
<TE>   She had shoved them all into the water: First Paul, 3, then Luke, 2,
followed by John. Then she lifted a sobbing Mary from her carrier and
lowered her into the tub. "What's the matter with Mary?" Noah asked when
he entered the bathroom. His mother held him underwater while his baby
sister floated alongside, she told detectives. Then she carried Mary down
the hall to join her dead brothers.</TE>
<TE>   While prosecutors delved into the grisly slayings, Yates' lawyers
pointed out the domestic details of the household: the photographs on the
refrigerator, a football dropped in the hall, rubber ducks scattered in
the bathroom. "Bunk beds, toys," Wendell Odom said. "Looks like boys,
doesn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Weren't those five bodies in absolute, stark contrast to everything
else you saw in that house?" Odom asked Officer Glenn West, who shot the
video of the Yates household.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer George Parnham pointed out that Yates gave short,
direct answers during her confession. A woman with a long history of
depression, psychosis and suicide attempts, Yates was too sick to string
together narrative explanations, he said. He pressed Mehl for details of
Yates' behavior. "Did she appear to be emotionless? She wasn't crying?
She wasn't wailing or moaning?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," the detective replied each time.</TE>
<TE>   Yates' lawyers are arguing that she was too delusional to know the
difference between right and wrong. If they convince the jury Yates was
insane, she likely will be sent to a mental hospital. Otherwise, she
could face life in prison or death by injection.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize that it's time to be punished," Yates told Mehl in the
confession played Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "How did you see drowning your children as a way to be punished?"
Silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you want the criminal justice system to punish you or did you . .
."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Yates interrupted.</TE>

<HD>Despite Court's Ruling, 'Era of the Screaming Headline Docudrama Is
Behind Us'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although victims' rights advocates say the California Supreme Court
decision Thursday clears the way for criminals to profit from their
stories by selling the book, TV or film rights, representatives from
Hollywood and the publishing community say the ruling comes a bit late to
benefit offenders as fully as it might have years before.</LD>
<LD>   Producers and agents say the appetite for dramatic "ripped from the
headlines" productions has greatly diminished since its hey-day in the
mid-1990s, when TV viewers could choose from three made-for-TV movies all
based on the case of "Long Island Lolita" Amy Fisher, as well as
competing Fox and CBS productions regarding the Menendez brothers.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, industry officials say, round-the-clock television
news coverage of high-profile trials on cable channels, such as Court TV,
and prime-time newsmagazines have largely supplanted dramatized accounts
of true crimes.</LD>
<TE>   "These stories don't necessarily create projects the way they used
to," said Patrick Faulstich, a former movie and TV executive who founded
the literary management company Accurate Representation. "I think the era
of the screaming headline docudrama is behind us in the network movie
business. The category was subsumed by the 24-hour news service. If
there's a big story out there, there'll be thousands of hours of coverage
on Court TV, on MSNBC, on CNN. Also, the '20/20s' and multiple
installments of '60 Minutes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Even as industry observers cite the downward trend in true-life crime
stories, producers and publishers acknowledge their discomfort with
lining criminals' pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles literary agent Mitchell Hamilburg recalls once being
approached by a convict named Nuel Emmons, who wanted to co-write a book
with his friend, convicted murderer Charles Manson.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't do it," Hamilburg said. "I just couldn't represent him. I
can't do stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press subsequently published the work, "Manson in His Own
Words."</TE>
<TE>   Other TV producers say they have done true crime projects only if the
victims benefit financially.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has come to realize in these years that it is not in their
interest to reward people for their antisocial behavior," said Lawrence
Schiller, who produced "The Executioner's Song" for NBC, a 1982 account
of Utah murderer Gary Mark Gilmore that starred Tommy Lee Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Schiller placed funds from "The Executioner's Song" into a college
trust fund for the children of Gilmore's girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Howard Braunstein also earmarked funds from his USA Network
movie about Ellie Nessler, a vigilante convicted of shooting her son's
molester in a courtroom near Yosemite, for her two children.</TE>
<TE>   "The money was for their future," Braunstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling was the high court's response to a lawsuit filed by
Frank Sinatra Jr., who tried to prevent convicted kidnapper Barry Keenan
from profiting from the screen rights about his role in Sinatra's 1963
abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia Pictures executives purchased, for $485,000, the rights to
"Snatching Sinatra" from New Times Los Angeles and Peter Gilstrap, who
wrote an article with that title in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan's attorney argued that the law violated his right to free
speech, and the court ultimately agreed. Columbia has since dropped the
project, and thus far no other major studio has expressed an interest in
acquiring it.</TE>
<TE>   Several publishers said Thursday the issue is foremost in their minds
when they consider whether to take on an imprisoned author.</TE>
<TE>   "As a book publisher, our service to the community is to provide
information," said Peter Osnos, publisher of New York-based PublicAffairs
books, which publishes works by leading public figures and journalists.
"I would never [publish a book] for somebody who was a dreadful
pedophile, but I don't think it's a good system where people are
prevented from telling their story."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Official Silence on Georgia Crematory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>A local judge late Thursday issued a gag order preventing law
enforcement officials from discussing their investigation into the
hundreds of bodies buried or stored at the Tri-State Crematory here.</LD>
<LD>   The order, signed by Walker County Superior Court Judge William Ralph
Hill Jr., came shortly after Tri-State's operator, Brent Marsh, hired a
former Georgia state lawmaker as his defense attorney. Marsh's
arraignment is scheduled for today.</LD>
<LD>   Marsh, 28, faces 16 felony counts of theft by deception. Authorities
said they intend to file dozens more charges to match the number of
corpses identified. As of Thursday, that number was 54 of the 283 remains
recovered from pits, mounds and steel vaults at the 16-acre crematory and
outside Marsh's nearby home.</LD>
<TE>   The case continues to spread, said officials. They've identified 30
funeral homes within a 200-mile radius that sent bodies for cremation to
Tri-State, and they are receiving 800 to 900 calls a day from concerned
families. An additional 100 to 150 families have shown up in person to
ask if their relatives were recovered from the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a contingent of state lawmakers toured the operation
while in Atlanta, and Gov. Roy Barnes requested federal aid to help pay
for an investigation that involves 500 employees and is expected to last
eight months. The state has paid $5 million for the first five days
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Marsh hired McCracken "Ken" Poston, a former state representative from
neighboring Catoosa County, to represent him in a case that has rocked
the community and generated intense media attention. Hill cited the
publicity, as well as his responsibility to protect Marsh's right to a
fair trial, in issuing the wide-ranging order.</TE>
<TE>   "For a trial judge to predict what information may in fact undermine
the impartiality of jurors is difficult if not impossible," Hill wrote.
"The difficulty of drafting an order that will effectively keep
prejudicial information from prospective jurors is similarly difficult
but is within the responsibility of a trial judge."</TE>
<TE>   Hill's order applies to all county and state employees engaged in the
investigation. They include the Walker County sheriff, Walker County
coroner, Walker County district attorney, Georgia medical examiner and
Georgia Bureau of Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   It prohibits them from discussing Marsh's "character or reputation" or
the identity of prospective witnesses, or from making "any personal
remarks concerning potential evidence or statements by witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   The order was delivered late Thursday by Dist. Atty. Herbert "Buzz"
Franklin, who interrupted a news briefing by state and local authorities
for the 80 reporters and photographers covering the case.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kris Sperry, the state's chief medical examiner, stopped in
mid-sentence as Franklin distributed copies of the gag order, prompting
officials to shut down the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   After reading the order, Sheriff Steve Wilson said he interpreted it
to mean he and other officials couldn't hold news briefings. Reached at
home, Hill declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Read the order. . . . I don't have anything further to say. You have
a good day," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Aide Tells of Work on Traficant's Farm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>A former staff member for Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio)
testified Thursday that most of the work he did while on the
congressional payroll was at Traficant's horse farm.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Rovnak said he was hired in 1990 to help constituents part
time at Traficant's Youngstown office. But Rovnak said he spent most of
his time at the farm, at times working 16-hour days on plumbing and
carpentry projects.</LD>
<LD>   Staffers have testified at Traficant's corruption trial that the
Democratic congressman made them do personal chores while on the
congressional payroll.</LD>
<TE>   Traficant, who is representing himself, although he is not a lawyer,
denies charges of tax falsification, racketeering and accepting gifts and
favors for his political influence. He faces up to 63 years in prison and
expulsion from the House if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rovnak said he was among several staffers who worked on Traficant's
boat at the request of H. West Richards, Traficant's chief of staff in
Washington from 1990 through 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Richards testified Thursday that he never forced staffers to work on
the boat but that they may have "perceived pressure from the congressman"
to do the work.</TE>
<TE>   While cross-examining Rovnak, Traficant reminisced with him about
their days playing football together. Rovnak also admitted committing
perjury in an unrelated civil lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant later asked if Rovnak thought he had been hired strictly as
a farm worker paid by taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happened," Rovnak said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Traficant said he would run as an independent in the
newly formed 17th Congressional District because the trial leaves him no
time to mount a primary campaign for the Democratic nomination.</TE>

<HD>Airport Security Test Exposes Flaws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Plainclothes federal agents testing airport security were able to
get guns and knives past screening checkpoints in Miami earlier this
month, government officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The incident renewed concerns about the aviation security system,
which has been on high alert since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Despite the intrusive searches law-abiding
passengers have learned to patiently cooperate with, the breaches showed
that weapons still can be smuggled into the secure area of a major
airport.</LD>
<LD>   The Feb. 6 test was conducted by agents of the Transportation
Department's inspector general. In previous years, undercover agents for
the inspector general and the Federal Aviation Administration often were
able to easily get weapons past checkpoints. The latest test showed that
not all loopholes have been closed.</LD>
<TE>   The airport security system is being turned over to a new federal
Transportation Security Administration. The agency took control Sunday of
passenger checkpoints, which had been operated by security companies
hired by the airlines and supervised by the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   But the same security screeners, often low-wage workers, are
continuing to do the job for now. Starting this summer, they will be
replaced by federal security officers at 429 airports that have regular
airline service.</TE>
<TE>   David Barnes, a spokesman for the inspector general, said he could not
confirm or deny that agents had breached security. "We have been doing
undercover audits at more than two dozen airports, and we're not going to
discuss what, if anything, we've found."</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the results of the test said agents were able
to get three guns and nine knives past security screeners at the Miami
airport.</TE>
<TE>   A Transportation Department official downplayed the test because it
occurred before the new administration assumed security duties.</TE>

<HD>Director of Centers for Disease Control Resigns</HD>
<DH>Health: Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan's impending departure adds to the
list of federal agencies that lack a permanent leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, who guided the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention through the challenge of responding to last year's anthrax
attacks, announced Thursday that he would resign as director of the
public health agency.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation, which will take effect March 31, will add to the list
of federal health agencies with no permanent leader. There is no surgeon
general or Food and Drug Administration commissioner, and an acting
director has led the National Institutes of Health for more than two
years.</LD>
<LD>   Within the NIH, at least five of the 19 major institutes have no
permanent director, including those that oversee federal funding for
research on mental health, neurological disorders, drug abuse, alcoholism
and biological imaging. At least one smaller federal health agency, the
Health Resources and Services Administration, also has an acting chief.</LD>
<TE>   "I am extremely worried that we have these absences at a time when
there is attention to health for the usual reasons, and now for the
unusual reason of bioterrorism," said Dr. Linda Rosenstock, dean of the
UCLA School of Public Health. "It's a frightening situation to have at a
time when you would look for stability in leadership, not volatility."</TE>
<TE>   Koplan, 57, has spent nearly all of his professional life at the CDC
and became director in 1998, under President Clinton. A CDC spokeswoman
said that Koplan, like other agency heads who serve at the pleasure of
each administration, had tendered his resignation when President Bush
took office. But Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson
asked him to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Koplan announced his decision to senior staff members at a meeting
Thursday afternoon. In a written statement, he did not explain why he was
leaving what he called "the best job in public health."</TE>
<TE>   The agency is charged with safeguarding the public's health, which
requires it to track disease outbreaks, manage food-borne illnesses and
work on immunization programs, on-the-job injury reduction and a wide
range of other health problems.</TE>
<TE>   The agency drew mixed reviews last year for its response to the
anthrax attacks that killed at least five people and infected more than a
dozen others. Faced with the nation's first case of bioterrorism by mail,
government officials first assured the public that their mail was safe,
then warned that thousands of letters had possibly been infected by those
few letters known to have carried anthrax bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Koplan was also accused of evading his responsibility when he refused
to advise people exposed to anthrax on whether to be vaccinated, saying
he lacked scientific evidence. And the federal government in general was
faulted for releasing information on the attacks through political
leaders, some of whom offered incorrect information, rather than through
federal scientists and physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Roper, CDC director from 1990 to 1993 and a close friend of
Koplan, said the anthrax attacks had no bearing on Koplan's departure.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he leaving because of anthrax? Of course not," Roper said. "Is he
leaving because the secretary asked him to leave or urged him to leave? I
know for certain that's not the case," said Roper, referring to Thompson.
"He was not asked to resign."</TE>
<TE>   Roper, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North
Carolina, said Koplan is "the best of the best" among CDC chiefs. He
credited Koplan with building the political support necessary to boost
the agency's budget and improve its infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "The CDC has been chronically underfunded," said Anthony Mazzaschi,
associate vice president for research at the Assn. of American Medical
Colleges, "but Jeffrey Koplan was an effective and passionate advocate of
public funding and public health."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Thompson called Koplan's departure "a loss for the
department . . . and for our country," and said he had "touched and
improved the lives of millions of people worldwide."</TE>

<HD>Problems With Alzheimer's Vaccine Halt Shots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A dozen volunteers inoculated with a highly touted experimental
vaccine designed to reverse the course of Alzheimer's disease have fallen
seriously ill with brain inflammation, forcing the vaccine's manufacturer
to stop giving the shots and raising doubts about the product's clinical
potential, according to sources familiar with the study.</LD>
<LD>   The vaccine, made by the Irish pharmaceutical company Elan and known
by its code name AN-1792, had generated unusually intense enthusiasm
among scientists and patient advocates during the last two years, as
experiments with mice suggested it could halt the progression of
Alzheimer's and perhaps cure the deadly disease.</LD>
<LD>   The ailment gradually robs people of their mind. It affects 2 million
to 4 million Americans and is expected to affect 15 million by 2030. Even
today's best treatments have a very modest effect.</LD>
<TE>   Taking an immunological approach to treating the disease, the vaccine
aims to elicit an immune system attack against "beta amyloid," the brain
protein believed to be at the root of Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials have released few details about the problems. A
spokesman said an independent committee is reviewing data from the study,
which has enrolled about 360 people in four European countries and 11
U.S. cities who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   But sources familiar with the study, including some who have been in
contact with Elan officials, said there is little question that the
vaccine triggered the brain reactions, which some called encephalitis (an
inflammation of the brain) and another source called
"meningoencephalitis" (an inflammation of the brain and surrounding
membranes).</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists had warned that the vaccine might trigger such
complications or even exacerbate Alzheimer's, a disease some believe is
caused by natural inflammatory processes.</TE>
<TE>   One such critic, Trey Sunderland, chief of the geriatric psychiatry
branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, said Thursday that the
vaccine may have directly caused the encephalitis in volunteers or it may
have caused a disruption of blood vessels in their brains. That would
allow viruses or other infectious agents to enter and cause encephalitis.</TE>
<TE>   Elan, which is developing the vaccine with Wyeth, a pharmaceutical
division of American Home Products Corp. of Madison, N.J., would not say
Thursday how quickly it had halted inoculations after the first few
patients were diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman said only doctors at individual test sites could
address that issue, but officials at several sites Thursday said they had
been told by the company not to talk to reporters.</TE>

<DL>TOMS RIVER, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>A retired police officer shot and killed his 22-year-old
granddaughter Thursday, then went door to door and killed three
neighbors, police said.</LD>
<LD>   John W. Mabie, 70, who retired from the Newark police force in 1976,
was charged with four counts of murder. Bail was set at $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested as he sat on the front lawn of his home, about an
hour's drive southeast of Trenton, authorities said. A .38-caliber
revolver was found on his front steps, Ocean County Prosecutor Thomas F.
Kelaher said.</LD>
<TE>   Kelaher said Mabie was at his mother-in-law's home down the street
from his house when he shot his granddaughter, Natalie Gingerelli. He
then allegedly left the house, walked to a nearby house and fatally shot
Sue Keiran, 42.</TE>
<TE>   Mabie went to another home and shot 27-year-old Thomas Luyster, who
died at a hospital, Kelaher said. The body of Luyster's fiancee, Suzanne
Lavecchia, was found on the lawn in front of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not give a motive for the shootings.</TE>

<LD>Tet Parade--A story in Saturday's California section on Vietnamese
New Year festivities quoted a man who said he had served in the Vietnam
War between 1974 and 1978. U.S. combat troops were withdrawn in 1973, and
the remaining troops and personnel departed in 1975 with the fall of
Saigon. The story also misidentified a military helicopter in the parade.
The aircraft was a Huey.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Davis Taylor, the third generation of his family to serve
as publisher of the Boston Globe, died Tuesday of heart failure at his
home in Brookline, Mass. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor was publisher for 22 years, beginning in 1955. During his
tenure, the newspaper won 11 Pulitzer Prizes and became the first major
paper to call for the resignation of Richard M. Nixon during the
Watergate controversy.</LD>
<LD>   In the Globe's obituary, he was praised for fostering editorial
independence. "He inspired and encouraged his editors to be creative,
innovative, and to do what they felt was right," said Thomas Winship,
Globe editor from 1965 to 1984.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor oversaw the Globe's move from Newspaper Row in downtown Boston,
where it was founded in 1872, to Morrissey Boulevard in the Dorchester
neighborhood. He also was the first chairman of Affiliated Publications
Inc., the paper's parent company, from 1973 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the family owned newspaper as a junior accountant after
graduating from Harvard in 1931. He was named general manager in 1940 and
publisher on the death of his father, the son of the paper's founder,
Charles H. Taylor. In 1972, Taylor was elected chairman of the American
Newspaper Publishers Assn. After his retirement in 1981, he continued as
a director and consultant to the Globe.</TE>

<LD>BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, cut

revenue, including from that of its wireless joint venture, was expected
to increase 2% to 4%.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nextel Communications Inc. lost $127 million in domestic operations
in the fourth quarter of 2001 three times as much as in the year-ago
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   But company executives said they were pleased with the company's
growth in cash flow and new subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications firm said it could not compute its overall
numbers, including loss per share, because it had yet to determine the
details of a $1-billion-to-$2-billion debt restructuring charge for its
international subsidiary, NII Holdings.</LD>
<TE>   The international unit was to be spun off into a separate stock, but
there has not yet been an initial public offering. The final figures will
be available April 1.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel shares climbed 12 cents to $4.50 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc. and other power sellers won't owe
California buyers hundreds of millions of dollars for some sales that are
part of a proceeding in which the state is seeking about $1.5 billion in
refunds, a judge said.</LD>
<LD>  Some power that buyers and sellers agreed to days before it was
delivered should be ineligible for refunds even if those transactions
were processed through a state exchange that mostly handled same-day
power sales, said Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Bruce
Birchman.</LD>
<LD>  Including those sales would be a "mischaracterization of the markets,"
Birchman said at a pre-hearing conference on which sales should be
included as potential refunds are calculated.</LD>

<LD>The state Public Utilities Commission postponed until March 6 a
vote on whether businesses in the state can continue to buy electricity
from private providers other than their traditional utilities, saying
that the commissioners needed more time to study public comments. The PUC
is debating whether to end the program as of July 1 or Sept. 20.</LD>

<HD>Boeing Confirms Plans to Cut 1,000 Jobs</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. said it will eliminate 1,000 jobs from its satellite
manufacturing arm in Southern California, about 11% of the work force, as
it restructures to deal with tough competition in the uncertain economy.</LD>
<LD>  The cuts, which had been reported by The Times, come four months after
Boeing cut 400 other jobs at the satellite division because of a slowdown
in the telecommunications industry.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based Boeing had previously said it would cut as many as
30,000 jobs nationwide by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>  The new round of cuts includes reductions in manufacturing and support
staff along with some engineering positions at Boeing facilities in El
Segundo and Torrance, said company spokesman George Torres.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 350 of the new cuts could be achieved by reassigning
affected workers to current openings and encouraging others to retire
early, Torres said.</TE>
<TE>  Boeing acquired the satellite business, which employs about 9,200
people, last year. The unit is the world's largest producer of satellites
for military and commercial markets.</TE>
<TE>  Torres said Boeing remains committed to expanding its satellite
business.</TE>
<TE>  The company intends to proceed with plans for a 35,000-square-foot
addition to its El Segundo satellite factory and continue pursuing new
military business that could create about 1,300 new jobs by 2005.</TE>
<TE>  Shares of Boeing rose 90 cents to close at $44.21 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporations are finding credit more available now than in previous
recessions because markets are more efficient and capital is cheaper, a
government report said.</LD>
<LD>  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report said large corporate
borrowers are responding to banks' tighter commercial loan standards by
borrowing funds through capital markets.</LD>
<LD>  Commercial and industrial loans fell by 9% in the third quarter of
2001, yet corporate bond issuance for nonfinancial and non-farm
businesses grew by 14% in the 12 months ending in the third quarter, the
report said.</LD>
<TE>  "In contrast to other recent recessions, commercial credit outstanding
from all sources continued to grow in 2001 in real terms, albeit at a
slower rate than in the three previous years of rapid credit expansion,"
the report said.</TE>
<TE>  This reflects a broader trend of corporate borrowers bypassing banks
for credit needs. Corporate borrowers held about 55% of their debt in
corporate bonds and commercial paper, a type of short-term debt, up from
45% in the 1990 recession. Smaller businesses with more limited access to
capital markets continue to rely more on bank loans.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. safety agency should conduct driving tests in addition to
the mathematical formula it uses to rate vehicle rollover risks, a
government study mandated by Congress concluded.</LD>
<LD>  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also should use a
new statistical model to help distinguish the rollover risk among similar
vehicle types and develop a rating system more precise than its one to
five stars, the National Research Council said in its report.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Express Co. said it agreed to pay $31 million to settle a
sex discrimination lawsuit, becoming the latest big financial firm to
settle allegations it treated women unfairly.</LD>
<LD>   The firm's money management unit, American Express Financial Advisors
Inc., also agreed to name a diversity officer and start mandatory
diversity training for financial advisors, a company spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   By 2005, the spokeswoman said, the company has agreed to increase its
hiring of women to 32% of all new financial advisors. Currently, about a
quarter of the company's 11,500 financial advisors are women, the
spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Employees of the firm had alleged that they were denied equal pay and
promotions.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, other big financial firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, have settled
discrimination lawsuits filed on behalf of female employees.</TE>

<LD>Fares at major U.S. airlines fell 16% in January from the
year-earlier month as carriers reduced prices to lure back passengers
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>  The average one-way domestic fare fell to $122.89 from $146.51 in
January 2001, said the Air Transport Assn. The average fare last month
was up from December's $117.79, which was the lowest level since 1989.</LD>
<LD>  Airline revenue last month fell 27% from a year earlier, the same as in
December, the group said.</LD>
<TE>  In related news, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it will rehire 1,200
flight attendants laid off after the terrorist attacks as the
second-largest carrier restores some flights because of rising demand.</TE>

declined 4.3% to $1.52 billion from $1.58 billion.</LD>
<LD>  * Cox Radio Inc., the third-biggest U.S. radio company, said
fourth-quarter profit more than doubled to $13.6 million, or 14 cents a

<TE>  * People magazine's managing editor, Carol Wallace, will resign after

succeeded by In Style magazine's Martha Nelson, publisher Time Inc. said.</TE>
<TE>  * Radio One Inc., the largest U.S. radio broadcaster serving black
listeners, said its fourth-quarter loss almost doubled because expenses
rose and advertising sales slowed.</TE>
<TE>  The loss increased to $15.4million, or 22 cents a share, and broadcast
sales rose 16% to $67.4million.</TE>
<TE>   * The Securities and Exchange Commission said it has charged an
ex-Lehman Bros. Inc. branch manager with securities fraud, alleging he
stole at least $40 million from more than 50 clients. Wall Street's top
regulator said it was seeking a temporary restraining order, asset freeze
and receiver for Frank Gruttadauria, a former manager of Lehman's
Cleveland office.</TE>
<TE>  * Federated Department Stores Inc. signed a preliminary agreement to
sell troubled catalog retailer Fingerhut Cos. to a Minnesota turnaround
specialist--but left the door open for additional bids. The
Cincinnati-based retailer said it has signed a nonbinding letter of

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Davis Taylor, the third generation of his family to serve as
publisher of the Boston Globe, died Tuesday of heart failure at his
home in Brookline, Mass. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor was publisher for 22 years, beginning in 1955. During his
tenure, the newspaper won 11 Pulitzer Prizes and became the first
major paper to call for the resignation of Richard M. Nixon during
the Watergate controversy.</LD>
<LD>   In the Globe's obituary, he was praised for fostering editorial
independence. ''He inspired and encouraged his editors to be
creative, innovative, and to do what they felt was right,'' said
Thomas Winship, Globe editor from 1965 to 1984.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor oversaw the Globe's move from Newspaper Row in downtown
Boston, where it was founded in 1872, to Morrissey Boulevard in the
Dorchester neighborhood. He also was the first chairman of Affiliated
Publications Inc., the paper's parent company, from 1973 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the family owned newspaper as a junior accountant after
graduating from Harvard in 1931. He was named general manager in 1940
and publisher on the death of his father, the son of the paper's
founder, Charles H. Taylor. In 1972, Taylor was elected chairman of
the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. After his retirement in 1981,
he continued as a director and consultant to the Globe.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials assembled outside an overcrowded San
Fernando Valley police station Thursday afternoon urging residents to
pass a bond measure that would give the city $600 million to upgrade
its emergency facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition Q, which will be on the March 5 ballot, would provide
money to replace the city's emergency operations center and four
aging police stations, build two police stations in the Valley and
Mid-Wilshire, and repair and renovate deteriorating Fire Department
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The bond would cost the average homeowner about $3 a month--or
about $35 a year for 24 years.</LD>
<TE>   This is the third time in recent years that the city has asked
voters to approve a bond that would renovate public safety
facilities. The last two propositions received the support of a
majority of voters, but failed to get the needed two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, officials said the bond is essential to help police
officers and firefighters do their jobs and to decrease response
times to emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The needs are great," Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said at a
news conference at the West Valley Community Police Station in
Reseda. "It is intolerable to force our fine men and women in blue to
work in these kinds of conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are cramped inside the 42-year-old station, which would
be one of the first replaced with the bond money.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was joined at the news conference by several City Council
members, Fire Chief William Bamattre and Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks, who is seeking a second five-year term. Hahn opposes Parks'
reappointment, but on Thursday, the two men said they were united in
their support for Proposition Q.</TE>
<TE>   Some Valley residents who want to create a separate city oppose
the bond, saying that it should not be on the ballot before the city
votes on secession. A dozen opponents waved "No on Q" signs at the
news conference.</TE>

<HD>Voters Get the Wrong Ballots</HD>
<DH>Politics: Election department error causes some in
Camarillo to receive forms intended for Simi Valley residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An election department snafu has resulted in the wrong ballots being
sent to a handful of absentee voters in Camarillo, raising concerns
about the potential for problems in the March 5 primary.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County elections chief Bruce Bradley said human error is
to blame for some Camarillo residents--only about 10 have come
forward so far--receiving absentee ballots intended for voters in
Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Bradley said the problem likely occurred when an election worker
reached for the wrong pile while helping insert more than 40,000
absentee ballots into envelopes mailed out earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   There is no way to know how many misdirected ballots went out,
Bradley said. But he said he suspects they went to no more than 50 of
the 7,600 voters in the Camarillo area who requested the ballots.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is not widespread," he said. "I don't think it's
going to affect any races."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) worries otherwise. He said
his office has been contacted by several people in the Camarillo area
who unexpectedly found themselves able to vote in the 4th District
supervisorial race in which incumbent Judy Mikels is facing
challenger John Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo residents are in the 3rd District, where there is no
supervisorial race this year.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly worries that the ballot error could result in some
ballots being disqualified or counted in the wrong election.</TE>
<TE>   "The onus should not be on [voters] to review and make sure they
have the right ballot," Gallegly said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these races could be very tight, and if we learned
anything in the last presidential cycle, it is that elections should
be taken more seriously than like they might have been in Florida and
other places," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said any voter who receives the wrong ballot can contact
the election division and get the correct one.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have until Tuesday to request an absentee ballot by
mail.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Bradley said even if an absentee voter in Camarillo
received the wrong ballot and erroneously cast a vote in the race for
4th District supervisor, the department's computers would catch the
error and disqualify that vote. The rest of the ballot would stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We mailed out 40,000 absentee ballots, and we made a mistake on
10 of them," Bradley said. "It's the human-error factor."</TE>

<HD>Mother Ordered to Jail for Sons' Deaths</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Simi Valley woman receives one year and
probation. Boys died in sweltering van.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley mother who left her two young sons to die in a
sweltering minivan last summer while she lay asleep after drinking a
bottle of wine was ordered Thursday to serve a year in county jail as
part of a five-year sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark
came a week after he spared Marlene Heath, 40, a lengthy state prison
term following her no contest plea last fall in the Aug. 4 deaths of
her sons, Jake, 3, and Dylan, 13 months.</LD>
<LD>   Heath told police that after drinking the wine that morning, she
drove toward Ventura for a company picnic but turned back. She then
fell asleep in her bedroom and found the children strapped in their
car seats four hours later, dead.</LD>
<TE>   Clark, who last week sentenced Heath to probation, went with a
probation department recommendation that Heath serve jail time and
ordered the former Kinko's employee to begin her incarceration in
Ventura County Jail on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Aramesh, who prosecuted the case, said
that although she wanted state prison time for Heath, she was
satisfied with Clark's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "What she did was inexcusable," Aramesh said. "The message is that
you will serve time if you neglect your children."</TE>
<TE>   Because she could receive credit for good behavior while in jail,
Heath could be released in less than a year, prosecutors said. She
would then be on probation for the remainder of her 60-month
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Other terms of Heath's probation include performing 500 hours of
community service, attending 52 child abuse education classes and
paying $1,100 in investigation fees to the probation department.</TE>
<TE>   Heath's attorney, Louis Samonsky, said he was not surprised by the
jail sentence considering the level of public surprise that his
client was not sent to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any judge, he tries to reflect the community values,"
Samonsky said. "There was a backlash, so I figured there would be
some jail time, but she was a good mother by all accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last week, when Heath and her husband, Phillip, attended
the hearing surrounded by dozens of family members and friends, only
a few relatives attended Thursday's proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, after Clark's decision to spare his wife a prison
sentence of up to 12 years for felony child endangerment, Phillip
Heath had said his sons "are up in heaven right now jumping up and
down."</TE>
<TE>   After Clark's ruling Thursday, he brushed aside reporters'
questions as he led his wife across a courthouse lawn to meet with
probation officials at the county jail.</TE>

<LD>Local officials have put the Orange County Water District on notice
that they expect to be reimbursed for the cost of buying replacement
water after the agency inadvertently added a possible carcinogen to
wells that serve Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Testing last month found low levels of dioxane, an industrial
solvent, at nine wells that serve those cities, as well as Fountain
Valley, which did not bill the water agency. All the affected wells
were closed.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the district's board of directors approved in
concept building treatment facilities to cleanse the water of the
solvent. That will cost millions of dollars and take up to 22 months.</LD>
<TE>   But if the wells remain shut until the treatment facilities are
built, local officials will be forced to spend millions buying more
expensive water from Northern California and the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of those shutdowns, our city will likely incur
additional water purchasing costs of $3.9 million annually," wrote
Tod Ridgeway, mayor of Newport Beach, in a Feb. 14 letter to the
water agency.</TE>
<TE>   The bill from the city does not mention a specific amount but says
Newport Beach would hold the agency accountable for any increased
costs, which could take the form of cash payments, credit to the city
or other options.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new testing revealed dioxane at a Santa Ana well that
serves Irvine and parts of Tustin, Orange and Santa Ana Heights,
though that well is not in use at this time.</TE>
<TE>   The county water district is among the first in the state to test
for dioxane, a new contaminant that has no state or federal limits.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the contamination is highly treated sewage water
that the district injects into the ground to keep seawater from
intruding into the freshwater aquifer beneath northern and central
Orange County. While this has kept saltwater out, the sewage water
contained dioxane. The agency is now treating the sewage water it
injects with higher levels of peroxide to keep more dioxane from
being added to the ground water.</TE>
<TE>   However, the district must eliminate the existing dioxane. The
district has tested 37 of its 230 wells, and found levels above 3
parts per billion in 10, including the most recent one in Santa Ana.
No agencies were required to shut wells but chose to do so to retain
public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   All four of Newport Beach's wells are closed, meaning the city is
relying entirely on imported water, which costs about 52% more than
ground water.</TE>
<TE>   "Because this is something that [OCWD added] to the ground-water
basin, we believe we're entitled to ask for payment for our costs ...
rather than passing that on to consumers," said Dave Kiff, assistant
city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa Consolidated Water District, which serves Costa Mesa, closed
the three contaminated wells; it has six other wells. Diana Leach,
general manager of the district, wrote in a Feb. 15 letter that she
anticipates spending $397,600 for water this fiscal year, which ends
June 30, and $852,000 during the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Fountain Valley's seven wells also were closed, but the
city hasn't had to increase use of imported water, said Robert
Kellison, field services manager.</TE>
<TE>   Increased water usage during the summer months would force the
city to buy more imported water--costs that Kellison said would be
passed on to the district if they occur.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the long-term health effects of exposure to
dioxane, but federal environmental officials have classified it a
probable human carcinogen and the state recently deemed it a
"contaminant of concern."</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley officials will be meeting with state health
officials Wednesday to discuss the issue. The wells showed levels of
3 to 20 parts dioxane per billion; the state recommends closing the
wells at 300 parts per billion.</TE>
