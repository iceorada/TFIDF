<LD>In what has become almost an annual rite of summer, a contestant on
CBS' "Big Brother" has been revealed to have a rap sheet.</LD>
<LD>   Web site The Smoking Gun, www.thesmokinggun.com, reported that
Chiara Berti, 25, was arrested in May on charges of driving under the
influence and driving without a license. She is only the latest
contestant on the show--which sequesters a dozen people in a house
and tapes their every action, gradually eliminating them until a
$500,000 winner is chosen--to be exposed in this fashion. Last year,
Justin Sebik, evicted after holding a knife to another contestant's
throat, was found to have had several assault charges against him.
Another contestant, it was later learned, had been arrested in a
vehicular manslaughter case, and a fourth for allegedly trespassing
on the Warner Bros. lot and trying to secure unauthorized photos of
the movie "Batman &amp; Robin."</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that history explains why CBS has become a trifle blase
about such revelations, though the network did say that in this case,
it was aware of Berti's arrest and was told that she was dealing with
the matter. The Smoking Gun quotes her attorney as saying that she is
"very likely to settle."</LD>
<TE>   "On the brighter side, she won't be doing any driving in the
house," said CBS spokesman Chris Ender.</TE>
<TE>   Charity's Foot Soldier</TE>
<TE>   It was an unusual sight: a celebrity skipping the valet service
and arriving at the party in his honor--on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a burgundy suit, and taking long strides in white trainers
from his own label, Phat Farm, Russell Simmons, who'd parked at the
nearby home of a friend, led his five-person entourage uphill along
Green Acres Drive in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of Def Jam Records, and chief executive of Rush
Communications, he was among the first guests to arrive at
supermarket mogul Ron Burkle's fabled estate, Green Acres, where Mary
Parent and Scott Stuber, of Universal Pictures, were being honored
with Simmons, and Chrysalis, a nonprofit organization, was raising
funds to help the poor and homeless. The weekend event was dubbed the
Butterfly Ball.</TE>
<TE>   Big names and open pocketbooks were plentiful, but some guests
held tight to their thoughts. Nicolas Cage arrived alone, posed for
photos, but didn't talk. And Anthony Hopkins paused only to say, "I'm
just here to lend support."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, by comparison, was quite chatty.</TE>
<TE>   In bad times, "the first thing to go is services to the poor,"
Simmons said, as he stood near the rose garden, surrounded by friends
and well-wishers. "A measurement of a good society is how we treat
poor people."</TE>
<TE>   (By that standard, the celebrities and other guests did quite
well. The $500-a-plate dinner raised $350,000 for Chrysalis.)</TE>
<TE>   Owen Wilson arrived. So, what was his involvement with the
charity?</TE>
<TE>   "Ron just asked me to come down," Wilson said. "I'm learning a lot
as the night goes on. It's to help the homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Would he be writing a check? "I'll try to carry my load," he said.
"I don't want to disappoint anyone."</TE>
<TE>   A Powerful Mix</TE>
<TE>   Scores of women, nearly all of them aspiring to work in the film
industry, crowded the lobby of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences theater Friday night to exchange business cards and sip
martinis. They came to this "power mixer" to hear the advice of women
who inspired them--producer Meg LeFauve, who's Jodie Foster's
business partner, Academy Award-winning sound editor Teri Dorman and
"Minority Report" producer Bonnie Curtis, among others.</TE>
<TE>   One of the event sponsors, filmmaker and author Helena Lumme,
urged a visitor to read her new coffee table book "Great Women of
Film" (Billboard Books, 2002). The book features 30 influential women
in the film industry--Foster, Susan Sarandon and Joan Allen among
them--and recounts the strategies that led to their success. "When I
finished 'The Accused,' I thought I had done a really bad job," says
Foster in the book. "[Ultimately] I used the Academy Award clout from
[that film] to get a job directing." Allen explains the importance of
self-confidence. "I'd be the first to admit that I wouldn't work with
a director who made me feel insecure for whatever reasons,
intentional or not." For Sarandon, acting isn't something that must
be taught. "I didn't have any training in acting," she says. "I don't
think you need that, you need life training to survive as an actor.
Anybody can act."</TE>
<TE>   Those were comforting words for the women in the lobby, which
buzzed with a thousand job pitches and introductions. Women were
connecting, and promises of career help were being offered. The
evening was just beginning, but Lumme was on her way to her goal of
creating a forum where "women could focus on getting more women into
the business."</TE>

Silver Lake, Shannyn Sossamon playing a video game at Spaceland.</TE>

<DH>A Web site makes a global game of tomes purposely left

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you happen to find "On the Road" at a gas station or "Who Moved My
Cheese?" next to a hunk of Gouda in your grocery store, it might not
be an accident. You could be the unwitting beneficiary of a
bookcrosser--a person who intentionally leaves books in public places
hoping they'll be found by strangers.</LD>
<LD>   And, if you really want to make the day of the person who left it,
you'll not only pick up the book and read it, you'll log onto a Web
site and let the bookcrosser know.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of leaving a book for someone else to find and enjoy is
not new--some folks have been leaving just-finished books in airports
and on buses since the dawn of hurry-up-and-wait. Creating a system
for book-leavers to find out what happened to those books adds a new
twist to the practice--and raises the stakes. Would you rather be
known as the person who left behind a steamy Danielle Steel novel or
the magical realism of "One Hundred Years of Solitude"?</LD>
<TE>   Something of a phenom among readers with a taste for mischief and
a touch of altruism, bookcrossing.com, the Web site that tracks books
"released into the wild," has accumulated more than 18,000 members
since its inception last year, and averages 112 new participants
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Its members have scattered more than 42,000 novels, self-help
books, memoirs, technical manuals and biographies in 45 countries,
leaving them in public restrooms, movie theaters, coffee shops or
anywhere that tickles their fancy. The result: a worldwide living
library.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Payton, a St. Louis homemaker, has let go of more than 400,
mostly in self-service laundries and restaurants</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Ruark, a West L.A. psychologist, has left more than 20 books
around the city--in dressing rooms, grocery stores and flower shops.</TE>
<TE>   Peri Doslu, a Santa Monica yoga instructor, has dropped three--one
on top of a telephone booth, one on a rock wall at Mono Lake, and
another in one of the studios where she teaches. "I'm always looking
for places to pass on books," said Doslu, 39. "To think my book's
going to go off and have this future, and I might even get to know a
little bit about it down the road, I really find enchanting."</TE>
<TE>   Enchanting? This called for a test case.</TE>
<TE>   I signed on and logged in, giving myself the screen name
MissPaigeTurner, then registered four novels. After receiving
identification numbers for each, I wrote them on bookmarks that
explained how bookcrossing works and placed them between the pages of
each book. I spent the rest of the afternoon looking for spots to
leave my books.</TE>
<TE>   My first drop was on the bus I rode downtown: I left Lemony
Snicket's "The Bad Beginning" on the back seat. A few hours later, I
dropped Iceberg Slim's "Mama Black Widow" on the sidewalk along
Vermont Avenue in Los Feliz. Next, I stopped in at Banana Republic,
tried on a shirt and left a copy of "The Nanny Diaries" in the
dressing room. Later, I stopped at Buster's coffee shop in South
Pasadena for a lime rickey. After downing the last slushy bits and
looking around to make sure no one was watching, I put a copy of
"Madame Bovary" on the table and made a quick exit.</TE>
<TE>   No one ran after me to say, "Hey! You forgot something!" No one
looked at me as if I were the Unabomber. In my mission as the phantom
book leaver, I was, as far as I knew, completely unobserved.</TE>
<TE>   Giddy with the fun of indulging my sneaky side, I headed home. The
only thing to do was wait. I checked my e-mail the following day,
expecting to find a message from the Web site telling me my books had
been found. No such luck. Ditto for the following day--and the next
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   I still haven't heard a peep.</TE>
<TE>   That's typical, said Ron Hornbaker, a 36-year-old software
developer from St. Louis, who came up with the idea for
BookCrossing's Web site. Only 10% to 15% of the books people release
are "successful," meaning they have been picked up by a stranger who
then logs on to the site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like fishing. If you caught a fish every castoff of
the line, it would get boring," said Hornbaker. "Even the ones you
don't hear from, you have to keep the faith that maybe they found a
good home. It's better than sitting on a bookshelf."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not a book is picked up depends on a lot of things,
Hornbaker said, notably, how well it is marked, what kind of book it
is, where it's placed, who picks it up and whether the finder has
Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   My books might have had better luck if, when registering them, I
penned a release note for the Web site, giving "hunters" details on
what books I'd left where and when.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Ruark did when she released "Divine Secrets of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood" in a Nordstrom dressing room in May. Within a week,
she received an e-mail from BookCrossing.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian woman, who had been with her daughter trying on
clothes, found the book. Twelve hours later, Ruark got a second
e-mail, saying her copy of "The Lady and the Monk" by Pico Ayer had
been found in the sushi section of a Wild Oats grocery store. "I
thought I'd hit the jackpot," said Ruark, 49, who signed up for
BookCrossing because "it sounded fun and a little bit subversive."</TE>
<TE>   She has since placed a book about dogs between bags of dog food at
the supermarket, and left Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" beside
a pot of flowers at a floral shop.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Aron, a film and television composer from Santa Monica,
hunts for books every other week, using the release notes on the Web
site to guide him. He's found seven books since May--on investment,
baseball and various history subjects--in coffee shops, bookstores
and a park.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part of it for me is the sheer unusualness of where
they'll leave stuff," said Aron, 39. "The whole thing is designed to
take you on an adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Half of the fun for bookcrossers is figuring out where to leave
the books, said Hornbaker, who left his first book, "Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance," in a deli. His ideas have since evolved.
He's reading Kerouac's "On the Road," which he plans to "throw out
the window to a hitchhiker."</TE>

<LD>THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF TURQUOISE</LD>
<LD>   Meditations on Landscape, Art, and Spirit</LD>
<LD>   By Ellen Meloy</LD>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   326 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   "The craving for turquoise is universal," suggests essayist and
nature writer Ellen Meloy. "Turquoise is capricious, it is alluring,
no one leaves the Southwest without it, although its life seems to
flee from it when it is removed from the bare, blood-red sandstone of
its native land."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Anthropology of Turquoise," her exquisitely rendered
meditation, Meloy considers all that might be linked to the spirit of
turquoise: the gem-like mineral itself, the myriad stops on the
spectrum that comprise the color's amplitude, and the metaphors she
finds in this blue-green color--metaphors of place, of peace, of the
restfulness of the ocean, the silence of the desert, the life-giving
waters of the rivers, even the respite of suburban swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   In this compilation of 15 densely written, highly poetic essays,
Meloy takes readers on a sensual travel narrative. On the Colorado
Plateau, exploring light and color, she tries to recapture, through
crayons and watercolors, a sense of her deceased brother's existence.
In Sequoia, she ponders family ties to a piece of land. The Bahamas
serve as backdrop for her investigation into the landscape and slave
history of the islands. Throughout, her writing is steeped in color,
nearly squawking with life.</TE>
<TE>   One essay, "Azul Maya," recounts a vacation to the Yucatan wilds,
where Meloy delves wide-eyed into the extraordinary flora and fauna.
Her poetic language runs freely among exceptional colors and species,
including birds she finds filling the trees like outrageous fruits,
looking "like pink chiffon prom dresses standing in little ashtrays."
The landscape's thick cover of green, she tells us, stretches "far
into the horizon like giant broccoli gone berserk."</TE>
<TE>   "A Field Guide to Brazen Harlotry" explores the erotics of the
natural world, "the great flood of vegetable sexuality that surrounds
us," while "The Silk That Hurls Us Down Its Spine" is the harrowing
adventure of Meloy's solo river-rafting trip in which the raft took
off downstream without her. The grandeur of the Colorado River Basin
pays no attention as she fights to regain the raft and survive.</TE>
<TE>   Her essays are slow moving, as quiet as a wide, torpid river,
requiring readers to stop the ongoing chatter of contemporary life
and pay close attention to the details of nature, of silence, of
solitude. The sense-based writing often meanders without story line,
but readers will seldom turn pages to find out what happens. Running
through her words is a magic spell that can soothe us into letting go
of conventions like plot, so immersed are we in the sacredness of the
moment, the wonder she shares of the natural world.</TE>
<TE>   Readers who prefer stories to unfold or details to be offered into
personal relationships will not find many of those elements, as Meloy
steers clear of much autobiography--we never learn, for example, how
the brother died--in favor of artistic impressions that remain rooted
in the physical, rather than the social or emotional, world.</TE>
<TE>   Her writing regularly reveals humor and lightness. "A cricket
takes up residence in my husband's closet. At night it sings love
songs to his hiking boots." And describing a scene on the Colorado
Plateau: "Do not think of a cactus acting like a cactus, with its
apple-green paddles and white spines. In winter the prickly pear
hallucinates. Its spines glow red-gold in the angled sun, like an
electrocuted aura."</TE>
<TE>   "Swimming the Mojave" is a funny, odd essay, recounting Meloy's
road-trip version of John Cheever's story "The Swimmer," in which she
swims in motel pools from Los Angeles to Colorado. She describes the
magnificence of the desert, the seediness of tiny towns with rundown
hotels, and the lurid desertscape of Las Vegas, where, lounging at a
pool, she notices the other bathers. "The skimpy bathing attire of
most women was not meant to be wet; it was made from strawberry fruit
rolls instead of fabric," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   Her essays remind us of the riches at stake in preserving the
natural world, and are quite serious in this regard. "The Angry Lunch
Cafe," the most polemical of the essays, lists Meloy's gripes with
"recreationists" and their approach to nature. As the West fills with
people and their rabid appetite for playgrounds, she tells us, "time
is running out for the 'wild preservatives' who remember solitude
instead of crowds ... backcountry without tire tracks every forty
steps."</TE>
<TE>   Taken as a whole, Meloy's gem-studded collection calls us to be
mindful of the physical world, to see it--really see it--with fresh
eyes. "(P)erhaps this is all that a person can try to put into each
of her days: attention to the radiance, a rise to the full chase of
beauty."</TE>

<HD>For Creative Kids, It's a Great Place to Hang</HD>
<DH>Let loose in a LACMA gallery, students transform the
neutral space into a lively, masterpiece showcase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven 11th-graders from Fairfax High School sat on the floor of a
gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art just over three
months ago and talked about how they could change that world.</LD>
<LD>   The museum had invited the students to turn a staid gallery with
22 masterpiece paintings and sculptures into a wholly different, more
exciting environment. The art was mostly mid-20th century Modernist
works by blue-chip artists, among them Piet Mondrian, Rene Magritte,
Isamu Noguchi, Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell. It is the kind of
work most 16- and 17-year-olds know only from textbooks, if at all,
so these students, all but one of them from Fairfax High's art magnet
program, had to learn everything about these works on the fly.
Reinstalling a major gallery in a major museum is not an incidental
task, but these seven had no fear of what they didn't know.</LD>
<TE>   In the gallery today, the students have clearly made their mark.
The classic off-white walls and dark-wood display cases are gone. The
sound of upbeat jazz resonates throughout. Text-covered bus benches
placed at the center of the gallery offer relief to tired visitors.
Mirrored walls sport silhouettes of cityscapes, and the art is
everywhere--hanging from the ceiling like billboards, standing on
pedestals in the center of the room, displayed in spiffy, new
plexiglass cases. Instead of a neutral environment, the students
created a metaphorical city, a lively place where art is inextricable
from life.</TE>
<TE>   So radical is the change from all the galleries that surround the
students' work that visitors cannot but stop and wonder what's up,
and that's just the point. LACMA hopes to find out how such a
different kind of place will affect the museum experience, for better
or for worse.</TE>
<TE>   "In the museum world right now, there's lots of debate about how
to install works of art," said Stephanie Barron, LACMA's vice
president for education and public programs and senior curator of
Modern and contemporary art. She spoke late last week at a reception
for the students in the gallery they'd rearranged. "I encouraged
these students not to think just of this gallery, but that they were
participating in the debate of how we look at works of art."</TE>
<TE>   Such inquiries into new ways of looking at museum galleries have
been undertaken by other museums, notably the Tate Gallery in London,
and are part of a campaign to attract and engage new audiences to
look at museums' permanent holdings. Much lies in the balance in such
attempts, as the cost of blockbuster exhibitions explode and
audiences remain difficult to attract.</TE>
<TE>   The students' gallery makeover was an extension of the museum's
education program known as LACMALab, an experimental program that
invites artists to engage with the museum and with young audiences.
In this case, the collaboration with Fairfax High was conceived by
L.A.-based conceptual artist Michael Asher. Well known for work that
challenges the practices of art museums, Asher felt that 11th-graders
would be smart enough to be creative and not yet sophisticated enough
to be inhibited by traditional museum methods.</TE>
<TE>   The students had to commit two afternoons a week for the last
three months of the school year, without credit or pay. They were
given a budget of $5,000 for materials and expenses and were told
they had to work with the museum's staff to ensure that the art would
be safe and treated respectfully. They also had to include all the
artworks already in the gallery room in their new arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, they could change as much as they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "The artworks were there," said student Daniel Madrigal. "Our job
was just to do it differently." One of his ideas was to expose the
backs of some of the paintings, which are normally hidden when hung
on the wall. Initially, he was told there would be nothing to see.
Undaunted, Madrigal insisted, and indeed, when the staff revealed the
backs of two works--Magritte's "The Treachery of Images (This Is Not
a Pipe)," from 1928-29, and Mondrian's "Composition in White Red and
Yellow," 1938--all sorts of labels documenting the work's exhibition
history and previous owners were there.</TE>
<TE>   The students were thrilled by the discovery and insisted that such
revelations make the works more interesting. Now the Magritte and
Mondrian are encased in transparent plastic boxes, front and back
revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Another student, Hannah J Koh, wanted walls with mirrors. "I was
very stubborn about the mirror idea," she said. "The mirrors expand
the dimensions of the art, and this gallery is the beginning of the
expansion." The mirrors reflect the space's lighting and the
artworks' refracted images, making the gallery a more complex,
jarring space.</TE>
<TE>   The students' installation, artist Asher said, turns some
long-held assumptions about presenting art upside down. "It reminds
us that the myth of the [gallery as] white cube is certainly a myth,"
he said. "The idea that a work of art can't go on a wall that has
other elements on it isn't true."</TE>
<TE>   Their tactics came from instinct, not schooling, although as art
students who have visited their share of museums, they were not
entirely naive, Asher said. "They know a lot about what they did."</TE>
<TE>   LACMA put some of its finest artworks on the line for the project,
at Barron's insistence. Indeed Magritte's "The Treachery of Images"
is arguably the museum's most famous painting. The results, she said,
exceeded her expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "I said from the start, if we were going to do this, they should
have the best work the museum had to offer." She told the students
about vistas leading into the gallery, about the need to show the
work to its best advantage. She told them that they needed to be sure
that their installation would augment the visitor's experience of the
art.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them this has to work even when you kids go away," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The students' installation is due to be taken down in September,
Barron said, but she's now reconsidering what to do with the space.</TE>
<TE>   "I may keep it up.... I'm not going to be in a hurry to take it
down. It's a little dull to put it back to the way it was, don't you
think?"</TE>

<HD>Her Sense of Security Died With Samantha</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are riding home from camp in the car, our radio tuned to an
all-news station. It is the day after Samantha Runnion disappeared; a
few hours before her body would be found, well before a suspect
arrested. Accounts of the manhunt and the crime provide the backdrop
for my daughter's account of her day--a dip in the pool, a morning
hike, an afternoon at a Dodgers game.</LD>
<LD>   When she finishes, the radio reporter's voice fills the car. Five
years old ... abducted ... lost puppy ... carried off screaming. I
hit the button to turn it off, but not soon enough. My daughter's
eyebrows knit and she turns to me.</LD>
<LD>   "Somebody took a little girl? Why would some man steal a child?"
For a moment, I'm not quite sure what she's asking. Until I see the
bewilderment in her eyes.</LD>
<TE>   At 11--heading for middle school, inclined to wear glitter on her
cheeks and the kind of skimpy tops Britney Spears wears on TV,
familiar with the suggestive lyrics of a host of rap CDs--this little
girl is still too naive to conceive of what is happening.</TE>
<TE>   Why would anyone steal a child, indeed? "Maybe she was kidnapped,"
my daughter suggests. "And her parents will have to pay to get her
back. Or maybe it's someone who wants a kid of his own. Maybe his
daughter died or moved away, and this little girl might look like
her."</TE>
<TE>   She turns to me for confirmation. And I have to tell her how wrong
she is; that this has nothing to do with greed or grief or misplaced
longing for paternity. That some people are simply so evil or sick,
they have sex with 5-year-olds for kicks. That there will be no happy
ending, just death and depravity. "It's hard to explain," I tell her.
"But there are people out there whose minds are so twisted, they want
to have sex with little kids. And sometimes they wind up hurting
those children. Or even killing them."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," she says. And she gets quiet, pondering this new idea. And I
am as saddened by the silence as she is chastened by the notion of
monsters who prey on little kids.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time that interpreting the news for children
has been difficult. There are challenges whenever we are forced to
explain grown-up scandals and tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   It was uncomfortable, to say the least, having to define "oral
sex" during the Clinton-Lewinsky era. And in the aftermath of the
World Trade Center attacks, I struggled to explain religious fervor
so extreme it led to the death of 3,000 innocents.</TE>
<TE>   But somehow, the brutal death of this young child seems more
intimate and threatening, and harder to put into perspective as we
search for its message and meaning. "Tell children not to talk to
strangers and what to do if approached, but don't give them the sense
that the world is an unsafe place." That was the advice from experts,
but it seems woefully inadequate. Because the world is a dangerous
place. And, as parents, we constantly straddle a line between our
responsibility to teach our children how to live safely and
comfortably in it and our desire to shield them from it. Each parent
draws the line in a different place, and each new tragedy forces us
to redraw it.</TE>
<TE>   Things that seemed reasonable to me before last week now suddenly
seem foolhardy. Like letting my two young daughters play alone in the
park while I sat inside its gym watching their sister's basketball
game. They were only 8 and 10, armed with nothing more than rules I'd
given them: Stay together at all times. Don't venture beyond the
swings. Run back to Mommy as fast as you can if anyone you don't know
tries to talk to you.</TE>
<TE>   How could I have believed that would protect them?</TE>
<TE>   And parents who once seemed to me irrationally overprotective now
seem like models of perspicacity. Like the friend who wouldn't let
his teenage daughter baby-sit for me because she wasn't allowed to be
alone "outside the walls" of his family's gated community.</TE>
<TE>   We all buy into the illusion. That same sort of logic led
Samantha's family to move from a tough neighborhood in Garden Grove
to a Stanton condominium complex, filled with friendly young families
like hers. Samantha was playing outside with a friend, just steps
away from adult supervision. She screamed and fought when her killer
grabbed her, just as her mother had taught her to.</TE>
<TE>   And none of that was enough to save her. How do we tell our
children that truth?</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing to worry about, I tell myself, as I lock the door
and head for work, leaving my daughters home alone. At 13 and 11,
they're not babies. They've spent plenty of time on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Yet midmorning, when I call and no one answers, I am seized by the
urge to run home. Minutes later, I pull into the garage and sit,
listening to the barking of our dogs, taking comfort for once in
their noise.</TE>
<TE>   Then the door to the house swings open and my bleary-eyed
11-year-old appears, roused from sleep by the dogs' commotion and
startled by the sight of my car. "I didn't know you were here," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Then why did you open the door?" I ask her. She wanted to make
the dogs be quiet, by showing them the empty garage, she says. "Well,
what if it wasn't me?" I say, and now I'm on the verge of yelling.
"What if someone had sneaked through that side door and was waiting
to grab you right here!"</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled by all my interrogation implied, she glanced at the
door--blocked by bikes, gardening tools and laundry piles--which had
never been considered a threat before. "You mean I'm not safe here,
in my own house, in this garage?" she asks. I walk to the door and
jiggle the lock, then come back and take her in my arms. "I'm sorry,
I just got carried away," I tell her. "Go back to bed. Of course,
you're safe in this house."</TE>
<TE>   But what I'm really thinking, I'm afraid to acknowledge ... not at
home, not anywhere, not now. It doesn't matter that Samantha's killer
may be in jail. The horror is that he exists at all.</TE>

<HD>A Man and His Muse</HD>
<DH>Dance and fitness teacher Ken Anderson has discovered he's
part of a secret society of devoted 'Xanadu' fans--confirmed by a
sold-out sing-along</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The muse first kissed Ken Anderson 22 years ago--not a chaste little
peck, either, but a big, wet Frenchy, you might say. It took place at
a midnight movie screening just a few weeks after the Berkeley native
had moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a Hollywood
filmmaker. From then on, Anderson's life would never be the same.</LD>
<LD>   Because there on screen, playing a modern-day Greek muse named
Kira, was pop chanteuse Olivia Newton-John in all her big-haired,
'80s-style Olivia glory. Alas, it was a role that practically
throttled the Aussie diva's budding film career and ushered in a
period of personal and professional upheaval--though she did meet her
future (and now ex) husband, Matt Lattanzi, on the set.</LD>
<LD>   The movie, of course, was "Xanadu," arguably the best musical
comedy ever made about supernatural love and roller-skating. A
meringue-light, proto-New Age remake of "Down to Earth" (1947), it
was shot in and around a very fetching-looking Los Angeles and
boasted dippy dialogue, sizzling dance sequences and an insanely
catchy disco-boogie score by Electric Light Orchestra and John
Farrar, Newton-John's longtime producer.</LD>
<TE>   "In the early '80s they didn't kick you out after one screening,
so every time I saw it I went multiple times," Anderson was recalling
the other day.</TE>
<TE>   Most critics pummeled the corny, innocuous little film, which
opened on Aug. 8, 1980. Film critic/historian Leonard Maltin's
verdict was typical. The movie, he wrote, was "designed as a showcase
for the singer, but the only thing it showcases is her total lack of
screen charisma."</TE>
<TE>   But in the years to come, the campy flick with the thumping
backbeat would transform the lives of scores of "Xanadudes" and
"Xanadames," creating an underground cult of "Museheads." Gradually,
Anderson has discovered that he's part of a secret society, whose
strength was confirmed by last Thursday night's sold-out "Xanadu
Sing-Along" at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood, part of
Outfest 2002, the annual L.A. gay and lesbian film festival.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a good movie, by a long shot, even then I knew that,"
Anderson said. "In retrospect I can't even figure out what it was,
but it had this huge, transcendent effect on me."</TE>
<TE>   To put it almost mildly. Today Anderson, 44, is still living his
own private "Xanadu" dream after being inspired by the movie's
dynamic choreography to chuck film school in favor of a career as a
Santa Monica dance and fitness instructor. He even drives a silver
sports car with a "Zanadu" vanity license plate (some unknown soul
had already claimed "Xanadu"). He has seen the film scads of times
over the years, owns the DVD and video versions, wears tank tops with
the "Xanadu" logo during his workout classes and can expound in
minute detail on the film's socio-cultural signifiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember there was this feeling that the '80s were going to be
very different from the '70s," he said, "and the movie had the
feeling that there were going to be all these different races and
generations and musics mixing together, and that it was going to be
something different. And now it seems very naive, but there really
was something euphoric about it."</TE>
<TE>   The muse appears. The muse goes away.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it takes a special kind of person to see utopian idealism
in a movie set in a roller-skating palace. Still, "Xanadu" does have
a philosophical streak. What else would you expect from a film about
a Greek demi-goddess who springs to life from a Venice Beach mural
and inspires a frustrated commercial painter, Sonny Malone, played to
somnambulant perfection by Michael Beck, to hold fast to his dreams?</TE>
<TE>   "Xanadu's" other star, the late tap-dancing matinee idol Gene
Kelly, brings a debonair cross-generational touch to the role of
Danny McGuire, a former big band musician, who long ago sold out his
dream and became a construction magnate, but yearns for one last shot
at running a jazz club.</TE>
<TE>   Given the iconic casting and over-the-top plot, it was all but
inevitable that "Xanadu" would be embraced as a gay cultural
touchstone, a camp classic beloved for its visual sensuality,
inadvertent double-entendres and aura of sincere sweetness. Even its
director, Robert Greenwald, who went on to helm "The Burning Bed,"
has trouble comprehending how the phenomenon took off.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that there was a huge following among young teenage girls
because I've gotten letters over the years," he said. "To be a little
bit elliptical, it was a time in my own life when retreating into a
fantasy world was a highly desirable and necessary thing for me."</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Kelley, programming director for Outfest 2002, remembers
seeing "Xanadu" "with a couple other nerd friends" at a mall in his
hometown of Gallup, N.M. "I wasn't immediately won over. I went to
see it for Gene Kelly, that's how gay I was. I didn't think they
respected the legacy of Gene Kelly."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's a total convert. "The things that it's most innocent
about are the things that are easiest to love," Kelley said. "It's a
mess of a movie, but it's our mess."</TE>
<TE>   A Fitting Tribute</TE>
<TE>   What better way to pay homage, Outfest reasoned, than with a
"Xanadu" sing-along at the Ford Amphitheatre, that arcadian bower
perched above the Hollywood Freeway's roar, across from the Bowl? And
what better way to put aside errant thoughts of, oh, the swooning
stock market, global warming and the pending U.S.-Iraq war?</TE>
<TE>   And so it was that, following the example of "The Sound of Music,"
"Grease," "Mary Poppins" and other Hollywood classics recently reborn
as group karaoke-fests, what some billed as the world's first
official "Xanadu" sing-along was held Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Outfest braced for some 1,200 Museheads to show up (which they
did), to lift champagne flutes, shout preemptive wisecracks at the
screen, flick their butane lighters during the ballads and cheer the
main characters toward a Hollywood happy ending. Costumes and props
were encouraged but, for safety reasons, roller-skates weren't. "But
we'll be skating in our hearts," Kelley predicted.</TE>
<TE>   A kind of "Wizard of Oz" for the pre-Reagan era, "Xanadu" was a
fairy tale that spoke in code language to its times and its largely
closeted devotees. Much like "The Wizard of Oz," which gained pathos
in hindsight because it opened in 1939, on the eve of global warfare,
"Xanadu" was a harmless cinematic bonbon that could be savored
guiltlessly before life started going to hell for some of those who
cherished it: It premiered the summer before the first murky news of
an obscure "gay cancer" hit the headlines.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a great date movie, whether your date had a beard or
not. "It was one of those test movies," said Anderson, who is gay.
"If he could sit through the movie, if you got it, you were sort of
like my kind of person."</TE>
<TE>   Pretty ironic considering that, for a time, Anderson "couldn't
tell anybody" about his secret "Xanadu" passion. Instead he'd claim
that his license plate referred to the fabulous mansion in "Citizen
Kane" or to Coleridge's famous poem. For Anderson, "Xanadu" was the
celluloid love that dared not speak its name.</TE>
<TE>   (This may be the place to recall that Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
1772-1834, writes of Xanadu in the first line of his poem "Kubla
Khan" as an enchanted palace within a walled garden, "a stately
pleasure dome." In a famous literary footnote, Coleridge later said
he had written the poem immediately upon waking from a long dream,
scribbling his recollections down as fast as he could. But before he
could finish, a businessman banging on his door broke the poet's
train of thought. The remainder of "Kubla Khan" consists of
Coleridge's fervent plea that a muse materialize and help him
retrieve his fleeting impressions. The poem's imagery is lush,
hallucinatory, extravagant. Reading it you may think, "Wow, what
drugs was this guy on?" According to Coleridge, it was a prescription
anodyne.)</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and other fans also believe that "Xanadu" is one of the
most evocative films ever set in Los Angeles, a city that always
seems to be half asleep, dreaming contentedly of itself. In the
movie, L.A. appears at its most air-headed and ephemeral, but also at
its most tolerant and open-minded. Museheads take pride in pointing
out that the cast is ethnically mixed (though largely in nonspeaking
roles).</TE>
<TE>   The city also looks ravishing, attired in the kind of
late-afternoon light that locals describe as "pearly." You might say
that Los Angeles itself is "Xanadu's" muse. "It [the movie] reveals
more about the time and place than I think it meant to," said Larry
Wilson, a professional magician and friend of Anderson's. "It's so
L.A., in the clothes and the look and the peoples' concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Missed the Sing-Along</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, Anderson was heartbroken when he found out he
couldn't attend the sing-along. But he had the best of excuses: By an
all-but-unimaginable coincidence, he had decided to design an entire
weekend of his dance-exercise class around a "Xanadu" theme, and he
would need to spend the day of the sing-along getting ready for it.</TE>
<TE>   His plans were all set. He would play only music from the
soundtrack, plus some other classic Olivia and ELO stuff. He would
decorate the Quest fitness and spiritual center in Santa Monica,
where he works as an independent contractor, with "Xanadu"
paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the handiwork was done by his partner, Bruce Zwinge, who
runs the costume shop for Cal State L.A.'s theater department.
There'd be "Xanadu"-themed contests and giveaways throughout the
two-day event, which was held Saturday and Sunday, two days after the
sing-along. Zwinge said that his partner had dreamed of throwing a
"Xanadu" party for years, and only learned of the sing-along by
accident a couple weeks ago. "I was shocked," Zwinge said.</TE>
<TE>   While Anderson and Zwinge were gearing up for the big weekend
bash, the sing-along went ahead at the Ford. Co-presented by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it attracted hard-core
Museheads and Olivia-istas, as well as the merely kitsch-curious.
"Every time you see it, it gets better, I guess because it's not as
bad as you remember," said Rod Pinks, wearing a blue Olivia T-shirt
as he sat with his friend Les Perkins munching baloney sandwiches and
potato chips before the show.</TE>
<TE>   Mia Jenner, a petite woman with long blond hair, turned up in a
long skirt, a "Xanadu" T-shirt and roller skates, but she wasn't in
much danger of losing her footing at the steep hillside venue. Named
"Miss Roller City 2001" after a Riverside County rink, Jenner says
she took up skating in the early '80s after seeing "Xanadu." "I
pretended I was Olivia Newton-John," she said, "because she got to be
a cartoon in the movie and she got the guy in the movie and she had
sisters."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief warmup by the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, the
movie finally started, and the audience began whooping and clapping
as soon as the first images flickered up on the 17-by-39-foot screen.
There were big cheers for Olivia and Gene Kelly's opening credits,
and a few scattered boos for poor Michael Beck. But everyone cheered
at the part where Newton-John skates up behind Beck on the Santa
Monica promenade and kisses him, then vanishes.</TE>
<TE>   As the action progressed, the interactions got louder and lustier.
Any sign of skin--an open shirt revealing luxuriant chest hair,
too-tight shorts on either male or female--was greeted with whistles
and applause.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. looked even better than remembered: Venice Beach, the
downtown skyline, the Hollywood Bowl and the Pan Pacific Auditorium,
an Art Deco landmark that burned down a few years after the film was
shot. Empathic yells greeted Newton-John's most memorable line: "It
must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really
matter to you."</TE>
<TE>   About 2-1 males-to-females, the crowd put its own spin on the
same-sex dialogue, as when Danny proposes that he and Sonny should
open a nightclub together:</TE>
<TE>   Danny: Kid, you're going to be my partner!</TE>
<TE>   Sonny: I don't know the first thing about being a partner!</TE>
<TE>   Danny: It's easy!</TE>
<TE>   Man seated in front of me: Sugar daddy!</TE>
<TE>   The movie is ludicrous, touching, excruciatingly badly acted in
parts and, well ... strangely and utterly charming. By the time
Newton-John launched into the theme-song finale, everyone was on
their feet, swaying and dancing in the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Then, too soon, the lights came up and the crowd was racing toward
the parking lot. Already the evening had begun to recede. In the cold
light of day, this ethereal scene would be hard to recapture. The
muse had left the building, and Miss Roller City 2001 was nowhere in
sight....</TE>
<TE>   A Xanadu Weekend</TE>
<TE>   Two nights and a day have elapsed since the sing-along. It's one
of those magical midsummer Saturday afternoons in Santa Monica. On
the sidewalk outside Quest fitness center, a modest two-story red
brick building at the corner of Broadway and 19th Street, Olivia
Newton-John's voice can be heard from inside, just a few blocks from
where a good chunk of "Xanadu" was filmed a generation earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Dripping sweat from every visible pore and shouting exhortations
through a head mike, Anderson is putting his spandex-clad pupils
through an Olympian workout. Several sport "Xanadu" T shirts and
black caps emblazoned with white letters: "Ken
Anderson--Xanadu--7/20/21-02."</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Anderson's Xanadu Weekend--A Place Where Dreams Come True,"
read the fliers out front, and it was clear that many of his students
believed it. "It's such an amazing thing, because what ["Xanadu"] is
saying is anything can change somebody's life, anything can be your
muse. And in Ken's case, it's literally true," said Larry Wilson, the
magician, who was wearing a cream-colored tuxedo and acting as the
event's master of ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   For the weekend, the studio was festooned with purple, blue and
white balloons. A giant reproduction of the "Xanadu" logo hung on a
wall. Outside the studio's front doors, Zwinge had built a miniature
replica of the Pan Pacific towers.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1 1/2-hour workout ended and the 30 or so attendees
toweled off and grabbed bottled water, it was time to hand out some
door prizes, followed by the day's piece de resistance: a karaoke
screening of "Xanadu."</TE>
<TE>   "He really follows his own heart more than anybody I've ever met,"
said Janet Andrea, a lawyer, as she watched Anderson dance with
another student, imitating Kelly and Newton-John. "He's writing a
book on 'Rosemary's Baby'--his other favorite movie. That is his
favorite movie. This is the movie that changed his life."</TE>
<TE>   A pleasant thought occurs: Maybe Anderson did find a way to make
movies his life after all. Outside the studio, the gentle Santa
Monica light danced across the palm trees and the freeway entrance
signs. For an instant, an ocean breeze rose up and brushed my face,
like a hand. Then the moment passed by and was gone.</TE>

<LD>Next day, Uncle Stanley, Peter and Sally visited the wildlife refuge
at the lighthouse.</LD>
<LD>   "I have another surprise for you," Uncle Stanley said. "We have to
be very quiet again."</LD>
<LD>   At the top of a hill they found about 30 albatrosses walking about
on their big, funny feet. Close by were many nests, each with a large
chick.</LD>
<TE>   "Why doesn't our chick have his nest here with the others?" Sally
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," Uncle Stanley said. "We think perhaps
one of his parents was born in that other place. Albatrosses and
other birds often return to their old nesting areas."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly a small cat darted from a napaka bush and scared the
birds. It bounded up to one chick and whoosh! The chick spat out a
stream of liquid. The cat turned and ran.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that!" Sally squeaked.</TE>
<TE>   "Cats and dogs are the worst enemies to albatross chicks. Rangers
say they kill dozens every year," Uncle Stanley said with a frown.
"We'll tell the ranger about this cat."</TE>
<TE>   "What was the stuff he spat out?" Peter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Stomach oil. Smells awful and the cat didn't like it one bit!"</TE>
<TE>   Peter had his camera with him and was busy taking pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "I can use these for a school project," he said. "We don't have
any albatrosses where we live in California."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's take a trip to the library next and see what else we can
learn about albatrosses," Uncle Stanley suggested.</TE>
<TE>   They found a book that had a picture of an albatross nest with one
big, creamy-white egg.</TE>
<TE>   "First the parents sit on their egg, and after the chick hatches,
they bring food. But one day they stop bringing food."</TE>
<TE>   "What?" both children cried. "They stop feeding their baby?"</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: The children discover the reason for the parents'
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Begley Kiehm has studied the albatrosses that live on the
island of Kauai in Hawaii. There is a large colony of them at the
Kilauea Lighthouse. A few "loners" have their nests in the cliffs.

<LD>What do you think these objects were used for? If you look carefully
you will see that the bowl is decorated with two polar bears and lots
of dripping icicles. And the shape of the bowl looks like an iceberg.
Did you guess that the bowl was used to hold ice for drinks? The
tongs were used to get the ice out of the bowl.</LD>
<LD>   But why use such fancy objects to serve something as common as
ice? The ice container and tongs were made by Gorham Silver Co. about
130 years ago. At that time you couldn't just reach into the freezer
for an ice cube. In places where winters are cold, ice was cut from
frozen ponds, rivers and lakes. This ice was stored in buildings so
that it could be used when summer came.</LD>
<LD>   Most of this ice was used to keep food cold so it wouldn't go bad.
But some people could buy ice to use as ice cubes in their drinks
when it was hot. This ice was expensive, so very special containers
were made to hold it.</LD>
<TE>   The decoration on the bowl doesn't just tell us what it was used
for. It also tells us about the history of our country. Right around
the time that the bowl was made, the United States bought Alaska from
the Russians. The polar bears and icicles symbolize this event.</TE>
<TE>   You can see these objects and many other types of containers at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For more information about
family activities at LACMA please call (323) 857-6598 or visit

<LD>* My favorite ride is Thunder Mountain at Disneyland. It makes me

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Jurassic Park at Universal Studios Hollywood
because it's scary. It also gives you a lot of chills because at the
beginning it is fun, then it's scarier by the minute. There are a lot
of dinosaurs and they are very scary too.</TE>
<TE>   --Abisai, 10</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Street Elementary</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I like this
ride because it is fast and fun and dark.</TE>
<TE>   --Marissa</TE>
<TE>   Park Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Bigfoot Rapids at Knott's Berry Farm. I like
it because it's fun to ride the boat and we get wet from the water. I
also like the sound. It makes me and my family get scared.</TE>
<TE>   --Amanda, 9</TE>
<TE>   Westmont Summer School</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Splash Mountain at Disneyland. It makes me
feel like I am flying when the ride goes down the mountain. You get
really wet and it goes down fast. I like it because you're in a dark

down the mountain.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a shaved pate, trim build and clear blue eyes, John Biroc has a
mien that is both cerebral and serene, like a mathematician
moonlighting as a yoga instructor. But the 63-year-old therapist's
actual job is quirkier. Biroc is a motivational coach for the mosh
pit scene and a hand-holder for rap rockers.</LD>
<LD>   Biroc's client niche is a loud and unusual one: He works only with
young rock musicians, most often tattooed, pierced and angst-ridden
modern rock bands but with an occasional mellow songwriter tossed in.
On a busy day, that makes his Encino office resemble the backstage
scene at the Roxy. "My colleagues who share the waiting room have
gotten used to it," Biroc says matter-of-factly. "They've learned to
expect anything when they open the door."</LD>
<LD>   Incubus is among the more famous clients to pass through that
waiting room, and band members have not been shy in publicizing their
session work with Biroc. They have hailed him in interviews and in
the liner notes of their albums. Singer Brandon Boyd and drummer Jose
Pasillas are even featured with heartfelt testimonials in a slickly
produced infomercial for Biroc's practice.</LD>
<TE>   The infomercial (which Biroc distributes via discs that play it as
a mini-movie on computers) is part of the ramping up of his venture,
which he calls the Biroc Process. He has plans to launch a New York
office soon with the same core concept: Pairing mental health
professionals who have creative arts in their own backgrounds with
fledgling rock stars who need a steadying hand. The goal is to have
happier, healthier artists who can sidestep the trapdoors that lead
to an episode of "Behind the Music."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not therapy, it's coaching; it's about the future, not the
past," Biroc explains.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the celebrity business seems certain to have more
people like Biroc offering themselves as consciences-for-hire for
volatile or troubled artists. With films and albums determining the
fortunes, literally, of huge entertainment companies, there has been
a surge in the business of minders. Be it lavish recovery centers or
the "sober assistants" that shadow addiction-vulnerable movie stars
everywhere they go, personality trainers are becoming as common in
celebrity circles as personal trainers at local gyms.</TE>
<TE>   Biroc has nine coaches working for him as subcontractors, and he
says their past artistic lives are almost as important to their roles
as their mental health credentials. One, for instance, played bass in
a blues band and is a psychiatrist with a specialty in chemical
dependency. The coaches help their clients deal with creative blocks,
cash windfalls, drugs, booze, family stress, power struggles within
the band--all the things that make the dream factory a dangerous
workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Often the subtle threats are the most common, says Paul Fried, a
bass player in the Calabasas quartet Audiovent, which released its
debut album on Atlantic Records last month. Fried at first sought
care from Biroc on his own, then brought in his bandmates to hammer
out some problems within the band dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a band you have to be able to communicate, and we wanted to
be able to do that and treat each other in a nicer way," Fried said.
"We learned a lot from him. We learned to identify what is important
and to please ourselves first. Those are feelings we can control.
When you have six or seven guys packed into a van, little things can
cause built-up resentment and animosity, and you have to be able to
deal. Then you can just make music."</TE>
<TE>   Biroc played drums in a band during a stint in the Army that saw
him stationed in Newfoundland in the 1960s, but the group had far
more enthusiasm than talent. The experience taught Biroc a lot about
the nature of collaborative creativity. He says his fleeting career
as a baseball player in the farm system of the Chicago Cubs offered
more insights into the team dynamic. His worldview is rounded out by
a USC doctorate in humanistic existentialism, 18 years as a theater
professor at Cal State Northridge and his training as a family and
marriage therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Biroc is clearly tickled by the generational bridges he crosses on
the commute between personal and professional life. He has season
tickets to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but the first radio station
programmed in his car is KROQ-FM (106.7), the modern rock outlet that
makes stars of his clients. He reads Rolling Stone and fields calls
from Kerrang magazine but still refers to sex as "hanky-panky" and,
if impassioned about a topic, tends to exclaim "Oh, my goodness!"</TE>
<TE>   Biroc is loath to detail too much of his casework for reasons of
confidentiality. He will say that many clients bring tales of drug
escapades and other excesses, but the Biroc teams are focused on
making the band a successful entity, so the sessions veer more toward
group politics than toward individual disorders.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst is when they are so drugged-out by the time I see them
that there is little we can do for them," Biroc says. "What we want
to deal with is getting them over creative blocks, the stress blocks,
how to deal with each other. We're looking at someone who is fairly
creative to begin with. If we get one totally hooked on drugs, we
spend so much time dealing with that one person, we're not going to
be able to help the band. We'll refer that one to someone else and
then we continue to work with the band. We don't want anything to bog
us down."</TE>
<TE>   For a young band, the dreaded sophomore album effort is an
especially searing trial by fire. "Think about it: The band comes in
with all of these ideas they've worked on for years and they put out
their first album," Biroc says. "They're flying high. They get all
this money and attention. And then the record label says, 'Now do it
again.' And the artist is just paralyzed."</TE>
<TE>   The sessions are not confined to the office; band members on the
road teleconference with their coach to discuss internal relations
and new challenges. Biroc expects that at some point, the coaches
will travel with the bands. As for the bills, sometimes the band pays
directly (as Incubus does), but more often the services are
contracted by the record label or band manager. Biroc says his
clients have included acts represented on the rosters of Jive, EMI,
Epic and other labels.</TE>
<TE>   This entire couch trip will probably induce nausea among rock
purists who already view the latest generation of rock as too whiny
and too beholden to commerce. Others, though, may reflect on Kurt
Cobain, Jim Morrison and Keith Moon and decide that proactive help
for young artists is a godsend. There is fodder for either point of
view in the ominous final line of Biroc's brochure, the phrase
printed in the page's largest type: "Don't lose your valuable
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Although Biroc says his business is healthy, the grim economics of
the music industry make the future uncertain. He views it in almost
clinical terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The record companies are really depressed," he says. "One of the
things I heard from Jive/Zomba is, 'Gee, we'd like to use you more,
but we're short on money.'</TE>
<TE>   "My viewpoint is if they don't do this, they won't make money
either. They're going to keep losing artists through
self-destruction."</TE>

<LD>   DreamWorks' gangster film "Road to Perdition" climbed to No. 1 in
its second week, grossing $15.4 million to edge out Sony's
high-profile family sequel "Stuart Little 2," which debuted with
$15.1 million. "Road to Perdition" managed the feat despite being on
nearly 1,100 fewer screens than "Stuart Little 2."</LD>

<HD>Eliminating the Short Cuts</HD>
<DH>Movies* In 'Road to Perdition,' film editor Jill Bilcock
uses classical techniques, a departure from the flashy works she's
become known for.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of the first scenes of "Road to Perdition," the taciturn mob
enforcer Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks, wends his car down
the snowy driveway to his house.</LD>
<LD>   Seamlessly, as if the audience were seeing Sullivan's wife and two
boys as he would see them through the windshield, the camera captures
their reactions to his arrival. In one cut, Sullivan's wife, played
by Jennifer Jason Leigh, smiles shyly. In another cut, his sons stop
throwing snowballs at one another and anxiously dust themselves off.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the last cut, the camera is positioned so that the
audience feels as if it is standing in the snow, watching Sullivan's
black car pass by as his son runs along behind it.</LD>
<TE>   In that brief, wordless scene, director Sam Mendes and film editor
Jill Bilcock deliver the first, telling impressions of each member of
the Sullivan family.</TE>
<TE>   Bilcock, a 54-year-old Australian film editor whose imprint on the
movie is receiving attention from critics, has spent the past decade
alternating between small Australian films and a wide range of U.S.
films. But "Road to Perdition," which was released earlier this
month, shows off her classical style rather than the flashy cuts
she's become known for in films like "Romeo + Juliet" and "Moulin
Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   According to Bilcock, the stillness of "Road to Perdition" was the
result of performances she "didn't have to carve around."</TE>
<TE>   "It was lovely to be able to stay with the actors," she said from
London last week where she and Mendes are finishing interviews for
the DVD version of "Road to Perdition." "I didn't have to cut away
when their performance went a little wobbly at times."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hanks and Leigh, the cast is stacked with
critically celebrated screen actors such as Paul Newman, Daniel
Craig, Stanley Tucci and Jude Law.</TE>
<TE>   Bilcock said one of her favorite scenes occurs in a diner, where
Hanks and Law sit at separate tables, facing each other.</TE>
<TE>   It is a pared-down exchange and each tight shot of Hanks shows the
same trickle of sweat crawling down the left side of his face.
Bilcock proudly describes the editing as "gaunt."</TE>
<TE>   "The gangster movie is almost unknown in Australia," Bilcock said.
"I had always done comedy and dance, where I dealt with rhythm, but
this offered me a chance to do rhythm I had never explored before. I
had never done a story where it was unspoiled and there was a bit of
a mystery."</TE>
<TE>   Bilcock came to Mendes' attention in 1998, after she finished
editing the Academy Award-nominated love story "Elizabeth." He was
shopping around for an editor to work on a script called "American
Beauty," and asked if she would meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't about the movie ['Elizabeth']. You can't judge an
editor by what they edit," Mendes said Monday. "You want someone you
can spend 12 weeks in a room with and share the journey of putting
the movie together."</TE>
<TE>   Bilcock was already committed to cutting "Moulin Rouge," a
psychedelic musical from director Baz Luhrmann, for whom she had
already done "Strictly Ballroom" in 1992 and "Romeo + Juliet" in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   With each of Luhrmann's films Bilcock escalated the speed of
rapid-fire scenes, forcing the viewer to try to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   But Mendes was still determined to work with her for a film with
an even tempo and an almost "still" tone.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of story crammed into 'Road to Perdition' in under
two hours," Mendes said. "So, you have to balance explosive moments
of violence with long scenes that are almost elegiac."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he had secured the deal for "Road to Perdition,"
Bilcock was wrapping up final edits in Australia on "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   "He said he would send me a script, but that the movie would look
very different from that because there were a lot of changes in
progress," Bilcock said. "When I read it I felt there were characters
as bizarre as Robert Mitchum in 'The Night of the Hunter' (1955). I
could tell the way he was talking it wasn't going to be a cliche
gangster movie."</TE>
<TE>   Film editors are like chefs who mix, cut and assemble the
ingredients into a feast. Save for research on the set during the
filming, most of their work is done in a windowless editing room
weeks after the cast and crew have moved on to other projects.</TE>
<TE>   With "Road to Perdition," filming began in March 2001, and the
final edits were not completed until four months ago. Editing can be
tedious work, but it is high-stake decision making.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, one of the most crucial scenes in "Road to
Perdition," in which Hanks stands in the pouring rain, confronting
his enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt there was something not quite right about it," Bilcock
said. "So, we pulled out the sound at the last minute, and it helped
it tremendously because it was shot at night in all that rain and it
was so stylized, it almost needed that stylization pushed further to
make it believable. Sometimes if you don't take shots like that to
their limit, they backfire on you."</TE>
<TE>   Because film editors work so closely with directors, a club that
is predominantly male, many people assume Bilcock is an exception as
a female film editor. But she's part of a boisterous club of
successful film editors who have been excelling at the trade for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most renowned film editors are Thelma Schoonmaker, who
cut Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull" in 1980 and now is working on his
big-budget Miramax film, "The Gangs of New York"; Anne V. Coates,
whose first big film was "Lawrence of Arabia" in 1962, but who most
recently cut "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and this year's "Unfaithful";
and Sally Menke, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1995 for "Pulp
Fiction."</TE>
<TE>   "There have always been a lot of women editors," said Coates.
"Women have a lot of patience, and they deal with problems between
directors and producers a lot more tactfully. Because we're mothers,
we can handle directors well, who are really like little children."</TE>
<TE>   Menke, who is also back in the editing room this summer--for
Quentin Tarantino's film, "Kill Bill," starring Uma Thurman, Daryl
Hannah and Lucy Liu--said some directors even suspect that women
bring a certain facile touch to what is typically considered "a
rough-and-tumble scene."</TE>
<TE>   There is also an infinite amount of patience and tenacity. For the
most critical and difficult scene in "Road to Perdition," where
Hanks' character confronts Newman's character in the pouring rain, it
took a long time before Bilcock and Mendes were able to make it feel
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Compatibility is essential with the director," Bilcock said,
"because everyone is at their most fragile before they screen it to
anyone. You have to have that ability to make someone feel safe
enough to try anything."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Mendes asked her to pull the sound out of the climactic
scene, a decision that Mendes felt made it less "literal."</TE>
<TE>   The time and emotional toll of getting to that point? Bilcock had
recut the scene hundreds of times over the course of 15 weeks.</TE>

<DH>Marvin Smith grooves in the clubs, but he's not ready to
give up his 'Tonight' day job</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By all accounts, drummer Marvin "Smitty" Smith has a cushy job.</LD>
<LD>   As the rhythm backbone on a television orchestra known the world
over as the Tonight Show Band, for about one hour each weekday
afternoon he sits on a studio bandstand churning out musical
vignettes and covers of rock songs in small spurts, and sending off
the odd joke cracked by host Jay Leno.</LD>
<LD>   So quick 'n' sweet is his day gig--a rim shot here, a drumroll
there--that sometimes Smith gets itchy for the raw challenges of
playing in a jazz club, which is what he did for 14 years in New York
before he began his tenure at "The Tonight Show" in January 1995.</LD>
<TE>   At such times, Smith gets out of the air-conditioned NBC studio in
Burbank, packs a pared-down drum kit and high-tails it to some tiny
venue around town. He did it last week for three nights, and as the
musician bounced from TV Land to the intimate setup of a Hollywood
jazz cafe, supplying droll beats and channeling subtle grooves were
all within one day's work.</TE>
<TE>   But before the jazzman can embark on a journey back to his club
roots, he has business to attend to. A recent muggy afternoon finds
Smith on the same Burbank sound stage he has been on for the past 7
1/2 years. "The show begins when the band starts to play," a "Tonight
Show" emcee informs the studio crowd, already astir in their seats at
the prospect of appearing on television. Smith assumes his position
at a fancy-looking drum kit, behind a transparent plexiglass panel
set against the show's instantly recognizable backdrop of the Los
Angeles skyline at night. The shield is meant to muffle the
snap-and-crackle of the drums; after all, this is a talk show, and
guests and host need to hear each other. "If you got the drums just
wide-open bleeding into every microphone, you're not gonna hear a
thing" on television, he explains.</TE>
<TE>   With the first commercial break underway, Smith &amp; Co. launch into
a soul groove, and the audience of 380--casually dressed and
suspiciously better-looking than the average populace--leaps out of
its seats to shake a heel.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner do they quiet down than guest Dana Carvey marches on
stage busting a collection of moves that range from his demented
version of a Russian folk stomp to break dance. Smith drums up an
appropriately eclectic beat to back up his routine.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of jazz musicians pretty much frown on doing a job like
this, because they feel it's not creative and it's somewhat beneath
the lofty aspirations of being a true artist," says Smith after the
show. "We're looked upon as sellouts who just took the money and ran.
On the flip side--it's steady work, there's good money in it, and
it's easy to do. And you can make a good living, which of course," he
says and chuckles, "is the other [thing] that every jazz musician
aspires to."</TE>
<TE>   The band then launches into a cover of the Beatles' "Come
Together," as neon signs periodically flash the word "applause" to
remind the audience to clap. Of covering rock songs, Smith says, "I
still look at it as an opportunity to make music; I'm not
compartmentalizing the stylistic idioms per se, thinking, 'Oh, I'm a
jazz musician, I'm better than that.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's all music; you still have to have a mind and creativity and
some intellect to make a rock song sound good." He takes inspiration
from his jazz hero Max Roach, who played with the likes of Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker but enthusiastically collaborated with
musicians from other genres.</TE>
<TE>   When the taping of the show wraps, Smith steps off stage cradling
part of his drum set. "Oh, man, there's a crack in my cymbal," he
says, frowning as he inspects it. Thankfully, he has spare drum kits
at home--lots of them. "If you talk to my wife she will probably want
to sell you some," he says with a smile. With that he's off to
prepare for the set he is playing later in the club, already, as he
put it, "vibing on the music."</TE>
<TE>   It's hours past dusk when Smith sets up his drum set at Rocco's, a
cavernous cafe with bare brick walls nestled on a gritty patch of
Hollywood's Santa Monica Boulevard, for a "late hit" with
pianist-composer Billy Childs and bassist Reggie Hamilton. The venue
has a cozy, lived-in feel that couldn't be further from the dizzying
hoopla of the "Tonight Show" studio. Several animal-print couches and
rows of chairs lined up like pews in a church bask in dim, honeyed
light. Peach curtains frame a tiny stage where plays are performed
before jazz musicians take over to jam late into the night.</TE>
<TE>   The set begins with a song called "Rubberman." A rapt audience of
13 sits quietly through the jazz improvisations spiced with classical
stylings, which envelop the venue in a cozy cocoon of sound.
Smith--eyes closed behind his glasses--punctuates the fat grooves of
the stand-up bass with precise beats, as the piano leads the
performance. This is more of a legitimate challenge to his skills.</TE>
<TE>   When he moved from New York to Los Angeles to be on the "Tonight
Show," Smith says that playing for only one hour each day delivered a
big shock to his system.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just used to playing hard, and for hours at a time," he
says. "And then I get here, and I have to wonder, 'Gee, am I gonna
lose my technique?' That's why I keep practicing, and I'm always
praying for people to call me to play a club gig."</TE>
<TE>   More people trickle in; the musicians on stage fidget with
excitement. Childs pauses to introduce the next song and sips red
wine, poured by the owner of the establishment. "This is ... " the
pianist begins to characterize the piece.</TE>
<TE>   " ... really hard," Smith finishes the sentence. His drumsticks
dance, creating a delicate pattern, like the sound of rain rapping
gently on a roof.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be more sensitive in a club," says Smith. Even when
he takes flight in a solo, he does so without drowning out the
others. While there are no "applause" signs to serve as reminder, the
crowd, which has swollen to a couple dozen, erupts periodically in
claps and cheers. "It's always nice when you can feel that you're
making a connection with the audience," says Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The hour is late but the spirits high. The impromptu gathering of
musicians is now improvising on the margins of a ballad. From a
distance, Smith's drumsticks appear like butterflies in flight; he
drops them and picks up a set of brushes to caress the drum.</TE>
<TE>   He switches them for mallets, as the bass player drapes over his
instrument and the pianist dazzles with a solo. The band closes with
a song inspired, explains Childs, by George Orwell's novel "1984."</TE>
<TE>   With midnight inching ever closer, Smith is not showing any signs
of tiredness. "No, no, no," he protests. "Music is a life force. I'm
up for any opportunity to get up on the bandstand and create--I'm
down with that."</TE>

<HD>Daniel Ho's Accessible Melodies</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist-keyboardist Daniel Ho led the group Kilauea in six highly
successful smooth-jazz albums in the early '80s. In its better
moments, the band blended the lyricism of Hawaiian traditional music
with the catchy hooks of contemporary pop-jazz.</LD>
<LD>   But Ho, who was born on the island of Oahu, never quite found
Kilauea to be a sufficiently versatile vehicle for his musical
interests, which also embraced traditional and contemporary slack key
guitar playing, alternative pop, songwriting and singing. On Friday
night at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center Plaza in
downtown Los Angeles, he offered an attractive overview of his
numerous skills.</LD>
<LD>   Starting out with a solo slack key guitar version of the popular
traditional song "Hawaii Aloha," he then moved to an electric
keyboard instrument and was joined by bassist Steve Billman and
drummer Randy Drake for a group of Kilauea numbers, including "Waimea
Bay," "When You Grow Up" and "Exotic Isle." He finished off the set
with newer material, making what he described as his debut appearance
as a singer, backed by a quartet of vocalists (Faith Rivera, Christa
Gates, Siena Lee and Denise Tajiri).</LD>
<TE>   Ho never claimed to be an especially gifted improviser.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview a decade ago, when he still led Kilauea, he
minimized his spontaneous inventive skills in favor of his interest
in melody and communication. And his set at the downtown plaza
underscored the accuracy of his perception.</TE>
<TE>   His playing--on guitar and keyboard--emphasized melody,
occasionally adding some surprisingly rich harmonies, but for the
most part stressing accessible themes underscored by foot-tapping
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, in the process he affirmed--even in his vocal
numbers--the comfortable linkage between smooth jazz and his Hawaiian
musical interests. If anything, Ho's program made one wonder why he
has abandoned his connection with Kilauea, a group concept to which
he seems so well suited.</TE>
<TE>   The duo Skyler Blue (singers Lee and Tajiri, who also played
guitar) and solo artist Rivera opened the program with brief sets of
their gentle, folk-oriented tunes.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Drives Nominations for News Emmys</HD>
<DH>Television* PBS leads the tally, with 41 nods. ABC receives
26; CBS, 19. Fox News Channel is shut out.</DH>

<LD>Coverage stemming from the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath not
surprisingly dominated nominations for the 23rd annual News and
Documentary Emmy Awards announced Monday, with PBS amassing the most
bids in a year that saw a record number of submissions.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcast networks as usual garnered the lion's share of
nominations, with PBS totaling 41, while 26 went to ABC and 19 to
CBS. NBC and pay service HBO tallied 10 nominations apiece, and cable
network CNN earned eight. MSNBC and CNBC combined for nine
nominations, eight of those going to "National Geographic Explorer."</LD>
<LD>   Nine other networks received three or fewer nominations, though
Fox News Channel--currently the most-watched cable news channel--was
shut out.</LD>
<TE>   "The CBS Evening News" amassed nine nominations overall--seven of
those for the main newscast anchored by Dan Rather--while ABC's
"World News Tonight" totaled seven and "NBC Nightly News With Tom
Brokaw" took five, including three of four bids for outstanding
coverage of a breaking news story in a regularly scheduled newscast,
recognizing segments titled "Anthrax Attack," "Attack on America" and
"Kabul Liberated."</TE>
<TE>   CBS, meanwhile, split a dozen nominations among its three
prime-time newsmagazines: "60 Minutes," "60 Minutes II" and "48
Hours."</TE>
<TE>   PBS spread its nominations among a wide variety of programs,
including a handful for the documentary series "POV" and a quartet
for "Nova." Public television also claimed four of five nominations
in the science/nature and cultural/artistic programming categories.</TE>
<TE>   An installment of PBS' "POV" series, "Promises"--about children in
Jerusalem--will vie in the best documentary category with "CNN
Presents: Beneath the Veil," a pre-Sept. 11 documentary about
oppression in Afghanistan, and HBO's "Cinemax Reel Life: Legacy," an
Oscar-nominated film about life in a Chicago housing project.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Sept. 11, coverage areas garnering attention included
reports related to the worldwide AIDS problem and exploration of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based National Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences (a sister organization to the Academy of Television Arts &amp;
Sciences in North Hollywood, which presents the nighttime Emmys) said
it received 1,654 entries, a 15% increase over the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The awards, encompassing 28 categories, will be presented Sept. 10
in New York. The national academy is planning a series of events that
week under the heading "9/11 to 9/11: A Tribute to News
Professionals." The News Emmys will also feature the first life
achievement award, to former ABC News President Roone Arledge.</TE>

<LD>   Eminem, Elliott, P.O.D. Top MTV Nominees</LD>
<LD>   Rappers Eminem and Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott and the rock band
P.O.D. lead nominees for this year's MTV Video Music Awards with six
each, the cable channel announced Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Eminem's comic book-style clip for "Without Me," in which he
dresses up as a version of Batman's sidekick, Robin, was nominated as
video of the year, best male video and best rap video. Elliott's "One
Minute Man," which features rappers Ludacris and Trina, is up for
best hip-hop video and several technical categories.</TE>
<TE>   P.O.D.'s "Alive," which features an elaborate highway crash, was
nominated for video of the year and best group video. The band's
other hit, "Youth of a Nation," will vie for best rock video.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders for video of the year: "Fell in Love With a
Girl," by the White Stripes; "Gone," by 'N Sync; "In the End," by
Linkin Park, and "One Mic," by Nas.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Fallon of "Saturday Night Live" will host the awards

<TE>   R. Kelly's 'Heaven' Circulating on Airwaves</TE>
<TE>   Chicago rapper R. Kelly's song "Heaven I Need a Hug," his response
to his June 5 arrest on child pornography charges, was released to
radio stations nationally on Monday by his label, Jive Records.</TE>
<TE>   A Jive spokeswoman said there are no plans for the song to be
released commercially as a single. Though it will be on Kelly's next
album, "Loveland," no release date for the album has been set. The
song first got airplay last month on Chicago's WGCI-FM after the
rapper gave a copy to the station exclusively.</TE>
<TE>   In "Heaven," Kelly sings: "It's all because I'm famous/You know
what I'm sayin'/I mean if I wasn't famous/Then all this wouldn't be
happening...."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's arrest stems from a 26-minute videotape circulated on the
Internet and elsewhere. On it, he allegedly engaged in sexual
relations with a girl said to be 14 when the tape was made. Kelly has
denied the charges.</TE>

<TE>   ABC-Fox Showdown 'Not My Fight': Mac</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Bernie Mac has remained mum about Fox's decision to
schedule his Peabody Award-winning sitcom opposite ABC's "My Wife and
Kids"--two of the few prime-time network TV series starring blacks.
But fielding questions at a news conference in Pasadena on Sunday, he
finally spoke out.</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever I am, I have to play. I have to put on a good show," he
said. Moving the show to the 8 p.m. Wednesday slot, he said, was a
business decision--something he can live with.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Wayans, star of the competing program, doesn't agree, he
acknowledged. Wayans called to enlist his help.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my fight," Mac said he told Wayans, arguing that
there's room for both programs because they attract different
viewers.</TE>

<TE>   Rapper Actors Don't Cut It With Jackson</TE>
<TE>   Actor Samuel L. Jackson doesn't think much of the trend that is
turning rap singers into movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   "To take people from the music world and give them the same kind
of credibility and weight that you give me, Morgan Freeman, Laurence
Fishburne, Forest Whitaker--that's like an aberration to me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has appeared with rappers in supporting parts in films
such as the upcoming "XXX." And he applauds Will Smith as a rapper
who has won credibility as an actor. But he won't even look at a
script that gives a rapper a starring role, he told the Sacramento
Bee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my job to lend credibility to so-and-so rapper who's
just coming into the business," he said. "I know there's some young
actor sitting in New York or L.A. who's spent half of his life
learning how to act and sacrificing to learn his craft but isn't
going to get his opportunity ... because of some actor who's been
created."</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Cuaron, director of this year's Spanish-language hit "Y Tu
Mama Tambien," has been picked to direct "Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban," the third movie in the Warner Bros. film
franchise, to be released in summer 2004.... Ray Romano will make his
feature film debut playing an accountant who gets hit in the head and
thinks he's his favorite action star, in New Line's comedy "Action
Abramowitz." ... KNBC news anchor Paul Moyer has signed a six-year
deal with the station that sources say will bring him slightly more
than $3 million a year.... Phil Donahue's ratings dropped throughout
his first week on the air at MSNBC, and he wound up averaging 660,000
viewers per night, compared with 710,000 for CNN's Connie Chung and
2.1 million for Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel....
Filmmaker-playwright David Mamet says he's written a movie about the
creation of the Israeli air force that he hopes to shoot in
Israel.... Universal Studios has signed the Rock to star in a movie
based on the videogame Spy Hunter, Eonline reports.... Tim Robbins
will join Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon in "Mystic River," a film about
childhood friends whose lives become intertwined because of a murder.
Clint Eastwood is directing.</TE>

<HD>Puccini's in the Air</HD>
<DH>'La Boheme' at the Bowl is superb, sans costumes or
supertitles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A concert version of Puccini's "La Boheme" Sunday at the Hollywood
Bowl wasn't just a great night at the Bowl. It was a great "Boheme."</LD>
<LD>   This was all the more striking because it's harder to hold
attention or follow the action of an opera without costumes and
staging and, especially these days when we've gotten so used to them,
without supertitles. Hollywood Bowl Orchestra conductor John Mauceri
gave useful introductions from the stage and pointed out that there
was a synopsis in the program booklet. Still, many people must have
missed the intricate and comic line-by-line byplay between the
characters, but the cheers at the end indicated there was not much
lost in the way of communication.</LD>
<LD>   Credit Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, a superb cast of
singers--two of whom were assaying their roles for the first time,
all but one of them making Bowl debuts--and an amplification system
that delivered the voices strongly, clearly and with balance.
Puccini's ensemble writing could be savored in ways often obscured in
the opera house.</LD>
<TE>   Unencumbered with details of staging, Mauceri could maintain a
brisk pace, but doing that did not prevent him from exploiting nuance
and detail or expanding Puccini's lyrical lines gloriously. It would
be easy to single out how well he handled the big romantic climaxes,
but making a single line swell and ebb to signal the impact of Mimi's
death during Musetta's prayer is beyond the usual.</TE>
<TE>   Without supertitles, the singers had to project their characters
through vocal acting as in days of old, and here there was no
laziness or generality.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Vargas was a sensitive, ardent, gentle Rodolfo who soared in
the heights and brought world-class singing to the performance from
the get-go. Patricia Racette was a subtle and vulnerable Mimi. When
she asked Marcello how she should respond to Rodolfo's jealousy, it
was just one of her heartbreaking readings of lines that often sound
perfunctory.</TE>
<TE>   Singing her first Musetta, Christine Goerke went far beyond the
usual bombshell-with-a-good-heart interpretation. She certainly had
all the requisite sexiness, but she was also spontaneous and
innocent, qualities all too easily misunderstood by Marcello.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Gunn, who has sung at the Bowl before, sang his first
Marcello with great strength and dramatic interpretation, given that
he was reliant upon a score. Wait until he's entirely off-book.</TE>
<TE>   The ensembles were tight and vocally vivid. Though no director was
credited, the characters actually listened and reacted to one
another. Earle Patriarco (Schaunard), Alan Held (Colline) and Thomas
Hammons (Benoit and Alcindoro) created distinct personalities. The
Opera Pacific Chorus and the Mitch Hanlon Children's Chorus also
contributed strongly.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--He's long-winded. She's long-suffering. And the neutral
party in the middle of their marital strife has broken his own rule
about not getting emotionally involved.</LD>
<LD>   "Faith Healer," the 1979 Brian Friel play that opened Saturday at
the Globe Theatres' Cassius Carter Centre Stage, tells the tale of a
traveling Irish faith healer, "Fantastic" Francis (Frank) Hardy; his
neurotic-heroic wife, Grace; and Hardy's Cockney manager, Teddy.</LD>
<LD>   The premise is that sometimes--not often, but sometimes--Hardy may
actually have the ability to heal people. His private hell is that he
knows that on most nights, he's destined to fail. He recites the
names of Welsh and Scottish towns to summon his courage for another
performance.</LD>
<TE>   "I always knew, drunk or sober, when nothing was going to happen,"
says the glib, engaging, narcissistic Frank, played by Michael Rudko.</TE>
<TE>   No two characters are on stage at the same time. Each does a
lengthy monologue, with Frank returning for a second round.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith," by turns, is funny, sentimental, maudlin and screechy,
and ultimately it is more successful than it has a right to be, given
its spare setting and the fact that the characters are never allowed
to interact except in their rambling remembrances.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the three has made an existence of nursing grievances and
living for brief moments of fulfillment amid a long streak of tight
money and hard times.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a twisted man, with such a talent for hurting," says
Grace, played with spooky realism by Lizbeth Mackay. Grace gauges her
mental health recovery by how much she drinks, how much she sleeps
and how many cigarettes she smokes. The answers: a lot, a little, a
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Each has a different take on high points and low points of their
two decades on the road. As the play opens, the partnership has
dissolved, but information about when and how unfolds slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Those dozen people who did not return after intermission missed
the best stuff: Teddy's description of life with the battling,
boozing couple and his own determined attempt to make a star of a
bagpipe-playing dog.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Donoghue--despite a bad wig--is a superb Teddy, providing the
funniest and most gut-wrenching of the lines.</TE>
<TE>   The audience has to piece together the lies and truths of their
contrasting memories and delusions of Frank, Grace and Teddy. It
takes some effort, but it's worth it: The pain and the poetry of
their life together resonates. Have a little faith.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Sundays 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 25. $35-$45. (619) 239-2255. Running time: 2

<HD>These Actors Ply Their Craft for an Audience of Just One</HD>
<DH>Theater* Performers assume the roles of patients to help
medical students develop the empathy crucial to a good bedside
manner.</DH>

<LD>Shedding tears and feigning anxiety through 25 consecutive
performances is enough to emotionally drain any actor. But in her
role as an abused wife, Sarah Blevins feels especially obligated to
nail the part.</LD>
<LD>   Her character is based on an actual battered woman who agonized
over telling her doctor the truth. "She was too scared to say that
her husband was getting more abusive, and she feared he was going to
hurt the kids," says Blevins. "Most abused women want someone to
know, but they won't come right out and say it. I had to get that
across with my emotions."</LD>
<LD>   Between regular acting jobs, Blevins works as a standardized
patient for medical schools at USC, UCLA and Western University of
Health Sciences in Pomona. Medical facilities nationwide are using
actors who portray patients in one-on-one encounters to help medical
students develop a better bedside manner.</LD>
<TE>   "Not everyone who becomes a doctor is a people person," says
Cynthia Harrelson, a trainer of standardized patients at the Pomona
school. "The students know this is a safe place to learn those social
skills, and they're not going to kill anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Blevins, a full-time actor who was recently cast in "The Comedy of
Errors," opening at the Knightsbridge Theatre in August, is called
upon every couple of months to portray a standardized patient. Actors
make an average of $15 to $20 an hour for their work. "Rarely do you
get paid for theater work you do," she says. "This is my only paying
gig as of now."</TE>
<TE>   Harrelson says drolly that her job as trainer is equivalent to the
"director, casting director, co-author, set designer and craft
services." Actors are natural standardized patients, she says,
because they "spend their whole lives studying people." The job is
similar to a theatrical production for which an actor performs the
same role night after night.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's School of Medicine uses a core group of about 100 actors in
its program, according to program coordinator Liz O'Gara, whose
office shelves hold 16 bulky three-ring notebooks filled with
hundreds of head shots and resumes, labeled according to age and
ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   "I hire actors like anybody in Hollywood hires actors," she says.
"People send in head shots, and we audition them."</TE>
<TE>   The ability to improvise is a plus, since there's no script. "We
can't give them dialogue because we have no idea what the students
are going to say," O'Gara says. "They have the patient's background
and a character bio, what their personality is like, what their
attitude is toward doctors, what their expectations are.... By the
time they get to the performance, the actor knows the patient
intimately, and they'll know what an appropriate response is to just
about any question."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, O'Gara was performing with the L.A. Women's
Shakespeare Company when she joined a temporary project at UCLA,
which evolved into the medical school's year-round standardized
patient program.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for using actors as patients came from Stephen
Abrahamson, retired head of medical education at USC (which was the
first Southern California school to have a standardized patient
program). In 1964, he co-wrote the first scientific article on the
use of standardized patients. Abrahamson predicted in 1991 that, "by
the year 2005 or 2010, almost all medical schools will have
[standardized patients] for teaching and evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was that prediction correct, the national medical boards
gave the programs a shot in the arm with a mandate for standardized
patient testing to become part of the national boards beginning with
the class of 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, "there's no exam for physicians that measures how they
interact with patients," says O'Gara. "Almost every school in the
country has [a standardized patient] program, but not every school in
the country has the resources of actors that we have in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Cases involving emotional and psychological skills, she adds, are
the ones in which "the actors' abilities really are important."</TE>
<TE>   It's crucial that actors are believable, says Christine Sheppard,
project director at Western University of Health Sciences, because
the students' skills--and grades--depend on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Actors have the skills of memorizing and understand
improvisation," she says. "And we're often working within a limited
budget, so we need people who are going to pick it up quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Taking on such roles can be a challenge. "You have to be the kind
of actor who can come up with those tears over and over, and that's
hard sometimes after a long day of crying 30 times," Blevins says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the rewards can be profound. After portraying the abused
woman, Blevins was approached by a medical student. "He said, 'It's
OK, my mother went through this and you're going to get through this
just fine.' He gave me a big hug, held my hand, and he had tears in
his eyes. I thought, 'Oh, my God!'</TE>
<TE>   "I just went on with it like it was real because I thought, why
tell him, 'Oh, I'm just an actor'? So I just said, 'Thank you very
much.' "</TE>

<HD>Burning Issue Roils Company Town</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>It's a tale of two towns that are actually one and the same.</LD>
<LD>   In Norco, La., two women drive past the Shell chemical plant from
opposite directions as smokestacks burn off chemical gases with a
brilliant flare. The first woman, who is black, cringes at the
"frightening" sight; the second, who is white, sees it as a thing of
beauty, a symbol of economic security.</LD>
<LD>   That contrast marks the social split explored in "Fenceline: A
Company Town Divided," an earnest but plodding edition of "POV"
airing at 10 tonight on KCET.</LD>
<TE>   Activist Margie Richard, a longtime resident of the all-black area
that abuts the refinery, knows dozens of neighbors who have asthma.
She and others in the neighborhood--where only one resident works at
the refinery that Shell built along the community's "fence
line"--blame high rates of respiratory ailments, cancer and birth
defects on plant emissions. They are trying to negotiate relocation
money from Shell.</TE>
<TE>   The point of view of the town's majority white population is
voiced by various residents with long links to the refinery,
including a retiree who fairly quakes with tearful pride when
remembering company picnics and other good times. These residents,
who live farther from the plant, say they know of no illnesses caused
by emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers Slawomir Grunberg and Jane Greenberg eventually find
shades of gray in the opposing viewpoints. While the white residents
resent the way Shell's opponents portray the company and the town,
they also respond with grudging sympathy for Norco's black community.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers may grudgingly admire this film, which thoughtfully
examines the role of economics in the struggle between industry and
environment, but it moves slowly, at the pace of life in the
Mississippi Delta.</TE>

<HD>Acting in the Thick of Accents</HD>
<DH>Movies* The big names of yesteryear kept their American
pronunciation along with their personas. Not so in today's world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An imposing figure in a long, black military coat studded with brass
buttons appears on deck. His men salute, addressing him as "comrade
captain." He barks orders in a stern Russian accent that sweeps
viewers back to the Cold War era.</LD>
<LD>   Who is that tough Red navy officer with the stiff, bureaucratic
air and the voice as frosty as a Siberian winter? It's Harrison Ford,
that quintessentially American star who with his latest role as a
Russian submarine commander in "K-19: The Widowmaker" hopes to
surprise fans with a previously undiscovered talent--his ability to
flesh out his character with a foreign accent.</LD>
<LD>   It's a risky move for a marquee name with an established career,
says David Alan Stern, a former Hollywood dialect coach, now
professor of dramatic arts at the University of Connecticut. "If your
career and your public persona is based on a very strong identity,
certain elements of which never change, basically you're perceived as
a personality more than you're perceived as an actor. It's always a
huge risk if the public is going to accept you, regardless of whether
it's performed well."</LD>
<TE>   Almost every review of the film, which opened last weekend to a
disappointing fourth-place finish at the box office ($13.1 million),
made note of Ford's accent, some in a mocking manner: Entertainment
Weekly's Owen Gleiberman wrote that "[Ford] speaks with an accent so
slight it's like the speech equivalent of a fake mustache." Desson
Howe of the Washington Post wrote, "His Russian accent works at the
beginning of his sentences, then the American brogue creeps back in."</TE>
<TE>   Critics and audiences expect far more from American actors than
they once did. Decades ago, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda,
John Wayne and other top actors kept their heroic personas, no matter
the role. "It would have been surprising and a risk if they had
played a British lord or a Southern sharecropper," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   It was beyond surprising when Clark Gable donned a dubious Irish
accent for "Parnell" (1937) and stunning when Spencer Tracy won an
Oscar for playing Manuel, a Portuguese fisherman with a
not-so-authentic accent in "Captains Courageous" (1937).</TE>
<TE>   But today's movie stars must leap into all kinds of parts
requiring accents. In general, American actresses such as Meryl
Streep and Gwyneth Paltrow have had more success than their male
counterparts. Consider: Brad Pitt's severe Austrian accent in "Seven
Years in Tibet" (mein Gott!), Nicolas Cage's over-the-top Italian in
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin" (mamma mia!) and Kevin Costner's British
accent in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" (crikey!)--a performance
described as "More Sherman Oaks than Sherwood Forest" by one critic.</TE>
<TE>   Accents spin actors out onto thin ice, but when rendered
articulately they can be critical to the story line and add as much
atmosphere as location shoots and special effects. For "K-19," the
producer, star and dialect coach agreed that Russian accents were
necessary because of the film's global casting.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was the best decision," said dialect coach Howard
Samuelsohn. "We had British and Canadian and Icelandic actors and a
couple of real Russians, and Liam Neeson's Irish and Harrison is
all-American. Kathryn [Bigelow, the director-producer] thought they
should all sound like they're from the same world." (As opposed to
those old World War II movies in which the Yanks sounded like
themselves and the Nazis sounded like Prince Charles' polo team. Or
as in last year's "Enemy at the Gates," another military tale in
which some of the Russian and German officers had accents but the Red
army heroes spoke like Brits--Joseph Fiennes sounded like he went to
Oxford; Jude Law sounded like he went to a few pubs.)</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the accent in "K-19" was that Ford felt it
would help him play the character, Samuelsohn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Do a little of what your idea of a Russian accent is,'
and I heard him and thought, 'He can do this.' And he said 'It's my
grandmother.' So I felt confident all the way through."</TE>
<TE>   Samuelsohn and Bigelow agreed that the Russian accents should
sound as natural as possible. There would be no rolled Rs and no
confusion of Vs with Ws. (No Ensign Chekov from "Star Trek.")</TE>
<TE>   "I used Harrison as kind of the center of the wheel," Samuelsohn
said. "He was the guy that I wanted everyone to sound like whether
they were from Britain or Scotland, and if I couldn't get them to be
as Russian as I would have liked, I would err on the side of them
sounding more American, like Harrison."</TE>
<TE>   Neeson, who has worked extensively on stage and in Hollywood,
garnered an Academy Award nomination for his German-accented role in
"Schindler's List." (1993). Stern has also coached Neeson and
describes his natural northern Irish dialect as "Irish pronunciation
with Scottish inflection." Those listening very carefully might hear
it popping out occasionally in "K-19." They're probably Americans,
said Samuelsohn. "You don't hear the American accent because to
people who live in America, that is a neutral sound."</TE>
<TE>   Accents and elocution have always been a significant part of
traditional British dramatic training. But the U.S. has caught up.
The American regional theater movement, which spread like wildfire in
the '60s and '70s, created a demand for stage and screen actors with
sophisticated training. Colleges, universities and conservatories
have strengthened their programs in that area, and today's actors are
the proof. Streep's note-perfect performances in "Sophie's Choice"
(1982), "A Cry in the Dark" (1988), "The French Lieutenant's Woman"
(1981) and other films have raised the bar in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Streep studied at the Yale School of Drama. But on a movie set,
there's no time for Ivy League instruction. So, dialect coaches are
hired, sometimes to the tune of $7,000 to $10,000 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Brutal shooting schedules force coaches into tight deadlines; they
might get only a couple of sessions or rehearsals with the actors--if
there are rehearsals at all.</TE>
<TE>   Once filming begins, the coach usually disappears, unless an actor
has tremendous clout. In that case, the coach might be allowed on set
to listen carefully, giving notes between takes, as long as he or she
stays out of the way of the director.</TE>
<TE>   Some coaches do extensive historical and sociolinguistic research
to create the perfect accent. Gary Oldman's creepy speech in "Bram
Stoker's Dracula" (1992) was invented by the actor and dialect coach
Jessica Drake based on the historical figure Vlad the Impaler. "He
was a Magyar Hungarian kidnapped by the Turks as a child. He didn't
escape until he was 12.... The accent was Hungarian, Turkish and
Romanian. It was completely made up. But who's gonna argue when none
of us were there?"A small percentage of actors can learn simply by
hearing and repeating. Comedians and those with a gift for mimicry
master accents quickly, Stern noted.</TE>
<TE>   Today, American and Canadian actors with comedic roots fearlessly
tackle accents. In "Austin Powers in Goldmember," Mike Myers' speech
zigzags from Britain to Scotland, Belgium to Holland. Robin Williams
went Russian in "Moscow on the Hudson" (1984) and Bostonian in "Good
Will Hunting" (1997). Dan Aykroyd headed for the Deep South in
"Driving Miss Daisy" (1989). Tom Hanks talked Alabama in "Forrest
Gump" (1994), Louisiana in "The Green Mile" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   If the actor isn't a great mimic, smart dialect coaches capitalize
on other abilities, said Robert Easton, an actor and longtime accent
coach who calls himself "The Henry Higgins of Hollywood." "Some are
kinesthetic. I had a girl who was an American who had never done an
English accent. I watched the way she moved and said, 'You're a
dancer,' and she said yes, she had studied since she was 5. So I
worked with her on the physicality of the accent: Round the lips,
open the mouth, vibrate the vocal cords."</TE>
<TE>   Easton, a stammerer in childhood, believes anyone who wants to
work seriously is trainable.</TE>
<TE>   Samuelsohn says most movie stars will train like mad because they
think of themselves as actors first. Like Harrison Ford in "K-19,"
they crave the challenge, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to do 'Indy Jones in the Submarine of Doom'; he
wanted to play the part."</TE>

<HD>Amgen Says Drug OKd for Cancer Patients</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Aranesp provides an alternative to Johnson
&amp; Johnson's Procrit for treating anemia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEENA BEASLEY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology company, said Monday
that U.S. regulators approved its Aranesp drug to treat anemia in
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, creating competition for
Johnson &amp; Johnson's top-selling product Procrit.</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks-based Amgen said the Food and Drug Administration
would allow the sale of Aranesp, a longer-lasting form of the
company's older anemia drug Epogen, as well as Procrit.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, there is a benefit in terms of lower frequency of
dosing. The drugs are similar in efficacy, but there is a dosing
advantage," said Fariba Ghodsian, an analyst at Roth Capital
Partners.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen sells Epogen as a treatment for anemia in kidney dialysis
patients, but rights to the drug for other indications were licensed
early on to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which sells the same drug in the U.S.
under the brand name Procrit for patients undergoing chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that Aranesp is effective when given once every
two weeks, compared with Procrit's weekly dosage schedule. Both drugs
must be injected or given intravenously.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp was launched last year as a treatment for patients with
chronic kidney disease. The drug, which saw first-quarter sales of
$39 million, has so far been targeted mainly at kidney patients who
are not on dialysis.</TE>
<TE>   With the approval for cancer patients, analysts estimate combined
sales of Epogen and Aranesp will reach $4 billion a year by
2005-2006, compared with 2001 Epogen sales of $2.2 billion and J&amp;J's
total anemia drug sales last year of $3.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   All three drugs are versions of epotein, the bioengineered form of
a human protein that stimulates production of red blood cells.</TE>
<TE>   Anemia results from a shortage of oxygen-rich blood cells, leaving
patients feeling weak and unable to perform daily tasks. The
condition occurs frequently in patients undergoing chemotherapy,
which kills both cancerous and healthy cells in the body.</TE>
<TE>   UBS Warburg analyst John Sonnier in a research note said he
believes the Aranesp approval for cancer patients represents "the
single most important growth opportunity for Amgen."</TE>
<TE>   Anemia will strike about two-thirds of the 1.2 million cancer
patients in the United States treated with chemotherapy this year.</TE>
<TE>   Recent reports that another Johnson &amp; Johnson anemia drug, Eprex,
has caused 141 cases of a rare but potentially fatal blood disorder
called pure red blood cell aplasia also could benefit Amgen, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eprex is sold only outside of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this could help Amgen get market share in Europe ... but
even in the U.S. some physicians would rather go with something that
doesn't have that sort of shadow hanging over it," Ghodsian said.</TE>
<TE>   With annual revenue of more than $4 billion, Amgen has relied on
Epogen and Neupogen, an immunity booster for cancer patients, for
nearly all of its sales.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said the FDA approved Aranesp for the treatment of patients
with nonmyeloid cancers, which are solid-tumor cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Myeloid cancers, such as leukemia, involve disease of the bone
marrow.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's shares closed down 18 cents at $35.28 in trading on
Nasdaq. J&amp;J shares closed up 68 cents at $42.53 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Michaels Leaving Helm of Clear Channel</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: Move comes as the company attempts to fend
off critics who accuse it of being anti-competitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Michaels, a former "shock jock" who became perhaps the nation's
most powerful radio executive as head of Clear Channel Communications
Inc.'s 1,200 radio stations, will step aside to head a newly created
think tank for the company that will focus on emerging wireless and
satellite technologies.</LD>
<LD>   Michaels attended a meeting with Clear Channel President Mark
Mays, and "the conversations led to Randy making the decision to move
on to this new area," said company spokeswoman Diane Warren.</LD>
<LD>   Michaels, 50, could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement rocked employees at Clear Channel and music
executives on both coasts.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes as Clear Channel is seeking to fend off
congressional critics who say it engages in anti-competitive
practices and questionable deals with independent record
promoters--middlemen paid by music labels to pitch songs to station
programmers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Michaels met with the heads of several major record
labels about independent promotion--a practice the music industry now
says smacks of payola, or illicit secret payments made to radio
stations in exchange for airplay. Michaels took a confrontational
stance in the meetings and left major issues unresolved, according to
music executives.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said that Mays was "absolutely not" dissatisfied with the
performance of the radio operation. Clear Channel plans to announce
its quarterly earnings next week, and there is "nothing funny or
unusual; we don't have any surprises to announce."</TE>
<TE>   A vocal proponent of media consolidation and of sometimes
controversial money-making strategies such as national contesting,
Michaels joined Clear Channel in 1999 when it bought Jacor
Communications, a radio chain that he was running.</TE>
<TE>   Mays will serve as acting chief of the radio division while
searching for a successor for Michaels. Warren said the new radio
boss would be based at the company's headquarters in San Antonio, not
at the current division office in Covington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Clear channel closed down 18 cents on Monday at $29.94
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Apartment rents across Southern California rose modestly last quarter
from 2001 levels, reflecting a regional economy that is making small
gains in employment.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the six-county region, average rents for apartments in
the largest complexes rose by 7% or less, according to a report by
RealFacts, a Novato, Calif., research firm.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest increase came in San Bernardino County, where renters
paid 6.7% more than a year ago, or an average of $862 per month
during the April-through-June period. Orange County recorded the
smallest increase at 1.8%, to an average of $1,215. And in Los
Angeles County, average rents grew by 4% to $1,248.</LD>

<HD>Citigroup Aided Enron, Panel Says</HD>
<DH>Probe: The bank's stock plunges after a Senate subcommittee
says it and other institutions had a major role in arranging
questionable financing for the energy firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and other Wall
Street investment banks helped prop up Enron Corp. for years by
arranging more than $8 billion in complex financing transactions that
boosted the energy company's stock price and hid debt, according to
research by a Senate committee.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000 alone, the controversial funding deals helped Enron reduce
its reported debt by about 40% and inflate its operating cash flow by
50%, committee investigators found.</LD>
<LD>   In some cases, the bankers not only knew about Enron's
questionable accounting practices, but also marketed the transaction
concepts to other potential clients, investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations, which will be the subject of a Senate hearing
today, almost certainly will intensify questions about the role Wall
Street played in Enron's collapse last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating
whether investment banks intentionally helped the fallen energy
trader cover up its deteriorating financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the congressional and SEC probes focus on whether
investment banks helped structure deals so that loans to Enron would
be disguised as revenue-generating energy trades. That setup had the
dual effect of boosting reported revenue while minimizing apparent
debt--thus luring investors who thought Enron's financial health was
far rosier than it actually was.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the services of Wall Street, one wonders how far Enron
could have gotten in their efforts," said Henry Hu, a securities law
expert at the University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate permanent
subcommittee on investigations, is expected to probe the deals today
at a hearing in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The committee documents reveal that Citigroup played an extensive
role in designing some of the questionable Enron transactions. The
documents, released Monday, helped fuel a heavy sell-off of
Citigroup's shares, which fell $3.96, or 11%, to $32.04 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Arda Nazerian, a Citigroup spokeswoman in New York, said the
firm's bankers were assured by Enron that its accounting firm had
approved the deals.</TE>
<TE>   "The transactions we entered into with Enron were entirely
appropriate at the time, based on what we knew and what we were told
by Enron," she said. "We were assured that Enron's auditors had
approved them, and we believed they were consistent with accounting
rules in place at the time."</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan's role in Enron transactions had been previously
disclosed. The company has said it was mislead by Enron and did
nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee also is looking into many
of Wall Street's dealings with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   By portraying the financing arrangements as energy trades rather
than as loans, Enron clearly intended to mislead investors, some
experts said. However, many also say it is unclear whether investment
banks broke any laws.</TE>
<TE>   By their nature, the banks routinely design financial mechanisms
to make their clients' finances look as strong as possible, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Enron was anxious to reduce the debt on its balance sheet,
the banks probably came up with the uncommon financing deals as a way
to keep Enron's lucrative business, said John Coffee, a Columbia
University law professor. "One bank perfects a technique involving
this illusory characterization of loans and the other banks feel a
competitive necessity to do likewise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate committee documents show that Citigroup boasted that
the privacy involved in the deals, and minimal disclosure to
investors, were benefits of the transactions. In some cases, the
third-party investors that provided funds to Enron never knew exactly
where their money was going, investigators concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Had the transactions been properly disclosed, Enron's financial
problems would have come to light sooner, investigators said. The
company's stock price probably would have dropped, and credit
agencies would have lowered their ratings on the firm's debt, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, with the help of the banks, relied on a financing vehicle
known as a prepay. In its simplest form, prepays are arrangements in
which one party agrees to pay another for a service or product to be
delivered at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron used elaborate hedging techniques to essentially turn
prepays into secret financing deals, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than disclose the loans as debt, the company used the deals
to increase its cash flow from operations, investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Enron reported the prepay deals as debt for
income tax purposes, so it could deduct the interest.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup arranged more than half of the Enron prepay deals,
helping to raise $4.8 billion in 14 transactions over six years, the
committee found.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase arranged about $3.7 billion in 12 transactions.
"By design and intent, the prepays as structured by Enron and the
financial institutions made it impossible for investors, analysts and
other financial institutions to uncover the true level of Enron's
indebtedness," according to congressional documents.</TE>
<TE>   The documents described a transaction with an entity known as
Yosemite. Citigroup helped Yosemite issue about $800 million in
bonds, which were bought by private investors. Yosemite then lent the
money to a Citigroup-controlled entity called Delta Energy Corp.,
based in Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Delta and Enron then entered into a prepaid contract, based on the
spot price of crude oil at a future date, and Delta paid Enron the
$800 million upfront.</TE>
<TE>   A series of hedging transactions effectively canceled each other
out, and by the maturity date of the contract, the $800 million was
cycled back to Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, every six months Enron made a payment of about $29
million to Delta, which in turn paid Yosemite, representing an
effective annual interest rate of 7.25% to Yosemite's bond investors.</TE>
<TE>   The net effect of the transaction was that Enron borrowed money,
but it didn't show up as debt on the firm's books.</TE>

<HD>Foreign Markets Follow U.S. Down</HD>
<DH>Bourses: Brazil and Europe see steep losses, but Asia
continues to hold up well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS, MARK MAGNIER and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>When Wall Street sneezes, the rest of the world gets a cold, but so
far it has not been a case of pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   With U.S. markets being pounded in recent weeks, foreign markets
have been playing follow-the-leader. On Monday, as major U.S. indexes
fell about 3%, stocks also slid around the globe. European losses ran
about 5%, and Brazil was down 6.5%.</LD>
<LD>   Asian markets fell Monday in advance of Wall Street's opening. But
today, many Far Eastern markets were rallying early on, retaining
their relative leadership role this year.</LD>
<TE>   In Tokyo, the Nikkei-225 index was up 0.5% in early trading; South
Korea's main index was up 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Although foreign markets often take their cue from Wall Street,
local issues can be more important in determining share price trends.</TE>
<TE>   The optimism buoying many Asian markets this year is based on
growing trade lifting all economic boats. Meanwhile, in Latin
America, many investors are queasy about debt levels, principally in
Argentina, which has defaulted, and in Brazil, which some economists
think may follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, the strengthening euro is expected to help the region's
stock markets in the long run, though it hasn't halted steep declines
this year. For U.S. investors in Europe and elsewhere, however, the
dollar's weakness has helped cushion foreign market losses this year.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of economic weakness and a distrust of reported earnings by
corporations fed the case of nerves of an already jittery European
trading community Monday, sending many stocks to multiyear lows.</TE>
<TE>   But in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank analyst Bernd Meyer was more
philosophical than frantic.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in a downturn for a couple of years now," he said,
noting that conservative earnings forecasts by major companies have
presented more positive surprises to shareholders than the kind of
unpleasant shock associated with WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects a continued bumpy ride on the continent while
U.S. markets respond to the corporate management scandals roiling the
economy. "Europe will react as strongly whether the trend is up or
down."</TE>
<TE>   Summer market trends tend to be exaggerated because many Europeans
are on vacation and they pay less attention to their portfolios than
they do during the rest of the year, Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the gloom, however, some analysts around the world have begun
advising clients that stocks may be undervalued and therefore a good
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Exports are growing, and we seem to be getting into a better
cycle," said Yoshiide Mukoyoshi, economist with Kokusai Securities in
Tokyo. "So for investors, it's a positive time to buy stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Asian markets have tended to slavishly follow their much larger
U.S. counterpart, but some analysts see signs that this pattern is
changing. "Asia is parting ways with the U.S.," said Jahanzeb Naseer,
a Hong Kong-based strategist with HSBC Asia. "It's a slow process,
but it's happening."</TE>
<TE>   One reason, they said, is that many Asian industry and equity
markets already went through a difficult restructuring after the
1997-98 currency crisis, even as U.S. markets were racing ahead. This
leaves them less vulnerable to declines and more resilient on the
upside.</TE>
<TE>   Although Asia still has a long way to go before it solves its
banking and corporate debt concerns, several countries, led by South
Korea and Thailand, are stepping up efforts to tackle the problems,
analysts said. And rising markets tend to make people forget the
worst of their difficulties, at least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   Asian nations are benefiting from rising U.S. demand as exporters
move more inventory overseas. This is complemented by improved
political stability and solid domestic demand in some markets, as
countries cut interest rates and ease their monetary policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're quite bullish for Asia next year," said Robert Subbaraman,
Asia analyst with Lehman Bros. in Japan. "We think domestic demand
will make a full-fledged recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Nikkei index is down 3.4% this year, compared with the
28.6% plunge in the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Asian markets were not down nearly as bad as expected" on
Monday. Subbaraman said. "A lot of problems in the U.S. seem to be
more U.S.-focused."</TE>
<TE>   In Latin America, Mexico's main index fell 3.5%, Argentina's by 4%
and Chile's by 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest damage was in Brazil, where the leading stock index
fell 6.5% and bonds weakened on reports that a new poll would show
leftist presidential candidate Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva
maintaining his commanding lead in voter preference ahead of the
November election.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street is nervous about a Da Silva victory because he has
said that he would consider stopping payment on Brazil's $400 million
in public debt and that he might halt the nation's practice of
privatizing state-owned companies and services.</TE>
<TE>   David Malpass, global economist for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. New York,
said Brazil's debt load has become more unsupportable in recent weeks
as investor nervousness has forced up interest rates, raising the
cost of making interest payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil is on the path to a debt default, and that fear is
spilling over into other South American countries," Malpass said.
"People are worried that Brazil will get the same treatment that
Argentina did" from the International Monetary Fund, a reference to
the IMF's prescription for austerity in lieu of more funds since the
currency devaluation in January.</TE>
<TE>   "The investment climate in Latin America at least for the time
being will remain negative until we see a rebound in the Dow Jones
index," said Carlos Janada of ABN Amro bank in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil will remain unstable until the election clears up all this
uncertainty," he said.</TE>

<HD>Analyst Grubman Could Be Disciplined by NASD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Assn. of Securities Dealers has targeted one of Wall
Street's most high-profile research analysts for enforcement
proceedings after concluding he recommended a stock with too flimsy a
rationale.</LD>
<LD>   Star telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith
Barney has a few weeks to defend himself to the self-regulating
agency for securities brokers, which could initiate a civil process
leading to a massive fine or a ban from the business.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD's enforcement staff reached a "preliminary determination"
last month that Grubman's reports touting telecommunications upstart
Winstar Communications Inc. violated NASD regulations, according to
the agency's public records.</LD>
<TE>   The evidence against Grubman doesn't involve any special deals
between Salomon and Winstar, such as the allocation of shares in hot
initial public offerings to executives, according to someone familiar
with the proceedings. If Grubman is found to have broken the rules
simply by making unreasonable recommendations, the move could set a
tough new standard for analysts everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The planned action highlights the extent to which the stock market
meltdown has prompted authorities to reexamine what had been common
during the boom years of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD has rarely sought to discipline analysts for unreasonable
optimism, and it has taken on fewer big-name Wall Street
professionals than the Securities and Exchange Commission, federal
prosecutors or, more recently, New York's attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there is a lot more regulatory and judicial scrutiny
today, and given the crisis we've just been through, it's
appropriate," said David Hilder, who tracks the stocks of investment
banks for Bear Stearns &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   During the boom, many analysts shifted from predictions based on
such traditional guidelines as the ratios of share price to earnings
and share price to book value, moving instead to looser measurements
including tallies of Internet visits. Few have been punished for
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Through disciplinary actions, the NASD could provide a more
specific working definition of having a reasonable basis for an
analyst recommendation," Hilder said. "If that happened, it could
certainly affect the way analysts do their work in potentially a very
positive way."</TE>
<TE>   The most serious enforcement actions to date have concerned
conflicts of interest, such as the tying of lucrative investment
banking business to positive analyst reports. New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer reached a $100-million settlement with Merrill Lynch in
May after finding that analysts there were hyping stocks that they
criticized internally. Spitzer also is investigating Grubman and
other Salomon analysts, a person close to the inquiry said.</TE>
<TE>   In the NASD case, Winstar provided a very small amount of
investment banking income to Salomon, now owned by Citigroup Inc.
Winstar's stock collapsed as Grubman was still defending it against a
growing chorus of critics, and the company filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Unless evidence emerges that Grubman himself didn't believe what
he was writing, it could be hard for the NASD to hold him
accountable, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I just recommend this thing because my bosses want some
investment banking business, that's wrong," said Junius Peake, a
former NASD vice chairman now teaching at the University of Northern
Colorado. "But if he believed in it, that's a very subjective thing,
unless there's a smoking gun there."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, which has paid Grubman as much as $20 million a year,
said his backing of Winstar fit into an overall sector strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Grubman's calls on Winstar were part of a consistent and
reasonable investment thesis developed and held in good faith for
many years," a firm spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous investors have begun arbitration proceedings against
Grubman or filed lawsuits over his recommending other stocks,
including WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>

<HD>HPL Revenue Based on Fake Deals, CEO Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HPL Technologies Inc., which last week warned investors not to trust
its past financial statements, said Monday that most of its fiscal
fourth-quarter revenue was based on "fictitious transactions" through
falsified documents made by the software maker's former chief
executive.</LD>
<LD>   At least $11 million of the $13.7 million in revenue reported in
the three months ended March 31 was based on fake deals with the
company's Japanese distributor, Canon Sales Co., said HPL interim CEO
and Chairman Elias Antoun. Canon Sales, a unit of Canon Inc., never
agreed to the purchases, he said.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose-based HPL, whose software helps companies make
semiconductors more efficiently, fired former CEO and Chairman David
Lepejian last week after a preliminary investigation by its board's
audit committee turned up "financial and accounting irregularities."</LD>
<TE>   Antoun said Monday that HPL would restate its results for fiscal
2002 and possibly restate results for 2001 as well. The company also
will restate its cash position, because the $60.1 million in cash and
short-term investments reported on its fourth-quarter balance sheet
"is not now and may not have ever been in the company's possession,"
he said. As of Friday, the company had $35.7 million in cash and
short-term investments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of HPL, the first Silicon Valley company to be swept up in
the nationwide wave of accounting scandals, plunged as much as 71% to
$4 on Nasdaq before trading was halted Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Lepejian is the "central player" in the company's accounting
problems, and the company is investigating whether any other HPL
employees were involved, Antoun said in a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Lepejian left HPL's office Tuesday, and company officials don't
know where he is and have been unable to contact him, Antoun said.
Lepejian owned 10.3 million HPL shares as of June 26.</TE>
<TE>   Outside attorneys began investigating HPL on Thursday, after the
company's management and board became aware of the accounting
regularities.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Energy IPO Raises $167.7 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pacific Energy Partners, an oil-pipeline operator controlled by
billionaire Philip Anschutz, managed to float an initial public stock
offering Monday despite Wall Street's latest plunge.</LD>
<LD>   But the total amount raised, $167.7 million, was less than what
Anschutz had hoped for.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach-based Pacific Energy sold 8.6 million units at $19.50
apiece, fewer than the 9.1 million units the company initially
planned to sell. Also, the price was below the company's initial
target of $20.50 per unit.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit managed the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Energy's assets include petroleum pipelines and storage
terminals near Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers of the units are taking a minority limited-partnership
interest in the company. Affiliates controlled by Anschutz Corp.
maintain a majority stake.</TE>
<TE>   The units will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange today
under the symbol PPX.</TE>
<TE>   Few IPOs have made it to market in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Dunlop Standard Ltd., which makes brakes for Boeing 757
jets, canceled its planned IPO.</TE>
<TE>   A total of $2.6 billion in IPO deals have been scrapped this month
as the market has tumbled.</TE>

<LD>Jakks Pacific Inc. reported quarterly profit in line with estimates
but said it fired 48 employees, or 15% of its work force, in

<HD>Merrill Names CEO in Waiting</HD>
<DH>Transition: Stanley O'Neal is to become the first black
chief executive of a major Wall Street firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Monday that President Stanley O'Neal would
succeed Chief Executive David Komansky, who is to retire about a year
earlier than he had planned.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, 51, will become the first African American CEO of a major
Wall Street firm.</LD>
<LD>   Komansky, 63, will remain chairman of the securities giant until
retiring in April. O'Neal, who was named president of Merrill a year
ago after serving as head of the firm's brokerage division, will
become CEO in December.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal has helped lift Merrill's profit margins this year by
slashing thousands of jobs and cutting other costs, as revenue has
tumbled amid Wall Street's slump.</TE>
<TE>   "Stan is ready to take on the role," Komansky said. "Everything
just really seemed to fit in place to do it now as opposed to later
on."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's board had been discussing plans for O'Neal's ascent for
three months, Komansky said.</TE>
<TE>   Making O'Neal CEO while Komansky remains chairman is consistent
with past management transitions at Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal became president of Merrill after running the brokerage
unit for 16 months. As head of the company's oldest unit, he cut
about 2,000 support staffers and had its 15,000 U.S. brokers shift
their focus to serving wealthy clients.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, unlike his predecessors, never worked as a broker. He was
Merrill's chief financial officer for two years starting in March
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Merrill as an investment banker in 1986, O'Neal, a
Harvard Business School graduate, worked in the treasurer's office of
General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was born in a small farm community in Alabama and spent
most of his childhood in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   He was tapped to run Merrill's debt and equity capital markets
worldwide in 1995, focusing mostly on building the business in Europe
and Asia. In 1997, Merrill asked him to oversee all its corporate and
institutional businesses.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will be taking over the top spot in a year when Merrill's
image has suffered a heavy blow: In May, the firm agreed to pay $100
million and change some of its research policies to settle charges by
New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer that Merrill analysts gave
investors tainted advice.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer accused the firm's Internet analysts of touting stocks to
the public in 2000 and 2001 while privately disparaging them. The
analysts' recommendations were aimed at keeping Merrill's investment
bankers happy, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell $1.23 to $35.77 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday amid the latest broad market plunge.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Petroleum's Net Income Falls 49%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental Petroleum Corp. said profit fell 49% in the second quarter
as gas prices tumbled.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Los Angeles-based oil and natural gas company fell
$1.27, or 5%, the biggest drop in 20 months, to $23.63 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Occidental said net income declined to $240 million, or 63 cents a
share, from $473 million, or $1.26, a year earlier, as revenue
declined 18% to $3.14 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The results were a penny better than the average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The price Occidental got for its U.S. gas fell 66%, to $2.92 per
thousand cubic feet, driving profit from oil and gas production down
48% to $421 million, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Gas had surged in the second quarter of 2001 as electricity prices
more than doubled.</TE>
<TE>   The average price of gas in California, where Occidental produces
more than half its output, fell 68%, according to Bloomberg Energy
Service statistics. Oil on the Nymex dropped 6.1% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nymex oil fell 4.4% on Monday on a report that Nigeria may leave
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and boost
production.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental said it increased oil and gas production by 14% in the
quarter, keeping it on target for a 5% increase in 2002. Capital
spending rose 5.5% to $326 million.</TE>
<TE>   Profit in the chemical unit fell 43% to $33 million, including a
$4-million loss from its 30% stake in Equistar Chemicals, which is
being sold to Lyondell Chemical Co.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental said it expected a gain of at least $100 million from
the sale, which is expected to close at the end of August. It had
posted $240 million in expenses in the fourth quarter from the sale.</TE>
<TE>   After the transaction, Occidental would own 21% of Lyondell, which
now owns 41% of Equistar.</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Inc. plans to sell off nonessential assets to raise cash,
but analysts cautioned Monday that there won't be many takers and the
prices will be too low to make a dent in the telecommunications
firm's massive $41-billion debt.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which filed the nation's largest bankruptcy case
Sunday, already had been shopping some of its overseas holdings,
including its assets in Japan and its ownership stakes in phone
companies in Brazil and Mexico. WorldCom also has said it will sell
its wireless services unit.</LD>
<LD>   But most of those assets aren't worth much, and selling additional
businesses such as its SkyTel paging unit and its local phone service
operations won't bring in much cash either, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   Some observers believe WorldCom may be forced to part with
valuable operations, including its UUNet Internet unit, to appease
its bankers and creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Last week WorldCom told creditors it would not sell any operations
for at least 70 days.</TE>
<TE>   "If WorldCom's management had their way, it would be a mix of ...
retaining the UUNet business and the business data services under
WorldCom, and everything else would be sold off," said David Willis,
a research analyst at Stamford, Conn.-based Meta Group. "It's not
clear that the creditors are going to be that patient."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's other options include supplementing the proceeds from
any asset sales with a cash infusion from new investors, selling off
its core businesses and selling the entire company.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part for WorldCom and its bondholders, banks and
creditors will be deciding which route will produce the best deal.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry is so decimated by debt and
collapsing demand that dozens of firms have landed in bankruptcy,
dumping equipment, networks and other assets onto the auction block.
With each bankruptcy filing and sale, the prices seem to fall more,
said Ajay Mehra, a portfolio manager and media and telecom specialist
at Columbia Management Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Valuing telecommunications is a fairly slippery slope," Mehra
said. "Right now, assets are selling for 10 cents on the dollar."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, assets were put up for sale by wireless carriers
Winstar Communications Inc. and Teligent Inc., by high-speed Internet
carriers NorthPoint Communications Group Inc. and Rhythms
NetConnections Inc., and by firms ranging from 360 Networks Inc. to
Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that WorldCom's assets can't be compared to those of
any start-up. After all, the company has about 20 million customers
and is the nation's second-largest long-distance provider, and its
UUNet operation carries about half the nation's e-mail and Internet
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that WorldCom assets are in a different league gained
momentum in June, when Newark, N.J.-based IDT Corp. offered a deal
worth $5 billion to purchase three parts of WorldCom--its MCI
long-distance unit and its two local phone company operations.</TE>
<TE>   IDT, a tiny company compared with WorldCom, said the two
telecommunications companies have not had serious discussions about
the proposal. But the offer still stands, IDT spokesman Gil Nielsen
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still interested," Nielsen said. "We're monitoring
developments, and we're hopeful that we'll hear from the creditors."</TE>
<TE>   Others believe the IDT offer won't fly. Some analysts say WorldCom
in its entirety is worth $14 billion. Pessimists believe it is worth
as little as $4 billion, said Cliff Higgerson, a partner at
ComVentures, a firm that invests in telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that WorldCom's best assets aren't valuable but that the
firm put up its for-sale sign during the industry's worst downturn.
Even the strongest players--the nation's regional local phone
companies--don't want to spend precious cash unless they get the best
of WorldCom's assets: its business contracts and its customers.</TE>
<TE>   Most European telephone companies are too weighed down with debt
to go shopping for acquisitions. Analysts believe the best hope for a
buyer might come from Asia, where telecom giants NTT, SingTel and
others are comparatively healthy and have the cash and the ambition
to make a deal in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest assets that could go on the block is the MCI
unit, which sells residential long-distance service, prepaid phone
cards and some Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   The upside is that the MCI business has a valuable brand name,
generates millions of dollars in cash, can stay profitable with
smaller overhead costs and has millions of customers. The downside is
that the long-distance business is disappearing fast and competition
is steadily eroding MCI's market share.</TE>
<TE>   Mehra, of Columbia Management, believes a fair price for MCI would
be double the unit's earnings before taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA. Valid financials are tough to come by, given
the company's admission that its 2001 and 2002 figures are
unreliable, but based on MCI's reported 2001 EBITDA, the price might
be about $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Selling UUNet, which in 2001 accounted for about 10% of WorldCom's
reported revenue, might fetch $10 billion to $15 billion, according
to Willis of Meta Group. In May 1996, when UUNet was last sold, the
price was $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Another substantive business, WorldCom's Digex Web hosting and
services unit, could be sold for $500 million to $700 million, Willis
estimated. The unit has about 600 customers, he said, and WorldCom's

<TE>   Analysts had few encouraging words about the other assets WorldCom
might be selling, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Local phone companies Brooks Fiber and MFS, which were included
in IDT's $5-billion bid. Analysts say the local business is dominated
by former monopolies, and the prospects for profits are bleak.</TE>
<TE>   * Brazil's Embratel Participacoes and Avantel, a Mexican
telecommunications joint venture between WorldCom and Grupo
Financiero Banamex-Accival. Both companies are struggling amid poor
economic climates. Based on Embratel's market value of $173 million
Monday, WorldCom's 19% stake would be worth about $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they say those overseas things are worth, you could
probably cut that number in half and be right," Mehra said. "Those
values have shrunk too."</TE>
<TE>   * SkyTel paging, which has customers but is stuck in a slowly
dying business. Many paging carriers have filed for bankruptcy.
Willis put SkyTel's value at "a few hundred million dollars," but
added: "Why would you buy it?"</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom's wireless services business, which is of nominal value
because it is a resale business and doesn't have many assets apart
from its quickly dwindling customer base.</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers Consider Offer</HD>
<DH>Labor: Jurisdictional issues appear to be an obstacle to a
contract agreement on the West Coast. Union also is worried about
loss of jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longshore union leaders meeting in San Francisco this week are
mulling over the shipping industry's latest contract proposal, which
would eliminate several hundred union clerical jobs at Western ports
but cushion the blow with early-retirement packages and job
guarantees.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents major ocean carriers and stevedoring companies, said he
was "pretty confident we'll get an agreement" based on the offer made
Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   "This proposal is as good or better than any other union contract
across the country," he said Monday in a call with reporters.</LD>
<TE>   However, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which
represents about 10,500 dockworkers on the Pacific Coast, was
skeptical. The union's main worry is that employers will use computer
technology to move union clerical jobs to lower-paid nonunion
contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Such jurisdictional issues appear to be the main obstacle to
reaching an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of ILWU locals along the coast are meeting this
week for a long-planned caucus. Union spokesman Steve Stallone said
the leaders would review the offer but were unlikely to take a vote
on it because of concerns over jurisdiction. He said the union may
negotiate further next week. "The door is still open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA agreed to maintain full health benefits for union members
and raise wages about 17% over the five-year contract, Miniace said.
Longshore wages on average range from $80,000 to $120,000 a year,
including overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA also would guarantee full-time salaries to all registered
union clerks, even if no work is available, Miniace said. That could
result in more than 250 union members being paid for not working in
2005, with the number dropping in later years as cargo volume grows,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   With a projected increase in port traffic, the overall number of
union jobs would drop only slightly in the short term, even with the
loss of some clerical jobs, according to the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations, now in their third month, are being closely
watched by the nation's retailers and manufacturers, who depend on
the ports to move merchandise to and from Asia. The current contract
was due to expire July 1, but both parties have been extending it on
a daily basis during negotiations.</TE>

<DH>Real estate: Billions pour into once-shunned commercial
properties and related securities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While Wall Street seems to keep sinking to new lows, the real estate
investment business is riding high.</LD>
<LD>   Individuals as well as huge institutions in search of stability
are pouring billions of dollars into commercial properties and real
estate securities, even though property markets have weakened and
investment returns are declining. Heated bidding has jacked up the
value of high-quality real estate ranging from New York skyscrapers
to Marina del Rey apartment houses.</LD>
<LD>   Many real estate investment professionals are benefiting from
their industry's newfound respect and prominence.</LD>
<TE>   "In the past, I had to make the phone calls" to investors, said
Robert M. Campbell, who heads an Orange County real estate investment
firm, CT Realty. "This time they are calling me. It's made my life
and job much easier."</TE>
<TE>   Today's high level of interest in commercial real estate contrasts
sharply with that of a few years ago, when the industry's solid
returns were ignored by many investors who were dazzled by the profit
generated by dot-com stocks and venture capital deals.</TE>
<TE>   These days, real estate executives say, many of those same
investors seek refuge in such mundane investments as self-storage
facilities and community shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   "They [investors] are running for security," said Hessam Nadji,
head of research at real estate services firm Marcus &amp; Millichap.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence that investors are shifting money out of stocks to buy
office buildings and shopping centers is hard to come by, but
property sales statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest that more
investors are turning to commercial real estate for safety and stable
re- turns.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of 2002, nationwide sales of commercial real
estate, buoyed by the $5-billion-plus sale of the Rodamco mall
portfolio, exceeded last year's levels and totaled $38.2 billion,
said Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based research firm that
tracks sales above $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, about $2.7 billion has flowed into real estate
mutual stock funds this year, even as investors have been dumping
other equities, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said.</TE>
<TE>   In cities across the country, investors continue to bid up the
value of commercial properties, particularly apartments, industrial
and distribution facilities, shopping centers and office buildings in
prime locations.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Boston, for example, a 41-story office building sold
for $190 million in May 2001. The tower, upgraded and fully leased,
fetched $267 million when sold again this spring, the industry
newsletter Real Estate Alert reported.</TE>
<TE>   In Silicon Valley, the value of first-quarter apartments sales
tracked by investment firm Hendricks &amp; Partners rose nearly 30% on a
per-unit basis from the same period last year despite the deep slump
in the area's technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also have been busy across Southern California. During
the first half of the year, commercial real estate sales in Los
Angeles and Orange counties as well as the Inland Empire soared
nearly 50% above last year's level to $5.05 billion, said Robert M.
White Jr., president of Real Capital Analytics.</TE>
<TE>   "There has definitely been a spike in activity in almost all
property types," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Many real estate fund managers who are flush with cash complain
about the lack of properties for sale or unrealistically high asking
prices. But when a favorably located and leased property comes on the
market, it often becomes the object of a bruising bidding war.</TE>
<TE>   This month, SSR Realty, which acquires properties on behalf of
institutional investors, had to outspend a dozen rivals to buy the
583-unit Marina Pointe apartments in Marina del Rey for $117 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Buying is very difficult and very competitive for the best
properties," said Thomas P. Lyden, chief executive of New York-based
SSR Realty.</TE>
<TE>   Lyden and his peers acknowledge that the higher prices being paid
for commercial real estate have been driving down returns. In many
markets, including Los Angeles, vacancies have been on the rise and
lease rates have declined, raising the risks to owners.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, many investors seem unfazed and are willing to
settle for annual returns of less than 10%, rather than risk more
losses and turmoil in the stock market, real estate observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, real estate investment firm ScanlanKemperBard Cos.,
which in the past often generated annual returns in excess of 20% on
its properties, sought to raise $7 million to buy a Portland,
Ore.-area shopping center that would initially generate a return of
about 8%--the lowest ever for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   But that did not keep investors away, and ScanlanKemperBard could
easily have raised twice the amount needed, said Todd Gooding, a
principal in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Given what's going on in other alternative investment markets,"
Gooding said, "real estate is still a pretty strong bet."</TE>

<HD>RREEF Fund Buys Office Properties in Southland</HD>

<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An affiliate of Chicago-based investment advisor RREEF, one of the
nation's most active real estate investment managers, bought a
780,000-square-foot portfolio of mostly office buildings in Cypress
and Anaheim for a combined price estimated at about $107 million.</LD>
<LD>   RREEF, which declined to comment on the sale, purchased the fully
leased buildings from an investment fund managed by Newport
Beach-based Layton-Belling &amp; Associates. They include Mitsubishi
Electric's U.S. headquarters in Cypress, an adjacent business park
and Anaheim Corporate Plaza near Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Mitsubishi leases the entire five-story office building at 5665
Plaza Drive in Cypress and is one of the tenants at the adjacent
complex at 5757 Plaza Drive. Other tenants include PacifiCare Health
Systems and Jacobs Engineering.</LD>
<TE>   The Anaheim Corporate Plaza along Orangewood Avenue is home to
numerous tenants, including Blue Cross and Pacific Bell.</TE>
<TE>   The Layton-Belling fund, which specializes in improving
under-performing commercial properties, renovated all the buildings
and brought them to full occupancy before offering them for sale. The
fund is a joint venture of Layton-Belling and Boston-based real
estate advisor AEW Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   The venture took over the Cypress properties three years ago as
part of a large portfolio acquired from Japan-based Shuwa Investments
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Layton-Belling co-founder Phil Belling confirmed that the sale
closed, but declined to disclose financial details. Officials at
RREEF also declined to comment. The transaction was brokered by
Secured Capital Corp. and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   The new owner is an institutional fund known as RREEF America II,
which typically buys stabilized real estate that is well-leased with
predictable revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   RREEF owns and manages dozens of California income properties on
behalf of its investor clients, which include the California Public
Employees' Retirement System and the Los Angeles County Employees'
Retirement Assn.</TE>

<HD>SBC to Pay Employees $10-Million Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. agreed to pay $10 million to settle a suit
brought by employees who said the company lost $635 million in their
retirement funds by selling shares in a wireless carrier before it
was acquired by Vodafone Group.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in April 2000, claimed that the local phone
company should have known a bidding war would start over AirTouch
Communications Inc. after the company sold its employees' 401(k)
shares in AirTouch in 1998, when shares were $52.25. About a year
later, AirTouch shares reached $107.66 when Vodafone acquired the
wireless carrier.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement allows SBC employees whose 401(k) funds were
invested in AirTouch as of Dec. 31, 1997, to collect about 60 cents a
share in compensation, according to the proposed settlement filed in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   San Antonio-based SBC, which said it didn't profit from the stock
conversion, has argued that it gave its employees months of notice
and five investment choices for converting AirTouch stock.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>American Express Co. said second-quarter profit more than tripled
from the same period a year ago, when the travel and credit card
giant's earnings were reduced by write-offs.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of American Express fell $2.68 to $28.97 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The 8.5% drop was the biggest decline since Sept. 18,
after Chief Executive Ken Chenault said American Express probably
wouldn't beat analysts' profit forecasts for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The largest U.S. travel agency and fourth-largest U.S. credit card
issuer said net income rose to $683 million, or 51 cents a share,
from $178 million, or 13 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue
climbed 16% to $5.7 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The jump in earnings stemmed from the company's decision to reduce
junk-bond holdings that in the second quarter of 2001 lowered profit
by $537 million. American Express also scaled back personnel costs by
cutting 14,500 jobs last year.</TE>

American-owned newspaper in the West, has filed a lawsuit accusing
the paper and its owner of fraud, accounting irregularities and
breach of fiduciary duties.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Pye Jr., a former aide to late Los Angeles County Supervisor
Kenneth J. Hahn and a minority shareholder in the Sentinel, filed
suit last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Jennifer
Thomas, president and chief executive of the Sentinel, along with a
company formed by her late husband that now owns controlling interest
in the Sentinel. The paper has a circulation of about 20,000.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that for many years, Thomas and her company, Ken
Jen Co.--the Sentinel's majority shareholder--engaged in a pattern of
"abuse of authority, self-dealing and diversion of corporate assets
... to the harm and detriment of the minority."</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit says that when the Sentinel's longtime headquarters on
Central Avenue was sold, the proceeds were used to buy the paper's
new home on Crenshaw Boulevard in the name of Ken Jen Co. The
Sentinel paid about $5,400 in monthly rent to Ken Jen Co. and also
paid most of the property taxes, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Sentinel, as a company, owned the property on Central, how
did it become a renter once it moved to Crenshaw?" asked attorney Ed
Hubbard, who along with Anthony Willoughby is representing Pye. "We
believe that the evidence will show a clear pattern of fraudulent
activity."</TE>
<TE>   The Sentinel's attorney, John Pfeiffer, called the allegations
"absolutely without merit."</TE>
<TE>   "Once the other side has been presented, they will be shown to be
just that, without merit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Thomas could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit marks the latest twist in a long-running dispute between
Pye and members of the Thomas family.</TE>
<TE>   Pye worked for the paper for many years and at one point served on
the board of directors, according to the suit. He was fired in 1984
by Jennifer Thomas' husband, Kenneth, the suit said, but retained 100
shares he had been given. Following a later court battle, Pye
received an additional 25 shares.</TE>
<TE>   Pye seeks $2 million in compensatory damages and as much as $20
million in punitive damages, Willoughby said.</TE>

<HD>Sprint, AT&amp;T Vie for WorldCom Customers</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Long-distance giant's rivals report an increase in
calls to customer-service lines and visits to Web sites as anxious
subscribers seek stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s bad fortunes could be good for AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's No. 1 and No. 3 largest long-distance carriers,
respectively, are starting to scoop up WorldCom customers who are
desperately seeking backup phone service or fleeing WorldCom
altogether, industry experts said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Both AT&amp;T and Sprint are already starting to benefit" from
WorldCom's demise, said Don Carros, a telecommunications consultant
with Meta Group Inc. "The way it's breaking down is that 60% of those
leaving WorldCom are going to AT&amp;T and 35% are going to Sprint." The
remaining 5% go to so-called Baby Bells such as SBC Communications
Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.</LD>
<TE>   AT&amp;T and Sprint declined to say how many new customers are
WorldCom refugees, but both reported substantial upticks in calls to
their customer-service lines and visits to their Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T had a 40% share of the $100-billion U.S. long-distance market
in 2001, WorldCom had 20% and Sprint had 8%, according to Gartner
Dataquest.</TE>
<TE>   For residential customers, defections are mitigated by the fact
that many people don't realize MCI is the long-distance arm of
WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "When people look at their bills, they see MCI, not WorldCom,"
said David Barden, analyst with Banc of America Securities, which
holds $333.7 million in WorldCom bonds. "In some respects, this has
kept MCI one step removed from a lot of the negative press."</TE>
<TE>   Business clients tend to be more savvy, but it's too early to tell
how many will switch. That's because businesses often are locked into
multiyear contracts for phone and Internet services. As a result,
only about 3% of contracts are up for grabs in any given month,
Carros said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sprint and AT&amp;T have been aggressively scouting for new
customers and marketing their financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint, for example, is running an advertising campaign
emphasizing its 100 years in business. In pitches to potential
clients, salespeople are prepped to talk about the company's finances
in detail.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a tremendous increase in customer inquiries across
the board for us," said Mark Bowser, senior vice president of sales
for Sprint, which is based in Overland Park, Kan. "My personal call
volume from customers is up four times from what it was six weeks
ago. How much business that will generate remains to be determined."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sprint's 2001 annual revenue of $17 billion is roughly
one-third the sales of AT&amp;T's $52.6 billion, the company has snagged
customers by being flexible and fleet-footed, said Steve Koppman,
senior analyst with Gartner Dataquest. "Sprint has a reputation of
being more willing to go out of its way to please customers and being
innovative as well as lower-cost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The WorldCom meltdown is proving to be a boon for AT&amp;T, which is
"being opportunistic in reaching out to customers," said AT&amp;T
spokeswoman Eileen Connolly.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to assure customers of its financial health, AT&amp;T is
touting its relatively low debt levels. The New York-based company
paid off $22 billion in debt last year, Connolly said. As of March
31, AT&amp;T had $34 billion in debt. The company, which is reporting its
second-quarter results today, also expects to use the bulk of the
money from the $27-billion sale of its cable business to Comcast
Corp. to further lower its debt to between $14 billion and $16
billion, Connolly said.</TE>
<TE>   "This couldn't come at a better time for AT&amp;T," said David Willis,
an analyst at Meta Group.</TE>
<TE>   How many customers switch depends on how well WorldCom manages its
business over the next few weeks. If layoffs lead to poor service,
businesses will bolt, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Business customers want stability," said Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications consultant based in Marietta, Ga. "If WorldCom
loses a customer, they'll lose them for good. No customer will come
back, even after the fire is put out. Once they settle in with AT&amp;T
or Sprint, they're not going to want to leave."</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Sees Another Broad Stock Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Markets: The Dow loses 234 points and Nasdaq drops 36.50.
Money flows into Treasuries even as yields sink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's sell-off Monday was nearly as broad as Friday's, though
trading volume fell short of the record set Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, as money continued to flee stocks, some investors piled
into Treasury securities, even as yields fell to near their lows
reached last fall.</LD>
<LD>   In commodities trading, oil tumbled on a report that Nigeria might
withdraw from OPEC. The cartel denied the report.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow industrials sank 234.68 points, or 2.9%,
to 7,784.58, a smaller loss than Friday's 390-point, 4.6% dive.</TE>
<TE>   But losers topped winners by 26 to 8 on the NYSE and by 25 to 11
on Nasdaq, about the same as on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slid 27.91 points, or 3.3%, to a
new five-year low of 819.85, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 36.50
points, or 2.8%, to 1,282.65, also a five-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Within the S&amp;P 500, 11 stock industry groups rose in the session,
led by personal products makers, including Gillette (up $1.23 to $29)
and Avon Products (up $1.21 to $44.93).</TE>
<TE>   But 92 industry groups declined in the session. The biggest loser:
diversified utility companies, led by Williams, which plunged $3.15
to $2.01 after warning of a big loss and cutting its dividend.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the breadth of the decline provided little hope that
a turnaround was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotions are running high right now, and a quick move to the
downside can easily be replaced by a move to the upside and vice
versa," said Charles G. Crane, strategist for Victory SBSF Capital
Management. "People are shooting first and asking questions later."</TE>
<TE>   As stocks fell again, Treasury bonds gained: The yield on the
10-year T-note sank to 4.45% from 4.52% Friday and is nearing the low
of 4.18% set in November.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year T-note fell to 2.34% from 2.41% Friday. The low was
2.30% in November.</TE>
<TE>   "A 4.5% yield on the 10-year Treasury is a heck of a lot better
than minus 20% to 30% for stocks," said Steven Bohlin, who helps
manage $1.8 billion at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe,
N.M.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been adding money to bond mutual funds at the
fastest pace since 1986. They added a record $18 billion to bond
funds in June, with most of the money going into government and
investment-grade funds, said Lipper Inc., a New York fund tracking
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said bond investors may be betting that the Federal
Reserve will be forced to cut short-term interest rates again, even
with rates already at 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   "The bond market is starting to realize that the Fed may ease
before they tighten," said James Caron, a fixed-income strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But those expectations aren't helping corporate junk bonds, which
continue to plunge in value with stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, crude oil had its biggest decline in three
months after the Independent, a newspaper in Britain, reported that
Nigeria may leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries and boost production.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which cited unidentified people familiar with the
cartel, was denied by OPEC's official news agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about members leaving OPEC will make people nervous," or
optimistic that oil production will rise, said Chris Schachte, an
energy trader at GSC Energy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil for August delivery fell $1.23, or 4.4%, to $26.60 a
barrel in New York.</TE>

<HD>BellSouth's Net Income Falls 67%; Shares Plummet</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Texas Instruments reports a profit of $95
million. Computer Associates posts a narrower loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of BellSouth Corp. skidded 18% to a multiyear low Monday after
the company posted disappointing second-quarter earnings and said it
saw no relief for the struggling telecommunications sector.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest provider of local phone service in the Southeast said
its net income for the quarter slumped 67% to $293 million, or 16
cents a share, from $880 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Sales
slipped to $5.78 billion, down 3.4% from $5.99 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The latest results include expenses of 19 cents a share to write
down the value of its stake in Qwest Communications International
Inc. and other companies and 12 cents to pay for job cuts. Excluding
those and other costs, BellSouth would have earned 53 cents a share.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expected earnings of 57
cents.</LD>
<TE>   BellSouth pared its 2002 sales and profit forecasts for a third
time this year. The Atlanta company expects a per-share profit of
$2.13 to $2.20, down from previous estimates of as high as $2.43.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth shares fell $5 to $22.61 on the New York Stock Exchange
in their biggest one-day percentage drop. The decline also dragged
down rivals SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.
WorldCom Inc., the long-distance operator that filed for bankruptcy
protection Sunday, owes the local carriers hundreds of millions of
dollars for using their networks to complete calls.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Instruments Inc. reported second-quarter net income of $95
million, or 5 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $197 million,
or 11 cents, a year earlier. The firm, whose chips power two-thirds
of the world's cellular phones, said sales rose 6% to $2.16 billion.
Profit excluding one-time costs was $109 million, or 6 cents,
matching analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Associates International Inc., the fifth-largest
software maker, reported a narrower net loss of $65 million, or 11
cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, compared with $342
million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $765 million.
Excluding one-time items, Computer Associates said it would have had
a profit of $12 million, or 2 cents; analysts on average expected it
to break even.</TE>
<TE>   * Novellus Systems Inc. reported an 80% drop in second-quarter
profit to $12 million, or 8 cents a share, as analysts expected, and
said third-quarter results would miss forecasts. Sales fell 41% to
$221.1 million. For the third quarter, Novellus expects profit of 10
cents a share on sales of $250 million, compared with analyst
expectations of 15 cents on sales of $270 million.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Plans to Sell Parts of Canal Plus</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The company may float a minority stake in
the pay-TV unit's remaining operations, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a significant first step toward redefining itself, Vivendi
Universal plans to sell off unprofitable portions of Canal Plus Group
and float a minority stake in the remaining French pay-TV company.</LD>
<LD>   The move, part of a companywide effort to slash the French utility
and media company's massive debt, would allow Vivendi to raise as
much as $5 billion while keeping control of the powerful media
property.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping Canal Plus in Vivendi signals the company's interest in
remaining a player in the media and entertainment industry, a source
close to the board said Monday. Vivendi's French board members, in
particular, have been adamant about protecting Canal Plus, France's
leading underwriter of French cinema. Vivendi holds a 49% stake in
the publicly traded company.</LD>
<TE>   This month, Vivendi replaced Chairman Jean-Marie Messier with
French businessman Jean-Rene Fourtou. Since then, there has been
widespread speculation that Vivendi would dismantle the media company
that Messier was cobbling together.</TE>
<TE>   The latest move, however, keeps at least one element of Messier's
master plan in place. Although it is too early to tell what Vivendi
plans to do with Universal Studios and Universal Music Group, it has
been widely speculated that Fourtou may follow a similar strategy for
the American companies.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou will present a plan to Vivendi's board in Paris today that
calls for the sale of various stakes in lackluster television
companies in Poland, Spain and Scandinavia. Also on the block are the
company's stakes in the Studio Canal film studio, movie theater
operator UGC and Canal Plus Technologies, a set-top box maker,
company sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has announced that it would sell Canal Plus' leading
source of losses, Italian subsidiary Telepiu, to News Corp. for $1.3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The trimmed-down Canal Plus would be anchored by the profitable
French premium pay-television network and include Canal Satellite,
France's top satellite TV system, and French cable television
operator Multimathematiques.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are skeptical. "Good luck," said Sanford C. Bernstein
media analyst Michael Nathanson, who doubts that the financial
markets have much appetite for a French pay-television company.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou is under pressure to clarify Vivendi's strategy and slash
$19 billion in media-related debt.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's financial picture worsened Monday when Vivendi
Environnement, the company's utility division, signaled to
bondholders that its parent company may not be able to satisfy $1.5
billion in obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, the heads of the U.S. entertainment companies met
with Fourtou and other board members in Paris and led them through an
explanation of the U.S. businesses, part of Fourtou's broad overview
of the company's assets.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares, already down 70% this year, dropped $1.03 to
$16.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

examiner; FCC joins proceedings.</DH>

<LD>Two federal agencies took the unusual step of jumping into WorldCom
Inc.'s bankruptcy case Monday to ensure continued telephone service,
monitor developments and uncover possible mismanagement,
irregularities or fraud at the nation's second-largest long-distance
company.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom's chief executive, meanwhile, vowed that the company
would emerge within a year from the nation's biggest bankruptcy case
ever, as it won court approval for a loan arrangement that gives it
$750 million in cash now as part of a $2-billion package.</LD>
<LD>   The action came in the first day of Bankruptcy Court hearings
after the company's Chapter 11 filing Sunday night. The petition,
available Monday, lists assets of $107 billion and debts of $41
billion, both higher than the company reported late Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department is seeking court approval for an
independent examiner to spend 90 days going over the company's
activities. WorldCom agreed with the request, according to court
documents, and bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in New York is
considering it.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, which already has a criminal investigation
pending into an accounting scheme that overstated revenue by $3.9
billion, said it believes the step is needed to protect WorldCom
shareholders' interest through the reorganization process. Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft said an independent examiner will provide
"transparency" in reporting results and "enhance accountability."</TE>
<TE>   "In turn, this should increase public confidence in the conduct of
the case and help preserve value and protect the creditors and
shareholders, including small creditors and those whose pension funds
are invested in WorldCom," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission sent Deputy General Counsel
John Rogovin to the hearing as part of that agency's aggressive new
interventionist strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC formally joined in the court proceedings "to protect the
interest of consumers," said FCC spokeswoman Robin Pence. In recent
bankruptcies involving Global Crossing Ltd. and other telecom firms,
the FCC has dispatched agency personnel to monitor proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In past weeks, FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell has been under fire
from prominent Capitol Hill lawmakers to explain what oversight and
enforcement efforts his agency is undertaking in the wake of a string
of big telecom bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore told reporters early
Monday in a New York news conference that the company's
"reorganization here is not going to be a liquidation. I think our
plan is going to be to keep the company intact."</TE>
<TE>   But many aren't so sure. The company was reportedly down to $200
million in cash when it filed its Chapter 11 petition late Sunday.
That means it has gone through more than $4 billion in cash and loan
proceeds since the end of March.</TE>
<TE>   A breakup of the Clinton, Miss.-based company has tremendous
ramifications for a customer list that includes defense and
government agencies and an industry beset by too much bandwidth and
too little demand.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a seller's market, and there are not a lot of likely
buyers," said David Novosel, a bond analyst at Banc One Capital
Markets in Chicago. "I agree with Sidgmore that the real value is in
the customers, the brand names and the relationships that have been
built up, not in the pipes and switches in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most of the telecoms that built systems and went bust,
WorldCom has 20 million corporate and residential customers and
generated $8 billion in revenue in the first three months this year,
rendering any breakup talk as premature to some.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a very substantial and real business," said Irwin N. Gold
of Los Angeles investment banker Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin, which
is serving as a financial advisor to creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a plan to keep the company intact could produce a strong
competitor that would keep prices low, destroy other companies and
exacerbate an industry slump that already is predicted to continue
for a year or two more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just perpetuating the pain in the industry," said stock
analyst F. Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond, Va. "We
need assets to be sold to incumbent carriers, not more companies on
the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Though having a healthy telecom industry is important, said
industry lawyer Robert J. Rini of Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips in
Washington, "There has historically been ruinous competition."</TE>
<TE>   In June, IDT Corp. urged its beleaguered rival to accept a
$5-billion bid for its long-distance and local phone assets, saying
the offer was the best chance to shore up the nation's telecom
system.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest chunks, all well-integrated and difficult to break
off, are WorldCom's large business customers, its MCI long-distance
service for consumers and small businesses and the UUNet high-speed
data network. UUNet is one of the Internet's core data "backbone"
providers and handles more than half of the nation's Internet
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom officials declined to explore IDT's offer at the time,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, nonprofit consumer organization Consumers Union, in a
letter to the FCC, said the agency as well as the Bush administration
should "neither directly nor indirectly facilitate the transfer of
WorldCom assets to dominant providers of long-distance and local
telephone services" that might use those assets to thwart
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors, particularly local phone companies, began demanding that
WorldCom pay upfront for access to customers after the company
revealed June 25 that it had uncovered misstated accounting that
boosted revenue by $3.9 billion over 15 months, a scheme that is
resulting in the biggest corporate restatement of earnings ever.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications Inc. said WorldCom owes it about $250 million
for wholesale and retail services provided before the bankruptcy, and
sources say that Verizon Communications Inc. is owed at least $200
million.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies worry that they won't be able to collect $100
million a month WorldCom pays each firm to connect its customers to
their voice and data networks.</TE>
<TE>   Such billing comes from a complicated system in which carriers
connect each other's customers into a vast interdependent
communications web.</TE>
<TE>   "Regulators should allow us to recover what they owe us," Lora
Watts, president of external affairs for SBC's Pacific Bell unit,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC, which will be legally required to continue providing
services to WorldCom even after the bankruptcy filing, should be
given legal assurances that we will receive prompt and full payment
for all future services."</TE>
<TE>   Many industry watchers warned that it could take months before
carriers see any money and that such delays could be particularly
tough on small to mid-size telecommunication businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned," said Jay Kinder, chief operating officer
for Roseville Telephone Co., a subsidiary of SureWest Communications.</TE>
<TE>   The Roseville, Calif., firm pulls in about $140 million a year in
revenue, Kinder said, and 10% to 12% of that comes from MCI.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's former employees also are concerned about the company's
future. The company said it owes $23.7 million in severance pay to
5,100 former employees, part of the 17,000 workers it is laying off.
The court is expected to decide next week whether those payments will
be made.</TE>

<HD>Tiger Shoots a Bogey in Social Consciousness</HD>

<LD>Golf will remember Tiger Woods' on-the-course performance at this
year's British Open at Muirfield because he blew his chance at a
historic grand slam. But millions of women golfers, and not a few
men, will remember more keenly how Woods betrayed them with his
comments about men-only clubs like Scotland's Muirfield and our
Augusta National, home of the Masters. "They're entitled to set up
their own rules the way they want them," Woods said. Later he added,
"There is nothing you can do about it."</LD>
<LD>   Anyone old enough to have witnessed the civil rights movement, or
to have read about it, knows better. In fact, if Woods wants to know
what one great golfer can do about segregation, he can look to Gary
Player of South Africa. In the 1950s and '60s, as he rose to fame as
a champion, Player initially supported his country's apartheid
policies and even mouthed the argument that blacks were not up to the
challenge of full citizenship.</LD>
<LD>   Experience and travel soon changed Player's mind, so much so that
he became a vocal advocate for the inclusion of blacks in all realms
of life back home, where he was by far the most popular celebrity. He
spoke often on the topic and wrote pleading articles for South
African newspapers.</LD>
<TE>   In 1971, Player met with Prime Minister John Vorster, a virulent
racist, and demanded that he be allowed to bring the African American
pro Lee Elder to South Africa for a series of matches to be attended
by both black and white spectators. Vorster sat silent for a moment
and then answered with a mutter: "Go ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The largest galleries ever seen in South Africa witnessed Elder
and Player as they conducted the first-ever sports competition there
involving black and white athletes. Spectators of all races watched
as Elder matched, and sometimes surpassed, Player. The nation learned
that the races could share competition and the grandstand in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years later, when I interviewed Player for a book, he
seemed prouder of his efforts to overcome racism in his homeland than
of anything he had done in golf. Yet he also was puzzled that none of
his American peers ever talked about social issues that intersected
with their sport.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for generations white American golfers kept mum about
racism in golf, refusing to take a stand for fear it would offend
those who controlled invitations to tournaments like the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Player, understanding the power that came with his popularity, was
far more willing to take such risks in his country. Woods has the
same kind of power. He is, arguably, the most popular athlete in any
sport in all the world. His appearance at a tournament guarantees its
success. His absence invariably means that fewer fans turn out, and
TV ratings plummet.</TE>
<TE>   He is so powerful, in fact, that a recent rumor that he might help
establish a tour for premier players made many in golf wonder whether
the PGA Tour would survive against such competition.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Woods chooses to employ his power on behalf of women, who
are second-class citizens in the game, depends on his view of
himself. On the few occasions when he has talked about such issues,
it has been in mild terms that place nearly all of the game's sins in
the past. His description of himself as a "Cablanasian," rather than
as a black man, has served to separate him, in the minds of some,
from the struggles of his African American forebears in the game. And
when it comes to helping others, he seems content to limit his work
on behalf of others to donations and appearances at charity events.
As he returns from Scotland and the worst score he ever posted as a
professional, Woods will no doubt be rethinking parts of his game and
considering some changes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us will hope that he also reconsiders what it means to be
a powerful public figure in a game still stained by prejudice. Gary
Player did, and his country was the better for it.</TE>

<HD>Nobody Knows? Who Knew?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nobody knows anything"--that was how the famed Hollywood
screenwriter William Goldman summed up his long career. That same
lesson is now humbling Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman, of course, knew a lot. He won two Oscars, for "Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men." He also
had his share of turkeys: "Chaplin," "The Ghost and the Darkness."
Yet at no point did he set out to write a bad movie. Stuff happens,
that's all.</LD>
<LD>   The same holds true for would-be market wizards. They don't set
out to make fools of themselves. It just happens. After Friday's
390-point drop, a weekend's worth of pundits sagely stated that if
investors went into a weekend in a gloomy mood, then the next day of
trading was likely to be even worse. That was the case in 1987 when a
108-point drop on Friday, Oct. 16, was followed by a 508-point drop
on "Black Monday," Oct. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," New York Stock Exchange
Chairman Richard Grasso said, "Mondays following Friday declines have
always been difficult, and I suspect tomorrow will be no different."
But, in fact, Monday's drop was "only" 234 points, barely more than
half of Friday's.</TE>
<TE>   The one sure thing is that nobody knows anything. In fact, the
smartest people on the street seem to know the least. The June 10
issue of Fortune magazine reported on almost 40,000 stock
recommendations from 213 brokerages during 2000. The most highly
recommended stocks suffered a 31% negative return in the following
year, while the stocks least recommended gained 49% for the year. In
other words, just about the best guarantee that a stock will go down
is that the experts predict it will go up, and vice versa. And yet
the same issue of Fortune couldn't resist offering readers more stock
tips.</TE>
<TE>   Will the market come back? Probably. Two centuries of data suggest
that stocks are indeed the best place to invest money. But meanwhile,
the market could go lower still. The July 22 issue of Barron's argues
that the "support level" for the Dow--a technician's concept for
determining stock values--is 7,400. If so, then the Dow has 384 more
points to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as Barron's also noted, "support levels are not
inviolable." The same edition quotes Boston-based money manager
Jeremy Grantham as saying "1,100 is fair value" for the Nasdaq.
That's 182 points below where that tech-heavy average closed Monday.
But then, as the article notes, last year Grantham assayed the
fair-value target for the Nasdaq at 1,250.</TE>
<TE>   So is there any hope for learning, let alone investing? Three
predictions seem safe: First, it's going to be a long while before
investors write blank checks to visionaries peddling blue-sky
technologies. That's what happened over the last decade in the
Internet and telecom sectors; memories of the $4 trillion or so gone
down the drain are going to linger for a while. But, of course, the
creation of that cyber-infrastructure wasn't a total loss. Sunday
night, WorldCom was able to e-mail its bankruptcy papers to a
Manhattan court.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the professions of accounting, investment banking and
stock-analyzing are going to be under a black cloud--not to mention a
heavy federal thumb--for quite some time. And once-trendy callings
such as "day traders" and "dot-commer" might have been permanently
deleted.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the popular culture will change too. In the last two
decades, the small fraternity of ticker-tape watchers has become a
larger community of financial news consumers.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, for instance, "the money honey," became a
star, admired for her thoughts on 401(k)s as well as for her luminous
big eyes. But today this icon of brainy womanhood has been eclipsed;
CNBC's ratings have fallen as many ordinary investors grew too
discouraged to watch anyone anymore.</TE>
<TE>   And so an older approach to profiting from the nexus of looks and
lucre is making a comeback: The current issue of Playboy features
"The Women of Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Already, '90s-style money mania seems like the distant past. Yet
we might pause and reflect that it was only yesterday. And then we
can resume gazing into the future. Yes, that's the place where nobody
knows anything. But if we ever could get it figured, boy, would we
get rich quick.</TE>

<HD>The Boom or Bush Cycle</HD>
<DH>Like father, like son. Expect a war soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The public's love affair with the Bush administration is souring.
Polls show that voters are deeply worried about its handling of the
economy, although they still claim to like George W. Bush as a
person. It makes sense, of course, since who doesn't enjoy the
company of a charming confidence man?</LD>
<LD>   In the movie, a rakish George Clooney can play him, winking and
smirking and flirting as he hatches corporate scams, squanders his
friends' money and rides a friendly Supreme Court into the White
House.</LD>
<LD>   Americans are up against the reality that while the son of old vet
Poppy might make for an interesting dinner guest, telling family war
stories and all, like his father he lacks the seriousness of purpose
required to manage daily life in the real world. And should we really
expect more from men who never had to take out the garbage, let alone
worry about paying the mortgage? Men for whom the making of money was
a game without real risk or purpose?</LD>
<TE>   Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing? Heck, what's the big deal? When
a big corporation goes under, those with connections get tipped off
long before Joe Shmoe and his pet portfolio. If a Bush loses
liquidity, friends will come running, checkbooks open, as they did
for George W. to pay for his string of failed Texas investments.
Besides, the family trust fund is where the "real" money is kept.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes are, as a matter of breeding, terminally irresponsible.
And while being a loose cannon can sometimes be useful in making war,
it is stability and pragmatism that breed prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes' contempt for government regulation of capitalism has
allowed corporate piracy to drive the nation toward financial ruin.
The American public now stares in disbelief as our infamous boom-Bush
cycle wreaks havoc on its retirement plans and endangers its jobs.
Meanwhile, yet another President George seeks to distract us with
patriotic-sounding gibberish.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe people have taken a step back and asked, 'What's
important in life?' " said the president two weeks ago in
Minneapolis. "You know, the bottom line and this corporate America
stuff--is that important? Or is serving your neighbor, loving your
neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   Consider the deep cynicism of that statement from a president who
spent most of his adult life milking that "corporate America stuff"
for all it was worth, just as his super-rich ancestors had always
done.</TE>
<TE>   Diffident in the face of the traumas of ordinary Americans, George
W., like his father before him, will make the times extraordinary.
War against Iraq is the president's much-planned-for answer if the
oft-rumored "economic recovery" doesn't sustain his popularity.</TE>
<TE>   That's what all this talk of Al Qaeda sleeper cells, homeland
security and knocking off Saddam Hussein is about: a backdrop for the
theater of war, a necessary distraction to a set of domestic policies
that has failed miserably. The massive tax cut brought us nothing but
soaring national debt, Alan Greenspan has been revealed as an
impotent Wizard of Oz and the Republican magic bullet of monetarism
has proved a bust.</TE>
<TE>   But while the end of Hussein's tyranny would certainly be a cause
for cheers, the harsh truth is that the most exhaustive investigation
in human history hasn't found a single credible thread connecting him
with our current troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if we are honest, the closest we can come to an
identifiable foreign enemy is Saudi Arabia, where the Bushes love to
do business and from whence the men and money came to destroy the
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The president should heed the call of Richard Grasso, chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange, who said on Sunday, "We've got to wage a
war against terrorism in the boardroom, against misleading
investors." But to wage that fight, Bush would have to get rid of the
corporate hustlers who dominate economic policy in his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   So get out the yellow ribbons and cheer those fireworks over
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   After all, a victory party might take some of the sting off the
fact that your hard-earned retirement chest is nothing but a wistful
memory.</TE>

<HD>Moscow Should Hand Over Fugitive Weapons Trafficker</HD>
<DH>U.S. is derelict in not demanding action from its
war-on-terror ally.</DH>

<LD>Most Americans would be shocked to learn that one of the Taliban's
favorite arms smugglers is now living freely and openly in a country
that is supposed to be an ally in the U.S. war against terrorism--and
that the Bush administration has done nothing about it.</LD>
<LD>   Another story of double-dealing by Saudi Arabia or divided
loyalties in Pakistan? No, this problem is in Russia. It offers a
glimpse into the global infrastructure of terrorism and international
crime, and why Russia's role in international affairs is still
unclear.</LD>
<LD>   When Vladimir V. Putin became president, it appeared that Russia
would take control of its future from the oligarchs and criminals.
And it still might. Putin has taken a number of impressive steps to
begin to reform Russian society. Yet the story of Victor Bout raises
some of the old questions.</LD>
<TE>   According to at least four separate United Nations reports, Bout,
a former Soviet military officer fluent in five languages, built an
international arms trafficking network that delivers arms to all of
Africa's major conflict zones. Bout has also reportedly worked on
behalf of the Al Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines and
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, whom Washington still considers a
sponsor of terrorism. And for years Bout also secretly helped the
Taliban obtain tons of heavy artillery, assault rifles and other
weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, and his connection
to a regime that gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist
network, Bout is not running for his life. On the contrary, he is
living quite comfortably in Russia. To date, Putin has not touched
him. And why should he? Neither President Bush nor any senior
administration official has asked him to.</TE>
<TE>   That is a far different approach than the one taken by President
Clinton. After identifying Bout as a threat to U.S. interests in
2000, the U.S. began to work with Britain, South Africa and Belgium
to disrupt Bout's activities and take down his organization.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, those efforts came into the open when the
Belgians issued an international arrest warrant for Bout. The
Interpol warrant dislodged him from his base in the United Arab
Emirates and made him an international fugitive. But Bout fled to
Russia, where he appears to be enjoying official protection.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 28, the same day that Bout walked into a Moscow radio
station to maintain his innocence, a spokesman for Interpol's Russian
bureau suggested that Bout was not even in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he remains a free man in Moscow, sheltered by a Russian
government that is reportedly skeptical of the allegations against
him.</TE>
<TE>   Bush should press Putin to hand Bout over to international law
enforcement authorities. Bush should explain to Putin that Bout's
organization--and groups like it--threaten common Russian and U.S.
security interests. It is clear that Russian law enforcement agencies
will not act without Putin's direct intervention.</TE>
<TE>   In fueling the deaths of innocents, Bout's organization offends
Russian and American values. And in arming rogues and terrorists, it
undermines our common objectives in promoting international security
and the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Bout's continuing impunity also sends the wrong message about the
future of a country still teetering between the rule of law and
criminality. To create a stable international order, the U.S. and
Russia need to address post-Cold War threats together.</TE>
<TE>   A good way to start would be to take down Victor Bout.</TE>

<LD>One day Wall Street is spooked by WorldCom's filing for bankruptcy,
the next by Citigroup's apparent ties to Enron. Small investors
haven't a clue about what's coming and whom to trust.</LD>
<LD>   They have plenty of reasons to be dazed. Even before Monday, the
market had recorded its worst two-week drop since the 1987 crash. But
is a fundamental shift taking place, one in which small investors are
bailing out for good? Or is this just part of an ordinary if
unusually nasty market cycle, the decline before the ascent?</LD>
<LD>   Richard Grasso, New York Stock Exchange chief, says the market is
in the down part of a cycle and eventually will recover and investors
will be rewarded if they remain calm. But according to Allen Sinai of
Decision Economics Inc., if they don't, there's a big chance that the
market will drag down consumer spending and the still-weak economy
will follow.</LD>
<TE>   There are many confounding factors, including public anger at
executives who walked away with millions before their companies
tanked. There's impatience to see corrupt executives punished sharply
for cooking the books--and not much belief that it will happen,
despite all the promises of crackdowns. There's fear that many other
phony bottom lines simply haven't been exposed yet. And there's the
wild card--will foreigners continue to pull out of U.S. investments?</TE>
<TE>   The best way to avoid the doomsayers' scenario is for President
Bush and Congress to sweep faster. Bush should start with his own
house, ordering the Securities and Exchange Commission to release any
documents related to his controversial sale of energy company stock
in 1990. Get it out and get it over with, like any smart company with
bad news to impart. Right now, Bush's history is an albatross.</TE>
<TE>   He also needs to fire the head of the SEC, Harvey L. Pitt, who was
a prominent attorney for the big accounting firms and has had to
recuse himself from more than 20 investigative cases because of his
links to industry. Pitt is not the right leader for a crisis of this
magnitude.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, instead of merely agreeing to sign whatever is passed,
should openly urge congressional Republicans to support the strict
Senate version of the accounting reform bill. House Republicans need
to get behind the bill and pass it swiftly, not chip away at it with
amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Bush keeps trying to build consumer confidence by simply saying
the economy is fundamentally sound and that he supports reform.
Workers and retirees watching their assets sink aren't buying it.
When Bush offers vague generalities rather than specific reforms,
frightened investors pull out and the market tumbles, as it did by
more than 200 points at the end of a wildly gyrating day Monday. Bush
should be able to detect a pattern by now and alter his course.</TE>

<LD>Pakistan's effort to stop infiltrators from entering the disputed
state of Kashmir and India's restrained response to Islamic
militants' slaughter of more than two dozen people there provide
solid ground that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell can build on
when he visits the region this weekend. Such is the slow but
important cycle of diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's trip follows one by the British foreign secretary, Jack
Straw, and many feverish visits to the region last spring by U.S.
emissaries. Then, India and Pakistan seemed headed toward war after
attacks in New Delhi and Kashmir that India blamed on guerrillas
crossing from Pakistan. The restraint demonstrated by these two
nuclear-armed adversaries following recent attacks is ample reason
for yet more mediation by allies.</LD>
<LD>   After this month's assault by Islamic extremists, India muted its
rhetoric and did not move more troops toward the border. This
discipline increases the burden on Washington to pressure Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf to continue his efforts to bar militants
from crossing into Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, has reached a
precarious political moment. He angered many Pakistanis by casting
his lot with Washington after Sept. 11, turning his back on
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, who had taken power several years
before with Pakistan's support. He then alienated more Pakistanis by
rigging an April referendum to keep himself in power for five more
years. In an even more blatant power grab, Musharraf is now trying to
rewrite the national constitution before parliamentary elections in
October so as to give the military permanent political authority.
That has cost him the support of the country's political parties and
advocates for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has been governed by military usurpers for about half its
55 years of independence. Eventually, every general in charge loses
support, though usually it takes much longer than it has for
Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Powell should advise the general that more Pakistanis will back
him if he drops the proposed constitutional changes and helps the
country get back on the road to democracy. Powell can tell India that
pulling back a substantial number of its troops from the border would
offer Musharraf an accomplishment to show his constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent reduction of tensions would give the two nations an
opportunity to talk to each other about Kashmir and about ways to
decrease the chances of blowing each other to oblivion--victories for
diplomacy all around.</TE>

<LD>Last year President Bush eliminated the American Bar Assn. from the
process of vetting potential judicial nominees, a role it performed
ably and in a nonpartisan way for the nine presidents before him. Now
he relies on the ideological tests of the very conservative
Federalist Society.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the men and women who pass this rigid test look
remarkably alike on the bench. They often side with business in
disputes involving employee rights, consumers and the environment.
They strongly oppose abortion, and their opinions reveal a strong
streak of judicial activism dressed up as traditional principle.</LD>
<LD>   Priscilla Owen is among them. A protege of Bush confidant Karl
Rove, who engineered her 1994 election to the Texas Supreme Court,
Owen is a nominee to a seat on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
She comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee today to defend a
record of indifference to the problems of most Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Senators should ask her why, for example, she voted to reverse a
jury verdict in favor of a woman who had sued her health insurance
company for refusing necessary surgery to remove her spleen and
gallbladder. Her colleague on the Texas high court, Alberto Gonzales,
now Bush's top legal advisor, dissented, writing that Owen's decision
turned the legal standard in that case "on its head."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, a solid conservative himself, also took issue with Owen
in an abortion case that should draw tough questions from Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairwoman of today's hearing. Texas law allows
pregnant teenagers in some instances to seek permission from a judge
to have an abortion without their parents' consent. Yet Owen has
staunchly opposed such "judicial bypasses." In one case, Gonzales
wrote, Owen's opinion would have "create[d] hurdles that simply are
not found in the ... statute" and would be "an unconscionable act of
judicial activism." In other cases, her colleagues have accused her
of "inflammatory rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   For all this, Owen's nomination puts Feinstein in a tough spot.
She was chairwoman last March when the Judiciary Committee rejected
Charles Pickering, another Bush pick for the 5th Circuit. She is
anxious to avoid being labeled obstructionist. But given her repeated
calls for mainstream nominees, not to mention her long support for
abortion rights, Feinstein should vote no, and so should her
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is now one of the most conservative appellate federal
courts, the 5th Circuit has a long and honorable history--defending
civil rights during the 1960s and the rights of asbestos workers,
systematically deceived and injured by their employers, in the 1970s.
Owen would add nothing positive to that legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Americans want independent, common-sensical and capable judges,
not those whose political ideology--from either direction--wins them
a nomination. As long as Bush continues to exclude the American Bar
Assn. from the nomination process, he should not be surprised that
his choices draw fire.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Windbags of War," Opinion, July 21: Ana Marie Cox worries
about a "tacit complicity between policymakers and media ... [that]
contributes to an atmosphere of hysteria that undercuts our good
judgment and weakens our loyalty to civil rights."</LD>
<LD>   She prefers experts who see little danger from foreign sources.
She approvingly quotes one such expert to the effect that the risk of
an attack on nuclear plants is "really very, very small." According
to Cox, the major danger facing the U.S. is an overreaction on the
part of right-wing warmongers. I hope she's right, but I doubt it.</LD>

<TE>   Straight out of Central Casting to play the wicked witch of the
Republican right, Ann Coulter--one of Cox's subjects--is guaranteed
to do time on all of the talk shows and sell her book while
interrupting those who disagree with her. She thrives on negativity
and unashamedly plays the Christian card with a very unchristian
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   From her harbor of hate, Coulter tried to sink the Clinton ship of
state with every verbal blast of arrogance at her command. But while
the captain's personal behavior left a lot to be desired, it did not
result in wrecking the lives of thousands of senior citizens or
dashing the hopes of so many young people now stranded on the rocks
of the unemployment line. Coulter is still angling to reel in former
President Clinton and blame him for what in fact is the incompetence
of our well-heeled leaders, who got there not by hard work but by
hard cash, inherited. And a little malfeasance for good measure.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'Martyrdom' Dreams Take Root Early in the West Bank," July 20:
It is simply and inexcusably horrible that martyrdom is so celebrated
among Palestinian youth. Whatever family, educational, media,
political and religious powers exist to encourage this tragic
development must somehow be effectively turned around. Jews are
taught that we are all responsible for each other and that despite
differences we must love our fellow Jews. It is in that spirit that I
write.</LD>
<LD>   If you are an Israeli settler in the West Bank or in Gaza, relying
on the Israel Defense Forces to protect you everywhere you go at all
times, you are courting danger and death for yourselves and your
neighbors. God is clearly not protecting you. Your young children
made no choice to live on other people's land and deprive them of
their legitimate rights to peoplehood.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately a political agreement will be reached, I pray sooner
than later. The time is long overdue for Israel to solidify its
borders more or less consistently with the 1967 Green Line and stop
offering up more Jewish lives to martyrdom. American Jews are barely
aware of it, but Israeli polls still consistently show substantial
support, even majority support, for this position. I am a proud Jew,
a lover of my people and of Israel. Long may it thrive. Without
excusing any crimes committed by Palestinians or anyone else, I am
deeply troubled to see Israel on a suicidal course with no
conceivable positive outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gordon</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article about the desire of Palestinian children to become
shahids (martyrs), and the shocked reaction of some parents, is a
testament to the generations of hate created by the schools of the
Palestinian Authority. Electing new leaders is not necessarily the
answer. Rather, it is a program of re-education that will serve as
the hallmark of a true and genuine peace movement. Instead of giving
millions of dollars to the PA, which funnels it into the private bank
accounts of its leadership, the funds should go directly to the
public school systems, to be administered by a committee or
foundation of the U.S. and the European Union, and should be given
only on the condition that the textbooks and brainwashing that teach
hatred of Jews and the destruction of Israel be replaced with
teaching that supports democratic principles, a desire to end the
bloodshed and intercultural exchanges.</TE>

<LD>Re "Murder Suspect Is No Stranger to Violence," July 20: The fact
that the alleged killer of Samantha Runnion, Alejandro Avila, was
tried for assaulting two little girls and found innocent is really a
sorry tale of our weak system. This man should have been locked up
instead of roaming our streets.</LD>
<LD>   It was noted that Avila had pornographic material on his computer,
a common occurrence with sex perverts. This could be one reason we
are seeing an epidemic in these crimes.</LD>

being arrested.</TE>

<TE>   As a former law enforcement official, I am particularly perplexed
that the police and the satellite technology experts have not
combined their efforts in developing a child location device similar
to the technology used in the global positioning system. How many
more children have to perish needlessly before this valuable
available resource is put to use outside of luxury car navigational
systems?</TE>
<TE>   Critics may say that "bugging" children amounts to Big Brother.
Query Elizabeth Smart's and Samantha's families regarding their
willingness to have sacrificed some of their children's privacy in
return for some peace of mind. Let's get on with it. Too many
children remain vulnerable to opportunistic as well as committed
predators.</TE>

<TE>   With all the anxiety about children being abducted, there is
something that we men can do to help. Parents have told their
children not to talk to strangers. When we see a child or children
playing in front of the house or at the playground and stop to talk
to them, we are breaking down this training.</TE>
<TE>   If you happen to see a child playing and make eye contact, just
smile and keep on walking. Do not stop and ask his or her name, offer
candy or anything else like that. A simple "Hi" will do, and go about
your business. If a parent or other adult is there, speak to the
adult first. This will let the child know that the adult accepts your
presence. It is a shame that we have to think this way, but I have
seen men with the best of intentions stop and talk to children, and
this breaks down the precautions the parents have taught.</TE>

<LD>Re "Despite Skeptics and Critics, Cryonics May Be a Cool Way to Go,"
Commentary, July 19: People who believe that a man who had died can
be revived by cloning his cryonically preserved cells overlook the
fact that the personality does not reside in the DNA. Identical twins
are perfect clones of each other, yet they are not the same person
and sometimes are exact opposites. When a body is cloned, the
spiritual being inhabiting that body is not part of the package.</LD>

<LD>Re "2,400 Legislative Workers Go Unpaid as Budget Battle Continues,"
July 13: A simple solution to the problem of not meeting any
legislative deadline would be to fine all members of both parties
$100 for the first day missed, double that for the second day, double
the second-day total for the third day and so on. When these fat cats
figure out what the potential cost to their pocketbooks could be, I
believe deadlines would be met very quickly. Would they buy in to
that? I think not.</LD>

<HD>NBA's Iverson Is Not Alone in His 'Trial by Media'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gar Anthony Haywood is a fine novelist, and he brought a great
dramatic flair to his July 18 commentary, "Put Away the Rope in the
Iverson Case," on Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, who was
charged with forcing his way into an apartment and threatening two
men with a gun. Haywood argued that Iverson is being "nailed to the
cross" by his "would-be executioners," who are "virtually hanging him
in the town square without a trial" as they "march upon 'Iverson
Castle.' " Very nicely worded, but his central thesis is flawed.</LD>
<LD>   Haywood claims that the "zeal" with which Iverson is being
criticized is due to the color of his skin and his "thuggish"
demeanor. However, white celebrities who have been accused of crimes
are equally vilified in the press and in the court of public opinion.
What about Robert Blake? Martha Stewart? Kathy Lee Gifford (whose
"crime," apart from being gratingly annoying, was that she didn't
know that the conglomerate that had paid her to attach her name to a
line of clothing was using underage workers)?</LD>
<LD>   And what about white athletes? Were the media and the public any
kinder to ice skater Tonya Harding? What about former Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker, whose crime was ... oh, I forgot, he didn't
actually commit any crime, he just uttered offensive statements.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, there is a double standard when black celebrities are
involved in public scandals. Whereas white celebrities have no real
recourse against the media pundits and angry mobs, black celebrities
(and their defenders) can always play the race card, drop a few
lynching references and try to shame their critics into silence. As
an African American, I reject these cynical, race-baiting techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Marlon Mohammed</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone else see the irony in Haywood's commentary? While he
is protesting "the zeal with which Iverson and the like ... are
nailed to the cross" and stating, "No matter how guilty of a crime
the accused might turn out to be, a lynching is still a lynching,"
The Times' lead front-page story in the same edition is about the
indictment of Inglewood police officers Jeremy Morse and Bijan
Darvish.</TE>
<TE>   Many black leaders have been trying to "lynch" Morse, without the
benefit of a trial, since this incident became news. Haywood's
commentary would be of far greater value if he had included the
Inglewood incident as another example where "a lynching is still a
lynching."</TE>

<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the so-called persecution of Iverson by the media (white
media was the implication), I find it interesting that he was able to
tell the authorities that he would turn himself in a number of days
after the alleged incident. Wow! I wonder if the average alleged
offender would have the privilege of deciding when he would turn
himself in and not be dragged to jail like everyone else.</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Sidewalk Spat Shaping Up Over Vehicle</HD>
<DH>The Segway has a top speed of 12.5 mph. Critics see a
danger to pedestrians, but it seems on fast track to approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has two wheels and a handlebar, but don't call it a scooter.</LD>
<LD>   It is propelled by an electric motor, but don't confuse it with a
golf cart.</LD>
<LD>   The much-ballyhooed Segway human transporter is a self-balancing,
motorized conveyance that is unique in the world of transportation.
But marketing concerns are only part of the reason why the
manufacturer is particular about what to call it.</LD>
<TE>   Segway LLC of New Hampshire doesn't want you to confuse its
invention with a scooter or an electric cart because such vehicles
are prohibited from public sidewalks in most states. In fact, the
only motorized vehicles allowed on sidewalks in California are
wheelchairs and carts used by the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Segway hopes to change that. The firm has sponsored legislation in
Sacramento to rewrite the definition of a pedestrian to include
people using the Segway transporter, thus allowing the device to roll
on all public sidewalks in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate already has approved the bill, and a final vote
in the Assembly is expected next month. Similar legislation sponsored
by Segway in 30 other states has already been adopted.</TE>
<TE>   But many pedestrian activists and advocates for the blind don't
count themselves among the bill's supporters. They worry that the
65-pound transporter, with a top cruising speed of 12.5 mph, will
endanger senior citizens, children and other pedestrians when it goes
on the market sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   "That could kill somebody," said Deborah Murphy, founder of L.A.
Walks, a pedestrian advocacy group in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the concerns over pedestrian safety, the Segway
transporter has also raised questions about who or what should have
access to public sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Created by inventor Dean Kamen, the Segway looks like a push-style
lawnmower. But it is equipped with 10 computers and five gyroscopes
to keep a single rider balanced on two side-by-side wheels.</TE>
<TE>   It has no brakes or accelerator. A rider, standing on the
transporter platform, simply shifts forward and silently glides
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The transporter has already made appearances on NBC's "Tonight
Show" and ABC's "Good Morning America" and at Disney World's Epcot
Center. It is in use by the U.S. Postal Service, the National Park
Service and at several law enforcement agencies nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   It is expected to go on sale to the public next year, with a price
tag starting at about $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Bill 1918 would allow an "electric assistive mobility
device" with the Segway's specifications on all sidewalks, without
requiring the rider to have a license or a helmet. If the bill is
adopted, cities can impose limits on the time and place where the
devices are used.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest concern for critics is that the machine can operate at
three to four times the speed of an average pedestrian. At that
velocity, critics say, the Segway should be relegated to bike lanes
or the street.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Skivers, president of the California Council for the
Blind, is concerned that the device could be dangerous to visually
impaired pedestrians who won't hear the near-silent electric
transporter approaching.</TE>
<TE>   Segway officials say the transporter is too small and slow for
streets. Besides, they say, the device has been thoroughly tested,
and it continues to be evaluated by government agencies throughout
the country.</TE>
<TE>   But the testing has not been without a few bumps. In May, a member
of a business district patrol unit in Atlanta toppled from a Segway
going up a driveway onto a sidewalk, injuring his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Segway officials point out that--as is the case with bicycles,
scooters and skateboards--the rider is ultimately responsible for
operating the device safely.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology does not replace common sense," said Matt Dailida,
manager of state government affairs for Segway.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics say that even when properly used, the machine can
be dangerous in an innocent mishap.</TE>
<TE>   David Lawrence, director of the Center for Injury Prevention
Policy and Practice at San Diego State University, said a collision
between pedestrians is usually harmless. But, he asked, what happens
if one of those pedestrians is on a Segway?</TE>
<TE>   "If someone bumps into a Segway operator, that same temporary loss
of balance could send a speeding vehicle careening into people
walking nearby," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   Dailida said the transporter--when traveling at 9 mph--takes about
four feet to stop. And if a rider falls off, it stops automatically,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   But accidents are inevitable, and a Washington, D.C., law firm is
already preparing to take advantage of that fact. The firm, called
USA Immigration Law Center, has announced that it is preparing to
specialize in Segway injury cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the Segway HT [human transporter] is a legal
nightmare and will be the basis for many lawsuits, both from the
corporate and consumer side," the law firm says on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Dailida said he had not heard of the firm but added: "It's very
premature for any group like that to prepare for legal suits against
our company."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, liability issues have prompted officials at
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to reconsider using the
Segway transporter in a pilot project intended to promote alternative
transportation around transit centers. The project, which was
scheduled to start in April, is on hold pending further study.</TE>
<TE>   But such setbacks have not discouraged Segway, which invested $100
million in creating the human transporter. The company also spent
$49,000 on a Sacramento lobbying firm to push the legislation
submitted by Sen. Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch).</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith, president of Walk San Francisco, a Bay Area
pedestrian advocacy group, suggested that Segway had used its money
and influence to get the Senate to vote 30 to 1 in support of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sidewalks are not for sale," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Torlakson said he has taken no contributions from Segway but
championed the legislation because he is interested in promoting
alternative transportation. "It's an incredible invention," he said.
"Let's give it a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the safety concerns, critics wonder whether the Segway
transporter is needed. Given the problems America has with obesity
and diabetes, they ask why more people don't use old-fashioned foot
power to get around.</TE>
<TE>   Said Smith: "What the Segway would do is automate one of the
oldest forms of exercise: walking."</TE>

<HD>Cypress Asks Federal Court to Stay Out of Dispute Over
Costco</HD>
<DH>Land use: The city wants the issue decided under California
law. The Cottonwood Christian Center has asked for intervention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a lawsuit to end the lawsuit in the dispute between Cypress and
the Cottonwood Christian Center. The question is whether the city can
turn the church's land into a Costco.</LD>
<LD>   Cypress has asked a federal court to keep out of the
fight--despite a church request for intervention--and let the Orange
County Superior Court decide.</LD>
<LD>   The city is trying to use eminent domain to take the land where
Cottonwood wants to build a mega-church. The city already is
negotiating to sell Costco the 18 acres.</LD>
<TE>   Church attorneys say the city's attempt to take the property is an
unconstitutional government seizure and a violation of a recent
federal law that exempts churches from most local land use rules.</TE>
<TE>   The battle has gained national attention and is viewed as a test
case of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of
2000.</TE>
<TE>   City officials defend their move as a routine use of state
redevelopment law. They say the state court should decide whether
building a commercial center is a legitimate public use that
justifies taking the church's land. The city estimates it would
receive $900,000 annually in sales taxes from a Costco.</TE>
<TE>   "We are saying that this land was last used for a swap meet and
has no intrinsic religious value," said William Wynder, Cypress city
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood bought the land at Walker Street and Katella Avenue in
1999 to build a church that could hold its 4,000 members and would
include a gym, a 300,000-square-foot auditorium, a day care center
and classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Church and city officials disagree over whether Cottonwood was
warned the city wanted a commercial center there when it bought the
property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at a loss to understand the city's apparent fear over a
federal court deciding this case," said Sean O'Connor, an attorney
for Cottonwood. "It's one thing for the city to violate the U.S.
Constitution. It's another for them to violate [the Religious Land
Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]," he said. "They violated both
in one swoop. We think that will get the court's attention."</TE>

<HD>Arson Investigators Prepare for Fire Season at Annual
Conference</HD>
<DH>Safety: The danger is significant this year as record
dryness continues. Officials gather to hone their skills on
controlled structural blazes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEASIDE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Kathleen Lange will never know all of the 340 arson investigators who
have poured into this sleepy coastal town near Monterey for a
conference this week. But she still considers them family.</LD>
<LD>   And whether an arsonist sets fire to tinder-dry Silverado Canyon
in Orange County or the brown hills east of San Diego, Lange takes it
personally. It's her colleagues around the state who will be called
to stamp those blazes out.</LD>
<LD>   "People that set fires on purpose are putting my brothers and
sisters at risk," said Lange, a fire investigator with the Orange
County Fire Authority. "And I want to catch them."</LD>
<TE>   That feeling is particularly strong this year among arson
investigators assembled here for the California Conference of Fire
Investigators. They face a year of record dryness and huge fire
potential--one that they know could inspire the most dangerous
firebugs.</TE>
<TE>   Before the conference is finished Wednesday, investigators will
talk for hours about the danger in the hills this year. They will
watch one of the largest controlled building burns to be attempted at
such an event to perfect their sleuthing skills. And they will get
advice on how to withstand a defense attorney on the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   Several investigators said they recently returned from assisting
in the investigations of huge wildfires in Arizona, Colorado and
South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically being told to get ready to travel," said Keith
Burson, a battalion chief for the South Placer Fire District. "We're
seeing a lot of dangerous fire behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from Burson's company recently returned from the
Hayman Fire in Colorado, which burned about 150,000 acres in June.</TE>
<TE>   That blaze was just part of what is quickly becoming a very
destructive fire season. With the peak months of August and September
still ahead, the number of acres burned is nearly triple the 10-year
average of 1.1 million acres.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 4,417 fires have charred 142,788 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire season is controlled by fuels, and there is a lot of
fuel," said Tim Simpkins, a fire investigator for the
Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department in the San Francisco Bay Area.
"We're seeing it all across the West, and [California] is ripe right
now."</TE>
<TE>   While they worry about forest and brush fires, the conferees will
spend much of their session honing their skills on the source of
structural fires.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers constructed a series of rooms at the closed Ft. Ord
Army base, and one by one they will be burned, then inspected by
clipboard-toting arson investigators.</TE>
<TE>   One room contained a set of children's bunk beds, stuffed animals
and toys. The fire was set to simulate what would occur in a real
event. Within two minutes, the room was in flames.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators took detailed notes as thick black smoke churned
overhead and a team of firefighters blasted the blaze with hoses.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 feet away, a team of fire researchers used a computer
hooked to the building to chart the speed and heat of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Like football players watching tape from a game the night before,
investigators planned to spend part of today studying the fires on
videotape, said Greg Smith, a fire investigator with the California
Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   "The standards are higher in an investigation now," Smith said as
a room set up to look like a kitchen burned behind him. "We want to
be as accurate as possible."</TE>

<HD>Sequoia Blaze Consumes 15,000 Acres</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: Four hundred Boy Scouts in the national forest
have been evacuated to avoid the fast-moving flames. More hot weather
is expected today.</DH>

<LD>A wildfire in the Sequoia National Forest continued to rage out of
control Monday, after burning a mountain resort and forcing the
evacuation of 400 Boy Scouts, two boys' camps and the town of
Johnsondale.</LD>
<LD>   The McNalley Fire erupted near the Road's End Resort in Tulare
County on Sunday afternoon. By Monday evening, it had consumed more
than 15,000 acres, and fire officials said they didn't know when it
would be contained.</LD>
<LD>   "The fire moved really fast, and now it's going up into steeper
terrain," said Norm Carpenter, spokesman for the Sequoia National
Forest. He said the winds often are erratic in the area and that more
hot weather is expected today, which won't help.</LD>
<TE>   The fire burned in the 3,760-acre Giant Sequoia National Monument,
designated by President Clinton in 2000. The monument preserves
groves of giant sequoias and protects the surrounding American Indian
archeological sites.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was burning near the park's Trail of 100 Giants, a grove
of the towering trees, officials said none of the giant trees was in
immediate danger.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight structures burned, and more than half a dozen roads
in the area were closed. More than 1,000 firefighters battled the
blaze.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Kern County, a second wildfire near Lake Isabella
was 50% contained Monday after burning 1,600 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The Deer Fire burned 20 structures and forced about 75 residents
to flee temporarily, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of both fires is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   And in Northern California, a lightening storm Sunday night
sparked 28 fires near Chico. More than 250 firefighters and 11
aircraft battled those blazes.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday evening, all 28 fires were contained after having burned
only 138 acres, but firefighters would stay on the lines until they
were all extinguished, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>A federal court judge is expected to rule today on a request for a
preliminary injunction barring further construction of a 174-acre
terminal in the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The request was filed by a coalition of community and
environmental groups that contends the Army Corps of Engineers failed
to review potential hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Under a $650-million lease agreement with the city, China Shipping
Holding Co. plans to build two wharves that would handle 1.2 million
containers a year.</LD>

<HD>Car vs. Big Rig: Usually Loser's Fault</HD>
<DH>Safety: Not only are 98% of the fatalities in the
automobile, but its driver has most likely gotten in the truck's way,
concludes a nationwide study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Car drivers are most often to blame for fatal accidents with big-rig
trucks and are most likely to die in those crashes, according to a
national study to be released today. The study of more than 10,000
fatal accidents by the Automobile Assn. of America's Foundation for
Traffic Safety determined that car drivers cause most collisions with
big rigs by speeding, failing to yield or cutting in the path of the
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Of those killed in the car-versus-truck accidents, 98% are car
drivers or their passengers, the study concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The study echoed the findings of previous research that blamed the
drivers of passenger vehicles for most collisions with big rigs. But
for the first time, the AAA study sought to determine the most common
driving behavior that results in such accidents.</LD>
<TE>   The study did not calculate how often car drivers were at fault
nationally. But the Automobile Club of Southern California estimated
that, among those accidents in which police determined who was to
blame, car drivers, motorcyclists and pedestrians were blamed for 69%
of their accidents with big rigs in California last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fatalities resulting from accidents involving big rigs dropped in
California to 396 last year, from 412 in 2000, according to the
California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The findings of the national study are significant for Southern
California motorists who find themselves increasingly sharing
congested roads with big rigs. Due to a surge in overseas cargo
shipments, big rig traffic from the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach has increased steadily and is expected to more than triple by
2020, from 30,000 trips a day to 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Car drivers need to realize that greater precautions must be
taken when driving near trucks," said Steven Bloch, senior researcher
for AAA.</TE>
<TE>   Such accidents are most often blamed on car drivers who fail to
stay in their lanes, refuse to yield right of way to big rigs, drive
too fast for conditions or otherwise break traffic laws, according to
the AAA study.</TE>
<TE>   The study says car drivers are usually responsible for such
accidents because they don't adjust their driving habits around big
rigs.</TE>
<TE>   "One reason why some car drivers perform unsafe maneuvers near
large trucks may be that they simply don't know the risks associated
with driving near trucks," the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their size, weight and momentum, big rigs need more
room to maneuver and stop than passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Peterson, who has been driving an 18-wheeler for nearly
25 years, said she routinely sees car drivers change lanes without
signaling, or cut in front of her truck and then slam on the brakes.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't realize that it takes more than a length of a football
field to stop when we are traveling at 55 mph," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said she saw such risky maneuvers as recently as Friday
morning, when she drove from Victorville to Long Beach. "If you had
been with me today, you would have seen all of those [driving
habits]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Hoemann, vice president of the California Trucking Assn.,
said the study also emphasizes a need to educate drivers about the
dangers of maneuvering near trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The study suggests that authorities make those risks clear by
letting drivers spend time in the cab of a big rig or a simulator.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Highway Administration has already launched the
No-Zone campaign to warn car drivers not to drive in dangerous areas,
such as blind spots where truck drivers cannot see passenger
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Hoemann added: "When an accident does happen, everybody has a
problem, so who is at fault is not as important as avoiding these
accidents."</TE>

Jackson be sentenced to death for the murder of a West Covina police
officer.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, 48, was sent to death row in 1984 for the fatal shooting
of Officer Kenneth Wrede. But a federal appeals court overturned his
death sentence two years ago on the grounds that his lawyer had
failed to provide an adequate defense during the penalty phase of the
trail.</LD>
<LD>   After a retrial of the penalty phase that began July 1, another
Los Angeles Superior Court jury decided Monday that Jackson should be
executed. Formal sentencing is set for Sept. 23.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to see that justice is served," West Covina Police
Chief Frank Wills said Monday. "We hope that this will bring some
closure for the Wrede family and the department."</TE>
<TE>   According to a summation of evidence by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals, Jackson had been smoking PCP cigarettes before he ran
into the street on Aug. 31, 1983, and threw himself onto the
pavement. When Wrede, 26, drove up and got out of his patrol car,
Jackson refused to cooperate and attacked the officer.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Wrede ran back to his patrol car and radioed for help.
At the same time, Jackson pulled a shotgun from the officer's car and
opened fire, fatally wounding the officer, detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court jury convicted Jackson of murder and recommended
a death sentence that subsequently was imposed by the trial judge. In
1989, the state Supreme Court upheld both the conviction and the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   However, on May 9, 2000, with Jackson's scheduled execution date
fast approaching, the federal appeals court upheld Jackson's murder
conviction but concluded that if all available evidence had been
presented during the penalty phase of the trial, there was a
reasonable chance that he might have received a sentence of life
imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   The judges criticized former Los Angeles County public defender
William Klump for failing to present possibly mitigating evidence
that Jackson had been choked by his mother as a boy, that he had once
been diagnosed as schizophrenic and that use of PCP might have
rendered him incapable of knowing he was killing Wrede.</TE>

<HD>Family Says It Will File Claim in Falling Death of
Handcuffed Suspect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a handcuffed man who plunged to his death last weekend
from a second-story landing says it will file a claim against Upland
police alleging the fall should not have happened while the man was
in police custody.</LD>
<LD>   Ronnie Bullock, 44, died Saturday at Arrowhead Regional Medical
Center in Colton a few hours after the fall.</LD>
<LD>   Upland police said two officers had handcuffed Bullock outside his
apartment and were telling him that he was being arrested on an
outstanding warrant for a parole violation when he suddenly tried to
escape over a 37-inch-high rail.</LD>
<TE>   "When he swung his leg over, the momentum carried him headfirst
onto the concrete 12 to 15 feet below," Sgt. Ken Bonson said. "That's
what a woman at the apartment and officers told investigators."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Bullock's family, Joe C. Hopkins, said Monday that
he was preparing a wrongful death claim.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very least, they had a duty to protect him once he was in
police custody.... He fell backward on his head."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins is representing Bullock's sons, Rodney, 16, and Ronnie Jr.
24; his stepson, Michael Harris, 14; and his father, Robert Lee
Bullock, 71.</TE>
<TE>   Upland police said Bullock made a similar daring jump from a
second story on May 16, 1999, to flee another pair of the
department's officers, but was captured on the ground. On that
occasion, he had run through a glass door to the balcony, Bonson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows why he did it," Bonson said of Friday's incident.
"In 1999, he suffered only minor injuries from the jump. Maybe he
thought he could do it again. He was probably facing state prison for
a parole violation."</TE>
<TE>   As it does with all deaths involving officers, the Upland Police
Department called in the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department
to investigate the incident.</TE>
<TE>   It began after police received a call about 11:15 p.m. about a man
in a striped shirt and jeans trying to remove a screen from a
second-story apartment at 1334 W. Foothill Blvd. Bonson said when
officers found Bullock in the parking area, he told them he was
locked out of his upstairs apartment. After learning he had an
outstanding warrant, they handcuffed him, Bonson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins said the officers should have ensured that Bullock wasn't
near the railing. "This unnecessary death needs to be thoroughly
investigated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock lived at the apartment with two of his three children,
Hopkins said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy found that Bullock died of a "blunt head, neck and
chest injury."</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor to Pay Fees of Fighting Her Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge says deputy D.A. owes the county $111,562
spent contesting her charge that a sexual harassment claim led to
retaliation. Her complaint was dismissed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge ordered a Los Angeles County deputy district
attorney Monday to reimburse the county for $111,562 in attorney's
fees incurred in defending against a suit she filed after making a
sexual harassment complaint against a colleague.</LD>
<LD>   Denise Moehlman had accused the district attorney's office of
retaliating against her after her complaint. Judge Robert Parkin
ruled that her lawsuit was frivolous and ordered her to repay legal
costs.</LD>
<LD>   Parkin had dismissed the lawsuit Jan. 25, after hearing several
days of testimony, saying that the district attorney's office and
several officials within the office were immune from such a suit.</LD>
<TE>   Moehlman, a deputy district attorney for 14 years, has appealed
the dismissal. She said she also would appeal Monday's ruling on the
fees. She said its effect would be to discourage the filing of sexual
harassment complaints within the office.</TE>
<TE>   Donna D. Melby, an outside counsel representing the district
attorney's office, originally billed $159,000 in attorney's fees.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent letter to Moehlman, Melby suggested that the demand
for the fees would be put off for eight months if Moehlman agreed to
resign as a deputy district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Both the judge and Melby said Monday that a settlement could still
be reached, and Moehlman said after the hearing that it had been
suggested to her privately that the fees might be dropped altogether
if she agreed to quit. She said she has no intention of quitting.</TE>
<TE>   Moehlman has claimed that after she complained nearly a decade ago
about a colleague she was given poor performance ratings.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had previously received outstanding ratings. The
complaint said that the colleague, who is no longer with the office,
had exposed himself to her.</TE>
<TE>   Moehlman has not been promoted since 1995 and has said that most
deputies with her length of service have moved up.</TE>
<TE>   She also has contended that others in the office who complained
about sexual harassment have suffered retaliation, while no
substantive action has been taken on their complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Sowders, head deputy district attorney for employee
relations, said Monday that he had no comment on the Moehlman case,
other than to agree with the judge's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Moehlman is assigned to the Airport Branch Courthouse, where she
performs a variety of tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Parkin said Monday that, in his view, Moehlman had "made a sham of
the proceedings" in the trial of her lawsuit and had wasted the time
of high officials, including the former district attorney, Gil
Garcetti.</TE>
<TE>   Moehlman summoned Garcetti to testify but never called him to the
witness stand.</TE>

<DH>Aviation: The Museum of Flying plans to pack up its planes
and leave the Santa Monica Airport for another Southland location
because of rising costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From a 1919 Curtiss JN-4 Jenny that soared the sky in World War I to
a flight simulator that can turn a 12-year-old into a fighter pilot,
the Santa Monica Museum of Flying has captured history through its
aircraft displays.</LD>
<LD>   But the museum will shut its hangar doors Sunday, pack up and
venture to another location.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the rising cost of insurance since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the museum's policy limits have been reduced by
more than 90%, said Dan Ryan, executive director of the museum. A
policy that used to pay about $50 million in case of an accident will
now pay only about $2 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We had to ground our entire fleet," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the museum to a more "rural location" in Southern
California will allow the running war birds to fly once again because
the densely populated area surrounding the Santa Monica Airport has
caused insurance premiums to rise. Although negotiations for a new
location are being finalized, Ryan would not comment on where the
museum will reopen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragic loss for the city of Santa Monica and pilots and
non-pilots alike throughout the Southland," said Alan Ehrlich,
president of the El Monte-based flying club Aero Assn. of Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   The museum opened in 1989 in the same spot where, for 46 years,
the Donald Douglas Aircraft Co. manufactured and tested military and
commercial aircraft. It is home to about 35 fighter planes, including
one of two existing Douglas World Cruisers, the first aircraft to fly
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Other relics at the museum include a running P-51 Mustang,
arguably the best fighter plane during World War II, and a bell that
was rung on the battleship Arizona when it was attacked by Japanese
bombers in Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization, which is run by a board of directors,
10 paid employees and a few volunteers, is on the north side of the
Santa Monica Airport. Small planes still use its runway, but flying
the fighter planes is out of the question--insurance is higher for
them because they are old and are more likely to have mechanical
failures, Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Flying is one of about 900 aviation museums
throughout the country, but Ehrlich, who visits the museum at least
twice a year, said his favorite attractions--a Japanese Zero and a
Russian Yak--are a rarity elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of museums where you could see American war
birds, but there's not much opportunity to see" foreign fighter
planes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the vintage planes and delicate artifacts, such as Donald
Douglas' drafting table and airplane models, still attract a sizable
audience, Ryan said fear of travel and having to do away with air
shows and flights have contributed to a decline in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the museum would get about 50,000 visitors a year,
but Ryan said he sees about half of that number now. The museum,
which used to be open seven days a week, had to scale back to
weekends only.</TE>
<TE>   For an organization that depends on donations, gift store revenue,
membership fees and dues received for renting out its space for
special events, it is impossible to run the museum from its current
location, and that has been a major blow to faithful museum-goers
such as Santa Monica resident Patrick Foley.</TE>
<TE>   The 72-year-old native New Yorker flew in the Korean and Vietnam
wars and often visits the Museum of Flying. He remembers when it was
"just a small shack."</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see it move," Foley said, looking up at the planes
hanging from the ceiling. "I don't think it should move because
everything here relates to what Donald Douglas" did at the Santa
Monica Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "You can move some of the airplanes, but you can't move history,"
the veteran said while choking back tears. "It's sad. It's going to
be gone, all gone."</TE>

<HD>Hosting Camp Is No Walk in Park</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Caretakers at Ventura County campgrounds work
hard so others can play. They earn no salary but live year-round
without paying rent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up the Ventura Freeway at Hobson Beach Park, vacationers, oil
drillers and surfers line up early for the bacon cheeseburgers cooked
to order on the snack-bar griddle.</LD>
<LD>   Down the road at Faria Beach Park, the daily grind is a faded
memory for the campers, who have nothing more pressing on the daily
agenda than grilling their steaks and keeping their propane tanks
filled.</LD>
<LD>   Holding it all together, making sure the snack bars are stocked
and the campers stick to the rules, are park hosts--a small mix of
families and couples who serve as live-in caretakers at the
campgrounds, and save the county some money in the process.</LD>
<TE>   They live in their own campers in eight of the 28 parks across
Ventura County, and they do it on the cheap. Hosts earn no salary but
live at the campgrounds for free, paying only for utilities and
whatever payments remain on their mobile homes.</TE>
<TE>   It can be a very busy job, especially at this time of year, given
that some 400,000 people visit county parks annually--60% of them in
the summer months.</TE>
<TE>   Some hosts say they took the job to pad meager retirement
accounts, while others figured it beat city living. For Brian Sloan,
it's one more step toward a goal shared by many Ventura County
residents: home ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saving money to buy a house," said Sloan, a 36-year-old
mechanic who, along with his wife, Jennifer, lives in a shiny motor
home at Foster Park.</TE>
<TE>   The living expenses are low for Sloan and the other hosts, but
it's a right they have to earn. Hosts agree to keep the parks
operating smoothly while serving as sentries of sorts for sheriff's
deputies and county parks officials unable to keep tabs on the more
than 6,000 acres of parkland and 29 miles of trails that crisscross
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   And on any given summer day, that's no small order.</TE>
<TE>   The park host job can mean anything from getting a jammed sewer
line cleared to negotiating with drunken campers. Just as important,
the hosts run the snack stands and collect the nightly campsite fees
that together are an important revenue stream for the Ventura County
Parks Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be really hard to survive without them," county Parks
Director Andy Oshita said of the hosts. "Otherwise, whenever problems
occurred after hours in the evening, we would have to call back a
ranger or a maintenance person and we would have to pay overtime. Can
you see how that will kill a department?"</TE>
<TE>   Oshita helped start the county park host program nearly 20 years
ago, after Proposition 13 began trimming local funds. Since then,
park hosts have evolved from part-time caretakers to full-time,
year-round personnel for the Parks Department, which has a
$1.4-million annual budget and just four rangers assigned to patrol
the 28 parks.</TE>
<TE>   A typical summer day will find a park host solving problems that
could range from dealing with a camper's demand for more propane or
ice to making sure the snack stands have enough hot dog buns and snow
cones. And even in vacationland, real-world problems occasionally
seep in.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, rangers and park hosts were on the lookout for
a trio of motor homes that were rumored to be part of a prostitution
ring at several county parks.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the locations are remote. Faria and Hobson beach parks are
tucked below the Ventura Freeway. Steckel Park, where a man leapt to
his death in 2000 after being chased by sheriff's deputies, sits
across a dry riverbed in the hills between Santa Paula and Ojai.
Hosts have to be on alert at all times.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never have [an inattentive] day," said Darlene Shaw, who
with her husband, Richard, has served as a host at Faria Beach for
the past six years. "But it's still a lot better than having to get
dressed in the morning and go to work."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Shaws say their view beats the surroundings of their
former residence--a dingy apartment in Van Nuys--there is a downside
to the job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all it's cracked up to be," Richard Shaw said through
the window of the snack bar he and his wife lease from the county.
"You know, in the six years we've been here, we have never been to
someone's family for Thanksgiving. I need a vacation."</TE>

<LD>Up the Ventura Freeway at Hobson Beach Park, vacationers, oil

<LD>   Down the road at Faria Beach Park, the daily grind is a faded
memory for the campers, who have nothing more pressing on the daily
agenda than grilling their steaks and keeping their propane tanks
filled.</LD>
<LD>   Ten miles inland at Foster Park, just off the road to Ojai, a
collection of tent dwellers and Lake Casitas water lovers angle every
summer weekend for one of the 22 dirt campsites.</LD>
<TE>   Holding it all together, making sure the snack bars are stocked
and the campers stick to the rules, are park hosts--a small mix of
families and couples who serve as live-in caretakers at the
campgrounds, and save the county some money in the process.</TE>
<TE>   They live in their own campers in eight of the 28 parks across

<TE>   Some hosts say they took the job to pad meager retirement
accounts, while others figured it beat city living. For Brian Sloan,
it's one more step toward a goal shared by many Ventura County
residents: home ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saving money to buy a house," said Sloan, a 36-year-old
mechanic who, along with his wife, Jennifer, lives in a shiny motor
home at Foster Park surrounded by a chain-link fence, freshly cut
grass and a tool shed doubling as a playroom for his two children and
a hulking English mastiff named Scooter.</TE>
<TE>   "In two years we'll have enough for the house, and we'll leave and
give someone else the opportunity," Sloan said.</TE>
<TE>   The living expenses are low for Sloan and the other hosts, but
it's a right they have to earn. Hosts agree to keep the parks
operating smoothly while serving as sentries of sorts for sheriff's
deputies and county parks officials unable to keep tabs on the more
than 6,000 acres of parkland and 29 miles of trails that crisscross

ago, after Proposition 13 began trimming local funds. Since then,
park hosts have evolved from part-time caretakers to full-time,

$1.4-million annual budget and just four rangers assigned to patrol

ice to making sure the snack stands have enough hot dog buns and snow
cones. And even in vacationland, real-world problems occasionally
seep in.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, rangers and park hosts were on the lookout for
a trio of motor homes that were rumored to be part of a prostitution
ring at several county parks.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a crime occurring, [the hosts] will get on the phone
and call us," said Deputy Rogelio Tamase, a seven-year veteran of the
Sheriff's Department who patrols the stretch of coast between Oxnard
and the Santa Barbara County line that includes two county parks.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the locations are remote. Faria and Hobson beach parks are
tucked below the Ventura Freeway. Steckel Park, where a man leapt to
his death in 2000 after being chased by sheriff's deputies, sits
across a dry riverbed in the hills between Santa Paula and Ojai.
Hosts have to be on alert at all times.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never have [an inattentive] day," said Darlene Shaw, who
with her husband, Richard, has served as a host at Faria Beach for
the past six years. "But it's still a lot better than having to get
dressed in the morning and go to work."</TE>
<TE>   The inexpensive living arrangement is an attractive lure to the
host program, Oshita said, adding that all successful applicants go
through a background check.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly as important as the background check, Oshita said, is the
condition of the motor home the new host will park at the campground.
Oshita wants them to be as clean as the applicants' background.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 applicants are currently on a waiting list in case a
vacancy occurs among one of the eight positions, he said. There is no
day off for the hosts, Oshita said, but he hears few complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "They get free space," Oshita said. "That's why park hosts keep
their noses clean--because they have a good deal going."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Shaws say their view beats the surroundings of their
former residence--a dingy apartment in Van Nuys--there is a downside
to the job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all it's cracked up to be," Richard Shaw said through
the window of the snack bar he and his wife lease from the county in
exchange for a cut of the profits. "You know, in the six years we've
been here, we have never been to someone's family for Thanksgiving. I
need a vacation."</TE>
<TE>   As Shaw spoke, a man wearing a large floppy hat and sandals
climbed out of a camper with Oregon license plates and began asking
Shaw about campgrounds in the area with cement fire rings.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who previously worked as a printer in the San Fernando
Valley, juggled a batch of French fries boiling in the deep fryer
while he patiently explained that fire regulations preclude
wood-burning fires on Ventura County beaches. The man paused for a
moment to think, then started in with another round of inquiries
about other campgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "You see this?" Darlene Shaw said with a laugh as she sat on a
wooden picnic bench in front of the snack stand. "It's what I'm
talking about. Questions, questions, questions."</TE>

<HD>INS Employee Pleads Guilty to Bribery, Selling Stolen

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 22-year employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
pleaded guilty Monday to charges of accepting a bribe and selling
stolen immigration documents.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Chica, 52, of Los Angeles admitted stealing 22 permanent
resident cards, which she sold for $2,000 to a person who turned out
to be a government informant. She also acknowledged selling an INS
work permit to the informant for $1,500.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Elisa Fernandez told the judge that
investigators had seized another 45 INS documents during a search of
Chica's home.</LD>
<TE>   Chica told U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. that she had
acted, in part, because she had been subjected to sexual harassment
at the INS.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry at the agency," she said. But, she added, "I knew
what I was doing was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Chica, who worked at the INS office in downtown Los Angeles, was
indicted last month after a five-month FBI investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors agreed to recommend that she be sentenced to 15 months
in prison in exchange for her plea.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is not binding on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Chica, who is free on $50,000 bond, is scheduled to be sentenced
Sept. 23.</TE>

<HD>After Police Incident, Some Fear Inglewood Will Take a
Beating</HD>
<DH>Violence: Residents worry that the Donovan Jackson
controversy will hurt business and damage the city's image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a throng of protesters demonstrated last week outside the gas
station where police had beaten 16-year-old Donovan Jackson,
businessman Ken Moore was on the other side of Inglewood, keeping the
latte flowing at his 17-month-old jazz and coffee bar, the Howling
Monk.</LD>
<LD>   Moore said he hoped for a just outcome to the beating
investigation. But he was also worried that the hubbub will tarnish
outsiders' opinions of Inglewood--and harm the prospects for
businesses such as his cafe, which has been drawing strong local
crowds in the evenings.</LD>
<LD>   The media are "showing people there was another Rodney King-type
beating in Inglewood, so now they think that if things go [according]
to pattern, the city will burn," said Moore, 53. "That's not the
case. We have a rogue cop who went overboard. It's nothing we did
here in our community."</LD>
<TE>   For the last two decades, Inglewood, a city of 113,000 in
southwest Los Angeles County, has fought to free itself from the
ghetto image created by Hollywood. Like much of south Los Angeles in
the 1980s and '90s, the city was plagued by recession, riots and
crack cocaine. Its commercial core collapsed into empty lots and
boarded storefronts.</TE>
<TE>   But even through those years, and increasingly today, Inglewood
has been home to middle-class members of minority groups who are
offended when their city is lumped in with "South-Central L.A."</TE>
<TE>   When the 1991 movie "Grand Canyon" portrayed Inglewood as anarchic
urban badlands, city leaders were so incensed that they threatened to
ban movie production within their borders.Since then, Inglewood's
crime rate has steadily declined. As a result, City Administrator
Joseph Rouzan said, big-name retailers such as Home Depot and Target
moved to town in 2001, broadening the tax base for a city government
that coped with a $4-million deficit in its operating budget last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The long-suffering downtown, meanwhile, underwent a
multimillion-dollar face lift, attracting a few new businesses--among
them the Howling Monk.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought, if we could suppress the crime problem we could
attract business, and I do believe it has worked," said Rouzan, who
has been with the city since 1998. "Some businesses are coming here.
But let's be frank: Anytime a city is heavily populated with
minorities, people get the subliminal message that it's a bad place
to be."</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan admitted that Inglewood still has a long way to go. Though
it still bills itself as the "City of Champions," the label has lost
some glitz since the Los Angeles Lakers abandoned the Forum, which
was one of the city's primary attractions, for Los Angeles' Staples
Center in 1999. That blow to civic pride also meant the loss of about
$1 million in yearly tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   And though cheerful, suburban side streets crisscross the city,
Inglewood still has deep pockets of poverty. Unemployment in the city
was 9.7% in June, compared with 7.1% in Los Angeles County overall,
according to the South Bay Workforce Investment Board.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood's median household income for 2000 was $34,000, about
$8,000 less than that for the county as a whole, according to the
South Bay Economic Development Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inglewood Unified School District, 59% of students come
from low-income families, making them eligible for free or
reduced-price meals, according to statistics for 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The school district itself is in turmoil: Just 13% of 11th-graders
score above the national average on standardized tests. Supt. James
Harris resigned this month; he was the district's fourth leader in as
many years.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Timing for City</TE>
<TE>   An internationally televised police brutality scandal, Rouzan
said, is the last thing the city needs while it is trying to land a
Wal-Mart and a cineplex.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents think 21st-century Inglewood can beat the bad
press with its new momentum--and a little old-school improvisation.
It is a point of local pride that, when the Lakers left town, a local
church stepped in, buying the Forum. Now Faithful Central Bible
Church uses the building for religious services, and rents it out for
non-church events as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [the beating incident] will stop the city from
moving forward," said a real estate agent, Johnny Inghram. "It won't
make a difference one way or the other for Inglewood," he said,
except to the extent that civil suits arising from it are "going to
be very costly to the taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1960s, Inglewood's minority residents have been
improvising an entirely new identity for their city after a
white-flight phenomenon that dramatically changed its racial makeup.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when some homes in the 94-year-old city went on
the market with restrictive clauses preventing sale to blacks and
Latinos. When the rules on home ownership loosened in the 1960s and
blacks moved in, whites began moving out. Many more abandoned the
city after court-ordered school integration in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood was 96% white in 1960, and 21% white in 1980. It is less
than 5% white today.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a recent influx of Latinos, it is the city's African
Americans who have taken the political reins. The first minority
mayor, now state Sen. Edward Vincent, was elected in 1983, and
African Americans have since put their cultural stamp on the city.</TE>
<TE>   One of Inglewood's prettiest parks was renamed for Vincent a few
years ago--despite some grumbling from a mostly white old guard. The
plaza next to City Hall is named for Thurgood Marshall, and the city
hosts one of Southern California's largest parades each year in honor
of Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt Dorn, the city's second black mayor, took office in
1997. The city's other top positions--city administrator, city
attorney and police chief--are now held by African Americans as well.
Critics of the mayor admit that they have seen some improvements in
Inglewood over the last few years, but they also worry that their
government has become inaccessible since Dorn took office.</TE>
<TE>   Contentious Politics</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, voters passed an initiative rolling back elected
officials' salaries, which are among the highest in the region. But
the city attorney ruled the rollback was invalid, and Dorn continues
to be paid $94,500 per year, with the four council members receiving
$47,244 each.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the city earned the Black Hole Award from the California
1st Amendment Coalition, which alleged that it had repeatedly
violated public disclosure rules. Around the same time, meeting times
were changed from evening hours to 1:30 p.m. three weeks out of each
month, with a fourth meeting each month still held in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "We have daytime meetings in a working community," said Marilyn
Douroux, a 34-year resident of Inglewood. "Now working people cannot
attend. It's these very behaviors of our leadership which have cast
us in this [negative] light."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the mayor believe he should be able to take
advantage of the improved quality of life when he runs for reelection
in November.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were 4,654 major crimes reported in Inglewood,
fewer than half as many as were reported in 1992. Also since 1992,
robbery, aggravated assault and property crimes have all fallen by
about half. Authorities attribute the improvement to aggressive
policing--and a nationwide decline in crime--but they also note the
active participation of Neighborhood Watch groups. The 9-square-mile
city boasts more than 200 of them.</TE>
<TE>   The other pressing quality-of-life issue is airport noise. Los
Angeles International Airport is just to the west of Inglewood and
draws nearly half its employees from the city. While LAX expansion
has been good for the local job market, the deafening roar of
low-flying jets is incessant.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Los Angeles World Airports began offering
millions worth of sound insulation for houses under the flight path.
But to receive the money, homeowners had to sign a document promising
they would not sue over noise issues in the future. Many residents
refused to sign, and focused their anger on City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a feeling they wouldn't be doing this to white folks,"
said Mark Weinberg, deputy city administrator.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has died down since February 2001, when the airport
authority agreed to do away with the document. Today, 800 homes have
received insulation, with 7,500 more are eligible to receive it in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Market Street, which was Inglewood's main downtown
shopping strip until the 1970s, which saw the rise of shopping malls
in nearby cities. By the 1990s, the street was in tatters, but the
$4-million face lift has brought new trees, sidewalks and flower
boxes.</TE>
<TE>   The street is still dominated by beauty shops and flea markets,
and there are still a number of empty storefronts. Retail sales
downtown were up only 1% for the first quarter of this year compared
with the same period the year before, Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But the cleanup, as well as generous loans for small and minority
businesses, have attracted new projects, such as the Little Belize
Caribbean Restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a pleasure here in Inglewood," said its owner, Adrian
Zetina, who received a business loan from the city. "Other cities
wouldn't help me out."</TE>
<TE>   Within the city are areas of wealth alongside poor communities. In
some cases, well-to-do residents try to separate themselves from the
city that they see as identified with the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably wouldn't even say we're from Inglewood," said John
Bass, who was shooting hoops in the driveway of his two-story home.
"We'd say we're from Ladera Heights."</TE>
<TE>   The Not-So-Sunny Side</TE>
<TE>   Across town, the neighborhood known as Darby-Dixon has been
fighting a gang problem for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people got shot over there, and over there, by the Mobil
[station]," said one 13-year-old from behind the fence of an
apartment complex. "My uncle got shot one time, and people are
robbing houses and everything. They even got grown people jumping
little kids around here."</TE>
<TE>   The city has been able to purchase and tear down some of the most
drug-plagued houses in Darby-Dixon using airport-noise mitigation
money, because the neighborhood is right under the LAX flight path.
Reyna Gonzalez, who was visiting her mother in Darby-Dixon, credits
the program with reducing the violence a bit.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinberg said he knows most people will judge Inglewood on the
way it handles the investigation into the Jackson incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible and regrettable," he said. "But the city also sees
it as an opportunity to show that we handle things a little
differently.''</TE>

<HD>2 L.A. Superior Court Judges Picked for U.S. Court</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: The Bush nominees, Republicans Gary Klausner and
S. James Otero, are expected to win Senate confirmation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Superior Court Judges Gary Klausner and S. James Otero
have been nominated by President Bush to become federal District
Court judges.</LD>
<LD>   Klausner, 60, and Otero, 50, are expected to win Senate
confirmation without difficulty, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   They are Republicans and were unanimously recommended for the
appointments by a local bipartisan screening committee.</LD>
<TE>   Their appointments would leave the federal district court with two
vacancies. More than 20 active judges serve on the Los Angeles-based
court, which operates branches in Santa Ana and Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Klausner, who served as presiding judge of the Superior Court
during the mid-1990s, supervises the court's civil division.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Loyola Law School, he worked as a prosecutor in the
district attorney's office from 1969 to 1974, when he was appointed a
court commissioner. He became a Municipal Court judge in 1980 and was
promoted to the Superior Court five years later.</TE>
<TE>   As presiding judge, Klausner campaigned to reform the jury system
by raising juror pay and cracking down on people who ignored notices
to serve. Klausner also fought a losing battle to prevent unification
of the Municipal and Superior Courts in L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   Otero is assistant supervisor of the Superior Court's civil
division.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles native earned a law degree at Stanford in 1976 and
then worked for the city attorney's office as a criminal prosecutor
and later as a legal advisor to the Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   Otero left in 1987 to become a corporate lawyer for Southern
Pacific Transportation Co., and in 1988 he was appointed a Municipal
Court judge. Two years later, he was elevated to the Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged With Girl's Kidnap, Assault, Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: Death penalty is a possibility in the strangling of
5-year-old Samantha Runnion. Alejandro Avila, 27, does not enter
pleas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bowing his head as the accusations were read, a 27-year-old Lake
Elsinore man was charged Monday with kidnapping, sexually assaulting
and murdering 5-year-old Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Avila did not enter a plea and was held without bail
until his arraignment next month. Prosecutors and his lawyers agreed
that Avila shouldn't attend the court hearing, so he participated via
video from Orange County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said Monday that he will
decide within two weeks whether to seek the death penalty against
Avila, promising he was "not going to make any deals."</LD>
<TE>   Rackauckas said that anyone who kidnaps and murders a young child
should "either die in prison of natural causes or be executed."</TE>
<TE>   Court papers filed Monday said Samantha was sexually assaulted at
least twice before being strangled. Beyond that, authorities revealed
no new details about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I can just tell you that the evidence that was amassed ... is
very, very compelling. And we are satisfied that we have the right
person," Rackauckas said at a news conference after the five-minute
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Special circumstances filed along with the charges will allow the
district attorney's office to seek the death penalty. Rackauckas said
he will meet with his staff and Samantha's family about whether to
seek death and described the case as his office's priority.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost impossible to overstate the amount of damage this
type of crime does to our community and the entire nation," he said.
"Many parents and children feel more fearful and less secure because
of this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Samantha's nor Avila's family attended the hearing before
Superior Court Judge Gary S. Paer in Santa Ana. Lorene L. Mies, a
public defender who is temporarily serving as Avila's attorney, would
not comment on whether Avila has received death threats at the jail,
where a court order bars visitors. He is also segregated from other
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the heavy publicity the case has received, Rackauckas said
Monday that he believes Avila can receive a fair trial in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha, who would have celebrated her sixth birthday Friday, was
abducted July 15, kicking and screaming. She was playing near a row
of garages near her Stanton home with a 6-year-old friend when a
stranger asked for help finding his lost puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Her nude body was found the next day in Cleveland National Forest
by a hang glider. The pursuit of Avila began after several tipsters
called a law enforcement hotline and pointed investigators in his
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators learned that one of his former girlfriend's
children, whom he was accused of molesting a year ago, lived until
recently in Samantha's condominium complex. Avila matched a physical
description provided by Samantha's playmate, and his car roughly
matched her description.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times hours before his arrest Friday,
Avila professed his innocence, saying he was at a mall at the time of
the abduction. But law enforcement authorities said that preliminary
DNA evidence connects him to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Avila also told The Times that detectives examined a scratch on
his leg he said he got by tripping over a child safety gate.
Detectives have said they believe Samantha scratched her attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's mother, Adelina, defended her son Monday on ABC-TV's "Good
Morning America," saying she doesn't think he killed Samantha. She
said that if her son is found guilty, she could forgive him.</TE>
<TE>   "But it would be hard," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's officials said they are continuing to
investigate the case and want to talk to anyone who saw Avila over
the past week.</TE>

<HD>Three Deny Rigging Military Contracts</HD>
<DH>Courts: An Anaheim businessman, an Army colonel and his
wife plead in S. Korea case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim Hills businessman, an Army colonel and his wife all
pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that they rigged military
service contracts in South Korea, according to the U.S. attorney's
office.</LD>
<LD>   During an arraignment in federal court in Santa Ana, Col. Richard
J. Moran, 56, denied charges that he pocketed $850,000 in cash
kickbacks from contractors hired to build barracks and provide
security guards early this year and last year. Moran and four others
were indicted July 3 after an investigation by the FBI, the Internal
Revenue Service and the Korean National Police.</LD>
<LD>   Gina Cha Moran, 44, also denied charges that she helped solicit
contract bribes for her husband and that she tried to hide the cash
from investigators. The couple are out on bail but must wear
electronic monitors and are confined to the Armed Forces Reserve
Center in Los Alamitos from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. nightly, according to
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Hueston.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Moran, who was stationed at Yongsan Army Base in South
Korea, oversaw 17,000 contracts with an annual value of more than
$310 million. He and his wife probably face up to 10 years in prison
if convicted of the charges, which include bribery, conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say a portion of one alleged bribe was funneled
through Joseph Kang Hur, 57, of Anaheim Hills, allegedly recruited by
the colonel as a middleman. Hur is free on bail.</TE>
<TE>   As for the remaining two defendants, Ronald Adair Parrish, 49, a
civilian who was chief of the Army's contract support division in
South Korea, pleaded not guilty Monday to illegally releasing bid
information to Indiana businessman Richard Lee Carlisle, 31, who will
be arraigned Aug. 5.</TE>

<LD>Retired Rear Adm. David M. Stone had just sat down to meet with
airport executives on his first day at Los Angeles International
Airport when the call came: Terminal No. 2 was being evacuated after
screeners detected what appeared to be the ingredients for a bomb in
a passenger's bag.</LD>
<LD>   Stone hurried to the terminal as 500 passengers spilled out onto
the sidewalk. He watched as traffic police shut down the upper-level
roadway. He acknowledged LAPD bomb-squad technicians as they arrived
to inspect the bag.</LD>
<LD>   About 90 minutes later, it was discovered that the suspicious
items were nothing more than several large Tupperware containers
filled with jelly and packed next to a radio, some batteries and a
bottle of nail polish.</LD>
<TE>   Stone, who retired from the Navy this month to work for the
federal agency charged with revamping security at the nation's
airports, couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the
challenges he'll face as the top security official at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "If you shut down the road, it impacts every other terminal,"
Stone said while recounting the July 15 incident in an interview last
week. "It was educational for me, right off the bat, to see the
complexities of how everything is interrelated."</TE>
<TE>   In his new role as LAX's federal security director for the
Transportation Security Administration, Stone must not only work with
airport officials to carry out evacuations, but must ensure that the
city agency operating the airport meets daunting deadlines set in an
aviation security bill approved by Congress last fall.</TE>
<TE>   He must hire 2,000 people by Nov. 19 to work at screening
checkpoints and operate security equipment. He must figure out by
Dec. 31 how to cram dozens of huge machines into inadequate airport
lobby space, and how to reconfigure security checkpoints to screen
all checked baggage. And he must draft protocols that allow officials
both to respond to threats and to reduce inconvenient evacuations
during the busy holiday travel season.</TE>
<TE>   "He faces one of the greatest challenges in the country at LAX,"
said Paul Bollinger, a vice president of HNTB, an architectural and
engineering firm that specializes in airports.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's third-busiest airport, LAX handles twice as many bags
per day--about 100,000--as comparable facilities such as Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport, which checks about 55,000 pieces. LAX
officials estimate that they need 200 trace machines and 40
explosives detection machines to meet Transportation Security
Administration deadlines--more than twice as many as requested by
facilities such as San Francisco International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Stone's peers in the Navy say he's up to the challenge. They say
he is a highly regarded leader, as comfortable working with enlisted
personnel as with other commanders.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an exceptional leader and he's combat-hardened," said Vice
Adm. Michael Mullen, who was Stone's boss when they worked at the
Pentagon for the secretary of the Navy. "He also has a wonderful
legacy of taking care of his people."</TE>
<TE>   Lived in Many Places</TE>
<TE>   Stone's tours of duty during 28 years in the Navy included
deployment in the Red Sea, where he was a squadron commander with the
Eisenhower Battle Group in support of Operation Desert Shield. He
also commanded a group of ships deployed to assist the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in the Mediterranean.</TE>
<TE>   An Illinois native, he moved 20 times during his Navy career to
places as varied as Bahrain; Italy; Seattle; Key West, Fla.; and
Charleston, S.C. Stone, who turned 50 this month, married a Navy
chaplain's daughter 25 years ago and is an ardent basketball fan,
counting the Lakers among his favorite teams.</TE>
<TE>   Stone is perhaps best known publicly for the role he played last
year on the court of inquiry that investigated the collision of the
Greeneville, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, and the Ehime Maru,
a Japanese trawler on which nine were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat in a courtroom and saw grieving families of those on the
Japanese fishing boat and grieving families of those who were being
evaluated," he said. "I knew it was embarrassing to many individuals
that they didn't do the things they needed to do, but the commanding
officer needed to be held accountable for his performance."</TE>
<TE>   In a wide-ranging interview, Stone spoke often about
accountability. Since the Sept. 11 skyjackings, he said, it has
become particularly important that airport officials take
responsibility for the crucial role they play in securing the
nation's aviation system.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in his office in the old air traffic control tower--he'll
move to Los Angeles from Alexandria, Va., in the next few
weeks--Stone gestured toward a board detailing management principles
that he calls his "three ships": leadership, partnership and
friendship. He said he lives by those tenets.</TE>
<TE>   Stone won't have to go it alone at LAX. He'll eventually have a
staff, and can rely on several companies contracted by the
Transportation Security Administration to assist airports in meeting
federal deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   He also has a head start on security directors at other major
airports because LAX officials have $5 million worth of reports from
consultants that detail how best to remodel the antiquated facility
to accommodate new personnel and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   LAX is not one of 39 airports that sent a letter to the security
agency earlier this year, asking for an extension of deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have declared that the city's
airports--including Ontario International Airport--will comply with
the winter dates.</TE>
<TE>   City officials expect that it will take nearly $25 million to
modify 42-year-old LAX to meet the agency mandates by the end of the
year. How much of that will be reimbursed by the federal government
remains unclear, especially because legislation that would provide
the agency with additional funding has been tied up in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Until that money is approved, Stone will have to wait for the
agency to order and ship equipment to screen bags at LAX. He's also
had to wait until today to begin accepting applications for
screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Lengthy Hiring Process</TE>
<TE>   This hiring process is expected to take weeks because of
time-consuming background checks and the difficulty other airports
have encountered in recruiting qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said he wants to retain screeners who now work at LAX if
they meet agency standards, but as many as 40% are not U.S.
citizens--a requirement under the new aviation security law.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Stone said, he's eager to take on the role of
coordinating security at LAX--to protect not only passengers and
aircraft, but also the airport itself.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I'm very much focused on, from Day 1, is the physical
security of LAX. I want to make sure I understand as quickly as I can
what the gaps are, and work with folks here to plug those gaps," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That goal is particularly important to city leaders who called for
the streamlining of law enforcement efforts after an Egyptian
immigrant killed two people in the Tom Bradley International Terminal
on the Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman was shot and killed by an El Al Israel Airline security
guard.</TE>
<TE>   The airport police department, LAPD and FBI all participated in
securing the airport after the shooting--leaving some to speculate
that there wasn't a clear chain of command.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad he wants to take a lead role out there on security,"
said Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "We need someone who is going to be proactive in making sure that
the federal government knows that the resource needs are huge at
LAX," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Airport sources also pointed to Stone's understanding that he must
balance security with convenience at LAX--one of the nation's crucial
transportation hubs.</TE>
<TE>   "When I read that 27% of folks aren't flying because of the hassle
factor, that equates to a significant economic impact to the airlines
and the community," he said. "So I need to ensure we put in place
screeners and security personnel that are going to work hard to
reduce the hassle factor."</TE>
<TE>   Stone said he had taken the high-profile position because he wants
"the opportunity to make a difference in the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "My background is in intelligence and I'm well aware of what the
threat is, and it's a serious threat to our country," he said. "There
are people who are intent on doing harm, and in the past they have
demonstrated intent to do harm at LAX. That thought is always on my
mind. It's one of the reasons I wanted to come here."</TE>

<HD>George Lindsay, 85; Botanist Led Growth of S.F. Museum
Complex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Lindsay, a botanist who presided over tremendous growth at the
California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and turned its
Natural History Museum into a major institution, died July 16 of
congestive heart failure at his home in Tiburon. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   From 1962 to 1982, Lindsay was director of the California Academy
of Sciences, the scientific and educational complex at Golden Gate
Park that includes the Natural History Museum, Steinhart Aquarium and
Morrison Planetarium.</LD>
<LD>   It is one of the 10 largest natural history museums in the world,
with collections of nearly 17 million birds, mammals, plants and
other specimens. It is particularly noted for its extensive
collection of specimens from the Galapagos Islands, the birthplace of
Darwin's theory of evolution and a frequent destination for Lindsay,
who led museum tours all over the world.</LD>
<TE>   Lindsay oversaw the construction of exhibit halls as well as the
Meyer Fish Roundabout, a circular viewing area holding 100,000
gallons of water and thousands of ocean fish, and the renovation of
the circa-1930s African Hall.</TE>
<TE>   He resuscitated the academy's anthropology department, which had
languished for decades after most of its collections were destroyed
in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. At that time, the
collections were housed in downtown San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "There are seven or eight major natural history museums. We are
one of them, and he got us there," said Bill Eschmeyer, a senior
curator who was Lindsay's director of research. "He doubled the staff
here and probably doubled the square footage of our buildings."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay's parents were citrus farmers in Pomona, where he was
born. He inherited a lemon farm and worked there and as director of a
botanical garden in Phoenix before World War II led to a stint with
the Army Air Force. Assigned as a combat cameraman in a unit that was
led by Clark Gable and included Ronald Reagan, he helped document the
war effort by filming the damage to bombing targets.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he finished his undergraduate and doctorate degrees
at Stanford University, where he completed a dissertation on the
barrel cactus.</TE>
<TE>   From 1956 to 1963, he was director of the San Diego Natural
History Museum.</TE>
<TE>   He had been infatuated with cacti and succulents since discovering
them during trips in his youth to the Baja peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The taxonomy of desert plants remained a lifelong interest. His
home was filled with unusual specimens, including succulents from
South Africa and Namibia.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife, the former Geraldine Kendrick Morris, during his
early years at the academy. Under his aegis, she founded its docent
program.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by five stepchildren: Charles Morris of Tiburon,
Geraldine Morris of Alameda, Diana Morris of San Francisco, Austin
Morris of Novato and Jane-Leslie Morris-Williams of Oakland.</TE>

<HD>Man's Case Hinges on Competence of Knoller, Noel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Incompetent lawyering by the couple convicted of manslaughter in the
dog attack death of a San Francisco woman probably will result in the
overturning of a prison guard's assault conviction, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Del Norte County Superior Court Judge William Follett ruled
earlier this month that former correctional officer Jose Ramon Garcia
received incompetent legal representation in his 1998 trial.</LD>
<LD>   "What this says is Jose served a couple years in prison he
shouldn't have," said Garcia's new lawyer, Dennis Riordan. "There was
no legal basis for the time he served."</LD>
<TE>   Garcia was represented by husband-and-wife attorneys Robert Noel
and Marjorie Knoller, who were convicted in March of involuntary
manslaughter in the death of their neighbor, Diane Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have 30 days to appeal, but Dist. Atty. Jim Fallman
said it is unlikely they will.</TE>
<TE>   "These same defense attorneys later proved their incompetence when
they got on TV in the dog-mauling case and got themselves convicted
in that case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was convicted of conspiracy to assault inmates and
sentenced to about four years. He was released on parole in spring
2001.</TE>

<LD>Police are looking for more victims of a man who is accused of
molesting two boys at a Fountain Valley athletic club where thousands
of children spend time in the summer and after school.</LD>
<LD>   Rafael Benitez, 31, of Santa Ana was arrested July 15 on suspicion
of molesting two boys, ages 11 and 13, at Los Caballeros Sports Club
on Newhope Street.</LD>
<LD>   Police contend that Benitez approached the boys in the club's
locker room and befriended them with conversation and small gifts
over a period of weeks. They accuse him of molesting them in the
locker room on separate days this month.</LD>
<TE>   "His weapon is his charm and demeanor," Fountain Valley Police
Sgt. Kevin Thomas said. "Over a period of time, he gains their
trust."</TE>
<TE>   The pattern leads investigators to believe other children may have
been victimized but have not come forward. Police warn that Benitez
has a history of hanging around youths at pools, parks and beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Benitez, who was a member at the club for about a year, was
arrested after the incidents were reported to club managers; police
decline to give further details. He told authorities his name was
Rafael Ramon, but investigators found his true name through
fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with attempted forcible sodomy, oral copulation of
a minor, lewd conduct and child annoyance, and is being held at
Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   The charge is at least the second against Benitez since 1994, when
he was arrested on suspicion of molesting an 11-year-old boy. Benitez
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child annoyance and was placed on three
years' probation, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Caballeros is a 17-acre facility that has thousands of
children participating in summer camp, and yearlong sports and dance
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids are almost 6 feet tall and I thought I didn't have to
think about that kind of stuff anymore," said Becky Carlson of Rancho
Santa Margarita as she dropped off her 13- and 15-year-old sons.
"This is a nice club and I had no cause for concern before. But now
I'm going to have to warn them that they have to be with other
children at all times."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace Rodecker, a managing owner of Los Caballeros, said the
children's summer programs are under constant supervision.</TE>
<TE>   "We were shocked ... and immediately contacted the Fountain Valley
police," Rodecker said. He said investigators asked him not to
discuss the case further.</TE>
<TE>   Police ask anyone with information about possible victims to call
them at (714) 593-4485.</TE>

<HD>Plans for 22 Freeway Expansion Reviewed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The planned expansion of the Garden Grove Freeway took a step toward
fruition Monday with a review of the proposed bidding process by the
Orange County Transportation Authority's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very excited about the project," said Tim Keenan, the
board's vice chairman.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the oldest freeway in Orange County that hasn't had any
improvements done to it. It hasn't been touched since the 1960s."</LD>
<TE>   One result, transportation officials say, is rush-hour congestion
unparalleled anywhere in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a parking lot out there," Jim Silva, a county
supervisor and transportation board member, said last year when the
project was proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Several options are being considered, ranging from simply
expanding bus service along the route to an $872-million project that
would add carpool lanes in both directions, as well as auxiliary
lanes and connectors to the Costa Mesa, San Diego, Santa Ana and San
Gabriel River freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely option, transportation officials say, is a
$438-million project creating a single carpool lane in both
directions as well as widening most of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision on the size of the project is expected in
mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on schedule to release the environmental impact report in
early August," and expect the Federal Highway Administration to react
in September, said Beth Beeman, a Caltrans spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   In a departure from the usual procedure, Keenan said, the design
and building process will be overseen by the transportation
authority.</TE>

<HD>Turning In a Marshmallow-Roaster: That's Mighty Neighborly
of You, Pal</HD>

<LD>Few things are as nerve-wracking as the suspicion that you might have
dangerous neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The Laguna News-Post's crime log reported that "a resident called
police when he became alarmed about a neighbor roasting marshmallows
on a barbecue. He told police that he thought the fire may be too hot
and that they may not put it out as well as it should be."</LD>
<LD>   "Duh!" award winner: Along the Cumberland River in Tennessee,
Kathryn Wilkens noticed a sign for drivers who do not own amphibious
vehicles (see photo). I suppose it would be useful for drivers
roasting marshmallows as well.</LD>
<TE>   Graveyard humor: At a Newport Beach cemetery, Virgil Harrington
spotted a memorial bench (see photo) left by someone jesting about
owning property on the Gold Coast. An inscription on the bench says:
"Family and friends, sit and look out to sea; Sip a glass of
champagne and pour one on me!"</TE>
<TE>   Still life? Bruce Gulde of Long Beach came upon a warning at the
entrance to an apartment building that caused him to wonder if people
inside were standing motionless (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   A team about to run away from home? Suspicions that the San Diego
Chargers may be moving to another city--perhaps hated L.A.--were not
eased by the team's listings in the Pac Bell directories. Almost all
say simply "Chargers" and omit "San Diego" from the team name,
reports Union-Tribune columnist Diane Bell. So does a season ticket
application. And she adds that the team's official Web site name is
just www.chargers.com.</TE>
<TE>   A Charger spokesman said the team was just trying to keep the
references clean and tight, adding, "San Diego is very important to
us." Somehow, that phrase has a sort of distant quality to it.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery solved: As for the photo that appeared here of a "Used
Guts" sign in a clothing store in Kyoto, Sam Jameson, The Times'
former Japan bureau chief, wrote: "There is no article of clothing
that is called 'guts' in Japanese. Therefore, the use of the word is
almost certainly a simple spelling mistake arising from the
difficulty of transcribing Japanese pronunciations into English
spelling."</TE>
<TE>   Jameson said the word "guts" probably was supposed to be "goods."
Several other readers concurred, including Judge Roger Boren of the
2nd District Court of Appeal. Boren said the word "gut" (pronounced
"goot") is "the root for the German noun equivalent of the English
noun 'goods,' as in wares or merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: "Best Secret Parking Place" was one of the categories
in the L.A. Downtown News' "Best of Downtown" poll. Reader Jeu Foon's
response: "The chief of police's slot." At least until a permanent
replacement for Bernard Parks is named.</TE>

<HD>Man Ordered Freed or Retried After 10 Years</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense was deficient, 9th Circuit says. Inmate's
brother admitted the shooting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending a decade in prison for a shooting that his brother
long ago admitted, a Lynwood man may finally gain his release as the
result of a federal appeals court ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 Monday that the
state must release Jesus Avila or retry him within 90 days. His
brother, Ernesto, who was never charged, could eventually be
prosecuted.</LD>
<LD>   Jesus Avila, now 30, was convicted in 1991 of shooting Demetrius
Kidd after a gang-related altercation at a baby shower in Ham Park in
Lynwood. He was sentenced to life in prison plus eight years,
stemming from enhancements due to the use of a firearm and inflicting
great bodily harm.</LD>
<TE>   His mother, Christine Avila, said Monday that she was elated. "I
have been praying for this for years."</TE>
<TE>   She said her other son, Ernesto, was not at home. He could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ted T. Yamamoto, Jesus' trial lawyer, failed to investigate
reports from witnesses that Ernesto did the shooting and that his
client was in another section of the park--even though he believed
that Ernesto was the shooter, the 9th Circuit said.</TE>
<TE>   That meant Yamamoto provided constitutionally deficient
representation, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has set rigorous standards for an inmate to
gain a new trial on the grounds of ineffective representation. An
inmate must demonstrate both that his attorney's conduct fell well
below professional norms and that his case was prejudiced because of
the deficient performance.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said that both tests were met in Jesus Avila's
case, noting that Yamamoto admitted being "incompetent" at a
post-trial hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We have repeatedly found that a lawyer who fails adequately to
investigate and to introduce into evidence, evidence that
demonstrates his client's factual innocence, or that raises
sufficient doubt as to that question to undermine confidence in the
verdict, renders deficient performance," 9th Circuit Judge Harry
Pregerson wrote. His opinion was joined by Judges Raymond C. Fisher
and Richard C. Tallman.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the incident, Kidd identified Jesus as his attacker,
as did another witness.</TE>
<TE>   However, several other witnesses said that Jesus was far from the
scene. Moreover, some witnesses told a private investigator working
for Jesus' original lawyer, George Denny, that Ernesto had been the
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Denny withdrew from the case after talking to Ernesto. Yamamoto
was in the courtroom at the time Denny recused himself, and Denny,
who was representing Ernesto in another case, told Yamamoto that he
had withdrawn because he was "representing someone that ... might
have been the shooter." But Yamamoto did not ask Denny who it was.</TE>
<TE>   Before Jesus' trial, Yamamoto became convinced that Ernesto was
the shooter, according to the 9th Circuit decision. But he did not
investigate Ernesto's involvement because he believed that Christine
Avila, the brothers' mother, "did not want him to implicate Ernesto
at trial."</TE>
<TE>   Yamamoto also explained that he did not "aggressively" investigate
whether Ernesto was the shooter because he "entertained a strong
belief" that Ernesto was going to admit his culpability during Jesus'
trial. But that did not happen.</TE>
<TE>   At a post-trial hearing, Ernesto admitted, under oath without
immunity, that he was the shooter. But Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge William Pounders said he had doubts about Ernesto's
credibility, as well as that of other witnesses who testified on
Jesus' behalf. Pounders made those assessments after a hearing where
he also concluded that Yamamoto had performed competently.</TE>
<TE>   A state appeals court upheld Jesus' conviction, and the California
Supreme Court declined to review. Later, a federal trial judge
rejected Jesus' claims that his constitutional rights had been
violated.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit reversed all those rulings, concluding that
Pounders had made clear factual errors, in addition to its findings
on Yamamoto.</TE>
<TE>   "Had Yamamoto conducted a reasonable investigation and zealously
represented Jesus at trial, four witnesses could have testified that
they saw Ernesto shoot Kidd, 11 witnesses could have testified that
Jesus was in the barbecue area when the shooting occurred, and
Ernesto might have come forward--or at least made an inculpatory
statement that could have been used against him at trial," Pregerson
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   If Yamamoto, a Los Angeles lawyer, had performed as he should
have, "there is a reasonable probability" the trial would have turned
out differently, Pregerson concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "The 9th Circuit did exactly what they should have done," said
Nancy S. Coan, Jesus' appellate lawyer. "I never believed for one
minute that a jury would have convicted him if he got a fair trial. I
am still in shock about how many courts ignored the facts in this
case."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he was castigated in the 9th Circuit ruling, Yamamoto
said Monday, "I am extremely happy for [Jesus]."</TE>
<TE>   Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general's
office, which defended the verdict on appeal, said the office was
reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney, said, "We would not make a decision on a retrial," for
Jesus, "until we have read the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the possibility of charging Ernesto, Gibbons said that
there was no statute of limitations in a case of attempted
first-degree murder. "If the case was attempted first-degree murder,
we could still prosecute him," she said.</TE>

<HD>George Rickey, 95; Sculptor, Master of Kinetic Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Rickey, a sculptor whose interest in movement led to his
reputation as the grand old man of kinetic art, died Wednesday in St.
Paul, Minn. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Rickey, who maintained a summer studio in Santa Barbara, inherited
the mantle of master of kinetic art after Alexander Calder died in
1976.</LD>
<LD>   A central figure in the artistic movement known as Constructivism,
he was known for his abstract steel sculptures--some reaching as high
as six stories--that were set in random motion by air currents.</LD>
<TE>   "In these giant wind-driven constructions, we see a rare balance
between the disciplines of an engineer and the free spirit of a
poet," architect John Johansen said when the American Academy of Arts
and Letters presented Rickey with its gold medal for sculpture in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Rickey's works have been exhibited around the world, most notably
at the Documenta III art show in 1964 in Kassel, Germany, and at a
1979 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Born in South Bend, Ind., Rickey was educated in Scotland, where
his father managed a Singer sewing machine factory. His grandfather
was a New England clockmaker who introduced him to the art and
mechanics of the pendulum, which would inspire him as an artist.</TE>
<TE>   Rickey studied art in Paris and at Oxford University during the
late 1920s and early '30s, then returned to the United States to
teach history.</TE>
<TE>   He made his first sculpture while serving as an Army Air Corps
sergeant working on ballistics problems during World War II. He began
to make crude mobiles, imitating Calder's style.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1950s, Rickey was working in stainless steel and
scrap metal at Indiana University, where he taught art.</TE>
<TE>   He found that he preferred stainless steel because of its
light-reflecting qualities and because it did not rust, a critical
feature for an artist with large outdoor installations in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, Rickey developed a style that favored movement over
mass. It was distinct from that of Calder, emphasizing spare
geometric shapes and slow, unpredictable movement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, he was represented at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York, which acquired a scissors-like construction that was 36 feet
high, spare and elegant.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington commissioned a
work called "Three Red Lines." It has been described as "a minuet of
pendulums, a line drawing in space, or a trio of red scissors slicing
at the sky."</TE>
<TE>   Rickey became known for sculptures based on moving blades and a
compound pendulum, using simple hinges and ball-bearing joints to
control the angle and range of movement.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the shape of the movement, not the shape of the parts, that
interests me," he once said.</TE>
<TE>   In an authoritative 1967 text titled "Constructivism: Origin and
Evolution," Rickey wrote that the kinetic artist "finds waiting for
him, as subject, not the trees, not the flowers, not the landscape,
but the waving of branches and trembling of stems."</TE>
<TE>   His work has appeared in many local collections, including UCLA,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Smalley Sculpture Garden
at the University of Judaism.</TE>
<TE>   Still prolific in his last years, he did most of his work at his
studios in East Chatham, N.Y. He moved to Minnesota a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rickey is survived by sons Stuart, a documentary filmmaker in San
Francisco, and Philip, a sculptor and landscape designer in St. Paul;
and two grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A second defense entomologist testified Monday that the body of
7-year-old Danielle van Dam was probably dumped in a rural area
several days after David Westerfield--on trial for her kidnap and
murder--was being watched by police.</LD>
<LD>   Neil Haskell, an entomologist from Indiana, said the size and
number of insects on the body showed that it could not have been
dumped before Feb. 12. By Feb. 5, Westerfield was being watched
continuously by police.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek sought to show that the unseasonably
warm and dry weather could have influenced how insects attacked the
body.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. Forest Service is considering allowing the first large rock
quarry within the Tahoe National Forest to provide granite for
rebuilding Interstate 80.</LD>
<LD>   The quarry would cover about 60 acres near Yuba Gap, 40 miles east
of Auburn.</LD>
<LD>   The highway is being rebuilt between Auburn and the Nevada border
for the first time since its construction 42 years ago, a process
expected to take another 10 to 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed quarry is within the 1,370 acres burned in last
summer's Emigrant Gap Fire, though the proposal predates the fire,
Forest Service geologist Bob DeTar said.</TE>

<HD>2 Passengers Are Killed in Unrelated Shootings</HD>
<DH>Violence: In both incidents, occupants of the vehicles
argued with people in other cars, who fired shots. Killed were a West

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-year-old West Covina man who was shot by an occupant of another
car on the Golden State Freeway in Sylmar died early Monday,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   In an unrelated shooting, a 16-year-old boy was killed while
riding in a car in Palmdale early Sunday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Ignacio Salinas, a passenger in the back seat of the car in
Sylmar, was shot several times in the upper body, said Sgt. Jason
Beatty of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division.</LD>
<TE>   The shooting occurred near the San Diego Freeway interchange about
6:50 p.m. Sunday when passengers of two cars traveling south on the
Golden State Freeway began shouting gang affiliations, Beatty said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the vehicle in which Salinas was riding exited the
freeway in Sun Valley after the shooting and called police, Beatty
said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics took Salinas to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in
Mission Hills, where he was pronounced dead about 2 a.m. Monday,
Beatty said. Police had made no arrests by late Monday. An
investigation was ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   In the Palmdale shooting, a Sylmar youth riding in one car was
fatally wounded during an argument with the occupants of another
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ceniceros was shot in the back shortly after the argument
started about 3 a.m. at a fast-food restaurant in the 2500 block of
East Avenue S, said homicide Det. Phil Martinez of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department. The two cars left the restaurant, but
the argument continued for several blocks, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that there was shooting coming back and forth,"
Martinez said. "We are still investigating what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Ceniceros was pronounced dead about 3:30 a.m. at Antelope Valley
Hospital in Lancaster, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said the suspects' car, a blue Saturn, was located on
Avenue R, near the site of the shooting.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Simon Unveils Tax Returns, Limits Access</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate reverses course, saying the controversy
has distracted from issues. But media viewing of the documents is
controlled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bowing to political pressure, Republican Bill Simon Jr. furnished 11
years' worth of tax returns for limited viewing Monday, hoping to
quell a controversy that has come to consume his gubernatorial
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The decision marked an abrupt reversal for Simon, who insisted for
months that he had paid a hefty share of taxes but was entitled to
keep the details private, even in the high-profile role of GOP
standard-bearer.</LD>
<LD>   "I changed my mind because I believe that ... this issue has
become a distraction," Simon, an investment banker and first-time
political candidate, said at a news conference in Burbank. "I think
for the people of California, it's necessary to focus the attention
on what the issues really ought to be."</LD>
<TE>   From 1990 to 2000, Simon reported $36 million in income, an
average of nearly $3.3 million annually. He paid about $8.6 million
in federal income taxes in that period--an average of about $777,000
a year, or just shy of 24% of his income.</TE>
<TE>   The full picture of Simon's state income tax record was unclear
because his California return for 1995 was missing. But from 1990 to
2000--apart from the missing year--Simon paid about $2.4 million in
California taxes, an average of 6.7% of his income. In addition,
Simon paid about $366,000 in income taxes to other states, about 1%
of his income.</TE>
<TE>   A look at Simon's tax return for 2000--the most recent year
available--showed that he paid nearly $2 million in state and federal
taxes on a total income of $7.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Simon requested an extension to file this year's return but paid
$1.5 million in estimated state and federal taxes in April, according
to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   An independent unraveling of the candidate's convoluted finances
was virtually impossible, however, given the time strictures and
other limits imposed by the Simon campaign. Shortly after 3 p.m.,
aides pushing a luggage cart trundled a voluminous collection of
documents into a hotel conference room, then handed out a stack of
tax returns the size of a thick phone directory.</TE>
<TE>   News organizations wanting to peruse Simon's tax records were
limited to a single reporter each before the campaign lost track and
others were allowed into the viewing area. Reporters had to finish
their work by 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Professional accountants and others with a more experienced eye
were forbidden from seeing the documents, and no copies were allowed
to leave the room where they were laid out. "We're not going to play
accountant versus accountant," said Jeff Flint, a campaign spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a reporter was reprimanded for failing to use the
blank sheets of paper provided by the Simon campaign, choosing
instead to use his own paper.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the restrictions, many Republicans expressed relief at
Simon's agreement to open his tax history to outside scrutiny. The
returns went as far back as 1990, the year Simon and his family
relocated to California.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists for the Simon campaign had worked behind the scenes
for weeks to bring the reluctant candidate around to releasing the
documents, increasing the pressure last week as fellow Republicans
started publicly voicing their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear, however, whether Monday's disclosure and the
viewing restrictions that were placed on reporters would lay the
matter to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Simon also has filed tax returns in New Mexico,
Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey, where his
family's investment banking firm is headquartered.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign has engaged in a self-inflicted slow water torture,"
said Arnold Steinberg, a longtime GOP strategist who is unaffiliated
with the Simon campaign. "It has backed and filled, seemingly to be
dragged kicking and screaming into disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they have a strategy and plan to move on," Steinberg
said. "The campaign can no longer afford to wing it."</TE>
<TE>   The tax issue has plagued Simon for months, ever since Democratic
Gov. Gray Davis released his income tax returns and demanded that
Simon do the same. "Part of running for governor is making available
your tax return so people can see you're paying your fair share,"
Davis said in April.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon rejected the governor's demand, saying that even public
figures deserve "a certain amount of privacy." Angered by the demand
for the release of his returns, Simon compared Davis to Karl Marx and
Big Brother.</TE>
<TE>   The matter had largely died down until earlier this month, when
the Internal Revenue Service identified Simon as the beneficiary of a
possibly illegal tax shelter. Simon said the matter was a dispute
between the IRS and his accountants at KPMG. He defended efforts to
reduce his tax bill and, as recently as last week, vigorously stated
his refusal to make public his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Then, about an hour before his campaign opened the viewing window,
Simon held a news conference to explain his decision to allow the
selective scrutiny. He said he had held back releasing the records
mainly to protect the privacy of his brother and five sisters, his
partners in the family's investment banking firm, William E. Simon
and Sons.</TE>
<TE>   "In revealing detailed financial information about myself, I'm
also actually revealing personal and private detail about my brother
and my sisters, as well," Simon told reporters. "It has troubled me
that my decision to run for office has led to the disclosure of much
of their personal, private information."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon said he grew convinced over the weekend that the
controversy about his tax history had become "an unnecessary
distraction" from more substantive issues that he wished to discuss
in the final stretch of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past few months, the issue of my personal tax returns
has been the curtain that Gray Davis has hid behind to avoid
answering questions about his financial mismanagement of the state,"
Simon said. "By revealing my tax records today, we will also clear
the way to reveal the record, the failed record, of Gov. Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his reluctance to release the personal materials, Simon
maintained a steadfast smile throughout most of the news conference,
held in a hotel ballroom festooned with California and American
flags.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon grew testy when asked about the limitations his campaign
had imposed on reporters. He gripped the lectern with both hands, his
brow furrowing with frustration. "You've got plenty of time to take a
look at it," Simon said of the mass of material.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how reporters were supposed to interpret the tax
records without the assistance of a tax expert, the candidate
snapped: "Well, take notes."</TE>
<TE>   Asked for details, Simon deferred questions to his financial
advisors or, in other instances, said his tax returns would speak for
him. He would not name the investment that is the subject of the
dispute between KPMG and the IRS, although he denied that it was a
tax shelter. He declined to take questions once his tax forms were
released.</TE>
<TE>   Court records in the IRS case show that Simon received a
confidential legal opinion from KPMG in October 1998. His returns for
the tax years 1998, 1999 and 2000 show that Simon reported more than
$5.7 million in investment losses that substantially reduced his
taxable income.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, the returns made available Monday show, Simon has
given $2.86 million in donations to charities, both directly and
through a private foundation he and his wife, Cynthia, established in
1995. Among the major recipients were Williams College, his alma
mater in Williamstown, Mass. He also has been a major donor to United
Way in Los Angeles and various Catholic charities, including Saint
Monica Parish, where he worships in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Simon has given several thousand dollars to
foundations that deal with autism and child development, to the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and to organizations that promote
the game of squash. He has given lesser amounts to such conservative
organizations as the Western Center for Journalism in Sacramento and
the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Like Simon, the Davis campaign held its own preemptive news
conference. Garry South, chief strategist for the governor, dismissed
the tax records sight unseen, calling their release "basically a
farce."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Simon had sought an extension of the filing deadline
for his 2001 tax return, South said it was unlikely that political
reporters could "make heads or tails" of the candidate's tax returns
when Simon required a 120-day extension--"with all his
accountants"--to have them prepared.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis has made public 15 years' worth of tax returns
and supporting documentation, going back to 1987, the first year he
served as state controller.</TE>
<TE>   No law requires candidates or elected officials to release their
private tax returns, but it has become a common practice for most
seeking high positions. Davis and his wife, Sharon, reported paying
more than $55,000 in state and federal taxes on 2001 income of
$200,351.</TE>

<HD>2 Plead in South Gate Election Cases</HD>
<DH>Politics: A candidate and a printer of campaign material
plead no contest to charges in 2001 city balloting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A printer of political campaign mailers and a former South Gate City
Council candidate pleaded no contest Monday to electoral fraud
charges stemming from their roles in South Gate's 2001 election.</LD>
<LD>   The former candidate, Katrina Jackson, entered a no-contest plea
to charges that she lied about her residency to qualify for the
ballot. The Los Angeles-based printer, Angel Gonzalez, was accused of
conspiring to publish a "hit piece" campaign mailer that contained
false depictions of official documents.</LD>
<LD>   Their no-contest pleas came on the same day of a scheduled
preliminary hearing on the case. The flier, which falsely claimed
that candidate Patricia Acosta had been disqualified from the ballot,
used the official seals of California and the Los Angeles County
Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Acosta lost the election by 1,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Although false mailers are not necessarily illegal, using fake
depictions of public documents does violate election code laws.</TE>
<TE>   "It closes a rather sordid chapter of the electoral history of
that city, in which these fliers with bogus public records were used
in an effort to mislead people," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry Bork,
the lead prosecutor on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Gonzalez conviction, it remains unclear who financed
distribution of the fliers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to comment on whether the investigation is
ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has long-standing ties to South Gate's leading elected
officials, including Treasurer Albert Robles, the city's perceived
political boss.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has consistently denied being behind the mailers. In an
unrelated case, he is charged with threatening to kill two state
legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's attorney, Mark Werksman, said the pleas weren't tied to
any cooperation agreements with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plea arrangement, four other counts against Jackson
and Gonzalez were dropped by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In one year, their felony convictions will be downgraded to
misdemeanors if they serve 200 hours of community service and break
no laws.</TE>
<TE>   "They pleaded, it's over and the case is now history," said
Werksman.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney has very little to show for an extremely
aggressive investigation and prosecution of two bit players in the
South Gate drama."</TE>
<TE>   South Gate's elections have long been marred by viciously false
campaign mailers, some of which have accused candidates of being
child molesters or drunks.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer attacking Acosta was sent to 12,000 homes in time for
the March 6, 2001, election, when 10 candidates were running for two
seats on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The two-sided flier falsely claimed that the city clerk had
disqualified Acosta because she was the target of a corruption
investigation by the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   One side--topped by the message: "Important Ballot Change,
Candidate Disqualification"--used the seal of California. The flip
side used the seal of Los Angeles Superior Court and the same format
as an official legal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta called the no-contest plea a "tremendous" victory. "We knew
what they did was a lie, and I'm positive that what happened affected
the outcome of my campaign," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta added that she thinks the case could yield more suspects.
"What I hope is that [Gonzalez] can tell us who was behind all of
this," she said. "That would be the ultimate victory to the war."</TE>
<TE>   In the Jackson case, prosecutors alleged that she filed a false
declaration of candidacy, stating that she lived in South Gate when
she actually lived in Los Angeles. Another former South Gate
candidate, Richard Mayer, was convicted on similar charges last year.</TE>

<LD>Seymour Solomon, one of the co-founders of Vanguard Records, a
leading independent label best known for its recordings by top
American folk artists in the 1950s and '60s, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Solomon died Thursday in Lenox, Mass., where he maintained a
summer home. Cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   With a $10,000 loan from their father, Solomon and his brother,
Maynard, started Vanguard in the 1950s as the larger, long-playing
records began to overtake 78 rpm records in the marketplace.</LD>
<TE>   Vanguard became known for producing albums of top quality. The
label's motto became "Recordings for the Connoisseur," and its
eclectic catalog lived up to that billing.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard started as a classical label, but the
Solomons--politically active and committed intellectuals--were not
opposed to broadening the scope of their label and taking some risks
to achieve that goal. Perhaps the best example of that came in 1956,
when they licensed a tape of the 1955 Carnegie Hall concert by a folk
group called the Weavers.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1950s, the Weavers had some impressive hits in the
pop-folk genre for Decca Records, but disbanded in 1953 after Pete
Seeger, one of the group's members, was cited for contempt of
Congress for refusing to testify before the House Un-American
Activities Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The 1955 concert, which marked the return of the Weavers to
performing, was a critical and artistic success, but the political
climate made many labels loath to release the recording. The Solomons
purchased the rights, and the record became a huge hit. Many music
experts say that the concert and subsequent recording marked the
revival of folk music in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard's success with the Weavers album--and the reputation it
developed for allowing a good deal of artistic freedom--led to the
signing of other folk stars, including Joan Baez, Phil Ochs and
Richard and Mimi Farina.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Vanguard began recording live concerts, including
the Newport Folk Festival, and later spearheaded a resurgence in
blues music by recording performers such as Mississippi John Hurt,
James Cotton, Junior Wells and Charlie Musselwhite.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Seymour Solomon studied violin at Juilliard
and served in the Army Air Corps orchestra during World War II.
Following the war, he studied music at New York University, wrote
criticism for several music magazines, and was a music commentator on
several New York radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon's first venture in recording came when he traveled to
Europe with a tape recorder in 1950 and captured five Bach cantatas
performed by the Vienna Philharmonic and the Vienna State Opera.
These became the first recordings for his Bach Guild Label.</TE>
<TE>   The Solomon brothers founded Vanguard later that same year. They
diversified into more contemporary music in the 1970s and '80s. Then,
in 1985, they sold the label to the Welk Record Group run by Larry
Welk, the son of bandleader Lawrence Welk.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour Solomon later began another label, Omega Classics. He
eventually bought Vanguard's old classical holdings from the Welk
Record Group and re-released much of it on compact disc.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother, Solomon is survived by three
daughters, a stepson, a sister and nine grandchildren.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The father of slain Yosemite sightseer Silvina Pelosso says only his
remaining daughter has kept him from killing Cary Stayner, the
handyman on trial in the murder of Pelosso and her friends Carole and
Juli Sund.</LD>
<LD>   "I could do justice on my own. I know I could do it," Jose Pelosso
said last week outside the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice.
"Throughout the trial, I think I've had more than 10 opportunities to
kill him."</LD>
<LD>   The Argentine father, who stormed out of the courtroom Thursday
while a tape of Stayner's confession was playing, said he can't
escape such thoughts.</LD>
<TE>   Pelosso's daughter left Argentina for a year in America and was
allegedly killed by the man Pelosso now comes to see every day.
Stayner, already imprisoned for killing another young woman, sits no
farther than the distance of a basketball free throw from Pelosso in
court.</TE>
<TE>   But the father keeps his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosso told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat that it is because of
his remaining daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "My other daughter," he said. "That's the only thing that keeps me
from it. I would have killed him. That's the only thing. I would just
tear him up."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosso, who goes by the name Pepe, and his wife, Raquel, have
suffered the worst years of their lives since the death of their
daughter. Their country's economy has crumbled. They've lost their
long-held family business. Their marriage is continually tested. And
Silvina is gone.</TE>
<TE>   They traveled to the United States from Cordoba, Argentina,
earlier this month as Stayner's trial date neared.</TE>
<TE>   They worried that they might not be able to come because of the
economic chaos in their country. But with the help of private
donations, the family was able to make the trip and will stay in an
apartment in San Jose for the duration of the trial, which is
expected to last two months.</TE>
<TE>   Their friends, Francis and Carole Carrington, Carole Sund's
parents, are staying nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Their daughter Paula, 24, didn't come for the trial, saying she
couldn't miss any more school, her father said. "She tries very hard
to not show me how upset she is," Pelosso said.</TE>

<DH>Labor: City employees move closer to a strike after voting
down a four-year offer of pay and benefits hikes.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of Simi Valley's largest public employees union voted Monday
to reject a last-minute offer from the city on a new contract,
meaning as many as 300 city workers could walk off the job later this
week.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the union's 170 dues-paying members gathered at the
Simi Valley Police Station to vote on a previous city offer, but the
new proposal--offering more in salary and benefits--arrived minutes
before the meeting, union officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, 95% of those at the meeting rejected the new offer, said
Edgar McLemore, president of the bargaining unit, meaning the strike
is scheduled to begin Thursday morning.</LD>
<TE>   Service Employees International Union Local 998 covers police
dispatchers, bus drivers, mechanics and secretaries in Simi Valley.
They are seeking a 3% pay hike and improved health benefits in their
contract, which expired June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever reason, our city manager had decided we're not
deserving of equal benefits," McLemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said officials have
prepared a plan to ensure that critical city services--such as
transit, police dispatching and sewage treatment--are not interrupted
during a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the union team rejected an offer by city negotiators
that would have provided a 4% annual increase in pay and health
benefits for each of the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's proposal was for a 19% increase over four years.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore, however, said a 19% package may look good on paper, but
it is not enough for employees to cover their increasing benefits
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're so far behind all of these years, 19% can hardly keep
up with what's going on," he said. "We're talking about benefits
equal with other people in this city."</TE>
<TE>   Union members are asking for a 21.6% package, including major
changes in the medical plan, said Zelma Baer, a union negotiator who
works in the city's accounting department.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders argue that the city's contributions to their health
benefits--currently about $310 a month--are less than half the $810 a
month that management employees receive.</TE>
<TE>   Baer said she pays $300 every month for HMO insurance, and
premiums are slated to go up 20% each year for the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do something now, or we're going to be buried," Baer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People won't be able to afford insurance, and they'll have to go
without, hoping their children won't get sick or hurt. That's no way
to live."</TE>

<TE>   "From the city's perspective it was a very generous proposal," she

<TE>   McLemore, however, said a 19% package may look good on paper, but

<TE>   The average union member earns about $16 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, a memo City Manager Mike Sedell sent to SEIU
employees raised the ire of some union leaders because it informed
workers in underlined print that they may resign from the union at
any time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's union-busting," McLemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Magelnicki said the memo was only for information purposes and
stemmed from calls Sedell has received from concerned workers, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells employees they have a choice about whether to
participate in the strike," she said, "and tells them that the city
won't be paying them if they choose to strike."</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man convicted in the robbery-murder of a 22-year-old
Occidental College art student was sentenced Monday to life in prison
without the possibility of parole.</LD>
<LD>   Demetrio Cabrera, 33, expressed sympathy to the mother of victim
Wendy Soltero moments before he was sentenced by Los Angeles Superior
Court Judge Mark Mooney. He insisted that he was innocent of the
charges.</LD>
<LD>   Beth Soltero said Cabrera's statement did not seem genuine because
he did not include Wendy's father or sister, who also attended the
sentencing, in his comments.</LD>
<TE>   Soltero said Cabrera deserved as much prison time as co-defendant
Araceli Pena, who shot her daughter in the back of the head as she
sat in her car, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera drove the car he and Pena used to commit an hour-long
crime spree in the Hollywood area Oct. 28, 2000, that resulted in
Wendy's death, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "She pulled the trigger, but he could have stopped it at any
time," the mother said of the two defendants after the sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Pena, 20, was sentenced in April to life in prison without the
possibility of parole. She and Cabrera were convicted of Soltero's
murder and several counts of robbery and attempted robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The pair committed three holdups in less than an hour and were
trying a fourth when they were spotted by Los Angeles police officers
and arrested, prosecutors said. The crimes netted less than $50.</TE>
<TE>   In the second robbery, Pena and Cabrera pulled up to Soltero's car
on Tamarind Avenue and demanded money. Soltero and two female
passengers were cooperating when Pena fired a single shot at Soltero,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The pair committed two more crimes before they were arrested, 40
minutes after the shooting, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Soltero said she is relieved that the case is over, but she
feels no sense of closure. "The only justice would be for us to get
Wendy back, and that's not going to happen," she said.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Gets an Honor With Altitude</HD>
<DH>Military: Air National Guard is naming firefighting planes
in honor of the city and other local communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, it's not as noticeable as having your name in lights, but
Thousand Oaks receives a different sort of distinction today when its
name and city seal are unveiled on a firefighting military plane.</LD>
<LD>   Councilmen Dan Del Campo and Dennis Gillette, along with City
Manager MaryJane Lazz and several department heads, will attend a
brief afternoon ceremony at the Channel Islands Air National Guard
base in Port Hueneme.</LD>
<LD>   There, a C-130E Hercules, a 40-year-old warhorse with nearly
22,000 flight hours will officially be renamed The City of Thousand
Oaks. The Lockheed transport recently engaged in its peacetime role
as a water-dropping plane, battling the Wolf fire north of Ojai and
the Copper fire near Santa Clarita.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very significant honor for the city," Gillette said. "It's
a particular honor for a [former] lowly enlisted Marine to be out
there with all that brass participating in this ceremony."</TE>
<TE>   The dedication is part of a program the guard's 146th Airlift Wing
established to honor cities around the base that many of the roughly
1,200 men and women under its command call home. Eleven full-time
employees and 19 Air National Guard reservists at the base are
Thousand Oaks residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rare opportunity that you have your name on anything
outside the city limits," Del Campo said. The Thousand Oaks name is
most recognizable adorning the Civic Arts Plaza-City Hall complex
that faces the Ventura Freeway near California 23.</TE>
<TE>   All of the cities in Ventura County have been asked for permission
to use their names, and officials in Camarillo, Port Hueneme, Oxnard
and Santa Paula have given formal approval. Malibu has also been
approached, along with Santa Barbara, which has given the plan its
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   The dedication program will include presentation of a
commemorative plaque by vice wing commander Col. Ed Bellion.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Mike Dugas, executive officer-community affairs and program
emcee, said aircraft decoration, or "nose art," is a military
tradition that peaked during World War II, when planes carried
everything from macho mascots with weapons to images of pinups, such
as Betty Grable. In the case of the C-130s, the name of the city and
its seal or logo will be placed above a crew entrance door.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of naming Air National Guard planes after nearby cities
dates back several decades, said Dugas, adding that this latest
effort has been warmly received.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no cost and it's for all the right reasons. So we've had
great response," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the 146th Airlift Wing, a reserve unit of the Air
Force, received delivery of the second of eight new C-130J Hercules
to be added to the fleet by 2006. The new planes use less fuel than
the older aircraft that were brought into service in the early 1960s
and require a crew of three rather than five.</TE>
<TE>   This is part of a federal effort to upgrade the nation's four
firefighting air guard units. The others are in Cheyenne, Wyo.;
Colorado Springs, Colo.; and Charlotte, N.C.</TE>

<HD>Truck Strikes, Kills Reseda Couple Crossing Dark Street</HD>
<DH>Safety: The husband and wife, who moved from Guatemala
eight months ago, may have been running to catch a bus, their son
says.</DH>

<LD>A Reseda couple may have been running to catch a bus after work when
they were struck and killed by a truck near Fashion Square Sherman
Oaks, their son said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Santos Mendoza, 41, and Floridalma Estrada, 38, were hit shortly
after 9 p.m. Sunday as they were crossing Riverside Drive near
Ranchito Avenue in a darkened section of the street that was not a
marked crosswalk, Capt. Greg Myer of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Valley Traffic Division said.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, who died at the scene, had immigrated from Guatemala
about eight months ago, family members said. They had jobs cleaning
and gardening at a condominium complex on Ranchito Avenue and were
headed toward a bus stop on Woodman Avenue, Myer said.</LD>
<TE>   They crossed about 50 feet east of the intersection onto Riverside
Drive, Myer said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's son, Bryan Mendoza, 14, later said that his parents
may have been running late to catch the bus.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver, a 24-year-old Agoura Hills man, was not cited,
Myer said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another tragedy that could have been prevented," said Los
Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine at a Monday afternoon news
conference on pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jan. 1, the Valley Traffic Division has responded to 10
traffic fatalities involving pedestrians, Myer said.</TE>
<TE>   In eight of the cases, the drivers were found not to be at fault,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Mendoza and a family friend, who shared an apartment with
Mendoza and Estrada, were making arrangements Monday afternoon to
have the couple's remains sent to Guatemala for burial.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hard workers and great parents," Bryan said between
phone calls to family in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   "I have many fond memories of my parents, and I do not want to
think about this right now."</TE>

<LD>The city is expected today to double the financial assistance it
offers low-income families to buy a house or fix up their existing
one, city officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council is set to approve new home-buyer and
rehabilitation assistance guidelines that increase the amount of
matching funds each family could receive from $5,000 to $10,000, said
Ernie Whitaker, Oxnard's housing rehabilitation manager.</LD>
<LD>   "We're working with 7-year-old policies, and housing prices have
gone up considerably since then," Whitaker said. The average home
prices are $192,500 in south Oxnard, $265,000 in north Oxnard and
$345,000 in Oxnard's beach area, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The increase would be available to qualifying families improving
their home exteriors and interiors, as well as to help with closing
costs or down payments for buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Families must be Oxnard residents and be low-income, Whitaker
said. The new guidelines would go into effect Aug. 1, he said.</TE>

<LD>Two basement rooms housing swimming pool equipment and chemicals at
Ventura High School were flooded early Monday, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The flood was caused by pipes that broke overnight, releasing
about 2 million gallons of water. The pipes had been connected to an
old boiler that was recently removed during the remodeling of the
school's gymnasium.</LD>
<LD>   By Monday evening, workers were still pumping water from the
basement. Fire officials say it may take another day to estimate the
cost of the damage. In addition to the pool equipment, the room
contained heaters, a transformer and several electrical panels.</LD>

<HD>Musty Water Due to Algae, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Health: Some residents had been concerned that recent
changes in the supply's odor and taste were the result of tampering
by terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regional water officials scrambled Monday to assure sensitive-nosed
residents from Beverly Hills to Thousand Oaks that the musty odor and
taste they've noticed in their tap water for the last few days is a
result of the heat wave and not biological terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Agencies supplied by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California fielded several telephone calls in recent days from
residents concerned that their water supply had been tampered with.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the smell and taste is caused by compounds produced
by algae blooms in Castaic Lake in northern Los Angeles County, Lake
Mathews in Riverside County and Lake Silverwood in San Bernardino
County. Algae can thrive during hot weather, but the resulting
compounds are not harmful to the public.</LD>
<TE>   Reservoirs are being treated with copper sulfate, sprinkled from
helicopters, to control the algae. But it could be weeks before the
odd odor disappears. In the meantime, as many as 10 million residents
and swimmers could be affected, although most people don't have
palates discerning enough to notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Sensitive people will notice a difference in taste and odor,"
said Don Kendall, general manager of the Calleguas Municipal Water
District, which serves portions of Ventura County. "It's strictly
aesthetic. It's perfectly safe to drink."</TE>
<TE>   Refrigerating drinking water diminishes the smell and taste,
Kendall said.</TE>
<TE>   This was the third such calm-the-public campaign that water
agencies have announced since the terrorist attacks in September, and
the second notification this month. Monday's announcement covers
swaths of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, including Beverly Hills,
Burbank, Glendale, Santa Monica, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and
Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Water agencies issued a similar announcement on July 3 to
residents in Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino counties, and said
Monday that residents in those areas can expect their water to remain
slightly earthy smelling for several more days.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 changed the perception of how we deal with taste or
anything that might garner the attention of consumers," said
Metropolitan Water District spokesman Bob Muir.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be proactive about this in telling residents their
water is safe."</TE>

<LD>Jacque Jones had a career-high five hits and a home run as the
visiting Minnesota Twins defeated the Chicago White Sox, 11-6, for
their sixth consecutive victory win, increasing their American League
Central lead to 14 games.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins had 17 hits and scored six runs in the sixth inning.
Jones hit a two-run homer in the second, and Dustan Mohr had a
three-run shot in the sixth, when White Sox Manager Jerry Manuel and
reliever Rocky Biddle were ejected.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Reed (8-5) got the victory by giving up six hits and three

<TE>   Todd Ritchie (5-14) gave up five runs in 4 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Baltimore 3--Vernon Wells had his first career
two-homer game, and Chris Woodward and Carlos Delgado also connected
to lead the Blue Jays at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Wells, who had 14 homers in his previous 152 games, hit solo shots
in the fifth and sixth innings. His first home run preceded a drive
by Woodward, and his second followed a three-run blast by Delgado.</TE>

<HD>Angels Ready for a Close-up</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After sweeping the Mariners, Anaheim wants to
prove to Oakland, and to the rest of the league, that it is a
legitimate contender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of a Major League Baseball promotion, the Angels and the
Oakland Athletics will don replica uniforms from the 1982 season
during a key three-game series that begins tonight at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind the Triumphant Glory Series: Give teams a chance
to celebrate their most memorable year in club history.</LD>
<LD>   Forsaking 1986, the year of the unforgettable American League
championship series meltdown against the Boston Red Sox, the Angels
chose to turn back the clock two decades to the year they won the
second of their three AL West division titles.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty years from now, the franchise hopes the 2002 uniforms will
spur memories of a division title--and perhaps more.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels begin their AL West series against the A's riding a
wave of confidence after sweeping the first-place Seattle Mariners
over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The three-game sweep, their first against the Mariners since 1998,
put the Angels in sole possession of second place and moved them
within a game of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Angel players enjoyed the moment on the field immediately after
Sunday's 7-5 victory, but by the time they reached the clubhouse they
were humbly looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels conclude the home stand with the series against the
A's, who are two games behind the Mariners, then continue their most
important stretch of the season when they travel to Seattle for a
three-game series before returning home to face the Red Sox and New
York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "We have another big game [tonight] and we have to be ready for
that," shortstop David Eckstein said. "It's been a good run but we
have to keep up that intensity."</TE>
<TE>   After the sweep, Mariner second baseman Bret Boone said the Angels
were proving themselves a contender, then added, "You can't forget
about Oakland."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels haven't.</TE>
<TE>   The A's won two of the three games against Texas over the weekend
and are 6-3 against the Angels this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels split a two-game series at Oakland last week. Kevin
Appier (8-7) earned the victory in a 10-4 win and will start today
against left-hander Barry Zito (13-3), who shut out the Angels, 2-0,
with help from two relievers.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Manager Art Howe moved Zito up a day in the rotation so he
can throw left-handers Ted Lilly, Mark Mulder and Zito against the
Rangers this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hudson, who beat the Angels in April, and Cory Lidle, coming
off a one-hitter against the Rangers on Saturday, will follow Zito
against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "With their pitching staff, you know it's possible that you might
only get one or two runs to work with," said Appier, who played for
Oakland in 1999 and 2000. "That doesn't change the way you pitch, but
you want to be on top of your game when you face them."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland General Manager Billy Beane already has added Lilly in a
trade with the Yankees and, if tradition holds, will probably make
another deal before the July 31 trade deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman also is considering trades,
but said, "I won't make one just to put a peg on the board. I'm not
going to do something if it's not going to make us better."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he is happy with the current
configuration of his roster.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always looking to improve your club," he said. "If we
don't [make a trade], I'm confident with the group we have.</TE>
<TE>   "We not only match up better with teams in our division much
better than at any time since I've been here, but also with other
teams in the American League that are contenders."</TE>
<TE>   Before the series against the Mariners, Angel left-hander Jarrod
Washburn said it was important for the Angels to prove that they were
a team Seattle should worry about. After he extended his major-league
leading winning streak to 12 games Sunday, Washburn felt the Angels
had achieved their goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we showed the Mariners that we're not going to go away,"
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Angels must prove the same point to the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of us are so close, if you let up, you're going to be
looking up so far you might not be able to catch anybody," Eckstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot of baseball to be played."</TE>

<HD>Erickson Charged With Assault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baltimore Oriole pitcher Scott Erickson was charged Monday with
assaulting his girlfriend after she confronted him about whether he
was cheating on her, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Erickson and Lisa Ortiz had a "heated argument" that ended with
Erickson throwing her to the floor of an elevator in the building
where they live, according to a police report.</LD>
<LD>   The right-handed pitcher told police Ortiz bit him on his right
arm, causing a bruise and swelling. Police also said Erickson's right
foot was bleeding and they found blood stains leading from the
couple's condominium to the elevator.</LD>
<TE>   Erickson and Ortiz told police they did not require medical
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing. It's just a bad break," Erickson said before
Monday's game against Toronto at Camden Yards. "Nothing happened. It
was pretty much a situation where they had to do something and it
just got blown out of proportion. No harm done."</TE>
<TE>   Erickson, who did not have any visible injuries, added "everything
will be dropped."</TE>
<TE>   However, a prosecutor said the state's attorney's office will
decide whether to pursue the case.</TE>
<TE>   Because Ortiz and Erickson aren't married, she could be compelled
to testify against him, prosecutor Alex Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   An Oriole spokesman said the team would not comment until it had
more information about the arrest. Manager Mike Hargrove said the
team will stand behind Erickson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Tiger President Dave Dombrowski apologized for comments he
made at a private luncheon that later were broadcast by a sports
radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Dombrowski apologized on radio station WXYT-AM "to any player that
may have been hurt by the comments" he made Friday to suite holders
and corporate sponsors, Tiger spokesman Jim Anderson said. Callers
who said they attended the luncheon began discussing the statements
on sports talk shows through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never had anything like this happen in my career,"
Dombrowski told The Detroit News in today's editions. "I should have
not made this mistake, but when you're talking to a group like that,
you are trying to entertain, you've been asked to do that, and all of
a sudden I crossed the line in my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   WDFN-AM received a recording of part of Dombrowski's speech and
broadcast it Monday. In it, Dombrowski tallied the salaries of
several Tigers, saying no team would accept them in a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to disparage any of these guys, but put yourself in
my shoes and say, 'I want to change some of the faces,' " Dombrowski
said at the luncheon.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Dean Palmer. He's a great guy. If you can trade him
tomorrow, give me a call. Save me $8.5 million in our budget next
year. Damion Easley ... he's still not hitting .200--and there's $6.5
million for next year. We're up to $15 [million]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago White Sox fired pitching coach Nardi Contreras and
appointed Don Cooper to the position.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras, 50, was hired by Chicago in May 1998. The White Sox
staff compiled a 4.77 earned-run average in 704 games under
Contreras.</TE>

<LD>Houston Astro owner Drayton McLane isn't getting much sympathy with
his threat to sell the team if baseball's economic structure doesn't
change.</LD>
<LD>   "When we first got here, the top teams were the Yankees and the
Mets at around $110 million to $130 million in revenue," McLane said.
"We moved into the new stadium and all of a sudden we had revenue of
$135 million. Unfortunately, our expenses, especially on salaries,
also went up."</LD>
<LD>   To which catcher Gregg Zaun, the team's player representative,
said: "When the big giants like Arthur Andersen go down and they're
proven to be dirty, what are you going to think about the rest of
these people and their creative bookkeeping?"</LD>
<TE>   Still more: Jon Heyman of Newsday commented, "McLane is crying he
has lost money, but the value of the franchise has almost tripled
since he bought the team for $115 million. Plus, he re-sold
ballpark-naming rights for tens of millions to Minute Maid.
Houstonians who lost their life savings and their jobs to the Enron
crooks don't need to hear this millionaire weeping."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the record for ejections in a season for a
rookie manager?</TE>
<TE>   Frightening: Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel is puzzled as to
why the august Augusta National would not welcome women members.</TE>
<TE>   "What are those boys afraid of, anyway? Are the old guys afraid
they won't be able to have any more of their all-male parties, where
they drink bourbon, smoke cigars and play 'Pin the Tail on Gloria
Steinem'?"</TE>
<TE>   Happy birthday: Nomar Garciaparra is 29 today. The Boston Red Sox
shortstop got his name from his father, Ramon--only backward.</TE>
<TE>   Merely memories: Australian Shirley de la Hunty, who as Shirley
Strickland won seven Olympic track and field medals, including three
golds, auctioned off her memorabilia, including the medals, for
$200,000.</TE>
<TE>   The money, she said, helped pay for her grandchildren's education
and promote environmental causes. When she was criticized, she said:</TE>
<TE>   "The medals themselves have done their duty. They've been fingered
by thousands of school children and adults, they've been shown
everywhere, and I think that they deserve something a little bit
safer."</TE>
<TE>   Gardening tip: Before Barry Bonds was injured, San Francisco Giant
Manager Dusty Baker was considering switching Bonds and Jeff Kent in
the batting order for the second time.</TE>
<TE>   But then Baker remembered that, "When you plant a seed, you've got
to let it grow a little bit before you pull it up and plant another
seed."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 10, by Bill Dahlen in 1910 and Burleigh Grimes in
1937, both with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Lance Armstrong says he is still bothered by French
fans yelling "Doper, doper" at him as he continues to lead the Tour
de France even though he was cleared of all suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   But Buddy Martin of the Charlotte Sun-Herald says: "When they
finally open up Lance Armstrong's chest, they're going to find that
there's a V-8 engine firing those piston-like legs which propel him
like a jet over the mountains in the Tour de France."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Wasting Away in the West</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tracy's revamped lineup produces 13 hits but
squanders almost all of them in 5-2 loss to Padres, L.A.'s 11th
defeat in last 13 games.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy took a jackhammer to his lineup Monday
night, and his team responded to the shakeup with 13 hits, the most
in 12 games since the All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   But a bend-but-don't-break performance by San Diego pitcher Brian
Lawrence and two phenomenal defensive plays by Padre left fielder Ron
Gant--who, as Angel fans will recall, has butchered his share of
balls in the outfield--left the Dodgers sifting through the rubble of
a 5-2 loss to the Padres before 20,085 in Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence gave up two runs and 12 hits in 7 1/3 innings for his
second win over the Dodgers in a week, and Gant threw out Mark
Grudzielanek at home in the fifth inning and robbed Dave Roberts of a
two-run triple--and possibly a game-tying inside-the-park home
run--with a superb diving catch of Roberts' liner toward the
left-field corner to end the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   Padre closer Trevor Hoffman retired the side in order in the ninth
for his 24th save, sealing the Dodgers' 11th loss in 13 games and
dropping them 2 1/2 games behind Arizona in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all frustrated," Tracy said. "When you've done what we did
to be in the position we're in, it's tougher every day to get beat,
because you want to get on track. In this division, those other teams
aren't going to wait forever, so we have to get things going."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers thought they had done just that in the eighth inning
Monday night, when Marquis Grissom's pinch-hit RBI single off
reliever Steve Reed cut San Diego's lead to 5-2 and put runners on
first and second.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts sent a slicing drive to medium left near the line, but
Gant raced over and hurled his body at it, extending his glove and
making the catch just before he hit the turf.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, will someone take the spell off us?" Dodger left fielder
Brian Jordan said. "I can't believe he even dove for that. If he
misses that, it's an inside-the-park home run. Unbelievable. But
that's how you win games, by being aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   And not by committing physical and mental errors or by going three
for 17 with runners in scoring position, as the Dodgers did Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Dave Hansen replaced the struggling Adrian Beltre
and had three hits, but his two fourth-inning errors led to an
unearned run that allowed the Padres to snap a tie on Wil Nieves' RBI
double.</TE>
<TE>   And Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez, who gave up four runs--three
earned--and eight hits in five innings to fall to 10-7, failed to
cover first on Gant's two-out chopper to the right side in the fifth.
That enabled Phil Nevin, who had doubled, to score for a 3-1 lead and
extended a rally that was capped by Deivi Cruz's run-scoring infield
single.</TE>
<TE>   "We surrendered some runs tonight," Tracy said. "Those are the
kinds of things we've done well this season."</TE>
<TE>   Having scored 27 runs in the previous 11 games, an average of 2.5
a game, and gone a season-high five games without a home run, Tracy
overhauled his lineup against Lawrence, the right-hander who has a
4-1 career record and 2.08 earned-run average against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The objective: Add a left-handed bat against Lawrence, who had
yielded a .285 average to left-handers and a .228 average to
right-handers this season, and hopefully take some strain off a
pitching staff that has been locked in numerous low-scoring close
games since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who had 12 hits in his previous 24 at-bats, moved
from the bottom of the order to the two hole; Paul Lo Duca, mired in
a one-for-19 slump, moved from second to cleanup; Mike Kinkade
spelled Eric Karros at first, and the left-handed hitting Hansen
replaced Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to get the offense going, and if we do that, I think
the other areas will settle themselves," Tracy said. "When you get
one chance to score in a game, and it's a meager amount, every pitch
you throw could win or lose the game."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen advanced a runner with a grounder to the right side in the
second and singled in his next three at-bats. Kinkade had two hits,
including an RBI single in the second, and Grudzielanek had two hits.
But the heart of the Dodger order continued to struggle.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 games, Lo Duca, No. 3 hitter Shawn Green, Karros
and Jordan have combined for six RBIs. The Dodgers put the leadoff
runner on base in each of the first seven innings Monday night but
could muster no more than two runs.</TE>
<TE>   And on one of their hardest-hit balls of the night, Jordan's
single to left in the fifth, Gant threw out Grudzielanek at the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little snake-bit," Tracy said. "We have to get the worm
turned."</TE>

<HD>Cabrera Acquired in Trade With Indians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers completed a minor trade with Cleveland Monday, acquiring
utility player Jolbert Cabrera for triple-A left-hander Lance
Caraccioli.</LD>
<LD>   Cabrera, who hit .111 in 38 games for the Indians, will likely be
assigned to triple-A Las Vegas, where he will add versatility--he can
play second base, shortstop, third base and all three outfield
positions--and depth.</LD>
<LD>   Cabrera, 29, was a super-sub for Cleveland last season, hitting
.261 with 38 runs batted in and a .312 on-base percentage in 141
games, but he hasn't been the same since being shot in the right
buttock during an attempted carjacking in his native Colombia last
December.</LD>
<TE>   Cabrera, whose brother, Orlando, plays shortstop for Montreal,
lost some of his speed since the shooting and has been up and down
between Cleveland and triple-A Buffalo twice this season. He has a
.177 on-base percentage and is hitting .024 (one for 41) against
right-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "I know him well from the American League, and I've been trying to
get him for six or seven months," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans
said. "He can play a lot of positions, and that can help with double
switches. Our scouts believe he can be a valuable addition."</TE>
<TE>   Caraccioli, 24, went 4-3 with a 4.14 earned-run average in 10
starts for Las Vegas, but he was not considered one of the Dodgers'
better prospects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hansen broke Manny Mota's franchise record with his 107th
pinch hit as a Dodger Sunday night against San Francisco, but he
still wouldn't put himself in the same class as Mota, who played for
the Dodgers from 1969-80 and 1982 and currently serves as a Dodger
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the best pinch-hitter in baseball," Hansen said. "He
didn't have the facilities we had, the statistics ... he was
self-taught. I'm lucky to be around him and to be learning from him
for all these years.</TE>
<TE>   "Pinch-hitting is not a popular role, but he made it recognized."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros, who hasn't knocked in a run in the last
12 games, did not start Monday night, but it had nothing to do with
the Felix Rodriguez fastball that hit him on the chin Saturday.
Manager Jim Tracy said he wanted to give Karros, who started the
previous 11 games, a day off.... Kevin Brown took another significant
step in his recovery from June 11 surgery for a herniated disk in his
lower back, throwing 60 pitches off a Dodger Stadium bullpen mound
Monday. Tracy said Brown threw all of his pitches and he was "very
encouraged" by Brown's first mound appearance since surgery.</TE>

<HD>Townsend, Schwikert to Lead U.S. Against World at Pond</HD>

<LD>A competition matching U.S. gymnasts against an impressive field of
international competitors will be held Aug. 22 at the Arrowhead Pond,
a preview of the feats that will unfold at the Pond a year later
during the World Gymnastics Championships.</LD>
<LD>   The T.J. Maxx International Gymnastics Challenge, announced
Monday, will be contested under a team format. Four U.S. men will
compete against four men from the rest of the world and four U.S.
women will compete against four international challengers, with each
team competing in two events of its choice. A panel of celebrities
and former world-class gymnasts will serve as judges.</LD>
<LD>   The event will be taped for airing on NBC on Nov. 24. Tickets will
go on public sale Monday through Ticketmaster and the Pond box
office.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. teams will be led by the men's and women's national
champions, Sean Townsend and Tasha Schwikert. They will defend their
titles in the U.S. championships Aug. 7-10 at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the U.S. men's team will be twin brothers Paul and Morgan
Hamm, who competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and 2001 World
Championships silver medalist Brett McClure. The rest of the women's
team will be announced after the U.S. championships.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, a two-time world all-around champion
and two-time Olympic gold medalist, leads the women's world team. She
will be joined by Daniele Hypolito of Brazil, a silver medalist in
floor exercise at last year's World Championships; Verona Van De
Leur, the Dutch champion, and Brenda Magana, the Mexican national
champion.</TE>
<TE>   The men's world squad includes Sydney Olympic all-around gold
medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, Jordan Jovtchev of Bulgaria, winner
of two medals at last year's World Championships, and Alexander
Beresh of Ukraine, who won two medals at Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   The World Championships on Aug. 16-24, 2003, are expected to draw
750 athletes from 60 countries to the Pond to vie for team and
individual championships. The World Championships will determine
qualifiers for the 2004 Athens Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We set very optimistic goals over a year ago for where we would
like to be with ticket sales a year out, and as of [Monday] morning,
the response from the gymnastics community has been very favorable,"
said Tim Ryan, general manager of the Pond. "And we anticipate a
tremendous demand once tickets go on public sale."</TE>

<KH>HORSE RACING BILL CHRISTINE</KH>
<HD>What He Couldn't Buy Was Americans' Love</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prince owned last year's horse of the year, Point Given, and he
might have come within one race of sweeping this year's Triple Crown
with War Emblem, but he still had much to accomplish in racing.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, he still needed to make Americans like him.</LD>
<LD>   Because of his heritage, and because of what happened in this
country last Sept. 11, the Saudi Arabian-born Ahmed bin Salman could
never make as many friends here as his champion horses did. War
Emblem's improbable win in the Kentucky Derby brought muted cheers at
Churchill Downs, and later there were suggestions that the prince
hadn't really won the Derby, he had bought one. Two weeks later, at
Pimlico, the prince's flights of humor fell flat as War Emblem won
the Preakness. Then three weeks after that the prince was derided for
being a no-show at Belmont Park, 20 miles from where the Twin Towers
once stood, on the day his colt was beaten.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of hours before the Belmont Stakes, it was left to
Richard Mulhall, Prince Ahmed's racing manager in the U.S., to
explain why War Emblem's owner wasn't in New York. Mulhall said
something about the prince's family obligations, but nobody in a
crowded Belmont press box believed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think more people like him than dislike him," Mulhall also
said, but few within earshot were nodding in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Ahmed, who died Monday of a heart attack at 43, was on the
wrong side, running horses in a nation wronged, and there was nothing
that War Emblem or Point Given or any of his many talented
thoroughbreds could do to undo that.</TE>
<TE>   That the prince bought the Derby was a bum rap, promulgated by
those who don't understand the game. If the Derby is your holy grail,
you get to the Churchill winner's circle on your hands and knees if
that's what it takes. Whether you buy horses early or late, or
home-grow them, is beside the point. There's no extra credit for
knowing your horse since he was a weanling. Every year, owners and
trainers with prospects that haven't panned out become last-minute
shoppers, and the only difference between them and Bin Salman was
that he got lucky and pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, purchased less than a month before the race, caught a
tactics-free Derby, one unlike almost all the others; it took the
prince's colt to prove to us that this is a so-so crop of
3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after the Derby was his, Bin Salman had to repeatedly
defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could buy next year's winner, I'll do that too," he brashly
said.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, it will always be a tough room for a Saudi doing
stand-up. The interview tent didn't shake with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   In Baltimore, the prince, having noted how his clowning trainer,
Bob Baffert, had drawn laughs from Del Mar to Dubai, went to the
Pimlico infield and wore the Preakness trophy on his head. The
trouble was, Baffert's own act had long worn thin. Marylanders were
not even ready for Abbott, and here they had Costello on the same
stage.</TE>
<TE>   For the prince, skipping the Belmont was the smart thing to do.
There was no less tension, or high security, this June than there was
for the Breeders' Cup, run at the same track about six weeks after
the terrorist attacks. Wisely, Bin Salman wasn't there that day to
see his horses run, either.</TE>
<TE>   He might have improved his image problems with better access, but
he resisted one-on-one interviews, preferring to dole out post-race
sound bites instead. For someone grounded in worldwide
communications, he surely knew better, but he seemed to tire quickly
of the incisive political parrying. At the Preakness, he didn't even
want to talk about the $1-million multi-race bonus issue that he and
Russell Reineman, the disenchanted minority owner of War Emblem, were
still kicking around. See my lawyer, the prince said.</TE>
<TE>   For all anybody knows, the last lengthy interview Bin Salman did
was with a reporter from The Times over lunch at the Santa Anita Turf
Club four years ago. For openers, Bin Salman jokingly asked what his
fee would be for the session. "Do I call you prince?" the reporter
wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahmed will be good enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He hauled out pictures of his four daughters. One, 5 years old.
Triplets, just over a year old. A son came along later, born just
days before a big win at Santa Anita, in a race the prince was forced
to miss.</TE>
<TE>   He named one of his fillies Triple Treasure, after the triplets.
He named one of his top fillies Habibti, an Arabian term of
endearment that he often called his wife and daughters. The name of
the champion Point Given came out of a contentious board meeting held
one day in London.</TE>
<TE>   "Point taken!" one of the prince's executives said.</TE>
<TE>   "Point given!" was the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself right then and there," the prince said, "that
I'm going to remember that name and give it to one of my horses
someday."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, he was a man with more horses than names.</TE>
<TE>   "If I like a horse, the sky's the limit," he said in 1996, after
he had paid $900,000 for Sharp Cat, who was one of his favorites and
became one of his best. He kissed the filly on the nose after she won
races, with all the warmth that he had for his children.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Ahmed also paid $900,000 for 90% of War Emblem, who made
him one of only three men--after John Galbreath and Paul Mellon--to
win both the English and Kentucky derbies. Bin Salman won at Epsom
with Oath in 1999. Would the prince have traded either win to have
won the hearts of America? Had he ever let us inside, we might have
known.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Dynasty!!! The Official NBA Finals 2002 Retrospective"</LD>
<TE>   Author: John Hareas.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers: NBA Entertainment, the Sporting News, NVU Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.95.</TE>
<TE>   This 9-inch-by-12-inch, 112-page coffee-table book with a glossy
jacket and gold-embossed cover is being released in conjunction with
the official NBA Finals home video and DVD, which are due out today.
The photography is excellent, and there is some good reading as well,
including a three-page foreword with Phil Jackson listed as the
author.</TE>
<TE>   The foreword, titled "The Longest Season," provides a fairly
revealing look at the Lakers' season as seen through the eyes of
their coach, regardless of whether he actually typed the words.</TE>
<TE>   The foreword begins with Jackson addressing his players on the
opening day of training camp at Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   He told them it was going to be a tough season, that every team
would be bringing their "A" game. Jackson also told them his mother
was very ill. She died two days later, on Oct. 2, causing Jackson to
miss the next week of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   The foreword includes much more about the Western Conference
finals against Sacramento than the Finals, which are called "a bit
anticlimactic."</TE>
<TE>   Laker fans will like this comment from Jackson: "We don't feel
we've reached our limits yet."</TE>
<TE>   The book opens with the Lakers' championship celebration, then
comes a look at other NBA dynasties. There are separate chapters on
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Jackson and the supporting cast. The
book concludes with chapters on the regular season, the early rounds
of the playoffs and the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The author, John Hareas, works for NBA Entertainment. He is not as
close to the Lakers as Riverside Press-Enterprise columnist Lyle
Spencer, who provided the copy for last year's official book. But it
really doesn't matter. The color photos--all 225 of them--are what
make this book.</TE>

<HD>Bloomington Brings Back Markham to Coach</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Markham has begun a second stint as Bloomington High's football
coach after the Colton Unified School District approved his hiring as
a replacement for Stewart Roper, who resigned several weeks ago after
inconsistencies were discovered on his resume.</LD>
<LD>   Markham, who led Bloomington to Southern Section titles in 1994,
'96 and '97, had expressed interest in coaching the Bruins again
after Robert Kistner resigned in April. But the position went to
Roper, who previously coached at Blythe Palo Verde.</LD>
<LD>   Roper was on the job about a week before he resigned. Bloomington
Principal Ignacio Cabrera, who declined to elaborate on the resume
discrepancies, said Roper also felt pressure from a community largely
supportive of Markham. Roper could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Markham, who has a 274-78-1 record and four section titles in 30
years of coaching, went 13-9 at Rialto over the last two seasons. He
was fired in May because he told school officials he could not commit
to staying through the coming season.</TE>

<HD>Fehr Denies a Sept. 16 Strike Date Has Been Set</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Players' union chief sends out a memo to members
saying published reports are incorrect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN and JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Major League Baseball Players Assn., claiming on Monday that
potential strike dates have not even been considered despite its
pessimistic view of lagging labor talks, denied reports that Sept. 16
has been tentatively targeted to begin the sport's ninth work
stoppage.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a story in Monday's editions of The Times, Don Fehr,
executive director of the union, informed players in a memorandum a
date had not been selected, according to a union source. Moreover,
Fehr, continuing his tour of all 30 clubs to update players on the
status of negotiations and the union's strategy, stated the executive
board had not determined it would be necessary to set a date.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to The Times, a national sports magazine recently
reported on its Web site that Sept. 16 is the "leading strike date
under consideration by the players' association." Players are
strongly considering walking out Sept. 16 because of financial and
public-relations issues, sources reaffirmed Monday, though at least
one high-ranking union official is said to favor an August date.</LD>
<TE>   Under a Sept. 16 strike plan, players, paid on the 15th and 30th
of each month, would miss only their final regular-season paycheck.
They would also wipe out big late-season crowds, costing
pennant-contending clubs a lot in lost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Sept. 11 issue. Baseball was credited with
helping the United States heal after the terrorist attacks, and
players are leery of shutting down the game before that date because
of the probable public backlash. A Sept. 16 strike date would also
give owners a window of about a week to save the postseason by
extending the season if a strike ended quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Commissioner Bud Selig, trying to reassure fans that
owners won't initiate a work stoppage this season, vowed not to lock
out players through the World Series. But Selig has made no mention
of what might happen after the postseason is completed, leaving the
door ajar for owners to unilaterally implement new work rules if
negotiations continue to lag, prompting the union to consider playing
its main bargaining chip.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is not surprising the union would distance itself from
any reported strike date, trying to avoid the perception of militancy
with financial issues finally on the table. Negotiations are expected
to intensify in the next few weeks as the sides work to reach an
agreement to replace the contract that expired Nov. 7, hoping to
avoid shutting down the game again.</TE>
<TE>   Owners, claiming teams are in dire financial straits, have
proposed significant economic changes, including increased revenue
sharing among the clubs and a luxury tax on teams with high payrolls.
The high-revenue clubs transferred $167 million to the lower-revenue
clubs last year, and the owners are now seeking to transfer about
$298 million from the high-revenue teams. The union is at $228
million.</TE>
<TE>   Players are typically distrustful of owners' cry of poor, and are
not in agreement about baseball's supposed competitive-balance
problem. The union is against siphoning resources from high-revenue
teams that they might otherwise invest in player salaries, and is
vehemently opposed to a luxury tax that would slow the increase in
salaries and player movement.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Baker Traded to the Celtics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics acquired forward Vin Baker from Seattle on Monday
in a five-player deal that sent point guard Kenny Anderson to the
SuperSonics.</LD>
<LD>   The Celtics also received guard Shammond Williams and traded
center Vitaly Potapenko and guard Joseph Forte to the SuperSonics.</LD>
<LD>   The deal brings Baker, 30, a nine-year NBA veteran, back to New
England. He was born in Connecticut and starred at the University of
Hartford.</LD>
<TE>   The Celtics hope it will revitalize the career of the 6-foot-11
Baker, who played in four consecutive All-Star games from 1995-98.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the marriage between Vin Baker and the Sonics really
had problems," SuperSonic Coach Nate McMillan said in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "He had lost his confidence out on the floor and just couldn't get
it back. We couldn't take another chance on bringing Vin back and
having him not want to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Without Anderson, Boston must find a starting point guard with
only Tony Delk, who backed up Anderson, playing that position. Erick
Strickland also played there, but he is a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Potapenko, 27, averaged 4.6 points last season and is recovering
from knee surgery. Forte, 21, played sparingly last season after
being drafted with the 21st pick.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 27, averaged 4.4 points in 50 games last season in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The key for the Celtics was Baker, who could play center in the
Eastern Conference. Tony Battie was Boston's starting center last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Baker has four years left on a contract that pays him more than
$50 million, a financial burden that makes it less likely the Celtics
would re-sign Rodney Rogers, a midseason acquisition who helped the
team's run to its first Eastern Conference final in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, 30, averaged 14.1 points and 6.4 rebounds last season, a
substantial decline from his years in Milwaukee where he once
averaged 21.1 points and 9.8 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, 31, averaged 9.6 points and 5.3 assists last season. He
is scheduled to earn $9.1 million in the final year of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Raptors rescinded their $3-million qualifying offer to
Keon Clark, making the 6-11 center an unrestricted free agent and
almost surely ending his two-year stay with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, 27, averaged 11.3 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocked
shots in the final year of his rookie contract, which paid him $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Keon deserves a fair contract," Raptor General Manager Glen
Grunwald said. "And a fair contract to Keon would turn into an unfair
contract for the Raptors because of the very likely additional
payments we would have to make for the luxury tax."</TE>
<TE>   As a restricted free agent, the Raptors could have matched any
offers for Clark. As an unrestricted free agent, Clark is free to
sign with any team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A judge issued a gag order in 76er guard Allen Iverson's assault
case in Philadelphia, saying he wanted to "buffer" prosecutors and
defense attorneys from intense media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal Court Judge James DeLeon barred police, the district
attorney's office, and the attorneys involved from talking to
reporters about Iverson's criminal case. He said he would revisit his
decision after Iverson's preliminary hearing, scheduled for July 29.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson is accused of storming into a cousin's apartment with a
gun and threatening two men while looking for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Buck forward Glenn Robinson apologized after being
released on $5,000 bail Sunday on domestic battery, assault and
illegal possession of a firearm charges in an apparent Saturday
incident with his former fiancee in Chicago Heights, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very sorry for the incident," said Robinson, who has an Aug.
19 preliminary hearing on the charges. "I regret any embarrassment to
my family, my friends, the Bucks organization and Bucks fans who have
supported me. I will do whatever is necessary to resolve this
situation and move forward."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran forward Danny Ferry, 36, re-signed with the San Antonio
Spurs.... Utah Jazz doctors discovered some weakness in the
reconstructed right knee of point guard Raul Lopez, but it wasn't
enough to prevent the Spanish prospect from passing a physical.</TE>

<HD>Hollins Will Be Eligible for UCLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Hollins, a 6-foot-11 center-forward from Pasadena Muir High,
will be eligible to play for the UCLA basketball team next season
because Saint Louis has granted him a full release from the letter of
intent he signed in November.</LD>
<LD>   Hollins decided not to attend Saint Louis when Coach Lorenzo Romar
left to become coach at Washington. He signed a grant-in-aid with
UCLA in June. Saint Louis originally gave him a qualified release,
meaning he would have had to sit out next season.</LD>
<LD>   Although the full release came Monday, Hollins might be asked to
be a redshirt unless sophomore forward Andre Patterson is
academically ineligible. Patterson, expected to be among UCLA's top

<HD>Schilling's 17th Victory Sets Him Apart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling got his 17th victory--four more than anyone else--and
Luis Gonzalez drove in four runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated
the Colorado Rockies, 5-1, Monday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez and Matt Williams homered for the Diamondbacks, who
maintained sole possession of first place in the National League
West.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (17-3) gave up one run and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings,
earning his 11th consecutive victory over a division opponent.</LD>
<TE>   He walked three--only the fifth time in 22 starts he has given up
more than one walk-- and struck out eight to finish with a major
league-leading 205 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   But Schilling needed help in the eighth, when he gave up singles
to Juan Pierre and Larry Walker before Mike Myers walked Todd Helton
to load the bases with one out.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Fetters retired Todd Zeile on an RBI groundout before Todd
Hollandsworth flied out.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling gave up a two-out hit to Todd Hollandsworth in the
seventh, then walked Juan Uribe and pinch-hitter Greg Norton before
pinch-hitter Terry Shumpert popped up.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has won seven in a row against Colorado in 14 starts
dating to a 4-1 loss at Coors Field on June 13, 1996, when he was
with Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hampton (5-12), who lost, 12-3, to Schilling and the
Diamondbacks on Wednesday in one of the worst starts of his career,
gave up three runs and five hits--including the homers by Williams
and Gonzalez--in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, San Francisco 3--Edgar Renteria hit a tiebreaking,
two-run double in the ninth inning as the Cardinals defeated the
Giants at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals survived a surprise pinch-hit appearance by Barry
Bonds with two out and a man on base in the ninth inning. Bonds, who
has been out since injuring his right hamstring Friday, limped to the
plate before striking out on a 3-2 pitch from Jason Isringhausen to
end the game.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis took the lead in the top half, breaking a 3-3 tie.
Placido Polanco led off with a double off Tim Worrell (7-1), who
intentionally walked Jim Edmonds and walked Albert Pujols to load the
bases.</TE>
<TE>   After Robb Nen relieved, Tino Martinez popped out to shortstop for
the first out before Renteria's shot to the wall in right field
scored Polanco and Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Cincinnati 5--Ken Griffey Jr. returned to the Red
lineup with two singles and a sacrifice fly, but Brian Giles tripled
and homered as the Pirates took an early lead and held on at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, out with a pulled hamstring since June 24, only jogged
after he hit the ball and went two for three with a walk and a
seventh-inning sacrifice fly to the warning track.</TE>
<TE>   While they waited for Texas starter Kenny Rogers to decide whether
he would accept a trade to Cincinnati, the Reds watched Ryan Dempster
(5-11) get rocked for the third time since he arrived in a deal with
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 2, Atlanta 1--A.J. Burnett gave up a run in six innings at
Miami as the Marlins handed Greg Maddux his first loss in 16 starts
and ended the Braves' six-game winning streak while winning their
fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (9-3) lost for the first time since April 30. Since then,
he was 7-0 with a 2.28 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Montreal 2--Pinch-hitter Marco Scutaro made a name for
himself at Shea Stadium with his first major league hit, a two-run
triple off Tomo Ohka (8-5) that broke a seventh-inning tie and sent
the Mets to victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, scrambling back into the NL wild-card race, won for the
seventh time in nine games. Mo Vaughn hit his 15th homer, David
Weathers (4-3) got the victory and Armando Benitez closed for his
24th save.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Philadelphia 6--Sammy Sosa hit his 30th homer and
singled home the tying run during a ninth-inning rally as the Cubs
won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Fred McGriff hit a game-winning RBI double for the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Abreu put the Phillies ahead, 6-5, with a ninth-inning homer
off Kyle Farnsworth (3-1), helping Philadelphia overcome a 5-0
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, Milwaukee 1--Wade Miller pitched seven strong innings
at Houston to defeat the Brewers for the 10th time in 11 decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Miller (7-3) retired 14 of the first 16 hitters and didn't allow a
baserunner to advance past first until the sixth. He gave up one run
and six hits to improve his ERA to 2.63 against the Brewers.</TE>

<HD>A Charming Prince Is Lost</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Bin Salman, an influential owner popular
within the sport, dies of heart attack at 43.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barely a month after his prized colt stumbled from the gate in the
Belmont Stakes, losing his bid to win a Triple Crown, influential
horse owner Prince Ahmed bin Salman died Monday of a heart attack in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He was 43.</LD>
<LD>   A major figure on the thoroughbred scene, Bin Salman operated from
a well-appointed farm near Santa Anita, using the wealth he
accumulated as an international publisher to acquire and train the
best young horses. War Emblem made him the first Arab to own a
Kentucky Derby winner.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, the prince faced occasional anti-Arab sentiments
and complaints that he was buying his way into the winner's circle.
When he failed to show up at the Belmont, citing "family
obligations," many wondered if it was in reaction to the criticisms.</LD>
<TE>   About that time, he reportedly began complaining of stomach
problems and visited the hospital off and on the final six weeks of
his life. The Daily Racing Form reported that Bin Salman had minor
surgery three days ago. The prince's private secretary was quoted as
saying that the surgery was unrelated to the ailment that led to his
death.</TE>
<TE>   As the racing world expressed its shock, acquaintances recalled
him as an elegant man with clipped mustache and pocket handkerchief,
unexpectedly casual for a member of Saudi royalty and devoted to
racing.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people brought as much passion, excitement and joy to
the game as he did," trainer Wayne Lukas said. "He not only enjoyed
himself, but he wanted everybody around him to enjoy themselves."</TE>
<TE>   A son of Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, the powerful governor of
Riyadh, Bin Salman came to the United States as a young man. Studying
comparative culture at UC Irvine in the early 1980s, he worked with
local trainer Richard Mulhall to assemble a modest stable.</TE>
<TE>   For years, racing took a backseat to his subsequent duties as
chairman of Saudi Research &amp; Marketing Ltd., whose holdings include
the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat, among the world's leading Arabic
newspapers. But after helping build the company into a major
publisher, Bin Salman returned to horses with zeal.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, he hired Mulhall to run his newly formed
Thoroughbred Corp. and they became regulars at auctions across the
nation. Among their early purchases was Sharp Cat, a filly that
eventually won $2 million in purses. More victories came with
Officer, Spain and Anees, who won the 1999 Breeders' Cup Juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps his best horse was Point Given, which won the Preakness
and Belmont while helping Thoroughbred Corp. rank second in North
America with $8 million in purses last year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all Bin Salman's success, a small circle of friends knew
him equally well for his sense of humor. He spoke of War Emblem being
his best investment since oil. Mentioning his wife at an awards
ceremony, he slyly informed the American audience that he had only
one.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, you hear he's a prince and you don't know how to talk
to him," said Victor Espinoza, the jockey who rode War Emblem. "But
he was like any other guy. A very nice person. When you were talking
to him, you didn't think you were talking to a prince."</TE>
<TE>   So friends were dismayed by the grumbling that accompanied his bid
for the Triple Crown, which no horse has won since Affirmed in 1978.
Critics pointed out that Bin Salman bought War Emblem for $900,000
just three weeks before the Derby, which hardly fit the traditional
mode of nurturing a talented yearling. As the jet-black colt
continued to win, Bin Salman had to contend with the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Breslin, the well-known columnist, urged him to stay away
from the Belmont in Elmont, N.Y., and other newspaper stories made
references to high gas prices and the fact that most of the hijackers
held Saudi passports.</TE>
<TE>   Still, acquaintances said he was ecstatic. And if he was beginning
to suffer from physical ailments, few in the racing community seemed
to know. Trainer Wally Dollase recalled that Bin Salman's eldest
brother, Prince Fahd, died of a heart attack last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe," Dollase said after hearing of Bin Salman's
similar demise. "It's a big loss to our game."</TE>

<LD>One year from today Our Team will take the field for the first time
at Cal State Dominguez Hills to conduct training camp, so you know
me, I thought it would be nice to spend some quality time with Our
Chargers on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   I could be mistaken, but at first the boys didn't seem too excited
to see me.</LD>
<LD>   I had worn my Dodger baseball cap, however, and "The Riviera
Country Club" free shirt I received from the Los Angeles Sports &amp;
Entertainment Commission in exchange for wearing the Commission's
name on my left sleeve, and I think Our Guys warmed up to the L.A.
billboard look, and began to understand I'm really a homer at heart.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time I almost ran over Doug Flutie, and let that be a
lesson to everyone to watch where you step. It's a wonder Tom Thumb
lasted as long as he did. Now just in case there were any hard
feelings from previous meetings, I told the Mission Bay Shrimp, "It
looks to me like you've grown a little since I saw you last."</TE>
<TE>   I know when I tell the wife she looks like she's lost some weight
since her last meal, she becomes unusually friendly. So I lied to
Flutie, too, and after looking himself over, he told me he might very
well be a little taller, which for him was an unusually friendly
response.</TE>
<TE>   With all the love in the air, I was beginning to feel like John
Fricke on Fox's nightly sports gush, but I didn't go so far as to hug
Flutie or offer to give him a piggy-back ride. There's no reason to
steal Fricke's entire act.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW AS you know, Our Team has been pretty crummy of late, going
6-26 the last two years. So I asked Coach Marty Schottenheimer if he
could get Our Guys playing better by the time they come to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?" said Schottenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   "That big city up north," I said, and if he doesn't know where
L.A. is located, I worry the Chargers will never be able to find the
end zones under this guy's direction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHARGER HISTORY begins in Los Angeles, of course, before they
moved to San Diego, and long before the Spanos Goofs became owners.
The folks in San Diego aren't very fond of the Spanos Goofs, which
tells me they've gotten to really know them.</TE>
<TE>   But since the Chargers are about to become Our Team, I thought I'd
talk to one of the Goofs--the one who was banned from playing in Bing
Crosby's old golf tournament because folks believed he was cheating
when reporting his handicap.</TE>
<TE>   I thought I might get into his good graces promising not to alert
our private clubs that a potential cheater was about to move to town.
But I got the impression from a Charger spokesman that if anyone got
an interview with Dean Spanos or a chance to caddie for him, it would
be Fricke.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting, isn't it, that Dean Spanos and Philip Anschutz's
point man, Tim LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke, might be the twosome to do
the deal to bring the Chargers to L.A. Sure hope someone is checking
the fine print.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CHARGERS have been practicing here in Shangri-La for the last
27 years on mornings so cool a sweater is required. It's considered
the best camp environment in the NFL. They spent $1.1 million to
upgrade the training facilities at UCSD and now $1 a year to conduct
camp here.</TE>
<TE>   There's a permanent grandstand available for San Diego area fans
to watch both practice fields in comfort, and yet the team has
decided to leave here for the heat and pollution of Carson. The last
person I know who was hellbent on going to Carson was Michael Ovitz,
and look what has happened to him.</TE>
<TE>   Charger General Manager John Butler said the team is going to
Carson to get away from San Diego and bond better as a team. No one
in San Diego believes a word Butler has to say about anything, which
will make conversations with LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke, in the future
very interesting.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, of course, is the team is positioning itself to get a
new stadium from San Diego or a new home in Los Angeles, and is
willing to throw a scare into Charger fans by moving the camp north.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers will be Our Team each summer from now on, and might
become Our Team permanently after 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer, of course, has no idea where L.A. is right now,
but if he thought "The Drive" was a bummer while coaching in
Cleveland, wait until he makes the drive to Cal State Dominguez Hills
regularly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to the Dodger-Padre game in Qualcomm Stadium, and you know
how they have that 10-run mercy rule in Little League? Well, more and
more that's what Sept. 16th is beginning to look like for the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MANAGER JIM Tracy said Kevin Brown threw about 60 pitches at
Dodger Stadium on Monday. When I asked if Brown would be using the
private plane the Dodgers are obligated to provide him when he
wants--to fly to San Diego and join the team, Tracy said, "I don't
know if she's running tonight." I'm guessing that was a "no."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I saw Commissioner Bud Selig and astronaut John Glenn sitting
next to each other during the Ted Williams ceremony at Fenway Park, I
figured they just put the space cadets together.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Steve Gandolfo:</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason I continue to read your column on page two is to
find out if someone in the Dodger clubhouse has knocked you out yet.
Hopefully I won't have to read much longer."</TE>
<TE>   The way the Dodgers are going, if someone takes a swing--they'll
miss.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Coach Is Critical of Pele</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an extraordinary interview, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Brazil's World
Cup-winning coach, has blasted Pele, saying that the man generally
acknowledged as the greatest player of all time "knows nothing" about
soccer.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Scolari told Chile's La Tercera newspaper, Brazil's
players did not want to receive the World Cup trophy from Pele after
they had beaten Germany, 2-0, in the June 30 final at Yokohama,
Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Scolari's comments appeared in an interview published Sunday and
apparently were in reaction to pre-World Cup criticism of the coach
and his team by Pele.</LD>
<TE>   "If you talk badly about one person five times, you can't expect
that person to like you afterward," Scolari said. "I believe that
Pele knows nothing about football.</TE>
<TE>   "He has done nothing as a coach and all his analyses always turn
out to be wrong. If you want to win a title, you have to listen to
Pele and then do the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   "Pele did not believe in the players, nor in the coach, nor in
Brazil's tactics. The players and the national team staff knew that
if Pele turned up there [in the team's camp], he would not be
welcome. He was at the trophy ceremony because he is the best player
in the history of football, he is an idol in all of Brazil, but his
analyses are worth nothing."</TE>
<TE>   In May, just weeks before the tournament began, Pele, a World Cup
winner in 1958, '62 and '70, said he did not believe Brazil had a
chance to win the title. "[Brazil's players] are not at their best at
the moment, and I do not think they will have a good World Cup," he
said. "I think the favorites are Argentina, France, Italy and
Portugal."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, France and Portugal were eliminated in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Quintanilla to D.C. United</TE>
<TE>   Teenage striker Eliseo Quintanilla of El Salvador Monday has been
signed by D.C. United of Major League Soccer. Quintanilla, 19, is a
left-sided forward who made his professional debut in the Salvadoran
league at age 16 and his national team debut a year later. He will be
eligible for MLS play once he obtains a work visa.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand Completes Move</TE>
<TE>   Rio Ferdinand, the world's most expensive defender and fifth-most
expensive player of all time, signed a five-year contract with
Manchester United after passing a medical and agreeing to personal
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United paid Leeds United $47.27 million for the England
national team defender and revealed Monday that the figure could rise
as high as $52.47 million depending on the team's performance with
Ferdinand in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bold step, but I'm happy to be here," Ferdinand, 23,
said. "It wasn't an easy decision. I spoke to my family about
loyalty, but at the end of the day it's a short career and
opportunities like this don't come around all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to sit at the end of my career and think I could
have done this or that. I thought of how I could improve myself as a
player, and this was a step in the right direction for me."</TE>
<TE>   Stumpf Out in Germany</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard Stumpf became the first coach to lose his job during the
new German season. Stumpf was fired by Kaiserslautern, the team he
coached to seventh place in the Bundesliga last season. No reason was
given for the dismissal of the 40-year-old, who had been
Kaiserslautern's coach since October 2000 and whose contract still
had two years to run.</TE>
<TE>   Zico Takes Over in Japan</TE>
<TE>   After officially being announced as Japan's new national team
coach Saturday, former Brazilian standout Zico Monday outlined his
plans for the team, saying that his choice of players will be based
on form and ability, not reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is fair to say that the World Cup squad will be my base, with
maybe two or three changes," he said in Tokyo. "But it is up to those
players to maintain that level and keep on trying to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "Football is all about timing, and I will choose my squad based on
which players are performing at the required level at that time. Just
because someone plays in Europe doesn't mean he has an automatic
right to wear the Japan shirt. He still needs to prove to me that he
deserves to be picked."</TE>
<TE>   Zico, 49, signed an 11-month contract with the Japanese Football
Assn. worth an estimated $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Exhibition Tonight</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy will play its reserve team, the Orange County Blue Star
of the Premier Development League, in an exhibition at Santa Ana
Stadium tonight at 7:30. Gates open at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10 for
adults, $7 for children.</TE>

<HD>Leslie Record Sounds Good</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Spark center has 24 points and 21 rebounds as she
reaches milestone of 3,000 points in win over Orlando.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa Leslie has set another gold standard in her remarkable career.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday the Sparks' center became the first WNBA player to reach
3,000 points during the Sparks' 92-84 victory over the Orlando Magic.</LD>
<LD>   Leslie, who had 24 points, 21 rebounds (tying her team and league
record) and a career-high eight assists, reached the milestone at
12:14 in the second half when she put in her own missed shot, sending
the 12,231 fans at Staples Center into a frenzy. After a timeout,
Leslie received another ovation as she was given the game ball, and
she raced across the court to give it to her mother Christina, who
was sitting courtside.</LD>
<TE>   "It was kinda weird; they gave me the ball, but we still had to
play," Leslie said. "But then I figured I'd give it to my mom. It's
her birthday tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, who had "no idea at all" she was that close to 3,000
points, tried to reflect on her accomplishment, but felt it was a
little soon. "It's nice because I've been here since the league
started," she said. "Let's see in another six years, if I'm handing
[the record] off to someone else. But it's nice being the first one.
It's cool."</TE>
<TE>   If Leslie, who now has 3,005 points and counting, was uncertain
how to appreciate the moment, Tamecka Dixon--who like Leslie is an
original Spark--had no problem.</TE>
<TE>   "What an accomplishment," said Dixon, who had 12 points, one of
five Sparks in double figures. "And it's well deserved. If anybody
should do it, she should.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if she was aware of it. She didn't play that way.
She took shots when they were available and didn't force anything.
She was very under control."</TE>
<TE>   The victory, and Leslie's night, obscured the fact the 18-4
Sparks--playing again without Latasha Byears, who is recovering from
a stress fracture in the right knee--nearly let the game slip away.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 85-66, with 7:03 to play, Los Angeles was outscored by
the Miracle, 18-3, over the next 4:34. But 88-84 was as close as
Orlando (10-12) got. DeLisha Milton and Leslie each made a pair of
free throws to close out the game.</TE>
<TE>   Milton finished with 16 points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika had 20 points, and reserve Sophia Witherspoon had 15,
tying the team record by making five (of 11) three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good win for us," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "We
had a couple of lapses, and I wanted to get Lisa out of the game, so
she could hear the crowd. But the acknowledgment wouldn't mean
anything if we didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   This figured to be a good game for Leslie to reach the 3,000-point
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks, at home since defeating Cleveland on Saturday, were
catching an Orlando team that had lost Sunday night in Sacramento. In
that loss, starters Shannon Johnson, Wendy Palmer and Nykesha Sales
had each played 36 or more minutes. And the visitors came into the
contest having lost six consecutive road games.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles did grab a 17-8 lead at the 14:17 mark. But the Sparks
have had a nagging tendency this season to get out of sync with bad
passes and rushed shots. It cropped up again as Orlando rolled out a
17-5 spurt to move in front, 25-22, and the Sparks spent the
remainder of the half catching up.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who scored 22 points, frustrated the Sparks with her
quickness, and Sales, who also had 22, kept L.A. on edge with her
ability to launch a shot from anywhere on the floor. When the Sparks
tried to clamp down on those two, Palmer (17 points) was effective
inside the lane.</TE>
<TE>   But Leslie, who had 15 points and 12 rebounds by the half, Milton
and Mabika rallied the Sparks to a 52-45 lead at the half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA news:</TE>
<TE>   Tari Phillips scored 10 of her 15 points in the first half as the
host New York Liberty (14-9) scored a 73-52 victory over the
Cleveland Rockers (8-14) before 13,719 at Madison Square Garden....
The Indiana Fever (9-13) used two free throws in the final seconds by
Olympia Scott-Richardson for a 73-72 victory over the Charlotte Sting
(13-9) before 6,115 at Indianapolis. The Sting activated forward
Shalonda Enis, who missed the first 21 games after her son's
birth.... The Seattle Storm traded guard Semeka Randall to the Utah
Starzz for guard-forward Kate Starbird. Utah's Natalie Williams will
miss tonight's game at Detroit to attend her grandmother's funeral.</TE>

<HD>Quick Exit for Chang</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Three-set loss to Gambill at UCLA is reminder of
how career comes full circle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Michael Chang, the twilight is amazingly similar to the dawn of
his career. He wasn't expected to win many matches at the start, and
now, about a decade and a half later, it's almost the same way.</LD>
<LD>   He has watched the losses accumulate--11 first-round exits in
2002. He has heard the word in the locker room, that his colleagues
no longer fear him and his 30-year-old legs on the court. And he has
seen the faces in the media room as the questions sound more
skeptical each month.</LD>
<LD>   Chang even had to chuckle about the last development, and he came
tantalizingly close to using a colorful description after his
three-set loss to Jan-Michael Gambill on Monday in the first round of
the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   Being Chang, he didn't and trailed off.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys must think I'm one really stubborn ... " he said,
laughing. "I still have a lot of hope."</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what he would have said? But Chang, ranked 106th, was in
a deeply reflective mood after 53rd-ranked Gambill defeated him, 4-6,
6-2, 7-6 (7), in 2 hours 20 minutes. Gambill led, 3-0, in the third
set before Chang fought back in characteristic fashion. In the
tiebreaker, Chang fought off two match points before Gambill won it
on the third, serving and volleying.</TE>
<TE>   The highest seeded player in action, No. 4 Andy Roddick, also
needed to go three sets. Roddick served 20 aces in his 6-7 (5), 6-1,
6-2 victory against Hyung-Taik Lee of South Korea. It was Roddick's
first tournament action since losing in the third round at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to feel like you're in the tournament," said
Roddick, who improved to 5-0 against Lee. "I was in the trenches
today. I had a tough match. I like starting off the tournament like
that."</TE>
<TE>   The longest singles match of the day was between Chang and
Gambill, a rematch of the 2000 final here, which Chang won after
Gambill retired because of injuries. It was the last tournament title
for Chang, but it should be noted he has won a title more recently
than Pete Sampras, whose last championship was at Wimbledon in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill, who has had struggles of his own this last year, compared
Chang to Sampras. He still spoke highly of Chang, calling him "a
great player," but stated the obvious after what has been a long and
prolonged slide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the same thing you see with Pete Sampras," Gambill
said. "The one thing both of those guys had over a lot of guys was
the fear factor. The fear factor is gone. Nobody has the fear factor
of Michael Chang anymore. Obviously, Sampras' is subdued a little
bit. That's one thing.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play a guy you have a fear factor of, you think it's so
hard to win games. You might already lose the first game for no
reason because you think they're so good."</TE>
<TE>   Chang bristled a bit when first told of Gambill's comment. He
understood when it was put into context later on.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the pressure is off for me," he said. "Playing these
events, players say, 'Well, we don't need to be afraid of Chang.'
Then again, nobody wants to lose to me either. Realistically, I think
people know it's a tough road for me. They don't want to lose to me.
It's gone back to the time when I was very young. Nobody wants to
lose to a 15-, 16-, 17-year-old. Nobody wants to really lose to
somebody who's in the twilight of his career."</TE>
<TE>   Chang spoke about breaking down in tears after losing to a
qualifier, James Sekulov of Australia, in 1999 at UCLA in the
quarterfinals. After that match, he spoke about quitting to his
father, Joe, and his coach and brother Carl. But he's still around.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, Chang said he and his brother have even discussed making
a coaching change but nothing has come to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I've talked about with Carl," Chang said. "We
thought about different possibilities. Carl has a tremendous love for
me. When it comes to tennis, he's really able to put aside his pride,
'Look, Michael if there's somebody else out there that can help you
to do better. I think we need to look at it.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another well-known tennis family observed a family milestone on
Monday. Cousins Prakash Amritraj and Stephen Amritraj won their first
ATP doubles match, beating George Bastl of Switzerland and Sandon
Stolle of Australia, 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2. Their proud fathers, brothers
Anand and Vijay were on hand and beaming afterward and thought it was
cosmic fate considering they won this tournament in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Prakash just finished his freshman year at USC, helping lead the
Trojans to the NCAA team title. Monday morning, he called Coach Dick
Leach, who retired after this season, to tell him they were playing a
former Trojan player, Bastl and Stolle.</TE>
<TE>   "He started laughing at me, he said, 'Good luck,' " Prakash said.
"So I'm going to call him and tell him we won. He better be sitting
down. He might have a heart attack."</TE>

<HD>He Was the Original American in Paris</HD>
<DH>Cycling: U.S. riders are common in Tour de France today; 21
years ago, Boyer was the first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHATEAU-THIERRY, France</DL>
<LD>Now that so many American riders figure prominently in the Tour de
France, it's easy to forget they were unheard of until the early
1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Self-effacing Jonathan "Jock" Boyer broke the barrier with little
fanfare in 1981. He was part of a winning Tour team that same year
and completed five Tours, finishing as high as 12th in the overall
standings.</LD>
<LD>   Boyer rolled with the pack in what many consider cycling's golden
era. His career spanned those of greats Eddy Merckx, Miguel Indurain
and Bernard Hinault, whom Boyer helped to the third of his five Tour
victories.</LD>
<TE>   The two continue to converse on the phone and exchange birthday
and holiday cards every year.</TE>
<TE>   "As a teammate he was golden," said Hinault, who works as a
goodwill ambassador for the Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of us. We didn't treat him any better or any worse
because he was American. He spoke French fluently and he had already
raced in France for some time, so that helped his integration into
the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing but good memories of him."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer, 46, was born in Utah and grew up in Carmel. His middle name
is Swift--as in Swift Premium--and his great-grandfather, Arthur
Leonard, was president of the Chicago stockyards.</TE>
<TE>   But Boyer's family wasn't particularly wealthy, and when he
decided he wanted to plunge into European cycling at 17, he worked as
a waiter to earn his passage.</TE>
<TE>   He also took an immersion course in French, seven hours a day for
nine weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I really was determined to get away from home and do my own
thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer raced as an amateur in France from 1973 to 1977 before
turning pro. His fellow riders were curious about his background, he
said, but didn't treat him like a freak.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I had a French name and had raced for French teams
made them a little more accepting," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if I did well, I'd keep going. If not, I'd go home. I
kept doing better."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer's career almost ended when he contracted a virulent stomach
bug at the 1978 world championships in Venezuela. He wasted to 125
pounds on a 6-foot frame and was forced to return to California to
recuperate. He became a vegetarian in response.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me two years to get that out of my system," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   When he came back to cycling, it was in a big way--with the
Renault-Gitane team led by Hinault. Boyer, then the U.S. pro
champion, wore a stars-and-stripes jersey in the team's winning
effort and finished 32nd overall. He was 23rd, 12th and 31st in three
subsequent Tours with another French team.</TE>
<TE>   Depleted by illness, he finished 98th in his swan song with the
U.S.-based 7-11 squad in 1987. Boyer also rode in three Tours of
Italy and placed fifth in the 1980 worlds.</TE>
<TE>   His most vivid memories are of the camaraderie among riders.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody escapes suffering," Boyer said, using cycling's term for
burning legs and lungs, "so it's a close-knit group."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer, now runs a wholesale bike distribution business out of an
old helicopter hangar in Marina, north of Monterey. He does not own a
television, and follows the Tour on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I got tired of living over there," Boyer said of his 20 years as
an expatriate. "But it was an amazing experience, and I cherish those
years."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Ends USC's Hopes of Playing in Rainbow Classic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Ohio judge's decision Friday to uphold the NCAA's "two-in-four"
rule for the coming season officially ended the USC men's basketball
team's hopes of playing in the Rainbow Classic in December, an event
the Trojans had tentatively scheduled anticipating a favorable
ruling.</LD>
<LD>   USC officials, though, claim that they had pulled out of the
three-day Hawaii holiday tournament well in advance of Judge Edmund
A. Sargus Jr.'s ruling in favor of the NCAA.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, the Trojans are looking to fill a one-game hole in
their schedule for this season three months before practice begins.</LD>
<TE>   "We're basically set with the schedule and there are no worries,"
USC senior associate athletic director Daryl Gross said. "It doesn't
matter if we play four years in a row in Hawaii or twice every four
years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been very comfortable with the two-in-four rule and
I'm sure we'll get a quality opponent for that last date."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge has been mentioned as a possible opponent and
had been on USC's tentative schedule earlier this summer.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit by a coalition of exempt events--multi-game events that
are counted as only one game toward a school's maximum allowance of
28 games in a regular season--hoped to change the NCAA's two-in-four
rule, allowing teams to play in such affairs every season if they
wanted, instead of two every four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The events' promoters claimed that with a number of teams already
having exhausted their exemptions over the last two years, the rule
put their events in jeopardy of going out of business with a shortage
of teams.</TE>
<TE>   USC, for example, already has played in two such exempt events,
the Yahoo Sports Invitational in 2000-01 and the Preseason NIT last
season.</TE>
<TE>   But Sargus wanted to see more evidence that events were in
peril--such as some actually folding--before ruling that the rule
violated antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   Several schools had held spots open in their schedules waiting for
the ruling and many tournaments are now scrambling to fill out their
fields.</TE>
<TE>   USC's tentative schedule includes nonconference games against
Missouri, which reached the Elite Eight last season, in the Wooden
Classic on Dec. 7, Ivy League champion Pennsylvania on Jan. 11 at the
Forum and at Mountain West Conference tournament runner-up Nevada Las
Vegas on Feb. 9.</TE>

<HD>Red Sox, Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Thousands attend two ceremonies at Boston's
Fenway Park honoring Hall of Famer Ted Williams, who died July 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Nine white doves took flight from home plate toward Fenway Park's
famous Green Monster, soaring over the outfield where Ted Williams
once roamed before turning and climbing over the Red Sox dugout and
out of the ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   Then, one by one, current and former Red Sox players took their
positions on the field--leaving left field empty except for a garland
of white carnations in the shape of a "9."</LD>
<LD>   With a wave from shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, they all headed to
Williams' former domain to say goodbye.</LD>
<TE>   The Hub bid the Kid adieu a final time Monday, as Red Sox fans
came by the thousands to pay their respects to the team's greatest
player at two events honoring the baseball and war hero.</TE>
<TE>   About 12,000 people came to the ballpark in the morning to meander
around the warning track past mementos of Williams' Hall of Fame
career. At night, those artifacts came to life in the form of Red Sox
greats from Carl Yastrzemski to Garciaparra and dignitaries such as
John Glenn, the former senator and astronaut and Williams' squadron
leader in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Just saying his name means excellence in baseball," said Glenn,
who flew more than a dozen missions with Williams. "For me, Ted also
stood for excellence in a setting far removed from baseball and for
which he is less well-known.... He never held back."</TE>
<TE>   About 20,500 people bought tickets for the star-studded service to
remember Williams, who died July 5, and forget the fight among his
children over whether to have his remains cremated or preserved in
cryonic ice. (Williams' three children declined an invitation to
attend.)</TE>
<TE>   The subject was broached only by former teammate and longtime
friend Dom DiMaggio, who drew a standing ovation when he broke from
the program with an impassioned plea to scatter Williams' ashes over
his favorite fishing spot, the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' life was celebrated, with nine "innings" dedicated to
No. 9, touching on his life as a rookie who proclaimed his goal to be
known as "the greatest hitter who ever lived"; a veteran of two wars;
a tireless charity fund-raiser and an elder statesman who was
inducted into the baseball and fishing halls of fame.</TE>
<TE>   Fans entering the ballpark for the evening tribute were given a
folder with Williams' stats, a postcard of his Cooperstown plaque and
a copy of John Updike's New Yorker story, "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu."</TE>
<TE>   The park was decorated with memories of Williams' life and career.
Banners covered the Green Monster to illustrate three of his
passions: hitting, serving in the Marines and talking to kids with
cancer. Proceeds of the evening event were donated to the Jimmy Fund,
Williams' favorite charity.</TE>
<TE>   Stenciled in the infield dirt were the numbers .406, Williams'
batting average in 1941; 521, his home run total and "USMC." Williams
spent five years fighting in two wars.</TE>
<TE>   For five hours in the morning, a steady stream of fans and even
Red Sox first baseman Brian Daubach filed in under a blazing sun to
walk along the warning track and see artifacts of Williams' career.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' Hall of Fame plaque was affixed to the left-field wall,
which also featured a picture gallery of Williams' career. The
scoreboard video screen played highlights of Williams' career and
testimonials from friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox chose to finish the program with broadcaster Curt
Gowdy's description of Williams' final at-bats Sept. 28, 1960. With
former Oriole pitcher Jack Fisher on the mound, Gowdy called
Williams' final homer.</TE>
<TE>   "What a way to go out."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Soldiers Now Guarding Afghan Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. soldiers have replaced Afghan guards providing security for
President Hamid Karzai, reflecting growing concern for government
leaders' safety in the war-torn country, the Pentagon said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes after the recent assassination of an Afghan vice
president, and Pentagon officials said it underscores the United
States' commitment to protecting the still-wobbly transitional
government.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, it is important for that country that the outcome of the
loya jirga not be negated by violence," Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said, referring to the recently concluded grand council to
select Afghanistan's interim leaders.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said that he was unaware of specific threats to Karzai
but that Afghanistan remains an unstable country "where people get
killed."</TE>
<TE>   The assignment of U.S. soldiers, requested by Karzai, comes as the
United States seeks to strike a balance between fostering Afghan
self-sufficiency and ensuring that the country's first democratic
steps in four decades don't falter.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has gone to great lengths to restrict its role
in the fledgling government, lest it create the appearance that
Karzai and his Cabinet are Western puppets.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials stressed that American forces were not involved in
providing security for the loya jirga, for instance, a task that fell
to an international security force led by British soldiers. Turkey is
now in charge of the international peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has also been training recruits for a new Afghan
army. The first battalion of Afghan soldiers is set to complete its
initial training today, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But the risks of relying too heavily on the Karzai government to
protect itself became clear earlier this month when a pair of gunmen
assassinated Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir in broad daylight as he
drove away from his office in Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   That followed another incident in February, when Air
Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman was killed at the
airport in Kabul during a melee involving a mob of Muslim pilgrims
angered by flight delays.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he does not expect the United States to continue
providing security for Karzai beyond the next several months.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at it as a relatively short-term matter," he said, noting
that the United States will also help train Afghan bodyguards for
Karzai and other government officials.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, Rumsfeld said an important operative in the Al
Qaeda terrorist network may be among "several handfuls" of detainees
captured by Pakistani forces in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld did not name the detainee but said he appears to have had
some responsibility for financial matters in Al Qaeda. Rumsfeld
stressed that the prisoner's identity and role had not been
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   All told, U.S. forces and allied partners have "rounded up some
600 terrorists in Afghanistan" since the start of the war nine months
ago, and hundreds more worldwide, Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld acknowledged that the United States is not certain of the
whereabouts of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, or even whether he
survived the war.</TE>
<TE>   "He's either dead, which is fine from our standpoint," Rumsfeld
said, "or he's alive and for some reason decides he does not want to
live up to his reputation as enjoying going on videos and letting the
world know that he's alive."</TE>

<HD>1 Killed, 2 Injured in N. Ireland Shootings</HD>

<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>A Protestant extremist shot a 19-year-old Catholic to death as he
walked home from a Belfast pub early Monday, after a night of
violence that saw two other men wounded in shootings.</LD>
<LD>   The Ulster Defense Assn., Northern Ireland's biggest outlawed
anti-Catholic group, claimed responsibility for several attacks,
including 19-year-old Gerald Lawlor's killing, in a message that
threatened further violence.</LD>
<LD>   Lawlor left behind his parents, four brothers, a girlfriend and a
toddler son--and a community wondering how to stop an upsurge in
street violence.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going back to the way it was back in the early '70s. My
parents told me all about it," said Rory Stewart, one of several
friends who gathered at the bouquet-covered street corner where
Lawlor died.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a summer of street turmoil, Lawlor's was the first fatal
shooting in Belfast since January, when Protestant extremists killed
a Catholic postman. That slaying inspired large-scale demonstrations
supporting the British province's 1998 peace accord.</TE>
<TE>   The UDA, which is supposed to be observing a truce in support of
the peace pact, claimed its attacks represented "a measured military
response" to attacks by the Irish Republican Army.</TE>
<TE>   "We warn republicans that further attacks on our community will be
met with further military action," the group said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Lawlor was slain, a gunman shot a 30-year-old Catholic man
in the leg. Protestants insisted that Catholic militants provoked the
trouble. The first person shot Sunday night was 19-year-old
Protestant Mark Blaney, who was attacked in a Catholic neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>Annan Taps Brazilian for Top Rights Post</HD>
<DH>U.N.: Sergio Vieira de Mello's closed-door diplomacy style
is a contrast to the strong criticism of current chief Mary Robinson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A career U.N. diplomat from Brazil will be named the U.N. human
rights chief today, replacing Mary Robinson, the outspoken former
Irish president who rankled the United States with her persistent
questioning of its counter-terrorism tactics and angered China and
Russia by condemning their suppression of separatists.</LD>
<LD>   The nomination of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a 54-year-old Brazilian
who has served in a succession of U.N. posts for the past 33 years,
was announced by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday and scheduled
to be approved by the General Assembly today. Robinson agreed to step
down after five years as the U.N. high commissioner for human rights
when Annan and the Security Council powers made clear they did not
support her belated effort to have her term extended until 2005.</LD>
<LD>   Though Robinson announced her resignation herself, she
acknowledged in an interview last week that her departure is not
entirely voluntary.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt that if I were strongly urged to do so, it would be
difficult not to accept to stay on," Robinson said during a visit
here. "But I was also aware that there were certain resistances. And
my philosophy has been that I came in to do a job, not to keep a
job."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which kept its diplomatic distance as
several Asian and East European candidates vied for the position, was
pleased by Vieira de Mello's appointment, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position has basically been that anybody would be an
improvement," a State Department official who asked not be named said
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Though respected by peers for his skillful performance as head of
the recent U.N. missions in East Timor and Kosovo, Vieira de Mello is
not expected to undertake the high-profile campaigning that made
Robinson a heroine in international human rights circles but a target
for governments irked by her often caustic criticism. Like Annan
himself, Vieira de Mello is known for quiet but effective closed-door
diplomacy, and has been seen as a potential candidate for the
secretary-general's job after Annan retires.</TE>
<TE>   "[Vieira] de Mello brings to the job an impressive diplomatic and
U.N. background, but he lacks hands-on human rights experience," said
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. "The
challenge he faces is to prove that he will stand up to governments
and be a clear and resounding voice on behalf of the victims of human
rights abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had already soured on Robinson a year ago,
during the U.N. conference on racism in Durban, South Africa, which
she chaired. The administration held her responsible for an agenda
that became dominated by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with
criticism of Israel that in some instances verged, some complained,
on being anti-Semitic. Despite what she says was her effort to purge
conference documents of "offensive content," the U.S. and Israeli
delegations walked out of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson has also spoken out against the death penalty in the
United States and the U.S. rejection of several international
treaties backed by human rights advocates, most notably that
establishing the International Criminal Court.</TE>
<TE>   But it is her insistent questioning of aspects of the war on
terrorism after Sept. 11 that has won her the lasting enmity of
officials in Washington, U.S. diplomats and human rights advocates
concur. Robinson has repeatedly criticized the United States for the
detention of Afghan war prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; for
civilian casualties from the air war in Afghanistan; and for the
creation of special military tribunals for the prosecution of accused
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, after returning to her Geneva headquarters, Robinson
again decried "an erosion of civil liberties in the name of combating
terrorism," charging that repressive governments are defending their
own conduct by pointing to the interrogation and detention without
charges of Muslim immigrants in the United States and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting reports from human rights defenders, trade
unionists, journalists around the world that measures are being taken
by countries saying that they're combating terrorism but are in fact
clamping down on political opposition and freedom of the press,
branding activities as being terrorist which were not so described
before the 11th of September," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Robinson was appointed in 1997, she set out to do the kinds
of things the United Nations had expected her to do. In Guatemala and
Colombia, she called for the prosecution of death squad organizers,
both past and present. In Sierra Leone, she pushed for public
trials--now getting underway--of officers and politicians responsible
for massacres and other atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   She waded into the raging conflict in East Timor, bluntly
informing Indonesian army officers there that they could face war
crimes prosecutions for attacks on civilians--a warning that some
observers said was instrumental in securing Jakarta's reluctant
cooperation in the territory's transition to independence.</TE>
<TE>   But she also began going other places and bringing up other issues
that the U.N.'s powers-that-be had not anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, on her first visit to China, she infuriated her hosts by
demanding permission to travel through Tibet--a request the
government reluctantly granted. She has spoken out during return
trips to Beijing in defense of religious and political dissidents.
"Now they just expect it," she said. "In my last visit they said, 'We
know your habits.' "</TE>
<TE>   On repeated trips to Moscow, Robinson became what she says with
pride was "the toughest voice on Chechnya," publicly assailing
Russia's conduct in the war there.</TE>
<TE>   And she also blasted the treatment of refugees in places like
Italy, Denmark and Australia--countries even less accustomed than the
United States to human rights criticism from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "If you operate under a double standard, people see that very
quickly," Robinson said in the interview here.</TE>
<TE>   But Annan and other senior U.N. officials have seen some of
Robinson's public stands as a squandering of political capital,
according to U.N. insiders--and Annan sometimes felt blindsided by
Robinson's attacks on the Security Council powers, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Robinson surprised supporters and critics alike by
declaring her intention to leave at the end of her four-year term.
She says she grew frustrated with the limitations of the U.N.
bureaucracy--she didn't have full freedom to appoint her top aides,
she complains--and the U.N. treasury, which provides just a third of
her office's $50-million annual budget. (Donors give the rest.)</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, 2001, was to have been her last day--but she had already
agreed to stay on for an additional year, and the World Trade Center
and Pentagon attacks and the counter-terrorism policies they
triggered made her decide to try to stay for a full second term,
until 2005. But Annan was already looking elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Corazon Aquino, the former president of the Philippines, was
briefly proposed as a candidate. But none of the other names
mentioned in U.N. corridors had the stature of Robinson, who as the
Irish head of state had made highly publicized visits to Somalia,
Rwanda and other scenes of human rights abuses. And long before her
election as Ireland's first female president, she was one of Western
Europe's most prominent human rights lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira de Mello is praised by U.S. and European diplomats as one
of the United Nations' most effective administrators, not an accolade
often bestowed on Robinson. But human rights advocates around the
world urged the next high commissioner to be as assertive as his
predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. needs someone who is willing to confront the U.S. on
Guantanamo, the Russians on Chechnya, and the Chinese on Tibet,"
Michael Posner, the director of the Lawyers Committee on Human
Rights, said last week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bully-pulpit job," said William Schultz, head of the
U.S. chapter of Amnesty International. "There are other places in the
U.N. system for quiet diplomacy."</TE>

<LD>Congolese and Rwandan leaders said Monday that they had reached an
agreement to end a four-year war in Congo--a fight that has defied
resolution as it claimed more than 2 million lives, mostly from
starvation and disease.</LD>
<LD>   "We have reached an understanding and agreement at a technical
stage," said South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma, who chaired
the talks.</LD>
<LD>   A Rwandan government official in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, said
the two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding restating
their commitment to the Lusaka peace agreement of 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Congo agreed to track down former Rwandan army soldiers and Hutu
Interahamwe militia within the territory it controls in collaboration
with the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda blames the ex-soldiers and militias for the slaughter of
about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 and has
accused Congo of harboring them.</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda pledged to withdraw its troops from Congo once effective
measures had been undertaken to address its security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The government official said Congo, Rwanda and South Africa agreed
on a timetable, which could see Rwanda start pulling out its troops
no later than 90 days from the date the deal is signed by presidents
Joseph Kabila of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Airstrike in Gaza Strip Kills 12</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A midnight Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip killed one of the most
senior figures in the militant Hamas movement and at least 11 other
Palestinians, including eight children, early today, authorities and
witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The lightning raid destroyed at least four homes in a Gaza City
residential neighborhood, injuring scores of people and sending
hundreds of others scrambling outdoors.</LD>
<LD>   The target of the strike was the home of Salah Shehada, founder of
Hamas' military wing and long suspected by the Israeli army of
involvement in terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings, against
Israeli citizens.</LD>
<TE>   Shehada's fate was the subject of major confusion after the
strike, with conflicting reports saying that he had died or that he
had survived, with or without injuries. But at midmorning today, a
Hamas leader confirmed that Shehada was among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Shehada's two-story home, near the center of Gaza City, was
reduced to rubble by a rocket fired from an Israeli F-16 fighter jet,
witnesses said. Neighboring homes were severely damaged, trapping an
unknown number of residents, whom rescue crews worked frantically to
free.</TE>
<TE>   Before Shehada's death was confirmed, hospital officials reported
that 11 people had died, including a 2-month-old, and that more than
100 were hurt. A Palestinian Authority official declared the raid "a
massacre."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army had no immediate comment except to confirm that
it had struck at Shehada, whom it accused of masterminding "hundreds
of terror attacks" against Israelis. Among those incidents was an
attack on a group of Jewish religious students in March and the
slaying of four Israeli soldiers in January, an army spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The raid came just hours after Hamas' spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, told reporters that his group would be willing to call
off suicide attacks if Israeli forces withdrew from the West Bank,
which they have occupied for more than a month. Israeli and
Palestinian officials met over the weekend to discuss a possible
phased pullout, among other issues, and rumors flew Monday that
soldiers might begin moving out of some West Bank cities within days.</TE>
<TE>   Those negotiations are now in doubt, as is restraint by Hamas. A
Hamas official, speaking to reporters at the Gaza hospital where the
dead and wounded were taken, warned that "all the Palestinian people
will unify to avenge the blood of the martyrs."</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who dreams of so-called peace is mistaken," Hamas said in
its statement confirming Shehada's death.</TE>
<TE>   The group added that Shehada's wife and three of their daughters
were also killed. It was unclear, however, whether they were among
the 11 fatalities confirmed by hospital officials or were in addition
to that tally.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a statement
condemning the attack. "Israel has the legal and moral responsibility
to take all measures to avoid the loss of innocent life; it clearly
failed to do so in using a missile against an apartment building,"
Annan said. He called on Israel "to halt such actions and to conduct
itself in a manner that is fully consistent with international
humanitarian law."</TE>
<TE>   At the scene of the attack, Palestinian crowds shouted, "God is
great!" and "Death to Israel!" whenever someone was recovered alive
from beneath the piles of rubble. Television footage showed bloodied
victims being carried out on stretchers.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people, many in their pajamas, thronged the scene,
including known Hamas activists who came to see what had happened to
their colleague.An initial report of Shehada's death was soon
contradicted by others that variously put him in the hospital with
injuries, walking among and consoling the wounded, or somewhere in
hiding, unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning, however, hopes that he might be alive began to fade
among Hamas activists who remained at the debris-strewn attack site,
looking for a sign of Shehada or his body. Then his death was
announced.  Shehada had long been one of the Israeli authorities'
prime targets. He spent more than a decade in an Israeli prison
because of his involvement in the first Palestinian intifada but was
released shortly before the latest confrontation began in September
2000. Israel suspects that he was one of the driving forces in the
resumption of violence against Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks against
Israeli soldiers and civilians in the last two years, including some
of the suicide bombings that have frightened Israelis into avoiding
public places and staying home.</TE>
<TE>   After two deadly back-to-back suicide attacks in June, Israeli
forces responded by sending tanks into the West Bank and reoccupying
most of the cities there. Since then, hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians in the West Bank have been under virtual house arrest,
allowed out only periodically to buy supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the strict military-enforced curfews have been
easing, despite two attacks on civilians in Israel last week that
left a dozen victims dead.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the two sides met Saturday to discuss plans for the
Israeli government to release millions of dollars in Palestinian
Authority funds, frozen after the current intifada began.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says the money will
be released only if the Palestinian Authority implements reforms and
ensures that the funds do not go to support terrorism. An agreement
on the issue had been expected soon and was to include the
participation of a U.S. supervisor to monitor the money flow.</TE>
<TE>   There also was a glimmer of hope that the Israeli army would start
to pull back from the seven West Bank cities it has kept under a
lockdown since June.</TE>
<TE>   Although they gave no timetable and more hawkish officials
demanded that the army stay longer, Israeli government sources hinted
Monday that tanks could begin withdrawing soon from two of the
"quieter" West Bank cities, Hebron and Bethlehem, in the absence of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is likely to harden again after today's airstrike.</TE>
<TE>   "I condemn this despicable, cowardly act.... Bullets will breed
bullets, violence will breed violence," Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian
Cabinet minister, told the BBC. Erekat participated in the
discussions with Israeli officials Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Erekat accused Sharon of trying to derail the effort to defuse
tensions but said that he himself had not given up hope.</TE>
<TE>   After the airstrike, Palestinian protesters took to the streets
throughout the Gaza Strip. Some opened fire on Jewish settlements in
the area, but there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Israeli forces have struck twice at Gaza, bombing
what the army said were metal workshops where mortar shells and
rockets were being manufactured. Palestinian mortar fire at Jewish
settlements in the Gaza Strip occurs with some frequency.</TE>
<TE>   The strip is walled off from Israel by a fortified fence, which
has made it difficult for attackers to get into Israel from Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Israeli government has long complained that terrorist
cells operate freely there.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer William Orme in New York contributed to this
report.</TE>

<DL>RABAT, Morocco</DL>
<LD>Morocco and Spain agreed to a "frank and sincere dialogue" and will
meet again in September to discuss their competing claims to a tiny
Mediterranean island that began a nine-day military standoff, the
Moroccan Foreign Ministry said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after Spain withdrew its forces, both countries
maintained their claims to the island, according to a joint statement
released after talks between Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohammed
Benaissa and his Spanish counterpart, Ana Palacio.</LD>
<LD>   But both agreed that for now, the uninhabited island will remain
as it was before the conflict started: empty.</LD>
<TE>   The ministers' encounter was the highest-level meeting between the
sparring neighbors since Morocco recalled its ambassador from Madrid
in October for consultation after a series of what it saw as
anti-Morocco attitudes by Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The talks were made possible by the U.S.-coordinated withdrawal of
Spanish troops from the island, 200 yards from the Moroccan coast. It
is called Leila, or Night, by Morocco and Isla del Perejil, or
Parsley Island, by Spain.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli police reopened the university offices of the leading
Palestinian official in Jerusalem on Monday, two weeks after they
claimed that the premises were being used for Palestinian Authority
activity and shut them down.</LD>
<LD>   Sari Nusseibeh, president of Al Quds University and the chief
representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Jerusalem,
said he signed a document Monday agreeing not to use the premises for
political activity. However, he said he'd conduct his PLO activity
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The shutdown of the offices was criticized as counterproductive by
the United States, and Nusseibeh denied that they were being used to
conduct activity on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not been in the past, and we do not intend to be in the
future, a representative office of the Palestinian Authority,"
Nusseibeh told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Under interim peace accords signed since 1993, the Palestinian
Authority cannot maintain any representation in East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Nusseibeh is considered a moderate and has opposed attacks by
Palestinian militants on Israelis during a 22-month-old uprising for
independence.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Decision to Cut Off Funds to U.N. Agency Sparks
Outrage</HD>
<DH>Aid: Critics charge that the move is designed to curry
political favor among abortion foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democratic lawmakers and United Nations officials were outraged by
the Bush administration's announcement Monday that it will withdraw
$34 million in funding for the U.N. Population Fund's worldwide
family planning programs because of allegations that the money
indirectly supports forced abortions in China.</LD>
<LD>   Branding the decision "an embarrassment and a travesty," critics
accused the administration of selling out the health of poor women
and children in 141 countries other than China to curry political
favor with its anti-abortion supporters.</LD>
<LD>   "Women and children will die because of this decision," said
Thoraya A. Obaid, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, the agency said that it promotes only voluntary
family planning, that it does not promote abortion anywhere and that
abortion rates have actually fallen in the 32 counties in China where
the fund's program operates.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ludicrous that because there is coercion in China--coercion
we all know about and deplore--the administration is barring all U.S.
support for use anywhere by the world's largest family planning
organization," Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement. The
$34 million in U.S. funds were already segregated with a "fire wall"
that barred their use in China. But anti-abortion activists have been
lobbying for 20 years for a total cutoff of aid to the U.N.
population agency, which a National Right to Life Committee official
called "a cheerleader and facilitator for China's birth-quota
program, which relies heavily on coerced abortion."</TE>
<TE>   "Top U.N. [Population Fund] officials have been completely cozy
with China's birth-quota bosses," said Douglas Johnson, legislative
director for the committee.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said a legal review
concluded that the U.N. Population Fund's activities violate the
Kemp-Kasten Amendment, which prohibits U.S. funding of any
organization that "supports or participates in the management of a
program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."</TE>
<TE>   The $34 million taken from the United Nations will be funneled to
the U.S. Agency for International Development for family planning
services in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Angola, Myanmar and other nations
where such needs are acute, Boucher said. The United States already
spends $480 million a year on these efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charged that the review process was political and tainted.
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) sent a scathing letter to Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell, who signed the decision to cut off aid, noting
that the secretary had praised the U.N. agency's work in maternal and
child health care, cancer screening and HIV prevention and alleging
that U.S. policy had been "hijacked by right-wing domestic
policy-makers in the White House."</TE>
<TE>   A Chinese Embassy spokesman said China hoped that the U.S. would
reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Xie Feng noted that China is giving birth to a
population the size of Australia's every year.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Stumbles but Avoids Free Fall</HD>
<DH>Markets: A feared crash does not materialize, but the
losses mount. As investors pull money out of stock mutual funds,
analysts see more signs pointing to a bottom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks stumbled badly Monday but avoided the crash many investors
were braced for in the wake of Friday's dramatic sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average dived 234.68 points, or 2.9%, to
7,784.58 in volatile trading, closing below the 8,000 level for the
first time since October 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Though the blue-chip Dow's loss was smaller than Friday's
390-point plunge, it was hardly comforting to millions of investors
whose stock holdings have been shrinking almost relentlessly over the
last nine weeks, extending a market decline that is now 28 months
old.</LD>
<TE>   Many analysts remain reluctant to predict that the selling wave is
abating.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have totally lost confidence in the stock market and
they're throwing in the towel," said Steve Colton, manager of the
Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth &amp; Income fund in Scotts Valley, Calif. "We're
definitely going through the 'capitulation' phase, but unfortunately,
I don't know how long it will last."</TE>
<TE>   Broader market indexes, including the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and
the Nasdaq composite, also fell in the range of 3% Monday, to new
five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street feared that Friday's Dow loss, which occurred amid
record trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, would set up an
even bigger decline Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the market edged higher shortly after the opening bell,
and for a few minutes seemed soothed by upbeat comments President
Bush made about the economy and about potential value in the stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   But sellers quickly took control, and by midday the Dow was down
302 points. That gave way to an afternoon rally, then another
sell-off before the close of trading. NYSE share volume was the
fifth-heaviest ever.</TE>
<TE>   The record bankruptcy filing Sunday of telecom giant WorldCom
Inc., though expected, again reminded investors of the magnitude of
corporate scandals that have devastated confidence in companies'
financial reporting and in their stocks this year.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, a Senate panel released documents that showed how
Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, helped insolvent energy trader
Enron Corp. devise some of the controversial financial transactions
that allowed Enron to conceal its heavy debt load.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said its dealings with Enron were "entirely appropriate
at the time." But investors hammered the bank's stock, sending it
down $3.96, or 11%, to $32.04. It was the biggest loser among the 30
shares in the Dow index.</TE>
<TE>   The losses racked up by the nation's biggest stocks this year have
devastated the portfolios of many institutional and individual
investors alike. The S&amp;P 500, the most widely quoted blue-chip index
other than the Dow, has tumbled 28.6% this year.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the S&amp;P now is down 46% from its March 2000 all-time
high. That is nearing the 48% drop of 1973-74, which was the worst
bear market decline of the post-World War II era.</TE>
<TE>   If the S&amp;P index surpasses its 1973-74 drop, it could deal a
further psychological blow to investors and raise anew the question
of where the decline will finally end, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors already have lost more than half their portfolio
value: The technology-dominated Nasdaq index, which soared with the
"new-economy" stocks of the late 1990s, now is 75% off its peak.</TE>
<TE>   Money managers say the selling in recent weeks has slammed nearly
every stock sector, unlike in 2001 and earlier this year, when many
non-tech stocks were rallying.</TE>
<TE>   "The carnage used to be somewhat selective, but now there is
literally no place to hide," said Bill Whitlow, manager of the Safeco
Northwest fund in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Pessimism has become so rampant that even companies reporting good
news, such as home builder D.R. Horton Inc.--which topped analysts'
expectations in a "blowout" quarterly earnings report on Monday--are
getting hammered, said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at
Value Line Asset Management in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its report, D.R. Horton shares fell 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the market now is under pressure from selling by
stock mutual fund managers as more individual investors cash out.</TE>
<TE>   Investors pulled a net $13.8 billion out of stock funds in June,
the first net redemptions since September, according to an estimate
Monday by data tracker Lipper Inc.</TE>
<TE>   This month, outflows have been at an even steeper pace, according
to TrimTabs.com Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif.: In the
five sessions ended Thursday, a net $15.6 billion was yanked from
stock funds, TrimTabs estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders are making daily withdrawals, so I'm forced to sell
stocks even though I don't want to," said the Phoenix-Oakhurst fund's
Colton. This is the first time during his 12 years as a fund manager
that Colton has been in such a predicament, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many small investors say they are continuing to hold on to
their stocks and stock funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sell now--I think it's absolutely crazy to do
that. I'm just sitting and waiting for it to get better," said Sandy
Verrall, 57, of Laguna Hills, who said the weak economy pushed her to
decide last year to come out of retirement and work part time.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Cross, 45, of Lake Forest, who works as an engineer for
Western Digital Corp., said the market plunge has led her to
reconsider timing for retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "It changes your plans," Cross said. She recently moved some of
her 401(k) savings to cash and fixed income securities, but she said
she hasn't pulled entirely out of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Market optimists say the wave of mutual fund redemptions is among
several key signs suggesting that stocks may be close to bottoming.
Increased market volatility--such as Monday's wild swings--also
suggests a bottom may be near, some say. These symptoms often occur
at the end of major sell-offs.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500's intraday price swings over the last two weeks have
been wider than at any time since September, said Kevin Marder, a Los
Angeles-based market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset
Management.</TE>
<TE>   Another potentially positive sign: Announcements of corporate
stock buybacks surged last week, indicating that many companies think
their shares are undervalued, according to TrimTabs' president,
Charles Biderman.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, there is plenty of cash on the sidelines that could
help fuel a rally, said Ed Yardeni, a strategist at Prudential
Securities in New York. Total assets in money market funds and
checking and savings accounts have soared to a record $5.9 trillion,
Yardeni said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the total in stock mutual funds now is about $3.3
trillion.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing plunge in share prices also is making many stocks look
cheaper, relative to company earnings, than they have been in years,
Orlando said. "This is the cheapest market in a generation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But many other pros aren't convinced that enough investors believe
shares are attractively priced. And even Orlando concedes, "What's
the catalyst that's going to move us higher? There's nothing on the
immediate horizon that I see."</TE>
<TE>   Another risk also looms, some say: Though the economy still
appears to be in recovery mode, Colton said he is concerned about the
"negative wealth effect" the market slide is creating.</TE>
<TE>   "If it finally causes consumers to stop spending, we could be in
for a 'double dip' recession," Colton said.</TE>

<HD>Big Spenders Are Reluctant to Shop Through the Drop</HD>
<DH>Consumers: Upscale retailers say they're beginning to feel
Wall Street's pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST, MARC BALLON and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buoyant consumers have been the stabilizing force in an otherwise
wobbly economy, but the stock market's current nose dive is raising
questions about how long that can continue.</LD>
<LD>   Retailers of luxury goods and services say they already are
feeling the pinch of the market downturn, and economists fear the
pain may spread.</LD>
<LD>   "If the stock market continues to fall, it will affect everything,
including houses and sales of consumer goods in general," said Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "None of us will be
escaping the effects of the stock market plunge. Even if the stock
market bottoms, the effect will linger on for a while. And the higher
the price tag, the greater the effect."</LD>
<TE>   The latest retail sales figures reported by the government show
spending was up slightly in June compared with last year, but some
merchants say they are seeing a change in spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   "Where people were upgrading, upgrading, upgrading before,
oblivious to cost, they are now trying to work deals and pinch
pennies like you've never seen," said James Ahern, a travel agent
specializing in adventure safaris and international cruises at First
Class Travel in Phoenix. "And these are people who have the money. I
know they have the money."</TE>
<TE>   At Melisse, a French-American restaurant in Santa Monica where the
average dinner check per person is $85, reservations are off by 20%
this week, said general manager Michael Morrisette.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are getting a little scared and thinking twice
before going out to dinner," he said. "Maybe instead of going out
three or four times a week, they're eating out two times."</TE>
<TE>   The shaky economy and tumbling stock market have led Hildegard
Scolari, 65, of Newport Beach to cut back on shopping and travel.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't spend money that I no longer have," said Scolari, a
retired fashion industry executive who is invested heavily in the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Yacht dealer Gordon Barienbrock certainly wasn't glad to hear that
the stock market had slid an additional 234.68 points on Monday. To
cope with slackened demand, he said he has been forced to cut prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The sale of luxury yachts is generally directly correlated to the
stock market," he said. "When you buy boats like that, you have to
feel rich."</TE>
<TE>   The luxury market aside, however, some economists dismiss the idea
that the market downturn will make a big dent in overall consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the democratization of the stock market, most households
can't tap into the market, either to take advantage of gains or
curtail losses, because most of it is locked up in mutual funds or
retirement programs," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist with
Deloitte Research in New York. "At the end of the day, what drives
consumer spending is cash flow, and the factors that affect cash flow
are pretty positive right now."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, consumers have shown surprising resiliency. As the economy
slowed last year--and took a staggering blow on Sept. 11--shoppers
simply hastened the trend away from higher-end department stores and
shopped more at discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target.</TE>
<TE>   Some big retailers on Monday said trends so far this month are
pointing to lower sales for July than last year in stores open at
least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc., parent company of Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, said that based on monthly receipts so far, July
sales are likely to be flat to slightly down.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney Co. said decent sales last week at its department
stores put the division at the higher end of the company's forecast
for July--which is 2% to 4% below July of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although retail sales in June were up by 1.1%, according to
Commerce Department figures, the unexpected increase was mostly a
result of pent-up demand after a weak May, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   In another indicator this month that discretionary spending could
be weakening, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc., which sells
mid-range to high-end consumer electronics products, said sales at
stores open and under its ownership at least a year dropped 4.6% in
the quarter ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Tweeter's chief financial officer, Joe McGuire, blamed weaker June
sales on the "major moves" in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany &amp; Co said it expects earnings to be at the low end of its
previous expectations. And Zale Corp., the nation's largest specialty
retailer of fine jewelry, said it expects established store sales to
be essentially flat this quarter, up a mere 1% to 2%.</TE>
<TE>   C. Britt Beemer, chairman of the Charleston, S.C.-based America's
Research Group, a consumer behavior strategic marketing firm that
surveys 10,000 to 15,000 consumers a week, said the market tumble and
sour economy won't change how much Americans buy but how much they
are willing to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   "When their children need clothing for back to school, consumers
are doing it, they're just going to different places," Beemer said.
"The biggest beneficiaries of the stock market decline have been
Wal-Mart and Target because consumers are still buying; they're just
going to places where they think they can save 10% or 15% more."</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, said it probably will
better last July's sales by 5% to 7% in stores open at least a year.
Still, even at Wal-Mart, consumers aren't splurging. For the week
ended July 19, the company said, basic commodities were the key sales
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Economists say key economic indicators that underpin consumer
spending haven't fallen apart as quickly as the stock markets--but
that they aren't accelerating either.</TE>
<TE>   Real wage growth slowed through the spring to 2.2% in May, down
from 3.3% in January but slightly ahead of April, according to
Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   Housing turnover remained high in May at 7.9%, with mortgage
purchase applications up 21% in the most recently reported week, on
the basis of continued low interest rates. But those numbers, which
have been strong since just after Sept. 11, are likely to fall
eventually as interest rates rise.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer credit could be another cause for concern, economists
say, as debt service payments, as a portion of disposable personal
income, remain close to all-time highs. That could mean more limited
capacity for the kind of borrowing that fuels consumer spending
growth, economists at Goldman Sachs say.</TE>
<TE>   Although real estate in California and the U.S. has been riding
high from a wave of willing buyers, housing could suffer if the stock
market remains mired in a slump and causes the U.S. economy to lapse
into another recession, known as a double-dip. That could cause
consumer spending to plunge and job growth to decline.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, people won't have money to put into real estate,"
said David Lereah, chief economist at the National Assn. of Realtors,
a Washington trade group.</TE>
<TE>   John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a
LaJolla firm that monitors real estate trends, said the shaky stock
market could lead to more money going into real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But top-end housing is the most volatile, subject to greater gains
and greater declines than less expensive units, and some owners who
have sold their homes believe luxury real estate could be headed for
a correction, brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   "They look at their home and realize the same effect could
happen," said Rick Edler, an agent at Remax Palos Verdes Realty.</TE>
<TE>   Cecelia Waeschle, a Beverly Hills real estate broker, said wealthy
consumers may balk at plunking down money as freely as they did when
their stocks were soaring.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to wait and see."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill to Cut Greenhouse Gases</HD>
<DH>Emissions: Vehicles must meet tailpipe standards in 2009.
Auto makers promise a fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that could change the way cars are designed nationwide,
Gov. Gray Davis on Monday signed into law legislation that makes
California the first state to combat global warming by requiring
reduced tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor's widely expected decision to sign the
bill by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) is a triumph for
environmentalists, who suffered a bitter defeat in Washington earlier
this year when they attempted to increase gas mileage standards.</LD>
<LD>   With passage of the measure in California, the nation's largest
car market, environmentalists hope not only to reduce gas-forming
emissions, but also to force changes that will improve fuel
efficiency of automobiles sold across the country.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to set an example for the rest of the country,"
Davis told a cheering crowd at the Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles, saying that he was leading the way because Washington
politicians had failed to act. "I am convinced that other states will
follow."</TE>
<TE>   The law augments the authority of the agency responsible for
regulating air pollution, the California Air Resources Board. But it
provides the board with only a hazy outline of how to reach its goal
of achieving the "maximum feasible reduction" of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   It requires that new cars sold here seven years from now emit less
of the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. It falls to the Air
Resources Board to figure out the technology.</TE>
<TE>   The board must come up with its recommendations by 2005, amid what
is certain to be sustained scrutiny and legal squabbling by auto
makers. The emissions standard it sets will then apply to all cars
and trucks from the 2009 model year onward.</TE>
<TE>   The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that
comprises all the major car makers except Honda, announced that it
would sue to challenge the new law, arguing that it exceeded the
state's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Because the best known way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
automobiles is to make ones that burn less fuel, auto makers argued
from the start that the California measure was a backdoor attempt to
go around the federal government and, in effect, set a new national
fuel-efficiency standard. In commenting on the bill, Davis himself
said, "I would prefer to have Washington take the lead, but in the
absence of that we have no choice but to do our part.... It is my
hope that other states will do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   California is the only state allowed, under federal law, to set
air pollution standards higher than those imposed by the federal
government. Other states can then follow California's lead, giving
the state the ability to set national standards.</TE>
<TE>   The state air board has a lengthy record of pushing auto makers to
pursue changes against their will. California regulations were the
first to require vehicle makers to use catalytic converters, seat
belts, clean diesel fuel, unleaded fuel, alternative fuels,
reformulated gasoline and electric and hybrid cars--often despite
industry denials that the changes could be accomplished or would be
accepted by consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Resources Board has the power to shape markets and affect
billions of dollars in industry investment.</TE>
<TE>   The board controls the formulation of fuels and chemicals used in
vehicles and businesses, how new cars are built, and the composition
of consumer products. Regulations on auto tailpipes have led to new
cars that are 95% cleaner than those of a decade ago, a key reason
for recent air quality gains in Los Angeles, San Diego and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Our track record is very good, and we are up to the task," said
the board chairman, Alan Lloyd. "We have an enormous opportunity but
also an enormous responsibility, and we are not as irresponsible as
some people have characterized."</TE>
<TE>   The law marks the first attempt by a state to cut tailpipe
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists link to
global warming. Vehicles produce about 60% of those gases in
California, with cars, trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles
contributing the most.</TE>
<TE>   Bold as it is, however, the step taken by California will not make
much of a dent in global warming. The state produces 6% of the
nation's greenhouse gases, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I am under no illusions that this bill by itself will contribute
significantly to the reductions in greenhouse gases, but it's a good
beginning and a good example for others to follow," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry, which mounted an expensive TV campaign to
defeat the legislation, argued that the law could result in new
taxes, which are prohibited by the law, and warned that vehicles
manufactured to meet the state's new requirements are likely to be
less safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there are all kinds of problems in having individual
states like California weigh into this arena," said Michael Love,
national regulatory affairs manager at Toyota Motor Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Martin, Air Resources Board spokesman, said, "Clearly it's a
new regulatory front. We are going to be asked to control gases we
have not in the past."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "We'll start with technologies that are already in
existence, they'll be phased in over time and the drivers will never
notice the difference. We'll end up with better cars as a result."</TE>
<TE>   The air board, which consists of 11 members appointed by the
governor, will start by looking at dozens of options, ranging from
engines that shut down a couple of cylinders on the open road to
improved seals on air-conditioning systems to prevent refrigerant
leaks. A comprehensive plan will be developed after public workshops
in the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   The board has identified 20 technologies, including several used
already by foreign auto manufacturers, that can be added to new cars
to cut greenhouse gases. Some also improve gas mileage and
performance and reduce other air pollutants. Manufacturers in Europe
have been using some of them voluntarily for years.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, some of the innovations could result in cars with
quicker acceleration, sleeker lines and better gas mileage, said
Charles Lave, a UC Irvine economist and member of a National Academy
of Science panel that examined auto fuel efficiency standards.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lots and lots of these technologies. It's proven stuff,
not speculative," Lave said. "There are plenty of these improvements
left. The only question is whether we will use the increased
efficiency to scratch off the stoplight faster, get more fuel
efficiency or get some of each."</TE>
<TE>   One technique, variable valve timing, which is used on some new
Honda models, controls fuel combustion by opening and closing piston
valves as the engine works harder. Another method uses extra gears on
automatic transmissions. The high-performance Audi A4 uses a
"continuously variable transmission" to continually adjust gears to
increase performance and efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   More cars use 42-volt battery systems to power electronic gizmos,
including VCRs and heated seats. But the extra electric power can be
harnessed to turn an engine on and off while idling.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota Prius and Honda's hybrid Civic and Insight use
combinations of batteries and internal combustion engines in their
drive trains. Low-friction oils, tires and materials also can make
cars more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Auto companies will be granted broad flexibility to meet the
state's demands. The new law requires that auto makers use "maximum
feasible and cost-effective measures" to reduce an unspecified
quantity of greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks. Regulators
must consider the effects on jobs and businesses, but not raise
taxes, lower speed limits or ban certain types of vehicles. One
provision allows auto companies to escape tailpipe reductions
altogether by reducing greenhouse gases emitted from their
manufacturing plants in other states.</TE>
<TE>   The bill faces some challenges.</TE>
<TE>   For two decades, auto makers have blocked attempts to raise the
standards. California entered the fray after the U.S. Senate voted
not to increase fuel efficiency standards beyond the current 27.5
miles per gallon for passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear what California is trying to do. It's born of a
frustration with the Bush administration on climate change and born
of frustration with the inconclusive nature of debate in Congress
over fuel efficiency standards. California is trying to fill a void
on greenhouse gas emissions and auto fuel economy," said Paul
Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C., research institution on energy and environment
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Dana, vice president of environmental affairs at the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said, "They say it's a CO2
[carbon dioxide] bill, but it's a fuel economy bill. That's all it
is."</TE>
<TE>   One strategy that may be used by auto makers to overturn the law
is a challenge to California's authority to regulate carbon dioxide,
a greenhouse gas, as a "pollutant." Unlike other tailpipe emissions,
it does not contribute to smog and has not been regulated before.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers are contemplating placing a referendum on the
California ballot to repeal the law.</TE>
<TE>   However, a poll that the Public Policy Institute of California
released earlier this month showed that 81% of respondents favor
requiring automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles
by 2009.</TE>

<HD>Beef Sickened at Least 26 Before Recall, Officials Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of illnesses from contaminated beef produced by ConAgra
Foods Inc. has risen to at least 26 people in five states, state and
federal health officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   ConAgra on Friday launched the nation's second-largest recall of
ground beef, almost 19 million pounds, after the U.S. Agriculture
Department said meat from the company's Colorado plant may be
contaminated with the deadly E. coli bacterium.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it
confirmed at least 25 illnesses linked to the ConAgra beef in
Colorado, South Dakota, Michigan, Washington and Wyoming.</LD>
<TE>   The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment added
another sick person to the CDC total, bringing the number of cases in
that state to 20.</TE>
<TE>   Three sick people were reported in South Dakota and one each in
Michigan, Washington and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Of those ill, six were hospitalized and later released.</TE>
<TE>   The number of illnesses linked to the ConAgra meat could rise.
Pavani Kalluri, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease
Control, said another "handful" of illnesses were under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, kidney damage and
even death. Children, the elderly and people with impaired immune
systems are at the most risk.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA had no immediate comment on how much of the tainted
ground beef was returned to ConAgra by grocery stores, retailers and
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The recalled beef was produced at ConAgra's plant in Greeley,
Colo., from April 12 to July 11 and sold nationwide. The company
first withdrew 354,200 pounds from the market on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway, Kroger, Wal-Mart and Food Lion were among the grocery
stores and supermarket chains that pulled food products from their
shelves in reaction to the recall.</TE>
<TE>   The label on all recalled meat bears the code "EST. 969" inside
the USDA seal of inspection. Consumers should return the meat to a
grocery store or discard it.</TE>
<TE>   Further recall information is available on the USDA's Web site at
http://www.usda.gov or by calling (866) 849-7438.</TE>
<TE>   Cooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees
kills E. coli and many other harmful bacteria, the CDC said.</TE>

<HD>New Orleans Cracks Down on Bribery</HD>
<DH>Crime: The new mayor says it's time for graft to end. More
than 80 arrest warrants are issued in an alleged scheme involving at
least two city agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Police began rounding up more than 80 people in an alleged bribery
scheme at the city's auto inspection and taxi licensing agencies
Monday as the new mayor opened a crackdown on graft in the Big Easy.</LD>
<LD>   The auto inspection agency, including its three inspection
stations, was shut down by the roundup that began before dawn, and
authorities said they expected all 20 of the agency's employees to be
implicated. Two city officials were fired, and one of them was
arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-four people in all--77 of them taxi drivers--were named in
arrest warrants accusing them of bribery, fraud and malfeasance.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said city employees took bribes to hand out taxi
permits to illegal immigrants and to overlook automobile safety
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Police said one of the inspectors, a nine-year veteran, told
investigators that "she was trained to do it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ray Nagin said the investigation probably will reach other
agencies and more arrests could be coming. The mayor, who began his
job in May, said there is "hard evidence" that previous
administrations knew of corruption and did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very clear that this type of behavior has been going on for
many, many years," Nagin said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has long had a reputation as a place of excess--from food
and drink to prostitution and graft. Federal prosecutors even now are
investigating the relationship of bail bond companies with judges in
suburban New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Nagin's predecessor, two-term Mayor Marc Morial, was credited with
cleaning up corruption and brutality in the Police Department. Former
Chief Richard Pennington, who recently took the top police job in
Atlanta, presided over indictments, firings and disciplinary actions
against more than 350 officers.</TE>
<TE>   Nagin, a former cable TV executive, said his administration is
examining contracts signed in the last days of Morial's
administration and the spending of federal funds. He said previous
administrations had ignored problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This is inexcusable and should have been taken care of long ago,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not leadership, it is not management. It's not anything but
complicity."</TE>

<LD>   U.S. District Judge Ted Stewart also ruled that MediaNews Group,
the paper's corporate owner, can't sell any Tribune asset worth more

<LD>One year before the Watergate break-in, Richard Nixon ordered a
burglary at the Brookings Institution, telling aides, "I want the
Brookings safe cleaned out."</LD>
<LD>   A few days later, two men with attache cases entered the think
tank's lobby, asking to see Morton Halperin, a critic of the
president's Vietnam policy. But the security guard on duty, a tall,
thin Caribbean native with a no-exceptions policy, didn't recognize
them. Roderick Warrick told them they had to clear their entrance
with Halperin. They left.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, some three decades after that encounter, Brookings
staffers--from the institution's president to its computer
technicians, from scholars to corporate executives--turned out to
honor the man who is credited with saving the institution's files.
They all had stories to tell about his stalwart devotion to the
rules--like the time he would not let the vice president of Brookings
into the building because he had not met him before.</LD>
<TE>   "He has the most complaints against him of any employee I
supervise," Kathy Santos, director of building operations, said
proudly. "At least until Sept. 11, I used to get a complaint once a
month."</TE>
<TE>   A staffer would chafe because Warrick wouldn't let his
girlfriend go up to the library. Or let him take a computer home. Or
even come to work if he'd forgotten his access card.</TE>
<TE>   "I calmed them down and told them Warrick was just doing his job,"
Santos said.</TE>
<TE>   Just doing his job earned Warrick the affection of many on the
staff. In a reception room laden with salmon canapes, celebratory
cake and fresh-cut fruit, they honored his years on Brookings'
payroll--and talked about his service to them even before that, when
he worked for a local real estate development company that handled
Brookings' security.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he's tough, but he's terrific," said Alice Rivlin, an
economist who served several Democratic administrations, and who
often returned as a Brookings scholar when her party lost power.
"I've come and gone from Brookings several times, and he always greets me
with great enthusiasm."  When Warrick turned away the two men in attache
cases, no one knew who had sent them.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1996, the National Archives released a fresh batch of
tapes recorded by the Nixon White House. In them, Nixon ordered the
burglary at Brookings, then widely considered a liberal organization.</TE>
<TE>   The order came the night the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that the
New York Times and the Washington Post had a constitutional right to
publish the Pentagon Papers, a secret Pentagon study that chronicled
decades of failed policy in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that Halperin and Leslie Gelb, who directed the Pentagon
Papers, might leak further antiwar materials, Nixon told White House
Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman to have someone rifle Brookings'
files and "just go in and take it! Go in around 8 or 9 o'clock...and
clean it up." At another point in a meeting with Haldeman and
National Security Advisor Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon fumes, "Goddamn
it, get in and get those files. Blow the safe and get them."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, according to the tapes, he pounded the desk
as he told aides, "Get it done! I want it done! I want the Brookings
safe cleaned out."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Watergate Committee heard testimony that Nixon aide
Charles Colson had suggested firebombing Brookings, creating a
pretext for the FBI to rush in alongside the firefighters, to snatch
documents, but Colson denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, Warrick's actions in foiling Halperin's uninvited
guests--no matter who sent them--made him the toast of the staff
Monday. Stephen Hess, Brookings' ubiquitous presidential scholar,
said he delayed a television appearance so he could attend Warrick's
party. But he seemed a bit jealous of all the attention to the guard.
"They didn't give me a party at my 30th," he observed.</TE>
<TE>   Warrick, a dapper, mustached man who prefers not to give his age,
also seemed a little puzzled by all the attention. "A lot of people
think I'm mean, but I'm just careful," he said. "You have to be
careful. All it takes is one mistake."</TE>
<TE>   That Warrick was careful even before it was fashionable has earned
him an asterisk in history. Two months after he stopped the men with
the attache cases, the so-called White House plumbers broke into the
office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Ellsberg, a former Pentagon
official, was an analyst at Rand Corp. who saw the secret Pentagon
Papers and photocopied the contents, leaking them to New York Times
reporter Neil Sheehan. And the following year, five men tied to
Nixon's reelection campaign were caught trying to burglarize
Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate. The
scandals that would eventually topple a president had a name.</TE>
<TE>   Strobe Talbott, the new president of Brookings and a former deputy
secretary of State in the Clinton administration, said the
institution was grateful. Had the burglars gotten in, he noted,
history might have known the Nixon White House scandals by a
different name. "We would not have wanted it to be called
Brookings-gate," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Sees 'Value' in Markets</HD>
<DH>Economy: The president encourages a return to stocks, but
investors continue to bail out. Some scorn his 'sweet nothings' and
question his team of advisors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ARGONNE, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Defending his administration's performance during the Wall Street
rout, President Bush summoned investors back to the stock market
Monday, professing his faith in the U.S. economy and in the quality
of a White House economic team headed by embattled Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill.</LD>
<LD>   In comments to reporters, Bush took what some observers saw as the
politically dicey step of recommending that Americans go back to
buying stocks despite steep declines in virtually every market
measure during the last four months.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not a stockbroker or a stock picker," the president said.
But, he continued, "I do believe that the fundamentals for economic
growth are real.</LD>
<TE>   "Investors are going to realize there's value in the market," he
said. "If they buy stock, they're buying value--as opposed to buying
... into a bubble."</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street veterans reacted to the president's remarks with
scorn. "Sweet nothings like 'The economy is fundamentally sound' or
'It's time to buy' are just empty talk," said New York investment
strategist Peter L. Bernstein. "Those are the kind of remarks that
reverberate down through history"--such as Herbert Hoover's rosy
assessments when the country was on the verge of the Great
Depression--Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   After a weekend in which criticism of O'Neill mounted, Bush rose
to the defense of his Treasury secretary, a former corporate chief
executive who has spent much of the last few months traveling
overseas. (He's recently been to Africa and Asia.) "He's doing a fine
job," the president said. "I have all the confidence in the world" in
him.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that when the stock market recovers, "I hope they will
give him credit."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have fumed in recent days about what they
view as unfair coverage of the White House amid the steep market
declines.</TE>
<TE>   They suggested that press accounts misrepresented O'Neill as being
overseas during the worst of the tumble, when in fact he was in the
country for many of the markets' worst days. And aides complained
that some television networks covering Bush's July 9 Wall Street
speech included a so-called "bug" in the lower right-hand corner of
the screen that showed the Dow and other stock indexes headed
downward.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration's problem with the dropping Dow go well
beyond public perception. Even longtime Wall Street optimists now say
the president and his economic team--which includes O'Neill, chief
economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey, budget director Mitchell E.
Daniels Jr. and economist R. Glenn Hubbard--have failed to come to
grips with the economic danger of the market slide.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time for leadership, but so far the president hasn't
wrestled the mantle of leadership" from Democrats and critics, warned
Morgan Stanley economist Richard Berner.</TE>
<TE>   In large measure, said Berner, that is because Bush's team has
failed to come up with strong proposals to cope with the crisis.
"They have blue-ribbon credentials, but they have not grabbed hold of
the agenda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic jitters that the White House is trying to calm carry
long-term and immediate dangers for the president. In the short run,
they sow confusion in the congressional races that will be decided in
November.</TE>
<TE>   But if the plunging stock market dries up investment money and,
with it, capital for growth, the immediate skittishness could turn
into an extended downturn. That, in turn, would present Bush with a
picture similar to the one his father faced when he ran for
reelection in 1992, in which his war-fueled popularity was swamped by
a soured economy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such worries, the president had nothing but optimistic
words Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Once Congress passes pending legislation intended to restore faith
in the integrity of corporations and their directors, he said, "the
investor is going to pick value, make decisions on value."</TE>
<TE>   "From what I hear, corporate profits are improving, which means
values will be available for those who invest in the market," the
president said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an optimist. I believe the future is going to be bright,"
Bush said, adding: "But, look, you're talking to the wrong guy about
what stocks to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois--the
Republican leader in whose district Bush was traveling--was
optimistic about producing legislation Bush would sign. The president
said he hoped the measure would be delivered to him before Congress'
summer recess. The House is scheduled to begin its holiday at the end
of this week; the Senate breaks a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the latest news of corporate bankruptcy--WorldCom Inc.
announced it was taking that step Sunday--Bush said he believed that
the stock market already had taken such a move into account and that
his concern now was for the company's employees.</TE>
<TE>   After losing 7.7% of its value last week to close at its lowest
level since October 1998, the Dow lost almost another 3% on Monday to
close at 7784.58. Other indexes lost similar amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's remarks about the economy came during an appearance at
Argonne National Laboratory that had been intended to promote his
call for creation of a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, while pressing Congress to approve trade legislation and the
corporate integrity measure, has made the plan to merge 22 government
agencies--and many more smaller offices--into the new department his
top priority.</TE>
<TE>   The House appears to be moving toward approving the creation of
the new department, but Bush is working to keep its shape close to
the format he proposed.</TE>

<HD>Final Roll Call of D-Day's Fallen Heroes</HD>
<DH>History: Memorial foundation is compiling complete list of
those who died at Normandy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEDFORD, Va.</DL>
<LD>When researcher Carol Tuckwiller called the Army's grave registration
unit at Ft. Lee, Va., to request help identifying every fatality in
the D-day invasion, a skeptical sergeant told her: "There's no single
source for this. No one's ever put a list together. It can't be
done."</LD>
<LD>   "I told him that's precisely why we were doing it--because it
hadn't been done," Tuckwiller recalled the other day as she sat at
her computer in the office of the National D-Day Memorial Foundation
in this country town midway between Lynchburg and Roanoke. Bedford
proportionally lost more of its soldier sons June 6, 1944, than any
town in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after two years of dogged research, scouring military
records, setting up an elaborate database and tracking down U.S.,
British and Canadian veterans, the foundation is closing in on its
goal of compiling the first list of those who died on the Normandy
beaches. So far, Tuckwiller has identified 3,700 of the estimated
4,400 killed.</LD>
<TE>   "An effort like this, as labor-intensive as it is, makes an
important contribution to our understanding of military history,"
said John F. Votaw, executive director of the First Division Museum
at Cantigny in Wheaton, Ill. "It connects with oral history projects,
and the database gives us a better understanding of the invasion and
who the soldiers were, as well as providing an entry point for
historians to ask larger questions."</TE>
<TE>   Tuckwiller's first task was to determine which Allied units
participated in what Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower called "the great
crusade," an operation involving 154,000 troops spread out over 50
miles of French coastline. The list of Army units alone filled 12
single-spaced pages. Then, under the Freedom of Information Act, she
had to gain access to the units' microfilmed "morning reports"--a
one-page log every company commander files daily to his headquarters
that shows "a record of events" and changes in the status of
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The notations that caught her attention were "fm dy to
kia"--stark, cold shorthand for saying a soldier's status had changed
in the last 24 hours from being on active duty to being killed in
action. But information often was incorrect. Soldiers who were
separated from their units and thought to be dead sometimes
reappeared. Others buried in temporary graves were reinterred. Many
men seemed to simply disappear. Each name became part of a giant
jigsaw puzzle for Tuckwiller.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran into the name Raymond Aubin, and it looked familiar," she
said. "Sure enough, it was in the database, but with two death
dates." Tuckwiller found an association of Aubin's landing-craft unit
and two eyewitnesses e-mailed her the precise details of his death.</TE>
<TE>   "One of them came by the office a few months ago and brought me
this picture, and there's Mr. Aubin right there," she said, touching
the figure of a handsome young man in a faded black-and-white photo
of the ill-fated unit. "I love the sequence of events you discover in
this research. It makes everything so personal."</TE>
<TE>   The names of the U.S. and Allied fatalities on D-day--an invasion
that broke Adolf Hitler's grip on Europe and led to Germany's
surrender on May 7, 1945--will be placed on 116 bronze plaques and
mounted on the D-Day Memorial, a stirring monument on 88 acres here
whose dedication last year was attended by President Bush. More than
200,000 people visited the memorial in the last year. Many veterans
left mementos to fallen comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "This memorial means everything to D-day vets and to the town of
Bedford," said Roy Stevens, 82, who was one of 70 young men from
Bedford inducted into the Army before the Normandy invasion at a
salary of $21 a month. "The 70 of us were like family. We knew each
other's habits just like we were brothers."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens and his twin brother, Ray, then 25, were among 35 Bedford
soldiers of Company A of the 116th Infantry in the first attack wave.
Nineteen of them died, most in the first 15 minutes of the invasion.
The dead were buried in the sand when the fighting died down, then
moved to a temporary cemetery on higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hopes Ray made it and was maybe in a hospital," Stevens
said. "Then, on about the fourth day, I went up the hill to the
cemetery. They'd put up wooden crosses. The first one I went up to,
and cleaned the mud off a dog tag, it was Ray's. The telegrams
notifying families a son or a husband had been killed didn't reach
Bedford for about a month. Then they came in a burst. It was like a
vale of tears settled over the whole town."</TE>
<TE>   The town of Bedford, then with a population of 3,200, claimed the
distinction of having suffered the greatest proportional D-day loss
in the country. Some communities, such as Roanoke, 28 miles to the
west, contended their per capita losses were higher, because some of
Bedford's casualties undoubtedly came from Bedford County, which was
10 times larger than the town of Bedford.</TE>
<TE>   William McIntosh, a retired Army colonel who is president of the
D-day foundation, says the point is moot and insignificant. Bedford
was chosen as the site for the memorial--and the plaques listing the
dead--because "it is emblematic of all the American heartland
communities, large and small, that have provided citizen soldiers" in
time of war, he said.</TE>
<TE>   McIntosh said the foundation's future is not threatened by
debt--which, although decreased, still stands at $4.3 million--or by
the indictment last month of Richard Burrow, 35, a Roanoke engineer
who was hired in 1996 to build the memorial. He is accused of fraud
for allegedly misleading lenders in his haste to secure loans to
finish the site in time for its dedication last summer. He has
pleaded not guilty and is not charged with having gained personally
from the transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "He was working his fanny off to get that thing finished," said
D-day veteran Bob Slaughterm of Roanoke, who spearheaded the idea to
build a memorial and who has started a defense fund for Burrow to
which many vets have contributed. "He was doing this for us. That's
why we're standing behind him."</TE>

<HD>A Girl or a Boy, You Pick</HD>
<DH>Embryo sorting makes it possible to screen for gender and
diseases. But the embryos no one wants raise profound ethical
questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She had the name picked out since high school: Logann Rae, taken from
a soap opera. She had two dolls waiting in a closet, both saved since
childhood. Tanya had always dreamed of having a daughter, and of the
intimate bond that would grow as they picked out dresses together,
styled their hair and painted their fingernails.  But Tanya's first
child was a son. Then came another. When an ultrasound showed that
her third child was also a boy, she struggled to hide her tears from
the nurse.</LD>
<LD>   And that is why this year she drove 400 miles to a doctor's office
in Westwood. Using methods common in fertility clinics, doctors mixed
Tanya's eggs with her husband's sperm to create five embryos in a
laboratory dish. Then, using a new technique, they examined the
embryos to determine which had the DNA to become boys, and which were
programmed to be girls.</LD>
<LD>   The three male embryos were frozen, their fate to be decided
later. The two female embryos were transferred to Tanya's womb in an
attempt to create the daughter she always wanted.</LD>
<TE>   The embryo-sorting technique--called PGD, for pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis--is quickly becoming the most controversial
development in high-tech reproduction. Doctors are able to screen
embryos not only for gender, but for whether they carry the genes
involved in cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia and more than 100
other inherited diseases. They can even tell whether an embryo would
grow into a good cell donor to help a sick person. The information is
helping parents choose which embryos they want--and which to reject
as unhealthy, or merely undesirable. The cost is about $10,000,
including the price of in vitro fertilization, the procedure that
creates "test-tube babies" and which is a required part of embryo
screening.</TE>
<TE>   But as the number of doctors offering the service leaps upward,
embryo screening is raising some profound questions: Is it proper to
discard an embryo based on its genes or gender? Which lives are not
worth living? Who decides?</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary to have this power," said Tracy Otte of Fountain
Valley, who is trying to have a child and avoid the muscular
dystrophy that killed two brothers in their early 20s. "If this
technology was there, would my brothers ever have been born? It
becomes: Did their lives have value? Absolutely, they had value. But
it was also tragic to see how young they died."</TE>
<TE>   Some fertility specialists say the questions will only become
thornier, as scientists are bound to create tests not only for
disease but for various traits. "There will come a day when we can
determine height or weight or skin tone characteristics, and the
question is: What do we do with that information?" said Dr. Jeffrey
Steinberg of the Fertility Institutes in Tarzana, which has offered
embryo screening for about a year. Society at large "has to give us
feedback, because this is as new to us as it is to the rest of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   "We've arrived at the point where we need a national debate--no
doubt about that," said David Hill, scientific director at ART
Reproductive Center of Beverly Hills, which offers embryo screening
services.</TE>
<TE>   It is far from clear if parents will ever be able to test for
intelligence or athletic ability, which are presumed to involve many
genes and environmental factors. Still, embryo screening is one of
several developments that could give parents significant control of
their children's genetic makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with data from the Human Genome Project, researchers are
probing the genetic foundations of obesity, mood and disease. Testing
devices called "gene chips" are allowing scientists to track the
activity not of one gene, but of thousands at the same time. Cloning
and genetic engineering have enabled biologists to augment the
genetic makeup of animals, adding genes so that the animals grow
faster, bigger or more resistant to disease.</TE>
<TE>   But even before scientists gain additional powers over human
reproduction, there is worldwide debate over how to handle the
information embryo screening can reveal.</TE>
<TE>   Debate Began in Late '80s</TE>
<TE>   The debate has been building since the late 1980s, when doctors at
London's Hammersmith Hospital learned how to tease a cell from a
3-day-old embryo and study its chromosomes for gender. By weeding out
male embryos from the females, the doctors aimed to help parents
avoid such gender-linked diseases as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, which are inherited overwhelmingly by boys.</TE>
<TE>   Later techniques allowed doctors to screen for the genes that
cause a variety of diseases. The screening, however, has become
widely available only in the last two years, as more companies have
begun handling the sophisticated laboratory work for fertility
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   While no one keeps complete numbers, specialists say about 50 U.S.
clinics now offer the service to patients. Nearly 2,000
embryo-screened babies have been born worldwide since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Embryo screening has caught the attention of Joy Pablo, 34, a Los
Angeles nurse who has battled breast cancer since 1998. She worries
that her 5-year-old daughter will one day face the disease. She hopes
her next child can escape the same fear.</TE>
<TE>   "If they could guarantee me a boy, I would have peace of mind,"
said Pablo, "because the chances of breast cancer are so much smaller
than with a girl."</TE>
<TE>   For Otte, 37, whose brothers died from muscular dystrophy, the
idea of rejecting a potential child because of the disease is
unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   Her brothers had friends and went to college--one went to his high
school prom. "They had this disease, but they weren't this disease,"
she said. Nonetheless, she is trying to have a daughter through
embryo screening because muscular dystrophy rarely strikes girls.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the road map of this disease, and it's too tough to repeat
that," said Otte, a third-grade teacher. "At age 8 or 9 you start
thinking about a wheelchair. A cold can kill because there's no
strength to cough up mucus."</TE>
<TE>   When having children, people such as Pablo and Otte often roll the
genetic dice and hope for the best. Or they become pregnant and use a
prenatal test, such as amniocentesis, followed by an abortion if the
test turns up a problem.</TE>
<TE>   With embryo sorting, "they can start their pregnancy on Day One
with a commitment to continuing it," said Dr. Mark Hughes of Wayne
State University in Detroit, who helped develop embryo diagnosis with
the Hammersmith doctors. "How can it be more ethically troublesome to
test before a pregnancy than later, when the fetus has a heartbeat
and is moving?"</TE>
<TE>   Many Ethical Concerns</TE>
<TE>   And yet, something about embryo screening makes many people
nervous, even people who do not see the embryo as equivalent to a
child.</TE>
<TE>   Where amniocentesis usually provides information about a single
fetus, embryo screening allows parents to judge and reject many
potential children at once. And because it bypasses the pain of
abortion, some fear it will be used too freely, coarsening attitudes
toward the embryo.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, the federal government has barred embryo screening for
any purpose. In England, it can be used to select a child's gender
only when there is a medical need.</TE>
<TE>   But in the United States, fertility techniques are regulated more
lightly, and there are no restrictions on how embryo screening may be
used. That leaves policy to be set by people such as Dr. Jaroslav
Marik of the Tyler Medical Clinic, the doctor Tanya visited in her
attempt to conceive a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   A regal man of 69, Marik has worked at the Tyler clinic, in the
shadow of the UCLA campus, since 1971. He was one of the first
doctors in a Western state to offer in vitro fertilization. An
enthusiastic defender of patient choice, Marik believes embryo
screening has the potential to nearly eliminate diseases such as
cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   But he also does not shy from offering it to patients who have no
medical need to select a child's gender. "What is medical need?" he
asked. "Isn't the right to happiness and health a part of that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a medical reason for Dolly Parton to have boobs like
that?" he asked. "Is there a medical reason to have liposuction? Is
that a misuse of medical technology?"</TE>
<TE>   Marik, who works with embryologist Jerry L. Hall, said about 70 of
his patients have screened embryos since 2001, including 15 who
sought a boy or girl for non-medical purposes.</TE>
<TE>   He believes he does the screening with proper respect for the
embryo. Patients work hard to make embryos and want some good to come
from them, he said. They usually ask that rejected embryos be donated
to research or, when they are healthy, to infertile couples.</TE>
<TE>   "I hardly remember anyone who instructed us to destroy the
embryo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But much of Marik's reasoning raises concerns among critics of
embryo screening--a constellation that includes antiabortion groups,
feminists, advocates for the disabled and people within the fertility
profession.</TE>
<TE>   Flaws, Embryo Rejection</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting a boy or girl when there is no medical need draws the
most objections.</TE>
<TE>   "Morally reprehensible," said Dr. Robert E. Anderson of the
Southern California Center for Reproductive Medicine in Newport
Beach. "Most Americans, no matter where they come down on the
question of where life begins, would find something morally
objectionable about creating embryos and then discarding some simply
because of their sex."</TE>
<TE>   "It is inherently sexist. It values one sex in favor of another,"
said Tania Simoncelli of the Center for Genetics and Society, an
Oakland public policy group.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, the Wayne State doctor, said: "I went into this to help
people with disease. Last time I checked, your gender is not a
disease."</TE>
<TE>   Some also argue that allowing gender selection endorses lopsided
gender preferences in other countries. In some parts of India, where
boys are heavily favored for economic and other reasons, there are
only 86 women for every 100 men. Parents commonly use sonograms and
abortion to avoid having girls, though the practice is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Indian fertility doctors bridle at the notion of being
bound by Western views. "I do not understand why some Indians are
ashamed that most Indians want to have boys," said Dr. Aniruddha
Malpani, who has produced 22 children--all boys--from screened
embryos at his Bombay clinic. "The preference for sons is based on
traditions which are centuries old, and these preferences are not
going to change quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Using embryo screening to detect disease has also drawn protest.</TE>
<TE>   Embryo tests can detect the genes behind cystic fibrosis, for
example, but not whether the illness will be so mild that symptoms
are negligible, as sometimes happens. Some critics say it is immoral
to reject a potential life on the basis of a disease that may turn
out to be mild.</TE>
<TE>   Some people argue against rejecting even embryos destined to have
severe disease. "Most people with disabilities rate their quality of
life as much higher than other people think," said Deborah Kaplan,
executive director of the World Institute on Disability in Oakland.
"People make the decision [to reject embryos] based on a prejudice
that having a disability means having a low quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   There is a subjective component to deciding whether any disease or
flaw is severe enough to make life not worth living. When Dorothy
Wertz of the University of Massachusetts Medical School surveyed U.S.
genetics professionals in 1995, she found that about 30% would abort
a pregnancy if the child was destined to have severe
obesity--something she considers to be more a cosmetic condition than
a disease.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest use of embryo screening could have nothing to do with
disease in the traditional sense. Instead, screening may become a
routine way to boost the success of in vitro fertilization.</TE>
<TE>   Embryos that look fine under the microscope often self-destruct in
the womb because of extra or missing chromosomes. Some doctors are
now screening for these faulty chromosomes before choosing which
embryos to transfer to patients.</TE>
<TE>   "The embryologists who begin to work with this, their jaws just
drop as they look back and say, 'Hey, how many of these embryos that
looked perfect but were doomed to failure have I loaded into a
catheter and transferred to a woman?' " said Dr. Beth Ary of the
Reproductive Specialty Center in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But this use of embryo screening is controversial as well. Some
doctors note that clinics test no more than eight of the 23 pairs of
chromosomes, and problems could be hiding in the others. They also
worry that embryos are damaged in the process of pulling off a cell.</TE>
<TE>   But Ary and her embryologist husband, Jim, said the birth rates at
their clinic rose after they began offering embryo screening to
patients in March 2001. And a Spanish study found screening raised
pregnancy rates among women who had repeatedly lost pregnancies for
unexplained reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping for a Little Girl</TE>
<TE>   For Tanya, the visit to Marik's office was a final effort for a
daughter. After three boys, her husband was willing to have only one
more child.</TE>
<TE>   "They say the odds are 50-50 of having a girl," she said earlier
this year. "But it isn't for me, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   She was dressed in a bathrobe, lying on a gurney in a Tyler clinic
examination room. Two female embryos had just been placed inside her.
She had asked Marik to give researchers the three male embryos she
created, or to donate them to an infertile couple, at his discretion.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya said she is comfortable using the technology but fears some
relatives, who are devout Roman Catholics, would object if they knew.
She asked that her last name and hometown not be printed.</TE>
<TE>   She talked about her love for her sons, but also about a longing
to re-create the intimacy that she enjoys with her own mother. "It
just seems that when boys get older they close up a little more and
get married, and the wife takes on that closeness," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While her husband bonds with their boys through fishing and golf,
Tanya dreams of barrettes and nail polish. "I do my boys' hair up,"
she said. "I put in lots of gel and spike it up real fancy. I painted
their toes, but my husband said, 'I don't think we're going to start
that.'</TE>
<TE>   "He said: 'You need a girl.' "</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after her visit came the news she had wanted for so
long: She was pregnant. "There was so much desire, and now it's being
fulfilled," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter is due in September.</TE>

<HD>Noncitizens Must Report if They Move</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The Justice Department, citing a 50-year-old
law, demands notification within 10 days of moving. Penalty could be
deportation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Monday that it would require all
noncitizens to report changes of address within 10 days of moving or
risk financial penalties, jail and even deportation.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which relies on a long-neglected 50-year-old law, would
apply to 10 million people older than 14 who are living in the United
States legally but not as American citizens. More than 1 million are
estimated to live in Los Angeles County alone. The new policy also
covers illegal immigrants--said to number 8 million to 9 million
nationally--but few are expected to step forward.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was part of a continuing effort by the federal
government to overhaul the lax and disorganized system of tracking
foreign visitors and residents that had long been in effect before
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   If the plan addressed a widespread concern, it also stirred
anxieties among immigrants that noncitizens are being targeted for
tough law enforcement measures unrelated to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the announcement came just days after the Justice
Department disclosed a precedent-setting agreement with Florida for
local police to play a greater role in enforcing immigration laws to
protect national security.</TE>
<TE>   "To put somebody in deportation proceedings for failing to report
a change of address is like using a nuclear bomb to kill a fly," said
Denyse Sabagh, an immigration lawyer in Washington. "It's definitely
punitive."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Justice Department officials described the plan as
"an important step to enhance border security" and an attempt to
address the problem of noncitizens avoiding removal from this country
by leaving INS officials in the dark about their whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   The INS will update nearly three dozen forms used by immigrants to
notify them of the requirements, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Others wondered whether the beleaguered Immigration and
Naturalization Service was prepared to take on such a demanding and
sensitive responsibility. The INS is often criticized for losing
paperwork or sending notices to the wrong address--miscues that can
greatly complicate legal proceedings involving immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The plan merely gives the INS "more things to lose," said Pedro
Casillas of Mission Hills, who emigrated from Mexico on a work visa.
He said some immigrants so distrust the INS that they would risk
deportation rather than register.</TE>
<TE>   "It's breathtaking," said Judy Golub, director of advocacy at the
American Immigration Lawyers Assn. "In the guise of making us safer,
they're not fixing the problem.... All this system does is make it
easier for people to be charged with violating the law, and the
consequences of violating the law are very clear."</TE>
<TE>   Tessa Gonzalez, 23, who came to Southern California from Indonesia
as a student in 1996, wondered: "Am I going to have to register every
time I change my dorm room?"</TE>
<TE>   The policy comes as the INS and U.S. colleges race to complete a
computerized system to monitor foreign students by next year.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement Monday, Justice Department officials sought to
emphasize that the change-of-address rule had been on the books for
half a century and that violating it is a criminal offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, far too many fail to comply with this existing
requirement," the Justice Department said, adding that the lack of
information "impairs the INS' ability" to conduct deportation
proceedings in many cases, and may also interfere with the agency's
success in informing immigrants of benefits they qualify for.</TE>
<TE>   The policy will apply to noncitizens 15 and older--about 10
million people, including legal noncitizens and refugees, census data
show. A survey by the Urban Institute and UCLA found that about 1.1
million adult noncitizens lived in Los Angeles County legally in
2000, suggesting that more than 1 person in 10 affected by the policy
may be a Los Angeles resident, said Michael Fix, the institute's
director of immigration studies.</TE>
<TE>   Experts were surprised at the scope of the Justice Department's
announcement, wondering how it would be implemented in the field,
where INS officers have often used broad discretion in carrying out
orders from Washington. "Who do you pick and how hard do you hit them
are abiding questions and tough questions," Fix said.</TE>
<TE>   Some viewed the plan as a legitimate effort by the government to
begin to get a handle on the nation's fast-changing and highly mobile
immigrant population.</TE>
<TE>   "The government of the United States should know where aliens are
residing in the United States, who they are and how many of them
there are," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for
Immigration Studies, a restrictionist group in Washington. "And the
fact is we don't."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Krikorian said the new requirement is
politically easier for the Bush administration to impose than a sharp
escalation in sanctions against employers who hire undocumented
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The plan follows a stinging legal defeat for the INS last year. In
that case, the Board of Immigration Appeals court found that the INS
had failed to properly notify a Salvadoran immigrant about its plans
to deport her, even though she had failed to provide the INS with
up-to-date address information. The new requirements are designed to
strengthen the government's legal standing to deport people who are
not in legal status, and they are not an effort to intimidate lawful
immigrants, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottom line--with this rule, the responsibility is with the
noncitizen to ensure that we have the proper address for them, and
not the other way around," a Justice Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement closely follows another tradition-breaking
enforcement plan by the Justice Department, which on Friday disclosed
that it had reached an accord with Florida for "a small and select
group" of local police to enforce immigration laws in concert with
the INS in cases involving terrorism and national security.</TE>
<TE>   Although local Florida police would not engage in routine
immigration enforcement, according to official descriptions of the
agreement, some have questioned whether such a role for local cops
could undermine their relationship with immigrants. Congress in 1996
said the Justice Department could establish such arrangements with
individual states, but the strategy sparked criticism even among some
major urban police departments, including in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Immigration Reform on House Democrats' Minds</HD>
<DH>Politics: 'Earned legalization,' temporary worker program
are part of proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI BEACH</DL>
<LD>Hoping to revive the stalled debate over immigration reform, the
leading House Democrat said Monday that his party soon would
introduce legislation that would allow millions of illegal immigrants
to move toward U.S. citizenship.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech here to the National Council of La Raza, a leading
Latino group, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said
that under the Democratic plan, undocumented immigrants who have been
in the U.S. for at least five years and who have worked for at least
two years could become legal residents if they pass a background
check by the FBI and law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   "These proposals reward hard work with fair play, and help us in
our fight against terrorism," Gephardt said.</LD>
<TE>   Although details remain to be determined, Gephardt said, the plan
would include a new program to import temporary workers from
countries such as Mexico--a top business priority.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of combining a temporary worker program with an "earned
legalization" follows the model that President Bush floated last year
in talks with Mexico. But amid intense resistance to any form of
legalization from many congressional Republican conservatives, Bush
began to back away from the idea late last summer.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Mexican President Vicente Fox appeared to give
immigration reform new life when he visited Washington and pressed
Bush to finalize a plan by the end of 2001. But only a few days
later, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks put the issue on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt's announcement marks the first major effort to revive the
process. The idea still faces intense resistance from those who
consider any path toward legalization for illegal immigrants a form
of amnesty that rewards lawbreaking. And the attacks gave opponents a
powerful new argument in their case, raising security concerns about
legalizing foreigners who illegally entered the country.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Gephardt argued that legalization would
enhance U.S. security by providing officials a clearer picture of the
illegal immigrant population. "This is a way to bring people into a
legal process and give us more sense of who is here and who is
willing to play by the rules and who isn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Negative reaction to the plan was swift. Mark Krikorian, executive
director of the Center for Immigration Studies--a group that supports
reduced immigration--called it an "astonishingly bad idea. It mocks
the rule of law. It rewards lawbreakers. It will encourage more
illegal immigration."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.), a leading congressional foe of
efforts to liberalize legalization rules, dismissed the proposal as
"a backdoor amnesty plan" and a "political ploy" aimed at gaining
Latino support for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt said the plan would be introduced within two weeks. He
acknowledged it has little prospect of passing this year. But it
could give Democrats a valuable calling card with Latino voters
during the fall congressional campaigns and increase pressure on the
Bush administration to specify its own plans.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt "is putting down a marker that we are getting back to the
legalization debate in a serious way," said Cecilia Munoz, La Raza's
vice president for policy.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials, while saying they needed to see more
details, expressed concern that the plan would make it too easy for
illegal immigrants to achieve legal status. The administration has
been considering ideas to require continued employment by illegal
immigrants seeking legalization.</TE>
<TE>   According to House Democratic aides, the party plan will propose
that illegal immigrants from all countries--not just Mexico--be
allowed to pursue legalization. Illegal immigrants would have three
years to apply for legal status. In addition to demonstrating five
years of residency in the United States and two years of work and
passing the background check, they would have to show that they have
paid all state and federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who passed those tests--as well as their spouses and
children--would become a permanent legal resident. Under current law,
permanent residents are eligible to apply for citizenship after five
years.</TE>
<TE>   As Gephardt described it, the House Democratic proposal follows
the same political logic as the plan that Bush first floated last
year. Both approaches envision a "grand compromise" to break the
stalemate on immigration reform.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and business, while urging a temporary worker program,
have generally opposed proposals to allow illegal immigrants to earn
legal status. Democrats, unions and immigrant rights groups want
legalization, but they have opposed temporary worker programs.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Can Represent Self, U.S. Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Trial: Standby defense lawyers contend that the suspected
'20th hijacker' is mentally incompetent. An ex-roommate makes a plea
deal with the FBI.</DH>

<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Monday she has seen no new evidence to question
the mental competency of accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias
Moussaoui, who has pledged to plead guilty this week.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema this month reopened the issue
of Moussaoui's competency to represent himself in the death penalty
case. She ruled last month that he was mentally fit to be his own
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   Brinkema could still revisit the issue at an arraignment Thursday
if Moussaoui's court-appointed standby lawyers present a new report
to bolster their position that Moussaoui is mentally ill.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui attempted to plead guilty last week to a revised
indictment designed to permit use of the federal death penalty.
Brinkema told him to consider the consequences of his actions for a
week, but Moussaoui said he would not change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Further Evaluation</TE>
<TE>   The lead court-appointed lawyer, Frank Dunham Jr., said the
defense team's mental health experts may present additional findings.
Moussaoui has refused to cooperate with the defense experts and with
Dunham's legal team.</TE>
<TE>   The defense experts had sought permission to visit Moussaoui in
the Alexandria Detention Center, asserting that by talking with him
and observing him through his food slot, they could evaluate his
mental health.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the rhetoric in the defendant's ... pleadings has become
increasingly confrontational, the court is not aware of any new
evidence that would support a claim that the defendant is not
mentally competent to proceed ... at this time," the judge said in a
written ruling. Brinkema said the visits "would deprive him of the
limited privacy upon which he has insisted, and to which we believe
he has a legitimate claim."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's handwritten motions have accused Brinkema and the
defense lawyers of plotting to kill him and have demanded that the
judge remove herself from the case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Saudi student who briefly shared a room with
Moussaoui in Oklahoma pleaded guilty Monday to making false
statements, including lying to the FBI about their plans to visit New
York in August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A Chance to Testify</TE>
<TE>   Hussein Al-Attas, 24, entered the plea to seven charges in U.S.
District Court as part of a deal that keeps him in the country to
testify, if needed, against Moussaoui, the only person charged with
conspiring to help the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea agreement, Al-Attas faces up to six months in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The two became roommates in Norman, Okla., after Moussaoui
enrolled at the nearby Airman Flight School. Later, Moussaoui asked
Al-Attas to drive him to a Minneapolis suburb, where he enrolled in
the second flight school.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a Muslim extremist, was arrested Aug. 16 in Eagan,
Minn., after administrators at a flight school became suspicious of
his intense desire to fly jumbo jets despite his poor flying skills.
Al-Attas was taken into custody with Moussaoui for questioning for
two days, released and detained again Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I had planned to travel with him to visit New York, Colorado and
possibly Los Angeles before returning to Norman to pick up my things
for the planned trip to Pakistan," Al-Attas told U.S. District Judge
Michael Mukasey.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado and Los Angeles plans were eventually dropped,
Al-Attas said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Alexander Eisemann described his client, who was
born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to Yemeni parents, as a "fairly naive
man who was trying to help the wrong person at the wrong time."</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Trims Funds for Nuclear Waste Dump</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Senate subcommittee voted Monday to cut more than one-third of the
money President Bush requested for work at the proposed nuclear waste
burial site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The panel, headed by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), a foe of the
storage site, would provide $336 million for preliminary work at the
location, which is 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The president, a
supporter of the plan, proposed $525 million, the same amount a House
version of the bill would provide.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, advocates of the proposed $58-billion project won a
pivotal victory when the Senate voted, 60 to 39, to block Nevada from
vetoing the plan. The House had voted its consent in May.</LD>
<TE>   Reid and other opponents have pledged to keep fighting the project
in the courts and at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The plan envisions burying 77,000 tons of highly radioactive
materials, mostly from power plants in 31 states, under Yucca
Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters hope it will be ready by 2010. The site has been
studied for two decades at a cost of nearly $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A Senate appropriations subcommittee included the reduced
appropriation for the Yucca project in a $26.3-billion bill financing
next year's energy and water projects, which are widely popular among
lawmakers. The overall bill is $800 million above Bush's request and
$1.1 billion over this year's total.</TE>
