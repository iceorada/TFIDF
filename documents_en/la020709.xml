<HD>True to Character</HD>
<DH>At Anime Expo, 15,000 fans, some of whom dressed the part,
gathered to buy--and bond</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regular girls with "boring day jobs," Judy Grivich and Kelly Bolton
were "glomped" by fans and stopped for photographs hundreds of times
over the weekend. Dressed as Hand Maid May and Cyberdoll
Sara--characters from the Japanese animation series "Hand Maid
May"--the San Jose roommates were minor celebrities as they walked
the aisles of the 11th annual Anime Expo; Grivich in a hot-pink
pinafore and apron, a wall-plug hanging out from under her fluffy
white petticoat, and Bolton in a black satin gown and corset,
clutching an empty plastic ramen bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Bolton, a 26-year-old administrative assistant, and Grivich, a
27-year-old bank employee, were among 15,000 die-hard anime fans, or
otaku, who attended last weekend's expo in Long Beach--a four-day
convention that celebrates all aspects of Japanese pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been into anime for a really long time when I used to rush
home from school to watch 'Star Blazers,' " said Bolton, who used the
show to make a convert out of her roommate. "It's like a drug. Show
them something really simple that's easy to get into, and then you
hook 'em."</LD>
<TE>   Some otaku were at the expo to snap pictures and collect
autographs from fellow fans who, like Grivich and Bolton, came to the
convention dressed as their favorite animated characters. One woman
used her T-shirt to collect signatures. Another woman's blue jeans
were covered with inky scrawls.</TE>
<TE>   Others were there to watch the fast and flashy videos that
screened around the clock, to sing karaoke-style late into the night
or to test their motor skills on various shoot-'em-up video games.
Most came with cash and credit cards, hoping to snatch up manga
(Japanese comic books), rare art cels, pop CDs and new videos.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett Davidson, 22, already owns $10,000 worth of anime videos
and DVDs, but that didn't stop him from spending $500 and maxing out
his credit card to purchase even more.</TE>
<TE>   "We're above average, but there are people that extremely out-do
us," said Davidson, who, with two of his friends, drove 1,300 miles
in less than 24 hours to feast his eyes on all things anime over the
four-day holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Like many otaku, he and his friends are attracted to the aesthetic
of anime, but also its creative and evolved story lines. Unlike
American cartoons, which are complete stories in and of themselves,
anime series must be watched in sequence and sometimes have hundreds
of episodes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like cartoons, but it's a lot more serious," said Davidson,
who recalls staying up for two days without sleep to watch the entire
"Slayer" series. "It's geared toward a higher age level with the
character development, the plot."</TE>
<TE>   American animation is still primarily geared toward children, but
anime is made for people of all ages and interests, running the gamut
from preschool "Pokemon"-type material to adult-oriented hentai.
Series like "Sailor Moon," about a schoolgirl with superpowers, have
a strong following with women, whereas shows like "Trigun," about an
outlaw with a $60-billion bounty on his head who accidentally foils
everyone's plans to kill him, appeal to both genders.</TE>
<TE>   At Suncoast, a video and DVD store that had set up shop at the
expo, "His &amp; Her," a he-said-she-said romance about two competitive
students who fall in love, was selling like hot cakes. So was "Excel
Saga," a comedy about a girl who joins a club that plots to take over
a city.</TE>
<TE>   The three major anime production studios--Bandai, ADV and
Pioneer--were all screening their latest videos before blissed-out
fans who sat in beanbag chairs and lay on the carpet to take it all
in. Meanwhile, other exhibit-goers dressed in "Got Manga?" T-shirts
wandered the aisles, emptying their wallets so they could stuff their
plastic bags with Astro Boy action figures and books on how to draw.</TE>
<TE>   Anime first came to the U.S. in the '60s, with shows like "Kimba
the White Lion" and "Speed Racer," but it wasn't until 1989 with the
animated film "Akira" that anime began to take off and until 1999
with the wildly popular "Pokemon" movie that it began to gain
mainstream acceptance. Today, anime is shown on the Cartoon Network
and Fox Kids, and videos are sold at Blockbuster and Tower Records.</TE>
<TE>   Its popularity is mirrored in the expo's attendance. In 1992, when
it began, 1,200 people attended. The average age was 25 to 35. About
85% were male, according to Mike Tatsugawa, the 34-year-old founder
of the expo. This year, more than 15,000 people attended. The average
age had dropped, ranging from 13 to 18; the genders were evenly
divided.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God! Did you make this?" asked a breathless teenage girl,
running up to expo attendee Jon Lubbe and grabbing the plush toy from
his hand. Lubbe, 27, was dressed as an obscure anime character and
was holding a stuffed animal from an even more obscure program.</TE>
<TE>   The two had never seen one another before this moment, still, they
bonded seamlessly.</TE>

<LD>Winona Ryder's criminal case has inspired yet another tongue-in-cheek
hommage. This one will take place in a West Hollywood theater with
Ryder portrayed by actor Rex Lee. "My Name is Winona and I'm a
Shoplifter" opens Monday at the Zephyr Theater in West Hollywood.
It's the creation of playwright Michael Kearns, who claims to have
been so moved by Ryder's life that he is writing a one-man show about
it.</LD>
<LD>   (Ryder, accused of shoplifting $4,760 in merchandise from Saks
Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills last December, is scheduled to stand
trial on felony charges of grand theft, burglary, vandalism and
possession of drugs without a prescription. In June, she pleaded not
guilty to the charges.)</LD>
<LD>   The play is set in a 12-step meeting and features the Ryder
character confessing to having shoplifted and also professing her
interest in dating the producer/man-about-town Steve Bing. She
discusses her friendships with the late Timothy Leary and makeup
artist Kevin Aucoin and, at one point, reads the abysmal reviews of
her current film "Mr. Deeds." "I couldn't avoid the fact that she's a
tragic figure and that's why we laugh at her," said Kearns. "It's our
tragedy that we're laughing at. I could identify with some of her
pain."</LD>
<TE>   The play opens the evening after the actress' scheduled pretrial
hearing in Beverly Hills Superior Court and runs through Aug. 5.
After that, it moves to Theater A @ Studio A in Silver Lake, and will
run Fridays through the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   Beach Brawl</TE>
<TE>   The city of Malibu has taken the side of David Geffen in the
battle between the producer and environmentalists over public access
to the beach in front of Geffen's home.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists for months have fought to open a path next to
Geffen's Carbon Beach home that would allow the public to walk from
Pacific Coast Highway to the sand. In January, the California Coastal
Commission and the California Conservancy granted the nonprofit group
Access for All the authority to adopt the walkway and see that it
opens to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the producer and the city filed a lawsuit last
Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against the group and the two
state agencies. According to the suit, the agencies violated state
law by failing to create a statewide plan for coastal public access
and by failing to conduct required environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   The city, which is legally culpable for the access way, says the
agencies acted irresponsibly. "The trouble with the haphazard, ad-hoc
way it's being done now is that resources are being put into opening
access ways where there is no parking, restrooms or lifeguards," said
Malibu City Atty. Christi Hogin. " ... It's in our interest that when
an access way is opened that it's safe and convenient for the
public."</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, Geffen has also objected to a state policy that in
1983 required him to open to the public a portion of his beach
property in exchange for a permit to add 950 square feet to his
house. Geffen claims that a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision finding
such arrangements unconstitutional exempts him from relinquishing the
access way.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, the pathway has remained blocked by a
wooden fence and gate. Members of Access for All could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Elivra Comes to Life</TE>
<TE>   Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, arrived in her macabre mobile at the
Laemmle Fairfax Cinemas just before midnight Saturday. Hundreds of
dedicated Elvira fans (and look-alikes) crowded the sidewalk, lining
up for a showing of her new movie, "Elvira's Haunted Hills."</TE>
<TE>   "Elvira has a huge following: a gay crowd, a goth crowd and the
'Rocky Horror' crowd," said Cassandra Peterson about her alter ego's
motley fan base. "It spans several generations, [but] it's an ardent
fan base like William Shatner's 'Star Trek' fans."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, who got her start in 1981 introducing horror movies on
KHJ-TV Channel 9 in Los Angeles, wrote the horror comedy spoof.</TE>
<TE>   She spent more than a decade trying to get Hollywood interested in
a sequel to the original 1988 cult movie, "Elvira, Mistress of the
Dark." The new movie, directed by Sam Irvin, was shot in Romania.
Peterson and her husband financed it by taking out another mortgage
on their home and borrowing from relatives. The couple also handled
their own advertising, handing out fliers in local stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't let Elvira fade," said Peterson, who has dedicated
the better part of her professional career to the character.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, which takes place in the 1850s, Elvira leaves a
Carpathian village to star in a Paris revue only to end up in a
mysterious, medieval castle inhabited by a sinister lord whose
long-dead wife bears an eerie resemblance to Elvira.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Chamberlain was originally cast as the lord but had to
back out when he got an offer that would actually pay, said Peterson.
Instead, Peterson and her husband lured Richard O'Brien, who wrote
"The Rocky Horror Show" (he plays Riff Raff in the movie) to play the
part. And that's not the only draw for aficionados of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   "We have special effects too, but they're not so special," she
said. "We couldn't afford them."</TE>

<LD>GIRL FROM THE SOUTH</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Joanna Trollope</LD>
<TE>   Viking</TE>
<TE>   304 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "Chick flick" is the term, often used pejoratively, to describe
those films that attract a predominantly female audience. Typically
told from a woman's perspective, these films tend to highlight
relationships over plot-driven action, use either internal monologues
or heart-to-heart conversations to reveal motivations and portray
character development and often include some kind of tear-inducing
scene as a cathartic release. Certain books follow this same model.
Joanna Trollope's "Girl From the South" treads this feminine
territory with a degree of lyricism, energetic writing and sharp
imagery. However, the novel doesn't address the deepest complexities
at the heart of human relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Gillon Stokes is the title's girl from the South, a nearly
30-year-old woman in Charleston, S.C., who works as an art museum
intern but can't quite make the leap to a full-fledged career in art
conservation. She hasn't found the perfect man to settle down with
and watches as her younger sister Ashley effortlessly meets all the
Southern expectations of feminine roles: a husband, a home, a baby on
the way. Gillon can meet none of these and isn't sure she wants to.
Ready for a change in scenery and urged by her boss to explore new
opportunities, she prepares for a job in London with a small firm
specializing in the conservation of Italian Renaissance paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tilly and Henry, a couple on the far side of the
Atlantic, are stalled out in their relationship. Tilly wants Henry to
propose but Henry isn't ready for that kind of commitment. Their
lives are populated with equally unrooted friends. The comparison
makes for a tidy juxtaposition: Gillon's clannish family and Southern
life on one hand, the rootlessness of urban London on the other.
Enter Gillon on the London scene, and the heart-to-heart talks about
relationships, the tears-held-back scenes and the soul-searching take
off.</TE>
<TE>   The plot revolves around questions of relationship: Will Tilly
succeed in getting Henry to marry her? Will Gillon find a man or
career of her own? Will Ashley overthrow the expectations placed on
her or succumb to them? Will Gillon and Tilly heal the childhood
wounds that still constrain each of them?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a woman," Gillon's mother, Martha, says at one point, " ...
and women don't, as a rule, identify themselves primarily by what
they do, what their career is. That's very satisfactory, a career, to
a lot of women, but women measure themselves by their relationships,
they identify themselves that way." This is an interesting comment
from a woman who's shunned expectations to become a psychiatrist and
has put career goals above familial roles, but British author
Trollope ("Next of Kin") doesn't address that discrepancy, nor the
undercurrents running beneath these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Though the writing is strong, the story is predictable. From the
moment we meet each character, none of whom are eccentric or terribly
unusual, we can see how and why they are stalled in their lives. We
watch as they untangle life lessons, employing therapy-speak to help
each other through as they come into their own as mature individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, we can only feel a sense of place ... from the
outside," Gillon is told before taking off for London. "It's not your
fault. It's not Mama's fault. It's not my fault. It's the tension ...
between being an individual and being part of a collective," Gillon
advises Ashley when postpartum depression hits.</TE>
<TE>   That thoughtful, deep novels of true artistic merit can be written
about women and their relationships was proven most recently by Mona
Simpson's "Off Keck Road." Not much happens in the way of extreme
plot occurrences; rather, the book limns the quiet lives of friends
and family members getting older and staying put, but in doing so,
plumbs the intricacies of human relationships.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, "Girl From the South" is perfect beach reading,
offering feel-good-about-yourself platitudes, abundant character
anguish over the guy that got away and comforting plot resolutions.
It's the consummate chick flick for the page.</TE>

<LD>The four-block radius around downtown's San Julian and 5th streets is
stage to some of the most desperate human drama in Los Angeles. But
for two hours every Tuesday it also becomes the stage for old jazz
standards.</LD>
<LD>   For a little more than a month now, Ravi Knypstra and Zane Musa
have used their Mittenwald upright bass and soprano sax,
respectively, to provide a musical oasis from the misery-soaked
sidewalks of Skid Row.</LD>
<LD>   Missing from their routine is the usual busker's tip tin. Both
professional musicians, Knypstra and Musa are not asking for the
audience's pocket change. The audience's reaction is sufficient
reward.</LD>
<TE>   "I've played in some of the biggest halls in town and most of the
jazz clubs, and it's really difficult to get an audience to listen
properly," says Knypstra. Who knew that he'd have to go to Skid Row
to find the ideal fans? "They are an amazingly fantastic audience.
Not only do they know the tunes, but they know who wrote them and
when the lyrics were written. They clap after the solos and after
every tune. Those people understand jazz."</TE>
<TE>   Businessman and community activist Alan Bloch organized and
financed the performances after seeing the despondency of downtown
street people. "I don't have a solution for despair like that. But I
thought at least as a minimum people should be entertained," says
Bloch. He heard Knypstra and Musa play on Larchmont and asked if
they'd be willing to participate in his "experiment." "I didn't have
a plan in mind with the exception of 'Let's see what happens.' "</TE>
<TE>   While both are busy full-time musicians--Knypstra gigs regularly
with Sonolux at the King King in Hollywood and Musa leads a weekly
jazz jam at Sonny's Spot in Leimert Park--they didn't hesitate. At 2
p.m. every Tuesday, Knypstra and Musa meet under the jacaranda trees
in San Julian Park, plug in an amplifier next to the angel statue and
jam. This pocket park is furnished with a fresh-cut patch of grass
and about 15 sheltered chess tables around which groups of mostly men
stoop and holler.</TE>
<TE>   A man on a nearby bench is the first to notice the musicians. He
seems mystified by the Mittenwald. "Who invented the cello?" he asks
Knypstra, indicating his bass. Knypstra doesn't know the inventor,
only that the bass originated in Italy about 500 years ago. The
answer apparently tickles the man, who breaks into uncontrollable
giggles.</TE>
<TE>   Knypstra and Musa begin the set with John Coltrane's classic
"Equinox." World-weary postures perk up. Chess players pause
mid-move. "I've never seen anything like it before in my life and I'm
62 years old," says Louis Hill, passing through on his bicycle. "They
are good!"</TE>
<TE>   Between songs, audience members hike over to the musicians to pay
respects. An elderly lady hooks Knypstra by the arm and coos, "Honey,
you just took me back home. I'm from New Orleans; you took me to the
French Quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Across from the musicians, volunteers from the Minority AIDS
Project conduct HIV tests as they do every Tuesday. They've already
done 15 this day. "The challenge is getting them to return for the
results," says outreach consultant Carolyn Martin as she hands out
condoms while grooving to Herbie Hancock's "Watermelon Man." She says
the music is an incentive for her to return week after week and hopes
it will encourage the at-risk patients to return as well. "It makes
the atmosphere more relaxed," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Something is missing: percussion. But soon the gap is filled by
Musa's brother, Chance Taylor, and his amazingly swift tap-dancing
feet. Taylor, who has danced with Savion Glover, among others, slips
into a tap-induced trance as he interprets the music. He taps with
his whole body. A young girl stands agape. Social workers peer over
in disbelief. So absorbed is he that he doesn't seem to notice a
fresh laceration on his ankle. He keeps dancing. A young man with
grass in his hair ambles by, stopping in front of the trio. Though he
seems barely to have the strength to stand straight, he suddenly
performs a short but lively Mexican folk dance then continues on his
way. Taylor nods in approval.</TE>
<TE>   A security guard from the park cuts through the crowd. Although
they have permission from the park's operator, the musicians wait out
a moment of tension, wondering if they are about to get booted. But
the guard smiles widely and instead of a ticket, he hands Taylor a
frosty bottle of water to tend his ankle then gives them all a hearty
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Bloch says he hopes the music will inspire street people to drum
up confidence and maybe even start their own band. He's encouraged by
the initial response. "There is so much life down there."</TE>
<TE>   Practicing his dance moves to the music, one old-timer echoes the
sentiment: "I may be in Skid Row, but I ain't down."</TE>

<LD>Ancient Jewelry</LD>
<LD>   Long ago, jewelry was a popular luxury item, just as it is today.
This wreath of flowers and leafy branches was made in ancient
Macedonia about 2,300 years ago, using materials and techniques that
have been very popular throughout time. It was crafted from sheet
gold and gold wire, with some of the flowers inlaid with blue and
green glass to give a shimmering, colorful effect. As light and
fragile as aluminum foil, this very delicate wreath was probably not
worn in daily life, but would have been put in a grave with its
owner.</LD>
<LD>   The ancient Romans loved to wear jewels, too, but women were not
the only ones who owned jewelry. Signet rings were very popular with
Roman men. These rings had a carved surface design or picture that
could be pressed into soft, warm wax to leave an imprint that would
stand for the owner's signature.</LD>
<TE>   Young children, particularly boys, owned charm necklaces to
protect them from evil and illness.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this wreath and other ancient jewelry at the J. Paul
Getty Museum. The museum invites children ages 12 and younger to stop
by the information desk in the entrance hall and receive a free
pewter Roman double-headed snake ring.</TE>
<TE>   You can also sign up for one of the Family Art Adventures, held at
2 p.m. daily, when a museum gallery teacher leads families on a tour
of the galleries. Sign-ups begin at 1:30, and the tours begin at the
information desk in the museum entrance hall.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300
or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sunday or after 4 p.m. on weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   This Learning Link was provided by the J. Paul Getty Museum, at

Angeles.</TE>

<LD>* My favorite amusement park is at the Orange County Fair. My
favorite ride is the swings because they go really high and you can
see the whole amusement park.</LD>
<LD>   --Breanna, 8</LD>
<LD>   Westmont Elementary Summer School</LD>

<TE>   * My favorite theme park ride is the roller coaster California
Screamin'. It's at California Adventure. When I'm on it, I have
butterflies in my stomach. I like the roller coaster so much because
there's a loop, steep falls and sharp turns.</TE>
<TE>   --Noelle, 10</TE>
<TE>   Harbor Magnet Elementary</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Space Mountain at Disneyland. It is really
scary and short. I like it because it makes you feel like you're in
outer space.</TE>
<TE>   --Gina, 11</TE>
<TE>   Verdugo Woodlands Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Splash Mountain at the one and only
Disneyland. It makes me feel brave because my 45-year-old mom (who is
terrified) is squeezing me as tight as she can. (I know, 45, I don't
get it either.) I love the ride because of the cool puppets and the
big drop that comes unexpectedly. The drop makes everybody scream and
go wild.</TE>
<TE>   --Ashley, 10</TE>

<TE>   * My favorite is Supreme Scream at Knott's Berry Farm. It makes me

<HD>The Sweet Life</HD>
<DH>Business is booming at Mashti Malone's, where ice cream
takes on the delicious and exotic flavors of its co-owners' native
Iran</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sign catches your eye first. It stands near the corner of Sunset
and La Brea in Hollywood, a giant black square with a scramble of
ethnic elements that look like they were blown from the streets below
by the winds: There is the delicate scrawl of Persian, some English,
a bit o' the Irish. Mashti Malone's Ice Cream, it says. Atop the sign
a big ice cream cone leans precariously against a giant clover.</LD>
<LD>   It heralds an Iranian ice cream parlor, with flavors so exotic
they sound like poetry, and ingredients that sound as if they must
have been harvested from a Persian garden. The flavors, which cost
$3.95 a pint, have names like Creamy Rosewater, Rosewater Saffron,
Ginger Rosewater, Rosewater Sorbet and Orange Blossom. Then there is
the Mashti, a $2 ice cream sandwich--a scoop of ice cream squished
between two thin wafers, rolled in fresh pistachios.</LD>
<LD>   The store belongs to two brothers, Mashti, 51, and Mehdi Shirvani,
37, who grew up Mashhad, a small town in northern Iran. "We are not
Malones," says Mehdi, the lively younger brother, and salesman of the
joint. "Do I look like a Malone?"</LD>
<TE>   The multicultural name is merely a product of the layers of
history that accumulate in mini-malls around this city, as owner
after owner stamps his personality on the establishment, leaving an
erratic record that will confound archeologists of the future when
they try to piece together Los Angeles at the turn of the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   The soft-spoken Mashti, ice cream genius of the duo, bought the
establishment in 1980. At the time, it was an ice cream store called
Mugsy Malone. "I didn't have enough money to change it, so I just
added Mashti," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers do happen to have a sister-in-law by the name of
Malone, who lives in Cape Cod and is married to their older brother,
Iraj. When Mashti bought the store, he told her they bought it for
her, which made her laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the name is so outlandish that a group of filmmakers who
were shooting in the mini-mall in 1983 and took a shine to Mashti
wrote "The Legend of Mashti Malone," whose fanciful verses now grace
the walls of the cheerful shop:</TE>
<TE>   "Once in a time and a place little known,</TE>
<TE>   lived an old farmer named Mashti Malone.</TE>
<TE>   And though he worked his poor hands to the bone</TE>
<TE>   Nothing would grow in his hands except stone ... "</TE>
<TE>   The Shirvani family has been in the food and ice cream business
for more than 70 years. Mashti has been making ice cream since he was
a child. By ninth grade, he was running the family shop in Iran. In
those days, they didn't even have old-fashioned ice cream makers. Men
with iron bars beat the ingredients in barrels until the ice cream
was perfect. "The people who were beating the ice cream had no
necks," Mashti recalls. "Just a head and shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   He came to the United States in 1978 to study electronics. He
worked as a chef in various restaurants and even opened a restaurant
of his own, but he had to return to ice cream, his first love.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice cream is much better," Mashti says. "Ice cream is happy
business."</TE>
<TE>   Initially the store sold almost all of its ice cream wholesale, to
more than 300 Persian and Armenian restaurants whose customers love
the Rosewater flavors that reminded them of home. ("Rose water is the
No. 1 dessert flavoring in the Middle East," said Mehdi, who joined
his brother here in 1988. "It's just like vanilla here.")</TE>
<TE>   But sometime in the late '90s, after an intense one-on-one
marketing push to persuade every non-Iranian who walked into the ice
cream store to try it, people in the neighborhood started catching
on. "We didn't take the retail part of our business very seriously
until we saw them react," said Medhi. "Everyone thinks of their
grandmother's perfume, of soap, of air fresheners. Now we tell them,
'We know this is going to remind you of your grandmother's
perfume....' Once they try it, they are hooked." Indeed, 60% of the
shop's retail customers are non-Persian, up from 5% just three years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has been through ups and downs in the last two decades,
and the Shirvanis weathered years when many small businesses went
under. Today, Mashti Malone's, which is two doors down from the Lava
Lounge, is a fixture in the neighborhood, satisfying locals who flock
to the store on weekends. Over the years, the little shop has become
a community center of sorts for immigrants missing the sweet tastes
of home. The Shirvanis said Hollywood redevelopment has boosted
business, which has never been better.</TE>
<TE>   After the Food Channel did a segment on Mashti Malone in April,
calls poured in from all over the country--Hawaii, Maine, Vermont,
Alabama--demanding shipments of the exotic flavors. The brothers have
launched a Web site (www.mashti.com) and will mail the ice cream
anywhere in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the brothers plan to open an ice cream plant in Garden
Grove to help satisfy the ever-increasing demand. They'll be able to
produce up to 2,000 gallons a day at the new facility; up from the
mere 100 gallons of ice cream they churn out in the chilly,
200-square-foot chamber in the rear of the store. The shop's machines
are so old that the last repairman who came to fix one burst out
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in the ice cream inner sanctum, the walls are lined with
containers of cardamom, rose water, a secret spice mix, pistachios,
and a $950 tin of "red gold," the best Persian saffron. Except for
the ice, the cream and the sugar, all ingredients for the exotic
flavors are imported. From Iran, if possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on the political situation," says Mehdi. "If there are
no sanctions in Iran, our relatives will do it. If not, we have a lot
of different sources in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Mashti is the ice cream alchemist, constantly refining his
flavors. He incorporated the starchy noodles used in a favorite
Persian dessert into a light rose sorbet to make what many think is
the freshest-tasting flavor on the menu (it's called faludeh). The
concoction is eaten with a squirt of lemon juice and a dash of sour
cherry, and is so refreshing it could inspire an overheated tourist
to walk another 50 stars down Hollywood Boulevard. Mashti also
created orange blossom ice cream. Currently he is honing his
rosewater ginger; he wants it to be strong enough for Persians but
not overpowering to the more sensitive American palate.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think?" he asked a visitor. "Is it too strong?"</TE>
<TE>   One recent day, he and his assistant Sonia Castro made the staple:
Creamy Rosewater. First they stirred the special mixture of cream in
a big bucket. Then they dumped in the rosewater. Twenty minutes
later, the machine churned out in a milky cascade. They stirred in
the ice chips by hand. Before they put it in the freezer they offered
a taste.</TE>
<TE>   The final stanza of "The Legend of Mashti Malone" drifted through
their visitor's head, as the silky ice cream melted on her tongue:</TE>
<TE>   Rosewater ice cream,  your tastebuds will moan.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens more flavors, each great on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Guaranteed to put you in the heaven zone.</TE>
<TE>   So goes the legend of Mashti Malone.</TE>

<LD>A big, British "here, here" to Wimbledon champion Serena Williams.
Congratulations on not only the title but the in-your-face look in
athletic head wear, right there on stuffy Centre Court, right there
in front of the royals--a silver tiara, studded with pearls and
Swarovski crystals.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 20, wore the tiara during all of her matches last week
in London, including the finals competition on Saturday against her
22-year-old sister, Venus. The press loved the symbolism: Little
sister wants to be queen. Or, quite possibly, Serena Williams is
after something a little less scary, a little more girlie.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who grew up in Compton and is studying fashion design,
is known for her hip court look, which has included long, blond hair
threaded with beads. She unveiled a new look at the French Open last
month, when she played a match in shiny black-and-gold dress, gold
sneakers and a tiara, which strikes us as more "Saturday Night
Fever"-ish than Windsor Castle-esque. Then Williams pronounced
herself "spangly dangly," which, in our view, is all good. She told
reporters she would miss her gold shoes at Wimbledon, which requires
players to wear all white. "Accessorize, accessorize, accessorize,"
she advised.</LD>
<TE>   We are tired of ugly head wear in sports. Thanks to Williams,
sweat-sopping headbands and bandanna wraps are so yesterday. Stamp a
swoosh mark on some unisex faux tiaras and get them to market.
(Williams' tiara, which she picked up at a Wimbledon village shop,
was designed by a company called Irresistible, according to the Daily
Telegraph newspaper in London). Think of the possibilities: a
bauble-free, lighter version for runners; a rhinestone-studded
heavier crown for the kind of mountaineer who heads into stiff winds
and wants to look good.</TE>
<TE>   It's really an athlete's dream to own multi-tasking sports gear,
the kind that flows from day into night. On Sunday, for instance,
Williams showed up for the Champions' Dinner at the Savoy Hotel in
London wearing a white, decollete-revealing gown--and, what else, a
spangly, dangly tiara.</TE>

<HD>Leaving a Legacy of Life Lessons and Values</HD>
<DH>Trends* More people are drafting 'ethical wills,' in which
they leave words of wisdom in addition to possessions to their heirs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The yogurt mogul wanted to vanish into the chair in his lawyer's
office. On the pages before him early this year, the cold, impersonal
language of his final will and testament screamed out. He
particularly disliked the term "issue" to describe his three
children.</LD>
<LD>   Right then, Gary Hirshberg decided to "bring some humanity" to a
document that would outlive him. In drawing up an "ethical will," the
chief executive of Stonyfield Farms Yogurt joined a small but growing
movement to bequeath values and life experiences along with material
assets.</LD>
<LD>   Updating an ancient model, one or two simple pages--handwritten,
tapped out on a computer or videotaped--can offer thoughts for future
generations, extended histories of families or businesses and
explanations for life choices that were never discussed before. Some
use the occasion of impending death to pour out their souls on paper,
but most ethical wills are written by healthy, middle-aged adults.
Unlike conventional testaments, moreover, ethical wills often are
read aloud or played while the authors are still alive. Family
members may even help edit them.</LD>
<TE>   Those who pen these personal essays point out that modern medicine
means many people die tethered to tubes, unable to speak. Scattered
families make scenes of deathbed reconciliation precious and rare.
Those who are drafting ethical wills say a written document
guarantees that important messages will be conveyed.</TE>
<TE>   "I especially wanted to be sure that any money that is left comes
with the message of why--and how--it was earned," said Hirsh- berg,
47, of Concord, N.H. "It was an opportunity to reach across the
generations and put me and my intentions and my soul into full view
of anybody who cares to read it."</TE>
<TE>   Also known as legacy statements, ethical wills date to the Old
Testament story of Jacob, who bestowed a blessing on each of his 12
children before he died. On a small scale, the concept was
rediscovered about five years ago. But since January, at least one
book about ethical wills has been published, a Web site is thriving
and consultants are teaming up with attorneys and financial planners
to include ethical wills in estate packages.</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking Their Ethics</TE>
<TE>   Some baby boomers--members of a generation that long has prided
itself on doing things differently--are embracing ethical wills as a
way to put a personal mark on life's grand finale. Many say the Enron
debacle and other corporate scandals have made middle-aged
businesspeople rethink their own codes of ethics. The terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 also boosted interest in ethical wills, affording
both a reminder of life's fragility and an incentive to pass along
lessons that can grate when delivered at the dinner table.
Encompassed in an ethical will, advocates maintain, these same
admonitions become loving and sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Children of any age tend to tune out when parents give them
advice, said Kenneth Grundfast, a Boston physician. "There is too
much of it over too many years, and it loses its impact because it is
daily," said Grundfast, 58, whose own ethical will focuses on "the
importance of honesty, the importance of giving to others, and the
treachery of getting involved in little falsehoods or little
financial subterfuges."</TE>
<TE>   These personal testaments have no legal standing--and, in fact,
some argue, could confuse or even contradict the distribution of
tangible possessions through an official will. There is also the risk
that an ethical will can resemble a voice of reproach from the grave:
the last big I-told-you-so.</TE>
<TE>   But many lawyers are nevertheless encouraging clients to
supplement traditional testaments with an ethical will. Many who have
written them say they feel good about leaving behind something that
their heirs won't have reason to fight about.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," Hirshberg said, "the elegance of this whole idea
was in its simplicity. It was so obvious, and the process was so
satisfying. I just sat down and sort of burst it all out. Now it is a
living document."</TE>
<TE>   Because ethical wills are not officially recorded, no one can say
for sure how popular they are. In Minneapolis, Dr. Barry K. Baines
said that when he first began discussing ethical wills with hospice
patients about five years ago, they looked at him blankly. Baines
recalled explaining the idea to one indigent patient who worried that
after he died, "there would be no trace of him left on this Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Baines, who had stumbled across the idea in a library book, told
him: "There's this thousands-of-years-old tradition--people can
bequeath their values. Everyone has hopes and dreams. You don't have
to be educated or successful."</TE>
<TE>   The patient, a man in his late 40s, had a family he loved very
much, Baines said. But he had little money and only a few meager
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   "The man grabbed on to this the way a drowning person would grab a
life preserver," Baines said.</TE>
<TE>   Launched a Web Site</TE>
<TE>   Soon Baines was promoting ethical wills at medical meetings and
traveling the country to host workshops. He launched a Web site
(www.ethicalwill.com) and in January published a guidebook, "Ethical
Wills" (Perseus).</TE>
<TE>   He said he senses an increased urgency, driven partly by the
tragic events of Sept. 11. But Baines, 51, noted also that as they
lose their own parents, the same boomers who vowed never to trust
anyone over 30 are feeling the cold hand of mortality on their
shoulders. As part of that group, Baines wrote an ethical will four
years ago and presented it to his then-teenage daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "When you share it while you are still alive, it makes you live
your life more deliberately," he said. "Even if it is just with your
family, you have kind of gone public with what you believe and what
you stand for. Then you kind of have to start living that way."</TE>
<TE>   But Colin Wied, an estate lawyer in San Diego, said he worries
that an emotion-filled attachment to a traditional testament "sets
the stage for the will to be contested."</TE>
<TE>   Wied said that when clients want to include an explanation for
gifts in their wills, "I strongly discourage it. I would not want to
do anything that could raise any kind of doubt over the validity of
the will."</TE>
<TE>   An impassioned personal statement could fuel questions about the
author's competency, Wied said, "lending credence to the idea that
maybe the old guy lost his marbles." More to the point, he wondered,
"why, if parents have something important to say, don't they just
bring the kids into the room and tell them in person?"</TE>
<TE>   But Marcia Brier, the founder of Family Legacy Services in Boston,
said some people are just not comfortable revealing themselves in
life. Though they have much to say, they worry that children and
grandchildren "will not care about the ramblings of an old man or
woman," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Brier--who with her partner, psychologist Carol M. Kauffman,
has drafted scores of ethical wills for clients from 30 to 80--said
"even in families with long histories of conflict, that could not be
further from the truth. If the words can be spoken and written with
love and with the intent to guide and support, they are almost
inevitably welcome and valuable."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Kaplan of Boulder, Colo., said his late wife, Bettina
Brickell, left behind a letter that was read at her memorial service.
Even now, 11 years later, Kaplan said he often rereads a document she
dictated at age 29 because she was too ill with melanoma to write it
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "When she wrote it, I don't think we had heard the phrase 'ethical
will.' But that's what it was," said Kaplan, a psychology professor.
"I have gone back to it often," he said, "because it condenses what
is important. It is kind of a grounding thing for me. Any time I am
losing perspective, I just take it out and read it."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan said he has shared Tina's letter with his new wife, and
when their two young children grow older, he will read it to them as
well. He allowed the document to be posted on the ethical wills Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   "I have profoundly experienced that love is all that matters,"
Tina Brickell wrote days before the cancer claimed her. "Like many
people, I occasionally got caught in my pettiness and separation,
thinking I knew the right answer. I judged others and I have judged
myself even more harshly. But I have learned that we carry within
ourselves the abundant wisdom and love to heal our weary heart and
judgmental mind."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Kaplan admitted, "it makes me teary. But it's a very
uplifting and positive message."</TE>

<LD>Brian, Heather and Alexandra continued walking as they ate their ice
cream bars. The day was hot. The ice cream was good.</LD>
<LD>   "Where is everybody?" Heather asked as she looked around at the
silent neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "You're right," Brian said. "The houses seem normal enough, but
there are no kids playing, nobody watering his lawn, nobody driving
by."</LD>
<TE>   "It's too hot to do anything," Alexandra said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon each of them had nothing left but a stick. "Looks just like a
regular, old wooden ice cream stick to me," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it is," Alexandra said as she turned the stick over in
her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait," Heather said. "Look at this." She held up her stick.</TE>
<TE>   Written on the stick in curly, silver letters were the words,
"Magic Stick."</TE>
<TE>   Brian turned his stick over again and was excited to discover that
he had a magic stick, too. So did Alexandra.</TE>
<TE>   "How do they work?" Heather asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," Brian said. "Maybe you are supposed to wish on
them."</TE>
<TE>   "Silly kids. They don't work at all. It's just an advertising
gimmick."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to try," Heather said. "What should we wish for?"</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I were home," Brian replied. "I've had enough adventure
for one day."</TE>
<TE>   "Me, too." Heather held her stick in both hands, and closed her
eyes. "I wish Brian and Alex and I were home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Try rubbing it while you wish," Brian suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish Brian and Alex and I were home," Heather said again, while
rubbing her magic stick.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing happened.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Alex is right," Heather said. "I don't think these are
magic sticks at all."</TE>
<TE>   "Listen," Brian said. "What's that?"</TE>
<TE>   Far in the distance they heard circus music. And it seemed to be
getting closer.</TE>

<HD>Digital's 'Tadpole' Phase</HD>

<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Gary Winick took Sigourney Weaver to lunch at the Payard Bistro
here, he simply wanted her to star in his new film, "Tadpole." But he
did even better. The actress not only agreed to take the part, but
snagged the restaurant as a location for a key scene in the film.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to shoot a scene where the women in the film have tea
at the Plaza Hotel," Winick recalled over lunch at a considerably
more downscale eatery around the corner from his mixing studio. "And
Sigourney said, 'What about this place?' And before I knew it, she'd
introduced herself to the manager and got him to agree to let us
shoot there."</LD>
<LD>   Due in theaters July 19, "Tadpole" is a clever coming-of-age
comedy about a precocious 15-year-old schoolboy (portrayed by Aaron
Stanford) who becomes infatuated with Weaver, his fortysomething
stepmother. Shot in 14 days for $200,000, the film was the Cinderella
story of this year's Sundance Film Festival, where it was a hit with
critics and audiences, setting off a bidding war that culminated in a
$5-million sale to Miramax.</LD>
<TE>   The film's success is a long-awaited triumph for Winick, who's
been scuffling on the indie-film fringes for years. After attending
the American Film Institute in the 1980s, where he produced a thesis
film for Carl Franklin, Winick has directed five obscure movies, none
of which had gotten into Sundance, much less made any real money.</TE>
<TE>   When Winick went to Sundance this January, he didn't even have an
agent.</TE>
<TE>   But after Miramax bought the film and Winick won the festival's
best director award, his stock soared. "I got calls from people I
could never get on the phone, met agents who'd never wanted to
represent me," he explained. "I had presents on my doorstep every
day. It felt totally unreal."</TE>
<TE>   The success of "Tadpole" was more than a personal credibility
boost. It was a huge breakthrough for InDigEnt, the New York-based
company founded by Winick, attorney John Sloss and the Independent
Film Channel, which has become the industry's digital filmmaking
leader. In an era when Hollywood is more corporate than ever,
InDigEnt functions like an artistic collective. Nearly everyone who
works on a movie, from makeup artist to producer, is--gasp--a profit
participant in the film. As Winick puts it: "We all get our money
back at the same time, which makes us all like Steven Spielberg."</TE>
<TE>   When the company was launched in 1999, industry observers scoffed.
After all, filmmakers are notoriously bad businessmen and most
artist-run companies have ended in failure. High-profile examples
include the Directors Co. (Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola,
William Friedkin) and First Artists (Paul Newman, Barbra Streisand,
Sidney Poitier).</TE>
<TE>   But Winick and Sloss saw an opportunity to attract young talent by
marrying the rock-bottom economics of digital video with the creative
intimacy of the medium. A savvy entrepreneur who's helped secure
financing or distribution for such films as "Boys Don't Cry" and "The
Deep End," Sloss went to IFC, which was looking for a way to brand
its cable channel as a top purveyor of indie films.</TE>
<TE>   IFC production vice president Caroline Kaplan agreed to finance a
package of five InDigEnt films, budgeted at $150,000 each. In return,
IFC agreed to give the filmmakers an unprecedented 50% of the films'
first-dollar gross. Sloss then sold the distribution rights to the
five-film package to Lions Gate.</TE>
<TE>   InDigEnt's collective spirit helped lure a host of gifted actors
and directors willing to work for scale in return for artistic
control and profit participation. The five-film package included
"Chelsea Walls," directed by Ethan Hawke and co-starring Uma Thurman
and Kris Kristofferson; "Tape," directed by Richard Linklater and
co-starring Hawke and Thurman; and "Final," directed by Campbell
Scott and co-starring Denis Leary and Hope Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The next batch of films included "Tadpole" and "Personal
Velocity," a Rebecca Miller-directed film that's being distributed by
United Artists. Three more films are on the way, also bankrolled by
IFC.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to "Tadpole's" Sundance sale, a host of crew members,
including the script supervisor, makeup artist and gaffer, are
getting $50,000 checks, paid in three installments, with the biggest
check due upon the film's release.</TE>
<TE>   "Our makeup person got to make a down payment on a house in
Brooklyn," says Winick. "By independent film standards, the money is
definitely a big deal. This whole company is an experiment, and the
jury's still out on how long it will last, but it's an experiment
that could help push the medium in a new direction."</TE>
<TE>   I must admit that until meeting Winick, my eyes had glazed over
during previous encounters with digital video proselytizers. After
all, the only time you really notice that a film's been shot in
digital video is when it looks awful.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, DV's biggest drawing card has been its low-budget
economics and artistic flexibility: Steven Soderbergh told friends
recently that when he wanted to cut 10 minutes out of his new DV
film, "Full Frontal," he did it in an hour on his Apple computer. But
Winick argues that digital video isn't just an economic boon for
filmmakers, but a creative tool as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Digital video gives you a way of bypassing the formality of the
filmmaking process," says Winick. "The stories that work for digital
video are intimate and performance-oriented, stories where you can
use multiple cameras and a small crew. Digital video allows you to be
more spontaneous and creative because you've eliminated a lot of the
gigantic machinery involved in taking an idea from conception to
film."</TE>
<TE>   At InDigEnt, digital video is clearly actor-oriented. One reason
Weaver agreed to do "Tadpole" was that she could shoot her whole part
in 10 days--she spent almost as much time rehearsing as she did
filming. When Winick shot an important scene between Weaver and
co-star Bebe Neuwirth in Central Park, he had three cameras running
simultaneously. If he'd been making a traditional film, Winick
would've had to stop and regroup after each take. Then an assistant
would hold a clapper board in front of the camera with a slate
identifying the new take. Operating with three digital cameras, each
the size of a pitcher of water, Winick used one slate and shot
continuously for 40 minutes, making adjustments as he went along.</TE>
<TE>   "Without slating every time the scene ends, you keep the actors in
the mood, so everything is about the performance," he explained. "The
tape costs $10, so you don't worry about how much you shoot. And
there isn't this big mythical camera and a lot of lights that take
time to set up. It's this little plastic camera that falls on the
ground every once in a while and we pick it up and keep going, so
everything feels a lot less precious for both the actors and the
filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   The unobtrusiveness of digital equipment also proved a pivotal
sales tool. The InDigEnt team wanted to shoot "Chelsea Walls" at the
fabled Chelsea Hotel, but the hotel's owner was wary about having his
establishment overrun by a mass of cables, dollies and other camera
equipment. "He kept saying no until I physically brought one of our
cameras over and he looked at it and said, 'That's it?' " Winick
recalls. "Once he saw the camera, everything was OK."</TE>
<TE>   Digital video technology still has its drawbacks--cinematographers
are still learning how to use light and move the camera. Variety's
early review of "Tadpole" complained about the film's technical
flaws, and Winick acknowledges that Miramax has spent $250,000--more
than it cost to shoot the entire film--on a new sound mix.</TE>
<TE>   For Winick, the biggest benefit of digital video is that it helped
reinvigorate his creative process. He'd spent years making films
about dark, complicated characters, but the movies never found an
audience. Knowing he needed a script he could shoot in two weeks,
Winick sought out a simpler, more accessible story.</TE>
<TE>   "Tadpole," he says, "is like a novella. It's very simple, with no
subplots and very little psychology. After trying to make all these
serious statement films, I realized there's a value in making people
laugh."</TE>
<TE>   He starts to laugh, a laugh directed entirely at himself. "For
years my father's been saying, 'Gary, why don't you just make a movie
with a happy ending?' I hate to say it, but maybe he was right. After
getting nowhere year after year, now I've got the Venice Film
Festival calling, saying they want two InDigEnt films--and they
didn't even ask to see them first!"</TE>

<DH>Despite health and business troubles, arts donor Alberto
Vilar insists he's made good on his philanthropic pledges</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over English breakfast tea at the Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey,
billionaire arts philanthropist Alberto Vilar announces his
engagement to be married--sort of.</LD>
<LD>   "There she is, Karen Painter," the 61-year-old divorce says
proudly, his eyes lighting up as Painter, a Harvard musicology
professor who recently conducted a music symposium at the 2002 Ojai
Music Festival, approaches the table near the end of a Saturday
morning meeting with Vilar. "She's my fiancee."</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations are offered, followed by the question: Is this
news?</LD>
<TE>   There is a long pause--then Vilar modifies his statement just a
little. He and Painter aren't quite engaged yet. "In fact, we've
discussed engagement," he says. "The official date is coming very
soon."</TE>
<TE>   "We're secretly engaged," offers Painter helpfully.</TE>
<TE>   "We're secretly engaged, but everybody knows," Vilar adds. "The
official date is later in July."</TE>
<TE>   The date for what--the wedding, the engagement, or the
announcement of the engagement?</TE>
<TE>   "The ring thing," Painter says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone else, the fine points of an engagement announcement
might not seem so important. But it is just such is-it-on-or-not
ambiguity that has led to trouble for Vilar, president and co-founder
of New York's Amerindo Investment Advisors Inc., in another area of
his life: his philanthropy. Vilar is believed to give more money to
opera than any other donor in the world, and he is one of the top
givers to the arts in general, as well. His gifts include a total of
$33 million to New York's Metropolitan Opera, $10 million to Los
Angeles Opera, and $50 million to Washington, D.C.'s John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   But since late last year--when Vilar was laid up with medical
problems and his company was laid low by the downturn in the stock
market--rumors and press reports that he is not honoring his pledges
to the arts have surfaced in the United States and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Such speculation has infuriated Vilar. Both he and his creditors
say he has honored all of his formal agreements--but the lingering
cloud of doubt leads this soft-spoken, self-described
"stiff-upper-lip" executive to call journalism a "blood sport," and
to politely suggest that his media critics "burn in hell by the gods
who love the arts."</TE>
<TE>   Vilar visited Los Angeles over the July 4 weekend to meet his
fiancee's family and friends, but he also took the opportunity to
lash out about the speculation.</TE>
<TE>   As Vilar describes it, in the final months of 2002, reporters were
not just looking a gift horse in the mouth; they were kicking said
horse when he was in a hospital bed, recovering from a series of back
surgeries and an emergency operation in late November for a
perforated gall bladder.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first encounter in two years where I've left either
my crutches or my cane," says Vilar, looking thin but healthy,
sitting with elegantly erect posture in an overstuffed chair in the
hotel lounge. "I am very lucky to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   Vilar says that his health problems caused him to "miss a few
payments" to five or six of the 25 or so organizations to which he
donates funds, and added that financial troubles for Amerindo led him
in some cases to exercise "skip-year" options written into his
various multiyear arrangements. "My contracts have all sorts of
provisions in them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, 2001 was not a good year for Vilar. Amerindo Investments
Inc., a $5.5-billion company at the beginning of 2000, saw its assets
fall to $1.6 billion by the end of last year.</TE>
<TE>   His health also took a dramatic turn for the worse: Vilar, an avid
skier, developed disc problems requiring four surgeries over the
course of 16 months.</TE>
<TE>   One of those operations took place Sept. 10, at New York's
Columbia University Hospital. Vilar awoke the next morning just in
time to watch the second plane hit the World Trade Center on the TV
screen in his hospital room.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar says that, due to the surgeries, he "could not travel for
two years"--an observation that, like the announcement of his
engagement, is relative. Reliant on cane and crutches, he managed to
come to Los Angeles last December for "A Night of Zarzuela and
Operetta With Placido Domingo and Friends," an event that Vilar
underwrote. He also made it to Berlin last October and took a trip to
Vienna on Nov. 27, to support an international medical program.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar says he "started to feel funny" on the plane to Vienna but
attributed his discomfort to indigestion from the previous day's
Thanksgiving dinner. When symptoms persisted after the flight, Vilar
contacted physicians in Vienna, and went in for surgery to remove his
gall bladder the following day. Because the gall bladder had ruptured
prior to surgery, Vilar suffered serious postoperative infections.</TE>
<TE>   "For five days, they didn't know whether I would live or die," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar adds that all of the organizations he supports have been
understanding of delays in payment, or the decision to invoke the
skip-year clause. "After the 27th of November, when I had this
perforation, I closed myself down under medical orders; my staff did
the best they could," he says. "All of a sudden I had a breakdown in
my health, and I had a breakdown in my financial markets. But almost
every organization came to us and said: 'We want to work with you,
Alberto.' "</TE>
<TE>   Journalists, he charged, have been less understanding--to put it
mildly. "To add insult to injury, they called a dozen organizations
to see if I had kicked the bucket, or I wasn't paying them, do you
know how crass that is?" he exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   And, Vilar adds, anyone that wants to hold on to a big donor is
not going to report problems with that donor, anyway. "Any
organization that has a big fish is going to go way out in the middle
of the ocean before they cut the line, because those big fish don't
exist very often," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar says that he frequently funds projects that are not part of
any formal contract or agreement with an organization--coming up at
L.A. Opera, for example, is "War and Peace," which Vilar is
underwriting by $1 million in addition to his $10-million long-term
agreement with the company. The word "contract" plays a crucial role
in one of the most prevalent of all the Vilar money rumors: that the
Berlin Philharmonic, as of November, was "still waiting" for the
first payment on the $25-million gift Vilar announced in October. The
money will fund an education project.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar confirms that he has not yet paid the Berlin Philharmonic
$25 million or any portion thereof--because he has no contract to do
so. In fact, the announcement was made before any payment plan was
worked out. Vilar says he decided to make the announcement in October
to coincide with a trip to Berlin to promote the concept of arts
philanthropy in Europe, at the invitation of the German government.</TE>
<TE>   Because there was no immediate payment concurrent with the
announcement--which Vilar prefers to call "an intent to
announce"--rumors swirled in the German press that Vilar was not
paying, and the stories were picked up by U.S. news outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar admits that he may have "put the cart before the horse," but
says the Berlin Philharmonic understood that there was to be no
immediate payment. "I am not in arrears one single penny. We are in
the concept stage, not the contract stage," Vilar asserts. Being
accused of nonpayment, he says, is like "getting a call from your
attorney for alimony payments when we're not even engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Vilar nor his beneficiaries have offered documentation to
prove that he's making good on his promises. However, several "crass"
phone calls result in oral confirmation from a spokesman at Los
Angeles Opera and a spokeswoman at Kennedy Center that Vilar has
honored all contracts to date. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Opera
said the company does not comment on donations. Berlin Philharmonic
leadership could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have a thick skin, and a missionary purpose, to be a
philanthropist, because somebody's going to pick on you," Vilar
muses.</TE>
<TE>   And whatever his financial straits, Vilar says there are more
gifts on the way.</TE>
<TE>   He says he has four yet-to-be-announced projects with major arts
organizations, to which he plans to donate a total of $150 million to
$250 million. At least one of those projects he will begin to fund
next year, he says.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, Vilar plans to hold any announcements until
the stock market bounces back in hopes that the timing will be better
to leverage other gifts--which may help to avoid future attacks from
the press for announcing another engagement before the ring is given.</TE>

<HD>A World of Colorful Concoctions From Ozomatli</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a good thing Ozomatli, L.A.'s stirring, multicultural urban
ensemble, was on the bill for Sunday's "World Roots" program at the
Hollywood Bowl. Otherwise the evening, with its inaccurate title and
erratic sequencing, might have seemed even more off center than it
was.</LD>
<LD>   Ozomatli's deep community connections and polyglot mix (Cuban,
Chicano, Japanese, African American, Filipino) give the band a
musical and cultural cachet that was immediately apparent in the
wildly enthusiastic audience response to its set. Equally important,
however, this is a group that has effectively blended pop, rap,
Latin, jazz and funk (among other elements) into a wildly colorful,
utterly convincing musical concoction.</LD>
<LD>   They served up their appealing menu of sound and rhythm with
joyous musical vigor, entering the Bowl through the audience,
dancing, drumming, singing and playing their horns. They kept the
movement alive through their entire program, and exited the same way,
journeying toward the top of the Bowl to engage their fervent fans at
every level. It was a stunning performance by a band that deserves a
major international breakthrough.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the program was more problematic. The touted group
Yerba Buena, opening the evening, didn't really get up to speed until
its final two numbers. It was in those selections--especially via the
vocal interplay between singer Xiomara Laugart and
singer-percussionist Pedro "Manotas" Martinez--that the band
justified its advance notices. Although they toured much of the
territory frequented by Ozomatli, Yerba Buena was much less
successful in blending the various multicultural elements of its
music.</TE>
<TE>   The headliners on this unusual bill were two musical icons, South
African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and Latin salsa and jazz keyboardist
Eddie Palmieri. But inexplicably, they were programmed into a single,
truncated segment at the end of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Masekela seemed somewhat distracted in a predictable presentation
of such familiar items as "Stimela" and "Grazing in the Grass."</TE>
<TE>   Palmieri played only two numbers, "Sujetata La Lengua" and
"Lazaro," both heavily reliant on repetitious vamps, before bringing
Masekela back for a pair of brief joint performances.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine "World Roots" as a title for such a narrowly
focused, oddly programmed lineup. Perhaps it's just best to be
thankful for the presence of Ozomatli.</TE>

<HD>ABC Couldn't Get Letterman but Koppel Does--as a Guest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>ABC News' Ted Koppel kicked off the new "Nightline UpClose"
late-night show Monday with what he called an irony, but others might
call a dig at his employer. Referring to his inaugural guest, Koppel
noted: "They wanted Letterman, so here he is."</LD>
<LD>   Koppel, of course, would have lost his job as anchor of
"Nightline" had ABC succeeded earlier this year in wooing comedian
David Letterman away from CBS, an episode Koppel referred to Monday
night as the "recent unpleasantness." Instead, Letterman stayed at
CBS, and agreed to be Koppel's first guest for "UpClose," which
inhabits the post-"Nightline" slot (formerly held by "Politically
Incorrect") until Jimmy Kimmel's new show premieres in January.</LD>
<LD>   In the interview with Koppel, taped June 26, Letterman said he had
always expected that he would finish his career at CBS, but the
attention from ABC--executives flying in unannounced (bearing gifts
from their children), calls from Paris--became seductive and he began
to think, "Maybe they know something I don't know."</LD>
<TE>   But while he listened to ABC seriously, Letterman said that on a
practical level he probably couldn't have made the move. "I'm really
quite comfortable [at CBS]," he said, and would have found it
difficult to go elsewhere at a point in his life when comfort is "far
more important than undertaking a new challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Now that Koppel's standing at ABC is again secured, his challenge
is to maintain ratings for "Nightline" as an alternative to the
entertainment competition on the other networks. In the second
quarter, which ended June 30, "Nightline" finished third in its time
period, according to Nielsen Media Research, with an average 4.19
million viewers to 4.36 million for the first half-hour of
Letterman's "Late Show" and 6.49 million for NBC's "Tonight" show.</TE>
<TE>   "UpClose" is airing following "Nightline" through Jan. 24.</TE>

<HD>When Not to Trust the Feedback</HD>
<DH>Television* Focus groups in 1996 said 'Everybody Loves
Raymond' was a dud, highlighting a drawback in trusting this input.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of the "Seinfeld" folklore includes early network research that
concluded the show had little chance of succeeding--a document its
producers later delighted in framing. Yet if that represents the
"Mona Lisa" of focus group misfires, the exhibit would also
rightfully feature one of today's biggest hits: "Everybody Loves
Raymond."</LD>
<LD>   Research from the popular CBS sitcom's first season found that not
everyone loved "Raymond." In fact, focus groups dismissed the stories
as "too thin" and "not current" and the title character as "weak,"
said his wife Debra "lacks charisma" and called the supporting
characters "dumb and/or annoying," with one respondent labeling
Frank, as played by Peter Boyle, "very sour."</LD>
<LD>   For producers who have seen projects live and die by such
comments, the 1996 reports obtained by The Times offer insight into
research's limitations in identifying a potential hit--in this case,
a show that started slowly ratings-wise but blossomed into TV's
second-most-watched comedy, preparing to head into its seventh season
and conservatively expected to generate more than $500 million in
revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Introduced in September 1996, "Raymond" was almost the
afterthought of a scheduling strategy by then-third-place CBS built
around bankable TV stars, which included bringing Bill Cosby back to
prime time as well as "Cheers" alumni Ted Danson and Rhea Perlman in
the short-lived "Ink" and "Pearl," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "Raymond" featured an unknown lead in stand-up comic
Ray Romano and a first-time "show runner," or series
creator-executive producer, in Phil Rosenthal. The biggest name
affixed was David Letterman, whose company is one of the producers.</TE>
<TE>   CBS executives liked the prototype, and initial testing yielded
promising results. So the network took a relatively low-risk gamble
by scheduling the program Fridays--when overall TV viewing levels
ebb.</TE>
<TE>   "We got their worst time slot and just squeaked onto the air,"
Rosenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   As the fall TV season progressed, however, ratings for "Raymond"
were disappointing, falling off from CBS' "Dave's World" and trailing
both ABC's "Boy Meets World" and NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" in its
time period.</TE>
<TE>   During those months, CBS continued to test episodes that posted
"average" or "below average" scores among groups evenly divided
between two dozen men and women, who viewed and rated episodes at ASI
Research in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "People said the show's story and jokes were 'predictable,'
'something you've seen or heard before' and 'nothing fresh or new,' "
read an Oct. 3, 1996, evaluation report. "Viewers wanted the show to
be more 'up-to-date' and 'current,' like 'Seinfeld' or 'Roseanne.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal recalls sitting in on one research session, watching the
discussion from behind one-way glass. "I remember this one guy, who
said, 'This guy's the worst wimp; I can't stand these kinds of wimpy
shows ... and I wouldn't watch this show unless my wife forced me,' "
he said.</TE>
<TE>   That December, CBS executives were presented a "diagnostic
analysis" of negative focus group reactions to "Raymond," suggesting,
among other things, that the program wasn't topical enough and
viewers didn't know how to categorize it. "If it is to be a family
show, people often question 'where are the kids?' and 'why aren't the
kids shown more?' " the report noted.</TE>
<TE>   CBS Television President Leslie Moonves, then beginning his first
full season at the network, said executives were pleased with the
show's quality but frustrated by the ratings, which "didn't move" on
Friday. The attitude, he said, was, "If the show is as good as we
think it is, why isn't it improving like a tenth of a rating point
every week? Just show me a little tick--that it's heading in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Although Rosenthal said he received little prodding to alter the
show, he does recall stating that his intention was to produce a
classic, traditional comedy and being told by one executive the words
missing from that description were "hip" and "edgy."</TE>
<TE>   "There was some network interference, where they were trying to
steer the show in a certain direction, but I stuck to my guns," he
said, adding of being hip or edgy, "Those are just not my values."</TE>
<TE>   With some of its more-heralded programs struggling, CBS decided to
give "Raymond" a trial run on Monday nights, where the stakes--and
expectations--would be higher. Before that move occurred in March,
Rosenthal said, Moonves told him, "I love the show, but if you don't
perform here, I can't do anything for you."</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for "Raymond" spiked upward in the new time slot, and the
show officially shifted to Mondays that spring. During the recently
completed TV season, the series averaged 20 million viewers--the
fifth-most-watched prime-time program and behind only "Friends" among
comedies.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, some of the criticisms registered by focus groups
have actually been assets. Unlike "Murphy Brown," for example, an
earlier CBS hit that mostly fizzled when the reruns were sold into
syndication, "Raymond" has prospered in that arena--in part because
Rosenthal avoided topical references, wanting to emulate the timeless
quality of a show like "The Honeymooners."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Murphy Brown' might have been a terrific show, but those jokes
were sometimes dated before it went on the air," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a show that is going to be relatable 20 years from now,"
Moonves added.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Monday test not gone well, "Raymond's" prospects of a
second year would have depended on the perceived appeal of newer
comedies that CBS developed. So what role, ultimately, does focus
group research play? "It is one tool, but only one," Moonves said,
noting that executives look for extremes--either particularly high
scores or those that say, "This show is never gonna make it."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some producers contend that that formula highlights an
inherent flaw in the process, since groundbreaking programs that take
creative chances often alienate a segment of the audience. To
Rosenthal, who never saw the diagnostic appraisal of "Raymond," it's
a reminder of how misleading such analysis can be.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said to the heads of the networks, 'Have you ever tested the
testing?' " he said, citing the high failure rate of new programs
despite the research. "I say that they should go with their gut a
little more, but maybe they're afraid to, because then you're on the
line."</TE>
<TE>   Moonves acknowledged that networks are always searching for the
next instant home run and that CBS, then trying to claw out of the
ratings cellar, may have felt more latitude to stick with a series
that took time to clear the bases. "It's easier when you're in last
place to go with some hunches and your gut," he said, adding, "Once
it took off Mondays, it was, 'Whew, one less time period to worry
about.' "</TE>

<HD>Building a Dragon From the Ground Up</HD>
<DH>A stalking leopard, a sinuous Lamborghini, a dog, birds,
snakes and sharks all inspired the design of the villain in 'Reign of
Fire'</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When director Rob Bowman and an army of technical-effects wizards set
out to create the definitive movie dragon for Touchstone Pictures and
Spyglass Entertainment's "Reign of Fire," they took inspiration from
a surprising source. Instead of relying on prior effects-based dragon
films, such as "Dragonslayer" and "Dragonheart," they turned to
National Geographic TV specials.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm presenting the idea that dragons are the supreme predator of
all predators, so I wanted to look at great predators and see what
characteristics they have," Bowman says of his Boeing 747-sized,
fire-spewing creature. "This is an Earth-born creature, not an alien,
and I wanted the audience to look at these creatures and feel like,
'I've seen that. Where have I seen that?' "</LD>
<LD>   Set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been all but destroyed by
the awakened dragons, "Reign of Fire" centers on a small group of
human survivors in England who encounter a team of warrior
dragon-hunters, fighting to reclaim the planet.</LD>
<TE>   Bucking summer action-movie tradition, Bowman wanted to focus more
on the human characters (led by Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey
and Polish actress Izabella Scorupco) than on digital effects. But he
knew that even when used sparingly, the threat had to be absolutely
realistic and convincing rather than the standard, thundering,
Tyrannosaurus rex-type image. Bowman wanted a dragon that could
conceivably exist and fly in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   Consultations with a paleontologist confirmed that in order to fly
gracefully with a minimum of flapping, the dragon would have to have
an enormous wingspan--the equivalent of 320 feet--with the arms
incorporated into the wings, and a very small, snakelike torso.</TE>
<TE>   Artists and technicians at the Secret Lab, the digital shop owned
by Touchstone's parent, the Walt Disney Co. (which last fall phased
it out, having decided to outsource effects work), worked for months
on the design of the main dragon, which was nicknamed "Ashley"
(Ash-ley, get it?), sculpting in clay, drawing on paper and even
doing early computer sculpts and animation tests. "That allowed us to
do many iterations very quickly," notes co-visual effects supervisor
Dan DeLeeuw.</TE>
<TE>   For the director, though, there were almost too many. "They were
very, very productive down there," Bowman says, laughing. "A new
drawing would come back and the attitude on its face would be, 'I
enjoy killing!' It was too human. At one point, after a couple of
months, I pounded my fist on the table and said, 'Stop trying to
impress me with these illustrations. It doesn't look like something
out of 'National Geographic'; it looks like something out of a
fantasy novel.' The word I gave them was: 'Don't impress me, bore
me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The traditionally straight, almost swanlike neck from the earliest
design was changed to a drooping neck and low-hanging head, which
gave Ashley a more threatening look. Finally, a drawing by artist
Mike Meaker, showing the dragon in what Bowman describes as a
"Lamborghini profile where it's lowest in front and sweeps high in
the back," gave the director what he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   This approach carried through to the animation. "I got a bunch of
nature documentaries, and there was one shot of a leopard stalking
some gazelles through high grass, hunched down very low to the
ground, its shoulder blades rising very high," says DeLeeuw. "I took
that piece of video to one of the animators and said, 'I know this
may be a little odd, because of how big this thing is, but try to
make its movements as much like a cat as you can.' When we had done
that test, Rob had flipped over it, and that was that."</TE>
<TE>   Once the crouching-leopard, hiding-dragon version of Ashley was
approved, it was built in the computer from the bones out with an eye
toward nature, more or less. "The rib cage, backbone and sternum are
from a bird, like a pelican," says visual effects supervisor Rich
Hoover. "Part of the neck is somewhat following a bird, and the tail
is very reptilian, though there's a little cheating from a pure
bird's bone structure and a lot of variation from a reptile."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman remained adamant throughout the animation that no human
qualities creep into the look or expressions of the dragons.</TE>
<TE>   "The expression on the face doesn't change much," he says. "It was
important to be true to what we understand in wildlife. There's no
facial expression before or after a shark eats you, and a lion
doesn't really smile or frown. These things are built into the
audience's psyche and their memories, and therefore it's more
realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a cue from his dog, the director realized that the dragons
could express a range of emotions through the movements of their
reptilian tails.</TE>
<TE>   Adapting the procedural animation system (one that allows for the
automatic animation of complex surfaces once the parameters have been
input) that had been used by Disney for fur animation of the
computer-generated dogs in "102 Dalmatians" and the lemurs in
"Dinosaur," the artists created individual scales on the dragon that
would shift with the movement of the creature's musculature. The
membranous wings were made to resemble tattered curtains, the legacy
of past battles.</TE>
<TE>   In the context of the story, there is only one male dragon but
hundreds of smaller, recently hatched females (intriguingly, the
earliest version of the script had it the other way around). For the
females, which are usually seen from a distance, through smoke or
very quickly while in flight, one model was built and replicated and
rescaled for each individual creature, using an adaptation of the
animation package originally used to create the animal stampede in
Disney's "Mulan."</TE>
<TE>   "We took a piece of animation, say, flapping its wings for five
seconds," and repeated it, says Hoover. "We made five or six
different kinds of animations--a flapping, a gliding, a flapping
hard, a takeoff--and we were able to piecemeal all those together and
go in and out of them whenever we wanted to make the flights subtly
different."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, one shot of ruined London features dozens of female dragons
in the skies, all of which were worked off one model.</TE>
<TE>   It was yet another nature video, this one on king cobras, that
gave Bowman the explanation for the most fantastical element of
dragon mythology: the fiery breath.</TE>
<TE>   In "Reign of Fire," it isn't breath but a combination of opposite
chemicals shot from glands in each side of the dragon's mouth that
ignite when they touch. This was derived from watching the way a king
cobra spits venom and knowledge of a particular African beetle that
really does secrete combustible fluids as a defensive action.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fire itself, the original plans called for it to be
practical, shot out of a rig that special effects supervisor David
Gauthier built with fire hoses mounted on an excavator arm, hooked up
to a tanker truck of propane.</TE>
<TE>   After the rig proved too unwieldy and dangerous, Hoover decided to
digitally animate the fire as well.</TE>
<TE>   "That gave us a lot more tools to give us the kind of look we
wanted," he says. "We could control the speed, the flame, the color
and when it went from fire to smoke. It may be a little bit more
fantastic than reality, but it's a lot more fun to watch."</TE>

<LD>   Money No Headache for 'Malcolm' Mom</LD>
<LD>   "Malcolm In the Middle" star Jane Kaczmarek, who was absent from
the set of the Fox comedy for several days last season in a reported
salary dispute, has received a paycheck boost.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, the actress is finalizing a
contract with Regency Television, the producers of "Malcolm," that
will bring her weekly salary to around $100,000 in the series'
upcoming fourth season and to around $150,000 for the next year.</TE>
<TE>   The new agreement also gives her a retroactive raise to around
$85,000 per episode for the just-concluded season.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson for Kaczmarek said last season that doctors at Fox
confirmed that the actress suffered from repeated and severe migraine
headaches. But other sources said that salary was the true reason
behind Kaczmarek's absence.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Regency and the actress declined comment.</TE>

<TE>   Court TV's unscripted series, "Forensic Files," will begin airing

<TE>   The network will air "Forensic Files" at 8 p.m. on four
consecutive Sundays starting Aug. 25. The series will continue its
Monday to Saturday schedule on Court TV at 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   Ron Howard Rides Away from 'Alamo'</TE>
<TE>   Ron Howard has decided not to direct "The Alamo" as his follow-up
to the Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind," although he and partner
Brian Grazer are still moving forward as producers of the film for
the Walt Disney Co., a spokesperson for Imagine Films Entertainment
said Monday. "Ron was anxious to get the film made, and it started
taking too long to develop," the spokesperson said.</TE>
<TE>   No replacement director has been selected, and Howard has not
decided what he will do instead.</TE>
<TE>   The move stung Disney, which had counted on Howard for a rare
directing stint away from Universal. Howard's last film apart from
Universal was "Ransom," also for Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Disney could not confirm whether Russell Crowe, who had rearranged
a crowded schedule to team again with Howard after "A Beautiful
Mind," would stay with "The Alamo."</TE>

<HD>Picture of a Family in Crisis Hangs in 'The Waverly
Gallery'</HD>
<DH>Writer Kenneth Lonergan feelingly depicts the effects of
dementia, but his story, at Pasadena Playhouse, is undercut by
predictability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the dementia of the leading character in Kenneth Lonergan's play
"The Waverly Gallery" got worse, an audience member near me commented
quite audibly, "This looks familiar."</LD>
<LD>   Gladys, the elderly woman in this play, will remind many
theatergoers at the Pasadena Playhouse of someone they love. With
more people living longer, her problems are increasingly prevalent.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this very familiarity leads directly to the biggest potential
pitfall for "The Waverly Gallery." As another audience member near me
observed to a friend in another row--thankfully, during intermission
instead of the play itself--"We know what's going to happen."</LD>
<TE>   The subject lacks suspense. Aged characters who are losing their
marbles usually don't find them.</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan's first challenge was to depict this process and its
effect on the old woman's family--something that the play
accomplishes very well. His second challenge was to prevent the
familiar from becoming the predictable. In this effort, "The Waverly
Gallery" isn't nearly as successful.</TE>
<TE>   As drama, this 1999 play pales in comparison to the two incisive
Lonergan scripts that emerged since it opened: the screenplay for
"You Can Count on Me" and the script for "Lobby Hero" (seen at South
Coast Repertory earlier this year). In each of those, the ending of
the story was hardly predetermined, and it was fascinating to watch
the characters wrestling with the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   More of this quality could have appeared in "The Waverly Gallery,"
too, if the younger family members in the play were at odds with each
other over what to do about Gladys.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gladys' relatives agree that they should allow her to
continue showing up most days at her nearly dormant Greenwich Village
gallery, because this lets her feel as if she's engaged with the
world. When she becomes worse, they all agree that she should be
cared for at her daughter's uptown apartment, with in-home aides, not
at a nursing facility.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the play was too close to home for Lonergan to consider
significant alterations in the story--the script is dedicated to his
grandmother and his mother, and it's described as "intensely
autobiographical" in the foreword to the published version. Certainly
the authentic sound of Gladys' crumbling speech patterns and the
repeated doses of overlapping dialogue--as family members grow
impatient with Gladys' inability to hear as well as to think--bear
testimony to Lonergan's intimacy with the subject.</TE>
<TE>   But the absence of conflict among the family members makes some
scenes feel stagnant, with especially flat endings. It's as if
Lonergan restrained himself from shaping the scenes in a way that
would violate their fidelity to his actual experiences. Lonergan may
have been aware of this problem--witness the fact that Bruno Kirby's
Pasadena staging includes a minor character who initially was dropped
after the play's premiere in Williamstown, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Here, David Groh plays the landlord of Gladys' gallery, even
though his character was missing not only from the New York
production in 2000 but also from the published script. The sole
purpose of this character appears to be to add a little more onstage
conflict--it's his decision to take back the gallery space that
forces Gladys' family to come to grips with her deterioration. But he
never seems more than a plot device, and his scenes are not smoothly
integrated into the play's texture.</TE>
<TE>   The plum role, of course, is Gladys herself: a garrulous former
lefty and social butterfly. She refuses to shut up as she finds her
faculties diminishing, instead speaking all the more in a desperate
attempt to remain grounded.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Roberts plays her with a high-pitched voice, in contrast to
the more gravelly sounds of the late Eileen Heckart, who created the
role. Certainly a higher voice can just as easily wear down the
patience of those around Gladys. It's easy to see how this Gladys'
repetitious questions and increasing querulousness get on her
family's nerves.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Roberts retains a dignity in her stance that
helps us see what a formidable woman Gladys once was. Of course, the
fact that Lonergan discreetly refrains from showing us Gladys' last
two years--when "all she did was moan," we are told--helps in the
dignity department.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weston has a low-key likability as Gladys' grandson--the
sometime narrator. His mother, Gladys' daughter Ellen, is well played
by Natalija Nogulich as a woman on a tightrope between caring resolve
and grim despair. The only odd note about this character is that she
is referred to as shy--in the stage directions as well as the
dialogue--without any evidence that it's true.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lerner and Mark Rosenthal round out the cast as two additional
nice guys--Gladys' son-in-law and the hapless painter who mounts his
work at her gallery. Unfortunately, the play needs more discord, not
more nice guys.</TE>

<DH>Television* 'The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook' is
the basis for a new show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDITH S. GILLIES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You just never know. That's the principle behind "The Worst-Case
Scenario Survival Handbook," a book that is the basis for a TBS show
premiering this week.</LD>
<LD>   The series, scheduled for 13 hourlong episodes, tackles dangerous
situations and shows viewers how to get out of them safely.</LD>
<LD>   You never know, for example, when you might have to jump out of a
moving car. Or knock down a door. Or jump off a building.</LD>
<TE>   "For instance, I'm driving down the road right now, and someone
could cross the line into my lane," said Mike Rowe, 40, the show's
host, in a cell phone interview. "We don't dwell on such facts, but
it makes sense to look down the road and keep your guard up."</TE>
<TE>   According to Rowe, the show--like the book--is a combination of
the Boy Scout motto (Be Prepared) and Murphy's Law (Anything that can
go wrong will).</TE>
<TE>   And when he mentions the Scout motto, Rowe is speaking from
experience. "I was an Eagle Scout in another life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Another life" for this Baltimore native includes seven years with
the Baltimore Opera, the start of his television career in 1988 with
the series "Your New Home" on the city's WJZ and narration and
voice-over work with several cable channels and broadcast networks.
He also hosted "The Most" on the History Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe said he can personally identify with some of the wilderness
challenges presented on the series. When he was 16, Rowe said, he and
a friend were hiking in the Maryland-Pennsylvania area of the
Appalachian Trail when they got lost in a February blizzard and had
to survive for more than two days.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have to catch a rabbit," he said, but he did have to
make a fire. (He was prepared and had matches.) "Eventually we
stumbled across railroad tracks and followed them to find our way.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't life-threatening, but in the middle of that, I saw that
panic, like grief, has stages. When you are frozen and in denial and
weirdly euphoric ... you learn that how you handle yourself is
important.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's the kind of thing we want to come back to in the show:
that there are millions of ways that things can go wrong and people
experience the same feelings of panic and disorientation. But you
overcome those feelings so you can function."</TE>
<TE>   The series, executive-produced by Craig Piligian, a veteran of
"Survivor," takes its cue from the book.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much a question of saying what might you do if this
happens," Rowe said, "but we're asking the viewer to take the leap
and think when this happens."</TE>
<TE>   The show has a broad range of situations, he said, "and I always
like to see a mix of the outrageous and the commonplace, like how to
deliver a baby in the back of a taxi as opposed to how to get safely
back into the house when you've locked yourself out.</TE>
<TE>   "The outrageous ones are fun to watch. But the world's an
unpredictable place, and I expect that in a month or two, people will
write in and say, 'This happened to me and I remembered seeing what
to do on your show. Thanks.' "</TE>
<TE>   Each episode of "Worst-Case Scenario" has several segments. Among
them:</TE>
<TE>   * Ripped from the pages: Using scenarios from the book, a stunt
person demonstrates how to survive those situations--such as how to
fall down a mountain without being injured; or, should it be
necessary, how to jump correctly and safely from a moving car.</TE>
<TE>   * Caught on tape: Videotapes of real people in extraordinary
situations show how they survived. They include a skydiver caught on
the landing gear of an airplane (a complicated story) and two people
struck by lightning in separate incidents.</TE>
<TE>   * Face-off: Two experts compete in tests of survival--such as two
men who, using limited supplies, race each other in the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   * Gear girl: Stuntwoman Danielle Burgio demonstrates some of the
latest gadgets that might be helpful, such as a smoke hood to enable
one to escape from a fire.</TE>
<TE>   * Volunteer challenge: People who apply to the WCS Web site are
challenged to face their worst fears, such as a mother who tries to
overcome her fear of heights by jumping from a cliff into water as
her children watch.</TE>
<TE>   * Five-mile radius: This deals with problems that occur where most
accidents happen, within a five-mile radius of home. A segment about
a family that found a bobcat in a bedroom explains how to avoid
injury to people and animals and how to prevent such situations from
occurring.</TE>
<TE>   Because you just never know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Worst-Case Scenario" will air Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on TBS.</TE>

<HD>Breeders Casually Resurrect Their Quirky Appeal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Breeders have gotten almost as much attention for their checkered
history as for such quirky '90s hits as "Cannonball" and "Divine
Hammer." On Sunday at the El Rey Theatre, the veteran alt-rock
quintet launched a U.S. tour behind its first new album in nine
years, "Title TK," with an ultra-casual show that seemed driven
chiefly by the whims of twin sisters Kim and Kelley Deal .</LD>
<LD>   Still, the 90-minute set offered a broad perspective, with new
tunes, lots of earlier material and selections from such side
projects as the Amps and the Kelley Deal 6000. In between, the twins
sniped good-naturedly at each other, smoked cigarettes, pounded out
Nerf Herder's surf-punky theme from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (a
favorite of Kelley's) and at one point had an extra drum kit set up
for Kim to play.</LD>
<LD>   Although the often loose proceedings probably wearied the less
faithful, most of the audience stuck around. The Breeders' pulsing,
low-end-centered pop-rock may not be as cutting-edge as it was a
decade ago, but its appeal remains, largely due to Kim's way with
spare, repetitive sonic and lyrical hooks, which can be traced back
to her days as bassist for the hugely influential punk-poppers the
Pixies.</LD>
<TE>   The tunes alternated between angular urgency and expansive drone,
with the sisters' spookily similar vocal harmonies providing an
unearthly sweetness that underscored the introverted heart of many
songs.</TE>
<TE>   New numbers such as "Little Fury" and the misfit's anthem "Huffer"
almost matched the exuberant thrills of the band's more popular
moments. And it was nice to see that after all this time, the
Breeders can still get along.</TE>

<HD>'The Elite': They Know the Drill</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screaming drill sergeants can be curiously fun to watch, as long as
you're not at the other end of their wrath. When they go face to face
with a trembling recruit, hurling insults full-throttle, they almost
become artisans of humiliation.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, drill sergeants and other manic military trainers are
among some of our more memorable movie characters. If you enjoyed
Louis Gossett Jr. in "An Officer and a Gentleman" or Robert Duvall in
"The Great Santini," you might want to check out the real-life
version in tonight's premiere of the Court TV documentary show "The
Elite" (10 p.m.). The series tells the stories of those who serve in
various law-enforcement organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Brown and his colleagues at the Somerset, N.J., academy have
six months to try to mold 45 cadets into graduates ready for police
work. Along with the trainers, we meet recruits like stocky, clumsy
Richard Yock, a favorite target of Brown's tirades. Still, Yock vows:
"They've got to arrest me to keep me away from here."</LD>
<TE>   The sergeant asks another recruit if she is religious. When she
replies, "Sir, yes, sir!," he tells her, "You better start praying,
because you're not going to make it here."</TE>
<TE>   After another recruit salutes with the wrong hand, the sergeant
can only shake his head and say, "Porter, you have got to be kidding
me." Porter does not return the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the warped humor, the teachers clearly relish the task of
molding cops through so-called "engineered adversity."</TE>
<TE>   The hour zips by, but one question lingers: What makes the
organization elite? (Presumably all police academies are rigorous.)</TE>
<TE>   It's not a major crime, but future episodes--which include looks
at prison security, criminal profilers and hostage negotiators--would
benefit by addressing that issue as it pertains to them.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Calls Auditor Deloitte Unreasonable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BERGSTROM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. told federal regulators Monday that it
decided in June it wasn't appropriate to give former auditor Deloitte
&amp; Touche any more information because of the accountant's
"unreasonable refusal" to resume an audit of the cable television
company.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia made the comments in an amendment to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing in which it had disclosed letters Deloitte
wrote the firm and the SEC claiming that Adelphia withheld data the
accountants needed.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of that unreasonable refusal, the company determined
that it was not appropriate to share with Deloitte any additional
information, including the information Deloitte claims was withheld,"
the nation's sixth-largest cable company said in Monday's SEC filing.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia executives wouldn't comment beyond the filing, a company
spokesman said. Deloitte &amp; Touche executives didn't return a call
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection June 25 after a slide that started with the disclosure in
March that the family of founder John J. Rigas had borrowed billions
through family-owned partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The company joined others, such as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.,
under scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities, with
disclosures that the Rigas family had used company cash or assets for
purposes such as buying a hockey team and investing in a golf course.
Many of the deals were never approved by the board.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigas family surrendered control of Adelphia in May. The firm
has estimated it was liable for $3.1 billion in family debts.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte said in a June 9 letter to Adelphia disclosed in last
week's filing that it halted the audit because questions of whether
workers had acted illegally "had to be investigated and
satisfactorily resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte said it had refused to resume the audit despite requests
by Adelphia, citing possible fabrication of documents and "lack of
responsiveness to or cooperation with us [and] refusal to share
material information with us."</TE>

<HD>Banks Give $10 Billion Worth of Credit to AOL</HD>
<DH>Media: The move is seen as a vote of confidence at a time
of growing concerns about the company's financing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER LOFTUS</AU>
<BD>DOW JONES/ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At a time of growing concerns about its financing, AOL Time Warner
Inc. received a vote of confidence from commercial banks Monday by
obtaining new credit facilities totaling $10 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The new facilities replace two maturing this year. They don't
automatically change AOL's sizable long-term debt balance of about
$28 billion or its cash balance of $857 million.</LD>
<LD>   But Wall Street analysts suggested the move couldn't hurt investor
confidence in AOL, which has been shaky in recent weeks. Last week,
AOL shares hit a 52-week low of $12.04. Shares fell 61 cents to $14
on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "The positive thing about it is, it just continues to show the
support the company is getting from the commercial banking
community," said Youssef Squali, analyst with First Albany.</TE>
<TE>   AOL said late Monday that it had closed a $6-billion, five-year
revolving credit facility and a $4-billion, 364-day revolving
facility. They were arranged through a syndicate of 27 banks that
provided for almost $12 billion of commitments, the company said. The
agents were ABN Amro, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citibank and J.P.
Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   AOL may dip into the credit facilities for same-day funding,
multi-currency capability and letter-of-credit availability.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the continued support and confidence in our
company's financial stability and prospects that the banks and
investment banks are showing by providing these credit commitments,"
Wayne Pace, AOL Time Warner's chief financial officer, said in a news
release.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, investors have grown increasingly concerned
about AOL's balance sheet. Its long-term debt has risen, partly
because of its agreement earlier this year to purchase the 49% stake
in AOL Europe that it didn't already own from Bertelsmann  for $6.75
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some investors have worried that AOL could be on the hook to
pay upward of $10 billion to purchase the 25% stake in its Time
Warner Entertainment partnership that it doesn't already own from
AT&amp;T Corp. AOL and AT&amp;T are in discussions over the fate of AT&amp;T's
stake.</TE>
<TE>   The general fear has been that AOL would take actions to hurt its
credit rating and increase its borrowing costs. To counter these
fears, AOL executives, led by Chief Executive Richard Parsons, have
gone out of their way to assure investors that the company will work
hard to maintain its investment-grade debt ratings.</TE>

<HD>The Big-Game Hunter Behind Vivendi Coup</HD>
<DH>Claude Bebear was pivotal to CEO's dismissal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In France, his colleagues call him "Crocodile Claude."</LD>
<LD>   It's a fitting moniker for Claude Bebear, whose passion for
big-game hunting rivals his zest for buying up smaller companies. His
predatory instincts helped him build one of the world's largest
insurance companies, Axa.</LD>
<LD>   Bebear, 66, may have nabbed his biggest prey yet in Jean-Marie
Messier, the fallen media king of Vivendi Universal whose dramatic
ouster Bebear helped engineer.</LD>
<TE>   Many reasons were behind Messier's spectacular flameout: He was an
architect of muddled strategy, he built up huge debt from a two-year
buying spree, and his communications with investors were clumsy and
often contradictory.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's downfall ultimately came down to politics. He lost
the support of his French boardroom allies that had been his bulwark
against a hostile North American faction led by the Bronfman family
of Canada, which blamed Messier for a nearly $2-billion loss in the
value of its holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Its coup against Messier last week, however, would not have
succeeded had it not been for Bebear. Soft-spoken, with a neat shock
of white hair, the man who sometimes is called the godfather of
French capitalism methodically worked behind the scenes to rally
French board members against the onetime boy wonder of French
capitalism, many observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear "was the ringleader," said Marie-Paule Virard, author of a
recent book on the French business elite. "He played a critical role
in Messier's firing."</TE>
<TE>   With the flamboyant chief executive gone, Bebear will play an even
more important role in the future of Vivendi, owner of Universal
Studios and Universal Music Group. At the same emergency board
meeting where Messier's resignation was made final, Bebear was named
to a seat on Vivendi's 17-member board and heads a key finance
committee charged with the task of averting a financial collapse. The
company is said to be close to working out a deal with lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's new management team, led by new CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou,
acknowledged last week that the company faced a short-term cash
crunch, disclosing that it must pay 1.8 billion euros to lenders by
the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to employees Monday, Fourtou downplayed speculation
that he would immediately begin the breakup of the company. "My top
priority over the next few days is to solve our company's short-term
liquidity problems. I am convinced that we will succeed because,
beyond this difficult situation, the majority of Vivendi Universal's
businesses are doing well and form a strong asset."</TE>
<TE>   As Vivendi seeks to buy more time with lenders, the company will
depend heavily on Bebear, who is well-regarded by the French banks
because of his track record at Axa. In 20 years, he turned a small
mutual insurance firm in Normandy into one of the world's largest
insurers. He did so through a series of takeovers, including
acquiring a majority stake in U.S. insurance powerhouse Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the U.S. in 1991. Its holdings include
Alliance Capital Management, a leading seller of mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear also has close ties to the same French banks that
threatened to pull the credit plug on Vivendi if Messier wasn't
ousted, according to sources close to the board. Bebear is a director
of Banque National de Paris, one of Vivendi's top lenders.</TE>
<TE>   A lover of Chinese art and fine wines, Bebear once compared
managing Axa to hunting, setting his sights on a target and bagging
it, whether it was a gazelle or a rival insurance company. He told an
interviewer in 1997, "There are always plenty of opportunities in the
world. You have to study them, and when you realize they are true
opportunities, to pounce on them."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with French weekly Le Point, Messier accused
Bebear of working to oust him so he could remain the only French
executive who had succeeded in the United States. Bebear declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear and Axa, it turns out, have had a contentious relationship
with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Axa was a key player in film financing from 1994 to 1998, when the
company wrote $2 billion worth of insurance policies guaranteeing
that banks would be paid even if film revenues fell short and didn't
cover costs. Axa covered more than 100 movies, including "The Saint,"
"U-Turn" and "The Mirror Has Two Faces."</TE>
<TE>   Despite huge premiums, the policies were a big loser for Axa. The
company took a $1-billion reserve against losses and is embroiled in
a lawsuit accusing the Hollywood bankers of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The plot to unseat Messier began in May, when Bebear said in a
radio interview that Vivendi has "a strategy and a decision problem"
and suggested that the board remove Messier. He told French newspaper
Le Monde that he was concerned that an "accident" with Vivendi could
spread to other publicly traded French companies. Bebear is chairman
of Axa, which owned 5.7 million shares of Vivendi at the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very rare public and startling commentary that was a
real clarion call," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the
Yale School of Management.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks didn't surprise his compatriots, who regard him as a
sort of French Warren Buffett.</TE>
<TE>   Said Virard: "Bebear above all is concerned about the image of the
French business establishment and the effect Vivendi's problems would
have on French banks."</TE>
<TE>   His admonishment couldn't have come at a worse time for Messier.
Vivendi's stock price was plummeting, and Messier had barely survived
a management crisis at the company's European pay-TV arm Canal Plus.
Messier's firing of Canal Plus Chairman Pierre Lescure, coupled with
critical remarks he made about French film subsidies, sparked an
uproar in France and fed a perception that Messier was selling out to
Hollywood. That suspicion was only intensified by Messier's move to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Messier further offended the French establishment with his love of
the limelight and his autobiography, in which he committed the taboo
of criticizing another French executive. "He [Bebear] wanted to throw
Messier out because he was not in the club," Virard added.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ill feeling against him, Messier survived the first
attempt by the Bronfmans to unseat him at a contentious May 29 board
meeting, thanks to the support of French members.</TE>
<TE>   But over the next month, Bebear's influence was evident as key
French board members turned against Messier. They included Bebear's
friends Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, who resigned from the board a week before
Messier's ouster, and Henri Lachmann, who is CEO of Schneider
Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear also has close ties to Fourtou.</TE>
<TE>   The two are good friends who in the early 1980s joined to create
Enterprises et Cites, an elite club of France's top bankers and
business executives. Lachmann also is a member of the club.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the interlocking relationships among French boards,
Fourtou sits on Axa's board, and Bebear sits on Lachmann's Schneider
Electric board.</TE>
<TE>   "He made the careers of Lachmann and Fourtou," Virard said. "It's
a club of friends."</TE>

<HD>Investors Still Seek Downtown L. A. Office Properties</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Buyers are overlooking the market's current
softness and looking for a safe institutional investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite increasing vacancies and a scarcity of big tenants looking
for space, real estate investors are lining up to buy high-rise
office buildings in downtown Los Angeles. An estimated $1 billion
worth of downtown high-rises have been sold or are expected to be put
on the market this year, real estate observers said.</LD>
<LD>   Trizec Properties recently bought out its partner at the 41-story
Ernst &amp; Young Plaza on Figueroa Street in a deal that valued the
skyscraper at $149 million. This year, an Orange County investment
firm agreed to pay more than $200 million for the landmark Arco
Plaza, despite numerous vacancies in the Flower Street complex with
twin 55-story towers.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of BP Plaza, a 1.4-million-square-foot skyscraper on
Bunker Hill, have received about 10 bids that exceed $250 million,
said people familiar with the sale proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   Many large institutional investors and their advisors are looking
beyond current weakness in the downtown office market as they seek
decent returns and an escape from Wall Street's downward trend, real
estate specialists said.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Los Angeles is viewed as an attractive option, a district
with a growing list of amenities, such as concert halls, restaurants
and loft-style apartments. No new office buildings are planned for
the area, so there will be no additional competition for years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are looking for a safe institutional investment, these
major institutional-quality trophy buildings are looking quite
attractive," real estate attorney Patrick Ramsey said. "There is more
interest in buying these [downtown towers] than suburban office
buildings in Encino."</TE>
<TE>   However, a few real estate brokers and players think investors may
be underestimating how low the market could go in the next few
months.</TE>
<TE>   The downtown office vacancy rate, after edging down last year,
recently climbed above 20% and probably will continue to rise, real
estate brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any landlord looking over the next 24 months sees that it will
only get worse," said veteran real estate broker Whitley Collins at
CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it seemed as if downtown Los Angeles would escape the
slowing economy and dot-com bust that sent rents and occupancy rates
plunging in several once-hot markets, including the Westside.
Downtown was one of the few major office districts in the country
where rents rose and the amount of occupied space grew. Several
architecture firms moved downtown, and many existing law, insurance
and financial services firms added space.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear the market has lost momentum, however. Several
companies have offered space for sublease recently, and few tenants
seem willing to expand. During the second quarter of this year, the
amount of occupied space fell by 240,000 square feet and wiped out
about half of last year's expansion, according to real estate
services firm Insigna/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 floors in Sanwa Bank Plaza at Figueroa Street and
Wilshire Boulevard will be available after the merger of Los
Angeles-based United California Bank and San Francisco-based Bank of
the West.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is growing concern about what will become of more
than 150,000 square feet of space troubled accounting firm Arthur
Anderson has leased in the city's tallest building, the 73-story
Library Tower on 5th Street.</TE>
<TE>   There is so much space available that a large tenant looking for
50,000 square feet would find more than 40 options downtown,
according to Insignia/ESG. "We still have a ton of activity," said
broker Chris Runyen at Grubb &amp; Ellis. But "when we lease a floor, we
get a floor back [to sublease] from someone else."</TE>
<TE>   In a growing sign the market is under pressure, landlords and
their leasing agents are dangling larger prizes and bonuses to get
brokers to show and lease space. At 911 Wilshire, a 22-story office
building, the broker who can fill two floors will walk away with four
season tickets to Lakers and Kings games.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to commissions, some landlords are offering brokers as
much as $4 for every square foot they lease.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not enough demand from large tenants to back-fill that
[empty] space right now," said brokerage manager Clay W. Hammerstein
at Insignia/ESG. "I think [the market] is going to stay pretty
static."</TE>
<TE>   Signs of softening in the market have not deterred the many
pension funds and other institutional investors with an appetite for
downtown Los Angeles real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Final and pending sales of office buildings this year have totaled
about $750 million, and an additional $270 million worth of property
soon may change hands, according to Real Estate Alert, a real estate
investment newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Some of downtown's established landlords also have increased their
investment in the central city office market.</TE>
<TE>   This year, MaguirePartners, downtown's largest landlord with about
5.5 million square feet of high-rise office space, bought out its
partner in Library Tower and is one of the bidders for BP Plaza.
Robert F. Maguire III, managing partner of MaguirePartners, said the
numerous bids for BP Plaza reflect expectations for higher rents. The
bidding for BP Plaza "is a real example of what a lot of investors
see happening in downtown L.A.," Maguire said. "We will act very
aggressively if we like the property."</TE>
<TE>   For investors shopping for properties nationwide, downtown Los
Angeles looks attractive in comparison with central business
districts in San Francisco and Boston, which have been hit by the
technology industry bust and a surge in construction.</TE>
<TE>   In a forecast of the nation's 10 largest office markets by Cushman
&amp; Wakefield, downtown Los Angeles emerged as No. 2, behind
Washington, with the best prospects of rental growth through the end
of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the investor interest has focused on the area's
top-quality towers, which tend to attract tenants even during tough
economic times.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the occupancy rate at the 41-story Ernst &amp; Young Plaza
at Figueroa and 7th streets rose to about 90% from about 65% and is
continuing to rise, said Michael Escalante, senior vice president at
building owner Trizec Properties. He said the firm has received
multiple offers from tenants at "very exciting rates" for the
building's top floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention is to expand in downtown Los Angeles," Escalante
said.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Scandals Bring Calls for Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The rash of corporate scandals this year could mark a turning point
in the way white-collar crime is viewed by the public and prosecuted
by the government, legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The popular refrain now is that simply fining executives for
wrongdoing under civil statutes won't stop financial abuses. The
threat of criminal prosecution--and prison--is the only effective
deterrent, some say.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to get the attention of corporate America until
we hear the click of the jail door on the backsides of some of these
executives who are manipulating the numbers," said James Cox, a Duke
University securities law professor.</LD>
<TE>   To achieve that, however, prosecutors will have to battle not just
powerful defendants and their talented lawyers but history as well.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what may appear to be monstrous financial fraud at
companies such as energy trader Enron Corp. and telecom giant
WorldCom Inc., it is notoriously difficult to win white-collar crime
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which can bring civil
cases but has no power to press criminal prosecutions, referred 523
white-collar cases to the Justice Department for criminal
investigation in the last decade, according to Transactional Records
Access Clearinghouse, a research group affiliated with Syracuse
University.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers rejected 292 of those cases, or more
than half. They landed convictions in 135 cases, and lost 42 others.
(The other 54 are in the pipeline, either still being tried or not
yet formally declined.)</TE>
<TE>   Of those convicted, 81 people went to jail.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, there has been talk in Washington about a new
Justice Department task force that would work directly with SEC
lawyers to pursue white-collar wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, President Bush is scheduled to give a speech in New York
outlining a new plan to address corporate malfeasance. He is
reportedly considering new statutes that would make it easier to
criminally prosecute executives for financial fraud. Democrats in
Congress are pursuing their own initiatives to tighten white-collar
fraud definitions and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll vigorously pursue people who break the law," Bush said at a
news conference on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors already have brought charges against two high-profile
executives: In June, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive
of conglomerate Tyco International Ltd., was indicted for alleged
sales-tax evasion, and Samuel D. Waksal, former head of troubled
biotech firm ImClone Systems Inc., was arraigned on insider-trading
and securities fraud charges. Lawyers for the two men have denied the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government is furiously trying to build a criminal
case against former executives of Enron. And Justice Department
officials have said they are looking into WorldCom after the
long-distance company said it misreported $3.9 billion in expenses,
masking huge losses in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Convictions Hard to Get</TE>
<TE>   Historically, however, convictions have been difficult to achieve
in white-collar crime cases, for a number of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are complex and dull to juries and time-consuming for
prosecutors, who must put in far more research time than in other
types of cases.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, when the charges are criminal, the legal burden is
higher than in civil cases. Prosecutors must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that an executive intentionally committed fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Civil regulators, by contrast, must show only that a defendant was
reckless.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in drug or murder cases, there may be little tangible
evidence to wave in front of a jury hearing a criminal
securities-fraud case. It's hard to disprove the claims of executives
that they relied on the advice of experts or that they merely made
bad financial decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In its duel against accounting firm Arthur Andersen, for example,
the government had a straightforward obstruction-of-justice case
related to Andersen's handling of client Enron's documents. The
shredding of documents was undisputed and a high-ranking Andersen
partner pleaded guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the government only barely won a conviction last month.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, criminal insider-stock-trading cases against
the likes of Ivan Boesky made for "a simple, vivid story," with
financiers furtively swapping confidential information about
companies, said Peter Romatowski, former chief of the
securities-fraud unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The cases could be pieced together through trading records and
phone logs.</TE>
<TE>   Securities fraud tied to accounting misdeeds, with no secret
meetings or hushed phone calls, "just does not have the same sex
appeal" for juries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And even though key executives of some now-defunct companies sold
millions of shares of stock before the firms failed, that alone is
not a crime. It must be shown to be related to some fraudulent act.</TE>
<TE>   In legal terms, there is no such thing as accounting fraud. In
criminal cases, executives now typically are charged with securities
fraud--meaning material misstatements or omissions in connection with
the sale or trading of securities--or related charges such as mail
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   As with most white-collar cases, the government is outmanned by
well-paid defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, by far the most
experienced in white-collar crimes, has a total of 50 lawyers in its
securities-fraud and major-crimes units, which handle these cases.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, prosecutors have some distinct advantages in today's
cases, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest is that public and congressional outrage is at a
boiling point. That gives the Justice Department a mandate to be
aggressive and devote extensive resources to prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to see jail time and more of it for major
white-collar offenses," said James Comey, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, prosecutors now see securities fraud as a career booster,
attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   "False financial statements are now a fad," Romatowski said.
"There were a lot of financial-fraud cases that were gathering dust
at the back of prosecutors' file drawers that are now getting dusted
off and getting a high priority due to Enron."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Public Perception</TE>
<TE>   The changed public thinking will show up in judges and juries,
experts say. Juries have often been sympathetic to white-collar
defendants, seeing their crimes as infractions of highly technical
laws that left few victims, experts said. Some judges have been
reluctant to impose stiff sentences.</TE>
<TE>   But with the stock market floundering and the pension plans of
some major firms in tatters, the new perception is that white-collar
crime sows extensive destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The result of these cases is people are going to see [executives]
as no different than the person who robs 10 banks," said Cox, the
securities law professor.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersen case was encouraging in one aspect, said John Coffee,
a Columbia University securities law expert: Though jurors were
divided on what prosecutors deemed to be the main evidence, they
sought out other facts to support a conviction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When a jury is convinced something is wrong, they may sit in the
jury room a long time sifting through the evidence until they can
find something they all agree was wrong," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   "By this point, the country is convinced we've entered into the
private sector's Watergate, and that tends to make juries far more
suspicious and hostile [toward white-collar defendants] than they
would have been 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have another advantage: a ready-made motive for fraud,
because of the enormous sums executives earned through stock options
in recent years. U.S. attorneys are certain to paint their cases as
morality plays, with greedy CEOs fudging their books to boost their
stocks and inflate their own pay.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic structure has a lot of sizzle," said Christopher Bebel,
a former prosecutor who focused on economic crimes. Executives "got
filthy rich and it will be easy for prosecutors to portray them as
villains. That will hold the attention of the jurors."</TE>
<TE>   The criminal investigations are being pursued so vigorously now in
part because jail terms have come to be viewed as perhaps the only
way to preempt executive fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has historically imposed fines on the stockbrokers and
investment firms it regulates. But monetary penalties are
increasingly seen as ineffectual.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen, for example, paid a $7-million SEC fine last year
for its flawed audits of Waste Management Inc., but apparently didn't
reform its handling of Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   "Criminal actions are essential when you're dealing with people in
the income level of CEOs and [chief financial officers] of major
companies," said Richard Breeden, a former SEC chairman. "If somebody
is making $105 million a year, for him to consent to an injunction
from the SEC that he won't do it again doesn't create adequate
deterrence. You've got to put him in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Yet whatever sentences are meted out are unlikely to be long.
Former junk bond king Michael Milken, who pleaded guilty to six
felony counts of securities fraud and other violations in 1990,
served 22 months of a 10-year sentence. The average prison term last
year in the cases of white-collar criminals referred by the SEC to
the Justice Department was 28 months, according to Transactional
Records Access Clearinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   But for those accustomed to boardrooms and chartered jets, the
specter of any jail time may scare them straight, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "To a white-collar defendant, the prospect of criminal conviction
and any jail time is horrific," said Bruce Baird, who headed the
securities unit of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in the late
1980s. "I have yet to see a client who didn't take that seriously and
who wasn't scared to death."</TE>

<HD>EBay to Acquire Online Payment Service PayPal</HD>
<DH>Internet: The auction site will shutter its unprofitable
Billpoint unit when $1.5-billion stock deal closes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc. widened its rule over the Internet auction world Monday
with an agreement to acquire online payment service PayPal Inc. in a
$1.5-billion stock swap reminiscent of the headiest days of the
dot-com boom.</LD>
<LD>   EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman said the deal was expected to
close by the end of the year. The deal would give PayPal stockholders
0.39 share of EBay stock for every PayPal share, valuing PayPal at
$21.93 a share at Monday's closing prices.</LD>
<LD>   EBay also announced that results for the latest quarter would
exceed forecasts. The firm expects to report second-quarter earnings
of 19 cents a share on revenue of about $266 million this month,
compared with its earlier forecast of 17 cents on revenue of $260
million to $265 million.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of San Jose-based EBay fell $4.31 to $56.24 and those of
Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal closed up $1.61 at $21.61; both
trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal acts as a middleman for transactions, allowing online
buyers and sellers to use credit cards even if the seller is not an
authorized credit card merchant.</TE>
<TE>   EBay has been profitable every quarter since going public in
September 1998, but its own payment system, Payments by Billpoint,
was never as successful as PayPal.</TE>
<TE>   "EBay recognized in PayPal something it might have taken them
years to build on their own," said Christopher Penny, an analyst for
Friedman Billings Ramsey. "They might have gotten there on their own,
but they had the money, so why not buy it?"</TE>
<TE>   Billpoint had been losing $10 million to $15 million a year, EBay
executives said. PayPal--which went public in February--reported
profit of $1.2 million in the first quarter this year.</TE>
<TE>   Billpoint would shutter when the sale closes. It was acquired by
EBay in June 1999 for $86 million.</TE>
<TE>   EBay transactions account for about 60% of PayPal's business. The
payment company, which would remain a separate operation, would give
up a much smaller source of revenue, online gambling sites. About 8%
of its revenue comes from online gaming transactions, according to
PayPal's quarterly earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a trade-off," said Carrie Johnson, a retail analyst with
Forrester Research. "Now that PayPal is aligned with a more
legitimate company, they will make up that income in other areas. And
not being in gaming makes it seem more secure for the general
consumer."</TE>
<TE>   But PayPal suffers from complaints about its customer service.
Users knock long waits on hold and accounts being frozen
unnecessarily during security checks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know personally that waiting times can be as long as 45
minutes," Penny said.</TE>
<TE>   The frozen accounts spawned three class-action suits. No trial
dates have been set.</TE>
<TE>   EBay executives declined to say how the customer service problems
might be eased.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal also ran into friction with banks and major credit card
companies. This year MasterCard said it wanted to examine third-party
electronic transactions more carefully for possible fraud. That
situation was probably eased, Penny said, with the announcement in
June that Wells Fargo &amp; Co. would process PayPal's credit card
transactions. "Wells Fargo and MasterCard have a close relationship,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before PayPal was introduced in October 1999, the majority of
payments on EBay were by checks or money orders sent through the
mail. Now 60% of EBay deals are made via PayPal or Billpoint. The
services charge sellers a percentage of the transaction as a fee.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal had a strategy to help build its subscriber base. When
buyers paid through the service, PayPal sent e-mail to sellers
notifying them that the money was ready to be put into their
accounts. All they had to do was register.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite brilliant," said EBay Chief Financial Officer Rajiv
Eutta. "The whole concept built them fast."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Billpoint premiered in March 2000, PayPal had a
substantial subscriber base.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one area where the first-mover advantage really paid
off," Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Borrowing Rises at 6.8% Rate in May</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans, shrugging off worries about the strength of the recovery,
increased their borrowing in May at the fastest pace in six months.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve said Monday that consumer credit rose at an
annual rate of 6.8% in May, the strongest rate of growth since a 15%
growth rate in November.</LD>
<LD>   The May increase left consumer borrowing at $1.71 trillion. The
gain of $9.5 billion in May followed a revised $8.6-billion increase
in April. That represented a 6.1% annual growth rate.</LD>
<TE>   The May advance was about $2 billion more than private analysts
had been expecting. They said the larger-than-expected gain showed
that consumers were helping to keep the recovery from last year's
recession from faltering.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers are focusing on the positive rather than the negative,"
said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research in New York. "They saw record
low mortgage rates, rising incomes and contained prices and responded
to that rather than corporate malfeasance, Middle East troubles and
the collapse in the stock market."</TE>
<TE>   Demand for revolving credit, the category that includes credit
cards, rose by $2.4 billion to $712.2 billion, an annual growth rate
of 4.1%, down from a 7.5% growth rate in April.</TE>
<TE>   Nonrevolving credit, the category that includes auto loans, rose
by $7.1 billion, to $993.6 billion, an annual growth rate of 8.7%,
compared with a 5.1% rate of increase in April.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending has held up remarkably well throughout the
recession, which began in March 2001, and the aftermath of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although private economists had expected a drop in spending this
year, given the rise in unemployment, consumer demand has stayed
strong.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts credit this to the fact that the downturn was relatively
mild and the Federal Reserve has held interest rates at the lowest
levels in decades, spurring home and car sales and high levels of
mortgage refinancings.</TE>

<HD>Universal to Put MP3 Songs Online</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: About 1,000 older albums will be offered,
unscrambled, to EMusic subscribers for downloading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the major record companies' largest experiment to date with MP3
files, Universal Music Group is expected to make 1,000 older albums
available online in that format today through its EMusic subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time a major record company has allowed any of its
albums to be released as unscrambled MP3s, a format the labels have
shunned because it can be freely pirated over the Internet. Aside
from a few singles from AOL Time Warner's Warner Music Group, the
five majors have released downloadable songs only in copy-protected
formats that deter piracy but sacrifice flexibility and portability.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the first time any major-label music has made its way
into a subscription service that lets consumers acquire an unlimited
amount of music for a flat monthly fee. EMusic lets its 50,000
subscribers download an unlimited number of songs from 900
independent labels for $9.99 to $14.99 a month.</LD>
<TE>   The move reflects the growing willingness by Universal, an arm of
Vivendi Universal and the world's largest record company, to
compromise on security in the hope of boosting online sales and
weaning consumers from piracy. For example, it recently disclosed
plans to make tens of thousands of downloadable songs available in a
format that could be burned onto CD, effectively removing the songs'
electronic locks.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Kenswil, president of Universal's ELabs, acknowledged that
the deal with EMusic was a compromise on security. One of the
benefits, though, is providing an outlet for albums that are
increasingly hard to find in stores, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The albums provided through EMusic will be older rock, pop, jazz
and blues records by the likes of Chuck Berry, Neil Diamond, Billie
Holiday and Sonic Youth. "We have this catalog of great music that's
not getting the audience it should," he said, partly because
retailers don't have the space for the tens of thousands of CDs still
in print.</TE>
<TE>   Founded late in 1997, EMusic rode the Internet-stock surge to a
peak value of more than $250 million. But its inability to win
licenses from the major labels stopped the company from building much
of a following, and Universal snapped it up in April 2001 for only
$22 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kohn, an EMusic founder who now runs the online comedy outlet
Laugh.com, said the main stumbling block for the major labels has
always been the MP3 format and the fear of piracy. But "all of the
major record companies' music has already been available in the MP3
format by users who rip [MP3s] from CDs," Kohn said.</TE>
<TE>   EMusic and Universal declined to release the financial terms of
their agreement.</TE>
<TE>   If EMusic has to pay Universal a fee for every song downloaded, as
is typical in such deals, heavy downloading could conceivably cost
EMusic more than it collects in subscription fees.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Reports It Is Retaining Customers</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: The company is buoyed by results as it
awaits bids on its worldwide fiber-optic network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buoyed by monthly results that were better than expected, Global
Crossing Ltd. said Monday that it was losing fewer long-distance
customers than anticipated during its bankruptcy case and was busily
signing new customers, especially in Europe, to large contracts for
Internet services.</LD>
<LD>   The increase in high-speed carrier business, offset by lower
prices industrywide and slack sales of dial-up Internet services and
other older services, comes as the company awaits bids Thursday for
all or parts of its worldwide fiber-optic network.</LD>
<LD>   "That customers haven't left them doesn't surprise me. But what
does surprise me is that companies that have contracts with Global
are extending them and signing on for more services," said analyst
David Neil of research firm Gartner Inc.'s Toronto office, who has
talked with many Global customers.</LD>
<TE>   "They don't think Global is going to go down. They say that
Global's not a significant risk," he said. And customers say service
is improving on the cutting-edge network that connects 200 cities in
27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   But the company can't continue for long on its own, he said, even
though it has reduced spending dramatically and put non-core assets
on the block, including its Global Marine cable-laying and
maintenance operation.</TE>
<TE>   The $500 million that investor Warren Buffett and two others plan
to make in Level 3 Communications Inc. raised the specter that it
might bid on Global's assets, but analysts were unsure that Level 3,
with its own huge debt load, could make a meaningful bid. Carriers
such as AT&amp;T Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. could benefit from
parts of Global but have expressed little interest thus far. Los
Angeles financier Tom T. Gores probably will use his Platinum Equity
to bid for the entire network.</TE>
<TE>   Freed from onerous payments on $12.4 billion in bonds used to
build the network, Global is showing what it can do as a
telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   In boasting that its Internet traffic has increased 400% this
year, Global said its ability to switch customers to its network
within 24 hours was a key attraction. In Europe, that is helping
bring in customers from the collapsed KPNQwest, the Dutch company
that started closing its fast-Internet business last week as it
searches for a buyer for the rest of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Global's chief executive, John Legere, said the company
had 85,000 customers. Global had expected to lose 3% of its customers
while it is in Chapter 11 proceedings. But so far, the company said,
it has not reached that mark. It would not provide further details.</TE>
<TE>   For May, though, the numbers were only starting to kick in, the
company said. Global lost $137 million, or 15 cents a share, an
improvement from its April loss of $163 million, or 17 cents a share.
Revenue slid slightly to $262 million in May from $266 million in
April.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the company was able to pad its cash on hand by
$30 million to $766 million, thanks to the sale of assets by its
59%-owned subsidiary Asia Global Crossing Ltd., which is not in
bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Without the subsidiary's sales, Global Crossing and its units
operating under Chapter 11 saw cash on hand drop $21 million, far
less than in previous months. The company also has $392 million in
restricted cash, mainly proceeds from the sale of assets that can be
used only with Bankruptcy Court approval.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of cash the company spends each month is an important
gauge of how long it can exist and how much it will have to fund a
reorganization. Legere has said the company would probably file a
plan competing against the bidders to recapitalize Global.</TE>

<HD>HP Brings Out Servers With Intel Itanium 2 Processor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. launched a line of high-end server and
workstation computers Monday that will be among the first products to
have Intel Corp.'s Itanium 2 processor.</LD>
<LD>   HP, which recently merged with Compaq Computer Corp., commands
nearly one-third of the $50-billion global market for servers,
powerful computers capable of running Web sites and managing
e-commerce transactions. The Palo Alto-based company is the largest
seller of servers, followed by IBM Corp. with a 23% share and Sun
Microsystems Inc. with 15%, according to market research firm IDC.</LD>
<LD>   The new HP servers aim at the high end of the market, where volume
is lower but profit margins are wider. About 20 companies will
introduce servers in the next few months based on Itanium 2, arguably
Intel's most critical product launch of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Clara chip company, which dominates the low- to
mid-priced server market but is weak in the high-end server market,
launched its first Itanium product last year to address this gap. But
sales were disappointing, partly because of the chip's low
performance. This year's chip is expected to be twice as fast.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for servers has slowed because of general economic malaise
and a reluctance by companies to buy costly computers. In the first
three months of this year, server sales dropped 20%, to $13.4
billion, while volume remained flat at just over 1 million servers
shipped, compared with the same period last year, according to IDC.
HP has been able to maintain its market during that time, said Mark
Hudson, HP's worldwide marketing manager for servers and
workstations.</TE>

<HD>Power, Money Behind Jackson's Attack on Sony, Insiders Say</HD>
<DH>Music: Some in the industry question the pop singer's
motives in going after his longtime record company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop star Michael Jackson is taking off the glove.</LD>
<LD>   He has pitted himself against the chairman of Sony Music
Entertainment Inc., Thomas D. Mottola, with whom Jackson has
successfully worked for more than a decade. The eccentric singer
attended Mottola's wedding and birthday party and has, on numerous
occasions, showered the executive publicly with "special thanks" for
his support at Sony.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's calling Mottola "mean"--and worse.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a racist and he's very, very, very devilish," Jackson said
during a weekend news conference in New York, where he waved a sign
bearing a horned image of the music honcho, encouraging the
entertainment executive to "go back to hell."</TE>
<TE>   Why the fiery words?</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he is furious with Mottola for the poor showing of
the singer's "Invincible" CD, saying Sony failed to adequately
promote the recording. He also has accused Sony and other record
companies of conspiring to cheat artists--particularly black
artists--out of royalty payments.</TE>
<TE>   Mottola declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sony said, "The bizarre, false statements Mr. Jackson made on
Saturday make it clear that his difficulties lie elsewhere than with
the marketing and promotion of  'Invincible.' "</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a growing consensus in the industry is that Jackson's
conversion to civil rights crusader and artist rights activist is
selfishly motivated. Label executives and others said Jackson--the
best-paid artist in the business--is piggybacking on the current
artist rights movement to pressure Sony into breaking its contract so
he can leave with his valuable catalog of master recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Jackson is under contract until 2004 with Sony, which
can hold on to his master recordings until 2010, sources said. He
owes the firm four more tracks to be released in a greatest-hits and
a boxed-set package.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the music industry find Jackson's pleas of poverty and
discrimination to be disingenuous. Once the world's most famous music
star, the aging singer holds what is believed to be the richest
recording contract signed.</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of his fame, Jackson struck an unprecedented
partnership deal with Sony under which he receives half of what the
company earns on his music, sources said. Most acts sign deals with a
12% royalty, and some of the biggest stars earn no more than 24%.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also became one of a handful of superstars to be granted
so-called reversion rights to their recordings, sources said. That
means in eight years Jackson will have the ability to distribute his
own greatest-hits packages or license them to one of Sony's
competitors. Typically, record companies own and keep all recordings
on their labels in perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Jackson's contract requires Sony to pay unusually
large advances for recording fees and video costs, as well as similar
commitments for marketing and promotion. Jackson was one of the
original trendsetters in music videos and has a reputation for
spending millions per video.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has accused Sony of giving his "Invincible" album short
shrift. Although he expressed gratitude to Mottola and other Sony
executives in the CD's liner notes, he now blames the album's poor
performance on the company's alleged lack of commitment to marketing
and promoting the project.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson received preferential treatment seldom showered on other
artists during the "Invincible" project. The company spent more than
$26 million to craft an elaborate global marketing, promotion and
publicity campaign to support the album, said sources familiar with
the "Invincible" budget.</TE>
<TE>   The project's two music videos cost more than $7 million to
produce. That's three or four times what most companies budget for
two videos.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Jackson showed up a day late to the set of the "You
Rock My World" video and left early, forcing Sony to hire a body
double to finish the video, which ran about $3 million over budget,
sources said. In October, the singer failed to show up at the set of
his "Cry" video, which the company was forced to shoot without his
participation. Both videos fell quickly out of rotation on MTV.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson got even angrier at Sony when the company rejected his
request to do a violence-tinged video for "Unbreakable," for which
Jackson submitted an $8-million proposal, sources said. Jackson never
responded to a video concept pitched by Sony for "Butterflies," one
of the only songs on the album that radio stations seemed to embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Jackson also agreed to a proposed concert tour of the
U.S. and Europe to support the album but then changed his mind. In
February, he backed out of a commitment by his managers to appear on
a 10-day promotional sweep of European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also turned down all but one of the company's requests to
promote the record to black radio stations, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   To date, "Invincible" has sold about 5 million copies, earning
Sony the dubious honor of underwriting what competitors say is the
most expensive marketing campaign in music history. Sony spent more
than $5 per CD on marketing and promotion, more than twice what most
companies spend to market superstar projects.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources say the company also paid $25 million in advances
to record the album.</TE>
<TE>   That figure included a $2.4-million personal advance to Jackson
and $5 million in travel expenses for Jackson and his entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry said Jackson orchestrated the racial attack
to embarrass Mottola, who had a previously scheduled meeting with
Sony Corp.'s top brass Monday. They said Jackson is betting Sony
might cut him free early with his catalog and allow him to shop a
deal elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors interviewed this week said Jackson will be hard
pressed to find another company that would repeat Sony's cash outlays
on his next record.</TE>
<TE>   And executives said it would be difficult for Jackson to cut a new
deal without his master recordings in hand.</TE>

<HD>Buffett, Others Buy Stake in Level 3</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Billionaire investor and his partners will pump
$500 million into the fiber-optic network operator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire Warren Buffett on Monday agreed to buy a stake in a
beaten-down telecommunications company.</LD>
<LD>   But investors who were hoping the news might spark a broad rally
in the depressed telecom sector were disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett, who traditionally has balked at investing in technology
businesses, agreed with two partners to pump $500 million into
fiber-optic network operator Level 3 Communications Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., along with
investment firms Longleaf Partners Funds and Legg Mason Inc., will
invest the cash in return for a 10-year convertible bond yielding 9%
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3, whose fiber-optic lines carry
voice and data transmissions, said it may use the capital to buy
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares soared $1.47, or 51%, to $4.36 on Nasdaq, and
traded as high as $5.34. But the stock is a shadow of its former
self: It had reached $130 in the tech-stock heyday of March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The report's effect on other telecom stocks was muted at best.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications gained 28 cents to $2.10 and Sprint FON added
17 cents to $11.47, while Nextel Communications fell 19 cents to
$2.91 and Broadwing lost 22 cents to $2.99.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 and companies such as Global Crossing Ltd., which is
operating under bankruptcy protection, spent billions building
networks in anticipation of a surge in demand for phone and data
traffic that never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett said in a statement that he thinks Level 3 can capitalize
on its rivals' difficulties. "Liquid resources and strong financial
backing are scarce and valuable assets in today's telecommunication
world," he said. "Level 3 has both."</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like Buffett thinks Level 3 may be one of the survivors
and might mop up some of the other casualties," said Michael Micko, a
bond analyst at Newton Investment Management in London.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a personal connection between Buffett and Level 3:
The telecom firm's chairman, Walter Scott Jr., is a director of
Berkshire Hathaway.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett, who says he prefers simple businesses, shunned tech
shares in the 1990s, investing instead in firms such as Dairy Queen
and paint maker Benjamin Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 annual meeting why he avoids
tech stocks, Omaha-based Buffett said: "I don't know what that world
will look like in 10 years and don't want to play in a game where the
other guy has an advantage over me."</TE>
<TE>   The Level 3 deal is classic Buffett in one sense, analysts said:
He's demanding a high-income return (the 9% yield) rather than simply
taking a chance on price appreciation for his investment.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are convertible into Level 3 stock, at the investors'
option, at a price of $3.41 a share. If eventually converted into
shares, the bonds would give the investors a 27% stake in Level 3.</TE>
<TE>   Longleaf invested $300 million in Level 3, while Berkshire
Hathaway and Legg Mason each bought $100 million of the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 lost $90 million in the first quarter on sales of $386
million.</TE>

<HD>Fresh Worries Send Shares Into Retreat</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: News on Merck's bookkeeping and Alcoa's weak
results end a brief rally. The Dow falls 104.6 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerns about Merck's accounting practices and a weak profit report
from Alcoa cut short Wall Street's rally Monday, sending the Dow
Jones industrials down more than 100 points and technology stocks
sharply lower.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 104.6 points, or
1.1%, at 9,274.9, giving back almost a third of Friday's 324-point
advance.</LD>
<LD>   Broader stock measures also retreated. The most significant losses
came in the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, which fell
42.75 points, or 3%, to 1,405.61. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
fell 12.05 points, or 1.2%, to 976.98. Nasdaq gained almost 5% on
Friday, while the S&amp;P advanced 3.7%.</LD>
<TE>   The overall market was mixed. Advancing issues led decliners by 8
to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, but winners led losers by 2 to 1
on Nasdaq. Trading was light.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said some of the selling reflected the same problems that
have dogged the market for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A Wall Street Journal story questioning Merck's accounting
practices sent the drug maker's stock down as investors yet again
wondered about the truthfulness of corporate earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   Merck, which denied wrongdoing, fell $1.05 to $47.81. Meanwhile,
Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock, citing the possibility of a delay
in the planned spinoff of the company's Merck Medco unit, which was
expected to happen as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting issues also hurt WorldCom, which fell 2 cents to 23
cents as Congress began hearings on whether the telecommunications
company defrauded investors through its bookkeeping. Two former top
WorldCom executives refused to testify before the committee Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointing quarterly results sent Alcoa down 88 cents to $32.50
after the aluminum company failed to meet analysts' forecasts,
despite its first quarter-to-quarter revenue increase in more than a
year. Like Merck, Alcoa is a Dow stock.</TE>
<TE>   Worries that second-quarter results--which will be reported over
the next few weeks--won't be strong enough to justify higher stock
prices have prompted investors to shun stocks. The recent string of
bookkeeping scandals has compounded the selling as investors decide
they're better off taking any profits now--rather than risk losing
them later on more bad news.</TE>
<TE>   "People are certainly waiting for the next shoe to drop," said
Michael Vogelzang, president of Boston Advisors Inc. "There's a
fairly prevalent sense of 'Who's going to be next, and which
companies in my portfolio are going to have that problem?' "</TE>
<TE>   Much of the selling in the tech sector focused on issues that
enjoyed big gains at the end of last week. Intel fell $1.04 to $18.50
after gaining 10% on Friday, and Microsoft fell $1.93 to $52.92,
erasing three-quarters of Friday's gains.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech losers included Texas Instruments, which lost 83 cents
to $24.15, and Dell, down $1.24 to $24.75. Dow member IBM dropped
$2.20 to $71.30.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar slumped to a nine-month low against
the yen while the euro notched its biggest one-day percentage gain
against the greenback this year. The dollar closed at 118.57 yen,
down from 120.20 yen Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The slide reversed the dollar's gains last week and came on the
heels of comments by Japan's finance minister that the dollar could
fall to the levels it hit after the Sept. 11 attacks of about 115
yen.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bond yields slipped as investors shifted money out of
stocks and into fixed-income securities. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 4.80% from 4.86% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices fell 73 cents to $26.07 a barrel--their biggest
one-day decline in five weeks--on expectations of an uninterrupted
flow of supply after the Fourth of July holiday passed without a
major terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Oil services stocks followed crude lower. Schlumberger tumbled
$1.66 to $45.06 and driller Noble fell $1.14 to $37.56.</TE>
<TE>   * Mentor Graphics fell $3.73, or 27%, to $10.24 after the maker of
semiconductor designing products warned that its second-quarter
results would fall far short of Wall Street expectations because
several large deals failed to close. The company warned after the
market closed Friday that it would post a loss for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Veritas Software tumbled $2.65, or 12%, to $19.31 after Morgan
Stanley's Joseph Farley cut his 2002 and 2003 earnings estimates.
"Technology spending is not recovering at the pace we earlier
anticipated," Farley said.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press, Reuters and Bloomberg News were used in

<HD>Mattel, Warner Bros. in Licensing Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. is expected to unveil today a major licensing agreement
with Warner Bros. to make toys stemming from films and TV shows
featuring the studio's Batman, Superman, Justice League, Looney Tunes
and Baby Looney Tunes characters.</LD>
<LD>   The four-year deal is considered a coup for Mattel in its
competition with rival Hasbro Inc., which had the master toy license
for Batman for 13 years. The deal covers all areas except Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say Warner executives were pleased with Mattel's work on
toys pegged to the release of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
and that they believe the El Segundo-based company's Fisher-Price
unit is poised to best exploit the "Baby Looney Tunes" animated
series scheduled to debut in the fall.</LD>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the deal said the agreement conservatively
could be worth at least $200 million for Mattel.</TE>
<TE>   The deal comes at a time when toy makers have been wary of
licensed toy deals because of disappointing results for such
franchises as "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel executives have said that the company cut its licensed toy
lines 25% in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Mattel decided not to renew a deal to make toys for
Walt Disney Co.'s newer films, prompting the studio to go with
Hasbro. Mattel's Fisher-Price, however, still produces toys based on
classic Disney characters.</TE>

<HD>Merck Sued Over Statements</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The drug maker is accused of providing
misleading data. SEC documents show it booked $12 billion in income
it never collected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmaceutical giant Merck &amp; Co. may have followed an acceptable
accounting practice in reporting $12 billion in income it never
received at its Medco Health Solutions pharmacy benefits unit, but
experts say drug makers and mail- order drug firms now will be
pressured to unveil all of their accounting and business
arrangements.</LD>
<LD>   A class-action lawsuit was filed Monday on behalf of Merck
shareholders, charging Merck officers and directors with "issuing
false and misleading statements concerning [the] business and
financial condition" of Merck and its wholly owned subsidiary, Medco
Health Solutions Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Medco reported in Securities and Exchange Commission documents
that it had booked as revenue $12 billion from patient co-payments to
pharmacies it had never collected. The news followed on the heels of
devastating admissions by WorldCom Inc. and other major companies
that their revenues had been inflated by billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Experts and analysts differed on the effect on Merck and the
planned initial public offering of 20% of Medco shares that still is
scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is more accounting confusion rather than Merck
actually doing anything wrong," said H&amp;R Block Financial Advisors
analyst Jason I. Fox. But Fox added that as long as Merck owns most
of Medco, it still would be "a cloud over the company."</TE>
<TE>   But there was considerable agreement that consumers have had their
fill of accounting practices that do not make sense to the average
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that these companies are going to have to be geared up to
talk about how and what they count as earnings," said
California-based health-care expert Peter Boland.</TE>
<TE>   Medco is the largest of the nation's 75 pharmacy benefit managers,
which compete with chain and independent pharmacies with cheaper
prices and mail-order service.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggested that the accounting questions would lead to more
scrutiny of another long-standing practice. The public, experts said,
may be more disturbed about the rebates PBMs earn from pharmaceutical
companies for guaranteeing to sell specific amounts of a certain
pharmaceutical company's drug or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   These rebates are, in part, supposed to be passed on to consumers
as savings, but in Medco's June 13 SEC filing, the company
acknowledged that it pockets most of the rebates and that "without
rebates earned from pharmaceutical companies, Medco would not have
been profitable in 1999, 2000 or 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have filed lawsuits charging that the rebates are really
an incentive program to push one manufacturer's drugs over another's
even though the drug might be more expensive and without clear
medical benefit. Critics charge this is how PBMs reap higher profits.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmacy benefit managers deny any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Deskin is president of the Pharmacy Benefit Management
Institute, a consultant group that provides information on PBMs to
employers, health plans and unions. Most clients, said Deskin, are
concerned about basic issues such as how quickly prescription
discount cards and prescriptions are processed.</TE>
<TE>   "How these PBMs account for their revenue really doesn't come up,"
Deskin said, adding that his clients must take it on faith that the
PBMs are offering the best drug at the best price and not pushing one
drug over another in order to reach a rebate quota.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the public is going to be far more concerned about the
rebates than about accounting practices," Deskin said.</TE>
<TE>   Merck stock closed at $47.81 Monday, down $1.05, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Online Payment Service Lives Out Dot-Com Dream</HD>
<DH>Investors: Founders could gain $111 million of EBay stock,
the sort of windfall start-ups sought during tech's heady days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>PayPal Inc. is taking tech investors on a trip down memory lane.</LD>
<LD>   By accepting a $1.5-billion takeover offer from EBay Inc. on
Monday, just five months after going public, PayPal is living the
Silicon Valley dream that went bust for most Internet-related firms
in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   PayPal priced its initial public offering at $13 a share in
February. At Monday's closing price of $21.61 on Nasdaq, up $1.61 for
the day, the stock is up 66% from the IPO.</LD>
<TE>   That's a healthy return for PayPal investors, though the stock has
been even higher: It reached $30.38 in late May before pulling back
with the broad market's sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, who started PayPal less than four
years ago, find themselves with the opportunity to rake in $111
million worth of EBay stock.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of X.com Corp.,
which merged with PayPal in March 2000, sits on the PayPal board and
stands to make $167 million from the takeover, based on
share-ownership data from Thomson Financial ShareWatch.</TE>
<TE>   Among the early investors in PayPal, which allows people to make
payments online, were Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture capital firms
Sequoia Capital and Clearstone Venture Partners, and investment banks
Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   Clearstone was in the second round of PayPal's fund-raising in
late 1999 and once owned about one-fifth of the company. After a
number of venture investment deals and the IPO, Clearstone's stake
settled to about 5.6%, making it the second-largest institutional
holder behind Sequoia, according to ShareWatch.</TE>
<TE>   "PayPal has kept a pretty low profile as far as their operations
are concerned, but it has been on a very steady growth curve since
early on," said Erik Lassila, a managing director at Clearstone.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal was founded in late 1998 as Confinity by Thiel and Levchin,
its chief technology officer. They launched as PayPal in October
1999, offering $10 cash to anyone who signed up for the service, and
they hitched their wagon early on to EBay, which now provides PayPal
about 60% of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal quickly surpassed earlier innovators such as DigiCash and
CyberCash. The firm's rapid growth caused customer-service problems,
but the company still achieved profitability for the first time this
year, with $1.2 million in earnings in the first quarter on about $49
million of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at a lot of online financial services companies and we
thought the models were flawed in many cases.," Lassila said. "It
wasn't at all clear at the time we invested, but we thought PayPal
had the right management."</TE>
<TE>   Lassila said it isn't clear whether Clearstone will cash out now
or hold the stock in EBay.</TE>
<TE>   "For now, I would say all the kudos go to the PayPal management
team," he said.</TE>

<HD>Port Talks Break for Visit to L.A. Sites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shipping lines and dockworkers broke from high-stakes contract
negotiations in San Francisco on Monday for a two-day tour of port
facilities in Los Angeles and Long Beach. The visit was arranged to
allow negotiators to see firsthand the technologies that are being
discussed at the bargaining table.</LD>
<LD>   Sources from both the Pacific Maritime Assn., representing
transpacific carriers, and the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union characterized the talks as moving very slowly, with
labor-cutting technologies and the union health benefit package the
main areas of contention.</LD>
<LD>   The contract, which covers about 10,000 workers in the Western
U.S., was due to expire last week, but both parties have agreed to
day-to-day extensions. No slowdowns or other disruptions have been
reported, to the relief of retailers across the country who are
counting on back-to-school and holiday shipments.</LD>
<TE>   The fear of disruption itself is already causing problems,
however. Many retailers moved their goods through the ports ahead of
schedule to head off potential supply problems and are now holding
full containers in their parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   That has caused a shortage of the wheeled platforms used to move
the containers back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which includes retailers and
manufacturers that use the ports, issued an appeal to its members to
"be good port citizens" and return the platforms.</TE>

<LD>Electric utility owner Entergy Corp. said that it expects
second-quarter profit to beat Wall Street estimates, citing surging
power sales and fewer shutdowns at the company's nuclear stations.</LD>
<LD>   The New Orleans-based company said earnings would come to at least
$1.15 a share, topping the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call of $1.11. In the year-earlier period, Entergy
earned $1.06 a share.</LD>
<LD>   Entergy, which posted 2001 revenue of $9.62 billion, also repeated
that it expects to report 2002 earnings of $3.40 to $3.60 a share, in
line with estimates of $3.53 a share.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alcoa Inc., the world's largest aluminum company, said second-quarter
profit fell 24% as increased production in China helped drive
aluminum prices lower.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings fell to $232 million, or 27 cents a share, from $307
million, or 35 cents, a year ago, the Pittsburgh-based company said.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's expectations had been falling over the last several
weeks and Alcoa's earnings came in 1 cent shy of estimates by
analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said, however, that Alcoa's cost-reduction program has
been respectable given the low prices for aluminum and that the
company fell roughly in line with their expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Alcoa said shipments rose 3.2% in the quarter, led by demand from
auto makers, builders and packaging companies, and said it was
controlling costs and operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue was down 12% from a year ago to $5.25 billion but up 5%
over the first quarter, the first sequential increase in six
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Alcoa fell 88 cents to close at $32.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Allegheny Energy Inc. said it will cut 600 jobs, or 10% of its work

prices, mild winter and spring weather and substantially decreased
energy trading since the collapse of Enron Corp. Allegheny invested
heavily last year in energy-trading operations.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. and its pilots' union struck a tentative deal
that would yield $465 million each year in wage cuts and other
concessions for 6 1/2 years to help keep the airline afloat,
according to the Air Line Pilots Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is a major step forward in the No. 6 carrier's bid
to cut costs, win approval of its application for government-backed
loans and if possible, avoid bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The wage cuts and cost reduction items are about 85% management's
latest request, a spokesman for the pilots' union said. Discussions
continued on issues still to be resolved.</LD>
<TE>   Arlington, Va.-based US Airways has struggled to stay financially
aloft since the Sept. 11 attacks. It is campaigning for about $1.3
billion in annual expense reductions from labor groups, suppliers,
lenders and creditors and has asked the federal government to back
$900 million of a $1-billion loan.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Accenture Ltd., the world's largest consulting company, said it will
slash about 1,000 jobs, or slightly more than 1% of its work force,
as the consulting industry faces slumping demand for services amid
the lingering economic downturn.</LD>
<LD>   Bermuda-registered Accenture is one of several management and
technology services companies that have been under pressure because
large corporations have reduced spending on information technology
projects.</LD>
<LD>   Accenture, part of an industry that usually has high turnover,
currently has one of its lowest rates of attrition, or the number of
staff leaving voluntarily, at 7%, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Accenture, which has a work force of 75,000 employees worldwide,
will be cutting consulting positions over the next few months, mainly
in management, the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Accenture fell 33 cents to $17.57 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The House panel probing Martha Stewart's sale of ImClone Systems Inc.
stock has issued a subpoena for her broker's home and cell phone
records from last December.</LD>
<LD>   The broker, Peter Bacanovic, was placed on leave last month by
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating whether
Stewart had inside information when she sold her ImClone shares a day
before federal regulators said they would not review the company's
cancer drug Erbitux. Stewart repeatedly has said her sale was lawful
and based on public information.</LD>
<TE>   "We gave [Bacanovic] every opportunity to provide these records
voluntarily, but we continue to get the runaround from his
attorneys," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Committee Chairman W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La).</TE>

comment.</TE>

<HD>Safeway's Profit Is in Line With Reduced Forecast</HD>
<DH>Retail: But grocer warns the economy and stiff competition
will continue to hurt results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Safeway Inc. on Monday posted weak second-quarter earnings in line
with a reduced forecast as stronger competition from discounters ate
into sales.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 3 U.S. grocery chain, which owns Vons in Southern
California, also warned that third-quarter profit may come in at the
low end of previous guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Safeway said operating profit in the second quarter ended June 15
fell 2% to $350.4 million, or 72 cents a share, from $358 million, or
69 cents, a year earlier. Net income, including one-time charges, was
up less than 1% to $309.3 million, or 63 cents, from $307.3 million,
or 59 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Total sales edged up 1.2% to $8.1 billion in the quarter. Sales at
stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, posted their first
decline in more than nine years.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Safeway has reported some of the strongest growth
in same-store sales in the grocery sector, but the slowing economy
and stiff competition on pricing has weighed on results.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to try to drive sales first and earnings second,"
said Andrew Wolf, an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets. "[Earnings]
are now secondary to sales, which means less visibility."</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, Safeway's same-store sales fell 0.4%. Wolf
estimates that the retailer's sales per square foot are down 3% so
far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sales] have to be positive," Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Safeway warned that its profit would fall short of
analysts' consensus estimate of 77 cents, citing economic softness
and disruptions in its buying operations. The company then forecast
profit of 71 cents to 73 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway closed up 44 cents at
$29.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has plunged 28%
since early June.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are trying to figure out whether Safeway's sudden sales
slump is a mere economic hiccup or the first sign of chronic
indigestion.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Burd, Safeway's chief executive, attributes the company's
sales weakness to more frugal shoppers who are buying fewer expensive
items at traditional supermarkets and buying more groceries from
discount merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Costco.</TE>
<TE>   The trend is provoking more price wars, Burd said, dampening sales
and squeezing profit margins in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway has decided to join the fray by reducing its everyday
prices as well as offering more sales promotions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not content with these [second-quarter] sales, by any
stretch," Burd told analysts during a conference call Monday. "We
think we have made the adjustments to change" the recent trends.</TE>
<TE>   With Safeway under the gun to lower its prices, Burd said the
company's third-quarter earnings probably will fall a penny or two
below the consensus estimate of 62 cents among analysts polled by
Thomson First Call.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Times has appointed Rick Wartzman as business editor.
Wartzman had been a writer and editor at the Wall Street Journal's
Los Angeles bureau until resigning to join The Times and finish
writing a book.</LD>
<LD>   He succeeds Bill Sing, who has been named senior editor in charge
of editing and creating special editorial sections for the paper.
Wartzman and Sing will assume their new posts in mid-September.</LD>
<LD>   "Rick is a highly talented writer and editor with a deep knowledge
of business," said John Carroll, editor of The Times. "He combines
the strengths of hard-news reporting and analysis with a sharp
interest in enterprise reporting."</LD>
<TE>   Wartzman had been on the Journal staff for nearly 15 years. He has
covered the steel industry, aerospace, the national economy,
Washington lobbying and the Clinton White House. Wartzman edited
feature stories for the Journal and wrote a monthly column. He was
the founding editor of the Journal's weekly California edition, and
he also served as Houston bureau chief. He joined the Journal in 1987
in its Pittsburgh bureau.</TE>
<TE>   As business editor since 1996, Sing, 44, oversaw an unprecedented
expansion of financial coverage in The Times. He supervised the most
important financial stories of the last decade, increased the size of
the business staff (it now has 89 reporters, editors, designers and
support staff) and made the business feature story a staple of the
front page.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure as editor, The Times' business section won a
Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Wartzman and Sing will report to Dean Baquet, managing editor.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Did Not Raise Red Flag, WorldCom Says</HD>
<DH>Telecom: In a February meeting, the company says it was not
told of any 'unusual transactions.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., rocked last month by a $3.9-billion accounting
scandal, said Monday that Arthur Andersen reported no problems with
its financial statements for 2001 during a meeting in February.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure came as the telecommunications giant provided more
details of the accounting fiasco in a revised filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom submitted its initial statement a week ago and was
immediately criticized by the SEC for not being more forthcoming.</LD>
<TE>   In the latest filing, WorldCom said its audit committee met Feb. 6
with Andersen to discuss its audit of the company's operating results
and financial position for the year ended Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen noted that there were "no significant or unusual
transactions" and that it had "no disagreements with management"
regarding accounting positions.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone provider, is
teetering on the verge of bankruptcy after disclosing June 25 it
disguised nearly $4 billion of expenses as capital expenditures to
appear more profitable.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has filed a civil fraud suit, and the Justice Department
also is investigating.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Monday before a House panel also probing the scandal,
WorldCom Chairman Bert Roberts called Andersen's failure to uncover
the irregularities "inconceivable."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, WorldCom's accountant during the five quarters in
question, has said its work was in compliance with SEC standards. It
has suggested that former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan
was to blame and claims important information was withheld from
auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying Monday before the House panel, former Andersen partner
Melvin Dick said auditors rely "on the honesty and integrity of the
management of the company."</TE>

accounting irregularities threatened former WorldCom Chief Executive
Bernard J. Ebbers with contempt Monday and called for jail time for
others involved in the phone giant's accounting debacle.</LD>
<LD>   At the first public hearing on an unfolding scandal that has
roiled Wall Street investors and Main Street pensioners, Ebbers
denied responsibility, saying, "I do not believe I have anything to
hide in these or any other proceedings."</LD>
<LD>   He read a short statement to the House Financial Services
Committee, saying, "No one will conclude that I engaged in any
criminal or fraudulent conduct during my tenure at WorldCom," and
afterward refused to answer questions from committee members. Also
summoned to testify were former Chief Financial Officer Scott D.
Sullivan; former Arthur Andersen partner Melvin Dick; Jack Grubman,
an investment analyst for Salomon Smith Barney; and two others.</LD>
<TE>   Ebbers was immediately condemned by Rep. Max Sandlin (D-Texas) and
several other panel members, who charged that Ebbers forfeited his
5th Amendment protection by elaborating on his innocence during his
stewardship of WorldCom, which ended in April, when he was forced out
and replaced by current CEO John W. Sidgmore.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee should hold him in contempt," Sandlin said of
Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The session unfolded as a confrontational, finger-pointing affair.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's Dick, for example, said neither he nor his firm had
"any inkling" that WorldCom moved routine maintenance costs to
capital spending accounts in violation of standard accounting
practices. And in a swipe at WorldCom, Dick added that he "would be
very interested to know how and when" the company's internal auditors
discovered the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony did little to dampen the public outcry over the
growing number of corporate financial scandals. In the wake of the
public uproar, politicians have taken aim at WorldCom and corporate
governance in general, a move that could reverse nearly two decades
of government deregulation of American business.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a dozen bills are circulating in Congress calling
for new accounting standards, limits on corporate executive loans and
other measures aimed at shoring up public confidence in the economy
and the stock market. Monday's hearing is the latest in a long list
of recent probes into corporate finances that began with Enron Corp.
in December and expanded to include Global Crossing Ltd. as well as
the financial oversight of corporate clients by the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Clinton,
Miss.-based WorldCom, contending that the nation's No. 2
long-distance carrier wrongly listed $3.9 billion as capital expenses
in 2001 and 2002, allowing it to hide losses of $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee also is looking into the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers did not appear to be in immediate danger of prosecution by
the House for his statements.</TE>
<TE>   Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) put off consideration
of contempt proceedings until the committee's legal staff could
examine Ebbers' testimony in detail. Congress has only infrequently
prosecuted witnesses for contempt after a wave of such actions during
the 1950s when former Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy accused dozens of
Americans of being Communists and subversives, according to
historians.</TE>
<TE>   Former WorldCom CFO Sullivan, who was fired last month after
acknowledging his role in the accounting irregularities, also invoked
the 5th Amendment. He escaped any threat of contempt because he did
not make a statement elaborating on his innocence or any role he
might have played in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for most of the afternoon, Sullivan escaped the
committee's wrath as members bore in on Ebbers, Dick, Grubman and two
current WorldCom executives.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Oxley singled out Grubman for criticism
before the investment analyst even testified.</TE>
<TE>   "We want ... to try to determine whether Mr. Grubman's failure to
recommend that investors sell their WorldCom stock until it became
virtually worthless can be explained by the hundreds of million of
dollars in underwriting fees that his firm collected from WorldCom,"
Oxley said.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, a prominent promoter of WorldCom and other telecom
stocks, told the panel: "I regret that I was wrong in rating WorldCom
highly for too long."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman went on to acknowledge that the company considered him
such a trusted ally it allowed him to attend three WorldCom board
meetings and have access to company financial information days before
it was made public. Nevertheless Grubman insisted he was unaware of
the company's true financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Committee member Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, took
aim at former Andersen partner Dick after the auditor demurred on
whether he thought he had been deceived by WorldCom officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop giving us these happy horsefeathers!" Ackerman said. "You
still feel the need to cover up for these guys? I thought you were
off the job."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Darlene Hooley (D-Ore.) followed up, asking Dick: "Have you
sat down and said to your colleagues, 'How in the world did we miss a
$3.8-billion discrepancy?' "</TE>
<TE>   Dick responded, "I have asked, since I became aware of this, other
members of the audit team whether or not they had any knowledge of
this, whether or not there was anything that we had done that should
have revealed this to us. And I've concluded, based on the work that
we did and my understanding of the work that the other members of the
team did, that we did our audit, and we did our audit in accordance
with all the things one would expect to do."</TE>
<TE>   Several panel members said that with voter outrage mounting over
corporate finance, Congress must do more than hold hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) called on colleagues to pass
laws that would put those who commit financial fraud in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) proposed that the nation's
1,000 largest companies be audited twice as frequently (or once every
six months) because "the world operates at least twice as fast as it
once did."</TE>
<TE>   While Ebbers' and Sullivan's decision to remain largely silent was
a prudent legal move, experts say they did little to help themselves
in the court of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Ebbers pushed the envelope a little and mightily strained the
committee's patience," said Charles Tiefer, former deputy general
council of the House of Representatives and now a University of
Baltimore law professor.</TE>
<TE>   "A witness who asserts the 5th Amendment but then climbs on top of
a soapbox at the same time looks unreconstructedly arrogant about
involvement in incriminating matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ebbers has painted a bull's-eye on his shirt. And an angry
public, which lost billions of dollars of its savings for his past
hubris, will not forgive him."</TE>

<HD>SEC Lacking Leadership, Critics Charge</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Vacancies hamper panel during challenging time
and should be filled quickly, legal experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when Wall Street faces its biggest challenge in years, the
stock market's top cop--the Securities and Exchange Commission--is
hamstrung by a leadership vacuum, critics say.</LD>
<LD>   Two commissioners' seats at the five-member SEC are vacant, while
two others are only temporarily filled.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties have been calling for the
resignation of Harvey L. Pitt, named SEC chairman by President Bush
last summer.</LD>
<TE>   Legal experts said it was urgent that the SEC's leadership gaps be
filled to bolster the agency's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ... bizarre that the other four commissioners for the SEC
have not been confirmed," said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington
University School of Law in St. Louis, Mo., and an expert on
securities law.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Glassman, a recent Republican nominee, is serving on the
SEC under a temporary recess appointment, awaiting Senate review.
Isaac Hunt, a Democratic holdover from the previous administration,
also has a recess appointment, but is not expected to be renominated
as a commissioner. Republican nominee and former accounting firm
executive Paul Atkins has been nominated but not yet confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Bush nominated two Democrats: Harvey Goldschmid, law
professor at Columbia University in New York and former SEC general
counsel; and Roel Campos, a lawyer and communications industry
executive in Houston who was an assistant U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Goldschmid nor Campos has been confirmed by the Senate.
The Goldschmid nomination has been sent from the White House to the
Senate Banking Committee for consideration, but the Campos nomination
has not, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The delays leave the controversial Pitt as the only officially
confirmed member of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned about the delays, Capitol Hill and Bush administration
aides said such holdups were not unusual. Asked about the Campos
nomination, a White House spokeswoman said, "He's going through the
process."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
said, "We expect that he'll be nominated." Campos couldn't be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a judge dismissed an SEC action against accounting firm
Ernst &amp; Young, finding procedural error in the fact that only one
commissioner could vote to approve the action, with two commissioners
having recused themselves and two seats empty.</TE>
<TE>   "As we saw with the Ernst &amp; Young business, when you only have a
small number of commissioners ... that in itself is a problem. But
it's a bigger problem now with an embattled Pitt and the legitimacy
of the whole agency under some assault," said Norman Ornstein,
political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a policy
study group.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers have said in recent days that Pitt should resign,
accusing him of being too close to the businesses he regulates.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's plan to force faster disclosure of insider stock
trades is drawing opposition from Microsoft Corp., Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and dozens of other U.S. companies as the president's own missed
deadlines on stock sales a decade ago have come under criticism.</LD>
<LD>   The corporations protested a Securities and Exchange Commission
proposal, initiated by Bush, that would require executives to
disclose within as little as two days when they trade company stock
or receive company loans.</LD>
<LD>   Under current rules, the deadline for reporting most trades can be
as long as 40 days.</LD>
<TE>   The two-day reporting requirement "may leave many companies with
too little time to comply and result in violations of the rule," a
Merrill lawyer wrote to the SEC.</TE>

<HD>Don't Dither as Hussein Builds Nuclear Devices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contemporary historians are already assessing the 1991 Gulf War as a
logistic miscalculation that overestimated the number of troops and
equipment needed to achieve the U.S.-led coalition goals. We could
have achieved the same results with a third, some say a quarter, of
that firepower and numeric superiority.</LD>
<LD>   Get this: We used 4.5 times more troops than the number that
invaded Normandy (130,000) on D-day, against what was then probably
the most efficient and best entrenched forces in the world--the
German army.</LD>
<LD>   Our wrong, overcautious assessment of our requirements for the
Gulf War cost us a fortune and, worse, valuable time. We should not
repeat the same mistake now, especially considering that the Iraqi
army--not an efficient fighting force back then--is only one-third
what it was in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Allow me to recommend the shape and character of our first wave of
attack on Iraq: No more than one squadron of fighter bombers will
take off and drop hundreds of thousands of leaflets on all front-line
Iraqi units. Every leaflet will be signed by the U.S. secretary of
the Treasury and will contain a printed commitment guaranteeing "the
bearer of this note will receive $100 in cash and safe passage to a
decent prisoner of war camp, on the condition that it be presented to
U.S. soldiers within 48 hours of the date and time of the drop." I
predict that the only casualties we will have will be some of our GIs
being overrun during the stampede to redeem the coupons. Saddam
Hussein will lose most of his army and be left with a few of his
closest first and second cousins.</TE>
<TE>   Now we send in the Marine band to celebrate, and then the
engineers to clean up the Iraqi laboratories once and for all. We
also may start free elections in the prisoner of war camps and
continue them in the new, democratic Republic of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, a grave risk here. There's a chance that
Hussein already has operative, unconventional weaponry, maybe even
one or two nuclear devices. This risk, however, should serve to
accentuate the need for almost immediate action and not taking any
chances by waiting too long.</TE>
<TE>   We can take a lesson from the Iraqi anecdote that describes an
uneducated Shiite (Hussein hates that Muslim minority) who was
walking on the tracks while a train was catching up with him. The
locomotive whistles and whistles, but to no avail because the Shiite
doesn't realize it is meant for him. Eventually the train catches up
with him, knocking the poor man off the tracks. The government
compensates him after his hospital days with a new kettle. The proud
Shiite puts the kettle on the stove. The kettle whistles at him. The
man grabs an ax and hits the kettle with fury, shouting, "These have
to be killed while they're still small!"</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi nuclear locomotive is coming closer and closer. We have
no time for war games.</TE>

<HD>Do the Math: It Adds Up to Investor Greed</HD>
<DH>Markets can be made crook-free but not fool-free.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>President Bush travels to Manhattan today to tell Wall Streeters to
clean up their act. No doubt he will talk tough, and no doubt
Democrats will talk even tougher.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the problem faced by would-be Street cleaners is that there's
no political cure for what's really gone wrong with the market, which
is too many bubbleheads greedily blowing up a bubble--a bubble that's
now burst.</LD>
<LD>   And so while it may be desirable to tweak the regulatory system,
the market itself provides the best remedy for stupidity. As the old
saying goes, a fool and his money are soon parted.</LD>
<TE>   Consider, as an example, Enron. According to a new report from the
Senate, profits for the company in 2000 amounted to $975 million. Yet
the board of directors approved $750 million in compensation for
executives, including $140 million for Chief Executive Kenneth Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders were no doubt delighted that Lay had pushed Enron's
shares up to $80, but they would have been wise to look at those
numbers more closely.</TE>
<TE>   If they had, they might not have given Lay more than a seventh of
the company's total profits that year, nor kept him on the payroll as
the stock price plunged toward zero.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the problem: When the market is going up, few people
look their gift horse in the mouth. In the 1990s, the Dow Jones
industrial average soared from 2,753 to 11,357. It was during that
decade that the "cult of the heroic chief executive," as the
Financial Times calls it, was born. Worshipful shareholders stopped
caring whether CEOs were actually managing their companies or merely
managing earnings reports; either way was fine, as long as the stock
went up. And few complained as corporate compensation multiplied;
according to Business Week, the average CEO of a major corporation
made 85 times the average hourly worker's pay in 1990 and 531 times
the worker's pay in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe those stock-option-grabbing CEOs--even the ones who
weren't crooks--weren't so worship-worthy after all. Maybe they were
just dumb-lucky.</TE>
<TE>   After all, if the market goes up fourfold, the most average
executive will look pretty good indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Put another way, oftentimes history sits in the driver's seat, and
people--even "masters of the universe"--are just along for the ride.
One might consider, as a comparison, the glorious fate of the West
Point Class of 1915, known to history as "the class the stars fell
on." Of the 164 men in that class, 59 became generals, including two
five-stars, Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Without minimizing their courage, the '15ers were at the right
place at the right time to enjoy glorious careers; they got into the
fighting business at the beginning of a long bull market in war.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, it seemed that CEOs of the '90s would be remembered
as the captains of industry whom the dollars fell on. But no longer.
Leaving aside the fraudsters, such as Enron and WorldCom--which lost
$80 billion and $180 billion, respectively, for their
shareholders--we can now see that even blue-chip companies lost still
more shareholder wealth in the last three years. General Electric has
lost $281 billion in market capitalization from its peak, Microsoft
is down $348 billion and Cisco Systems is minus $486 billion. Indeed,
all the companies listed on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 have shrunk by
about $4.6 trillion since March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One can presume that well-run companies will make a comeback,
along with stocks as a whole, but that's the point: When the market
goes back up, the reputations of CEOs will get back on the escalator
too. Until then, even the most ethical chief will be under a
cloud--the dark cloud of unprofitability.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bush can propose whatever he wants. Yet the most
important action he can take is, paradoxically, inaction. By not
intervening to bail out failing companies, the government has forced
a relearning of that most basic of market lessons--caveat emptor, let
the buyer beware.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, markets should be kept crook-free, but they can never be made
fool-free. Yet after this burst bubble, investors, a little older and
a lot wiser, are going to be less foolish.</TE>
<TE>   At least for a while.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Must Accept Accountability</HD>
<DH>The key to reform is oversight and U.S. involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS ROSS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palestinian reform is now on everyone's mind. President Bush has made
it the litmus test for Palestinian statehood and for U.S. diplomatic
engagement between Israelis and Palestinians. Europeans strongly
favor reform. Arab leaders who have little interest in reforming
themselves are enthusiastic about Palestinian transformation. And,
perhaps most important, the Palestinian public not only favors reform
but is insisting on it.</LD>
<LD>   That is the good news. Now the bad: Reform is still a longshot for
several reasons. First, if the terror does not stop, the
Israelis--notwithstanding initial moves now to ease curfews and
restrictions on Palestinian movement--will see little choice but to
keep the Palestinian public under siege. Reform, elections and the
creation of a new Palestinian order will not take place in an
environment in which the Israeli military is in every Palestinian
city. Second, Yasser Arafat, the quintessential survivor, is trying
to seize the mantle of reform to avoid losing power. But as long as
those trying to implement reform are accountable to him, there will
be no prospect of real change. Third, the international
community--especially the key donors--needs to stand united on
reform, its requirements and the Palestinians we will be working with
to ensure its implementation.</LD>
<TE>   Already we see disagreements over dealing with Arafat. Does this
mean the reform battle is lost before it begins? No, but it will take
a concerted and integrated strategy to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   To begin, we must address the security issue. Security won't come
from simply calling for it. The rolling process of security
performance and Israeli withdrawals will require working with the
remnants of the Palestinian security organizations because they are
the only ones with the capacity to act. We should not kid ourselves:
Initially, they are likely to act only if Arafat says to do so. But
that is not the end of the story. We should make it clear that there
are specific steps to be taken in terms of acting against Hamas,
Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyr's Brigade elements first in Gaza and
then in different parts of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should set the standards of performance and evaluate
whether Palestinian forces are meeting those standards. Clearly,
since this involves the prevention of terrorist attacks against
Israelis, we will need to coordinate closely with the Israelis, and
they will need to resume coordination with Palestinians on security
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Such an approach should not be limited to security. It should be
applied to all areas, with accountability flowing to the outside, not
the inside, in at least the early stages of the reform process. If
Palestinians who are acting in the areas of finances, rule of law,
separation of powers, civil society, education and security are
accountable to Arafat, little will change. Certainly, until new
institutions governed by professional standards are truly
functioning, accountability must come from the outside. The donor
community has a right to demand such accountability, particularly
given the money that will be required for reconstruction and given
the Palestinian track record on fulfillment of promises.</TE>
<TE>   Who should lead the accountability effort? While the effort will
need to be multilateral, the United States does need to organize and
lead it. Otherwise it is simply unlikely to happen. We should chair
an oversight board. It can have subcommittees with different chairs
related to areas of different expertise. But the overriding purpose
is to provide oversight, evaluation and accountability. And it must
be understood that donor money will stop flowing should performance
stop.</TE>
<TE>   The board and the subcommittees would deal with those Palestinians
who had technical responsibilities for carrying out reform. Again,
even if appointed by Arafat, these individuals would be answerable to
the oversight board, not to him.</TE>
<TE>   By dealing with them, one avoids the issue of dealing with Arafat.
Moreover, should he seek to block steps taken by Palestinians trying
to fulfill their responsibilities, the oversight board could announce
that Arafat was seeking to undermine the reform process.</TE>
<TE>   The oversight board would work with Palestinians on the timing of
elections. While Arafat has called for elections for his office in
January, it makes more sense to build institutions for a Palestinian
state before electing the head of the Palestinian Authority. But
municipal and legislative elections should be held no later than
January and in any case should occur first. These elections make
sense not only because they can be tied to institution-building but
also because they will begin to create a legitimate political
leadership. There is one other general point to keep in mind if
reform is to work: Palestinians have to believe that the reform
process will actually lead to a credible Palestinian state. In this
sense, reform has to have a destination. It is commonplace to talk
about the importance of giving Palestinians hope or a clear political
horizon. In truth, the president did that. But, having spent time
with a number of Palestinian reformers over the last week, it is fair
to say that they were not persuaded by Bush's speech. It is not
simply that they would have liked more content about what might
emerge in a Palestinian state. Rather, it is that they want to see
some indication that the U.S. has staying power.</TE>
<TE>   It would also help them to see some signal of hope about the
future from the Israeli leadership. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has
always argued that the problem has been Arafat, and without Arafat,
peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians would be possible.
Palestinians doubt he has any such intention. If there was ever a
time for Sharon to address his understanding of Palestinian needs and
aspirations, this is it.</TE>

<HD>A Fox Is About to Reassure Us Hens</HD>
<DH>Can Bush scold Wall Street with a straight face?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For President Bush to pretend to be shocked that some of the nation's
top executives deal from a stacked deck is akin to a madam feigning
surprise that sexual favors have been sold in her establishment.
Dubya may have gaps in his education, but ignorance of "aggressive
accounting" techniques and other scams they don't teach in Biz 101 is
not one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Not only was the prez and ex-businessman himself a pro at milking
failed corporations he made look good on paper, but too many family
members, friends and members of his administration have been
implicated in scandals of the sort he now condemns. For Bush to argue
that the unraveling of corporate America is the work of a "few bad
apples" is a dangerous line of reasoning for him because an
embarrassing number of those apples have fallen very close to the
tree of his presidency.</LD>
<LD>   For example, the troubles of Vice President Dick Cheney are just
beginning; the dubious accounting practices initiated at Halliburton
when he was CEO are now the focus of a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation. The SEC is forced to investigate this and
other potential business outrages despite the extreme reluctance of
its chairman, Harvey L. Pitt--who was selected for the job by George
W. himself after a career as a top lobbyist for stock brokers and
accounting firms that opposed tough SEC regulation.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney has also steadfastly refused to turn over the names of
energy corporation officials, including Enron executives, who guided
him in the secret meetings in which Bush's energy plan was crafted.
Bush still seems not the least embarrassed that Enron's chairman,
Kenneth Lay, was a personal friend and the largest contributor to his
presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Enron alums remain safely ensconced at the top of the Bush
administration. Special prosecutor, anyone? Clearly, the antics of
the Texas crowd make the petty shenanigans of the Clintons and those
Arkansas boys look like the work of small-time hustlers.</TE>
<TE>   When the president once referred to himself as the black sheep of
the Bush family, it was a joshing, self-congratulatory admission that
he was even more rascally than the rest. That ever-charming "what me
worry'' quality stood him in good stead as he ran through the money
of numerous family friends who invested in a long string of his
losing ventures.</TE>
<TE>   George W. was saved from repeated financial disaster by one merger
after another, business maneuvers that made no economic sense to the
new partner beyond the acquisition of the presumed clout of the son
of a Central Intelligence Agency chief turned vice president turned
president.</TE>
<TE>   The final such deal was with Harken Energy, a firm that bailed out
Bush's Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., which owed the banks $2 million.
Bush's political connections appeared to pay off when Harken, which
had zero experience drilling in water, suddenly won a contract with
the Persian Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain for offshore oil exploration,
which in turn boosted Harken's stock.</TE>
<TE>   However, the company failed to find oil in Bahrain, and insiders
like Bush knew that banks were refusing to continue to carry Harken's
considerable debt.</TE>
<TE>   Bush cashed out for nearly $850,000 before the company reported a
$22-million loss and the stock lost 75% of its value.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who failed to properly report the transaction to the SEC
until eight months after the deadline, was on the audit committee of
Harken's board of directors but denied knowing of the upcoming
negative quarterly report. He also claimed ignorance of a shell game
in which Harken insiders purchased one of the company's major
subsidiaries with money provided by Harken, fabricating a $10-million
profit.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Bush was spared the fate of some other free-wheeling
financial hustlers--insider trading charges--by a compliant SEC. It
certainly couldn't have hurt that the SEC's then-chairman was
appointed by Bush's father and that the SEC general counsel had been
Dubya's own lawyer in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   How can Bush now, with a straight face, tell the nation that he
will order the SEC to brand as criminals those guilty of the same
sorts of actions? As a matter of consistency, he should in the very
least demand that Martha Stewart, a comparative innocent when judged
by Bush family standards, be treated no more harshly than he was.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if justice were consistent, Stewart, and perhaps even Lay,
might be planning a run for the presidency.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of downplaying the gravity of the corporate crime wave
that has unnerved investors and battered the stock market, the Bush
White House is scrambling. But if President Bush in a landmark speech
today calls for tougher penalties rather than basic reforms of the
accounting industry, as he telegraphed in a news conference Monday,
investors will have no reason to tiptoe back into the market.</LD>
<LD>   The latest revelation, that pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck &amp;
Co. overstated its revenue by $12 billion over the last three years,
is a case in point. If the experts are right, what Merck did was not
only legal but within generally accepted accounting practices. So,
even though investors believed they were buying into a larger company
than actually existed, there may be nothing to prosecute. It's the
accounting practices that are twisted.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 firms have had to restate their profit after
admitting to various schemes designed to make their books look
better. Investors need solid assurances that companies are producing
understandable and trustworthy balance sheets. Because much of the
chicanery is arguably legal, Bush can't stop at new criminal
penalties. Nailing chief executives for misdeeds may sound good, but
try getting a conviction of a corporate executive wrapped in a
blanket of lawyers. The real test is whether Bush will embrace tough
regulations that make cooking the books more difficult in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, a
former lawyer for the Big Five accounting firms, has proposed a
namby-pamby oversight board that would allow the accounting industry
to continue to set auditing standards. Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
John McCain (R-Ariz.) are right to demand that Pitt resign. Sadly,
Bush was full of praise Monday for Pitt, calling him "fast to act"
against the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Bush should champion an independent, full-time regulatory board
for auditors and a return to auditing as a profession unpolluted by
consulting jobs. Both measures are in the Senate reform bill that the
administration, congressional Republicans and the accounting industry
have opposed. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
is spending millions to lobby Congress to save its system of weak
self-regulation and calls reform proposals a "de facto government
takeover" of the industry. Bush at least has softened toward the
Senate bill, but clearly he has no love for it.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have corporate pasts that
raise questions. A decade ago, Bush was late in disclosing his sale,
just ahead of bad news, of shares in a company for which he was a
member of the board of directors. Cheney's former employer,
Halliburton Co., is under investigation for its accounting practices
at a time when Cheney was CEO. They both would have something extra
to prove in championing reforms.</TE>
<TE>   With news footage of WorldCom's executives taking the 5th
Amendment before Congress on Monday still fresh, Bush has no more
slack. It's do or die on market confidence.</TE>

<HD>For Cops, a Whiff From '91</HD>

<LD>Videotape of a white Inglewood cop slamming a handcuffed
developmentally handicapped black teenager onto a squad car, then
throwing a hard punch to his face, may not be "Rodney King, the
Sequel." But as CNN and other networks endlessly replay that scene,
captured at a gas station three miles east of Los Angeles
International Airport, Americans will watch and wonder whether L.A.
has learned anything in the decade since that night in March 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The answer is yes.</LD>
<LD>   A decade back--as the Christopher Commission would later
confirm--cops often dished out street justice and stuck together when
a roughed-up citizen complained.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, commanders and police experts who have seen the
newscasts are breaking ranks to declare emphatically that clobbering
a handcuffed suspect is as indefensible as it is illegal. The
Inglewood Police Department already has suspended the officer shown
striking the 16-year-old, Donovan Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   After the King beating, then-Chief Daryl F. Gates reacted slowly
and defensively, dismissing the videotaped assault as an aberration.
This time, the Inglewood department, the Los Angeles County district
attorney, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department and the FBI were quick
to launch parallel investigations to determine whether the action
captured on the video was the textbook case of excessive force it
appeared to be.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department is investigating because of the
involvement of deputies, who approached the teenager's father at the
service station after seeing that his license plate was expired.
Inglewood officers arrived as backup.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca has no tolerance for police brutality. He has a
cadre of civil rights lawyers running clean investigations of
excessive-force allegations. The lawyers, unlike cops who work in
Internal Affairs, have nothing to lose professionally by finding the
truth. They'll never return to patrol with officers who consider them
snitches. Baca's department is creating a model that other law
enforcement agencies should copy.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood Police Department, meanwhile, should look at
improving officer training as the investigators determine what
happened Saturday and decide what further discipline, if any, is
warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the teenager assaulted an officer. Indeed, at
least one cop is seen bleeding in the TV news footage. But it's the
rare police officer who doesn't understand by now that there is no
justification for beating a restrained suspect. We're confident that
the Los Angeles law enforcement community will demonstrate that it
has lost all tolerance for anyone who forgets.</TE>

<LD>Throughout its long and complex history, Mexico has treated its
leaders as if they were above the law. The government never held
accountable even the many whose terms ended in shame. That's
changing.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, prosecutors questioned former Mexican presidents
suspected of corruption or even complicity in politically motivated
slaughter only as witnesses against others. Last week, for the first
time, the government forced a former president--Luis Echeverria--to
confront his past.</LD>
<LD>   For 6 1/2 hours, a special prosecutor peppered Echeverria with
citizens' allegations and questions concerning his role in the events
of Oct. 2, 1968. That day, the army and still unidentified gunmen
opened fire on demonstrating students trapped in a closed public
square in the Mexico City neighborhood of Tlatelolco. Authorities
said the fusillade killed as many as 100 people. Victims' relatives
and witnesses put the number higher.</LD>
<TE>   This was Mexico's worst modern massacre. Echeverria, president
from 1970 to 1976, was the minister in charge of internal security at
the time of the 1968 killings, so grilling him should provide insight
into what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The nation also awaits his response to the special prosecutor's
questions about an incident that took place while he was president.
On June 10, 1971, thugs on the government payroll killed at least 30
students during a march protesting against government repression.</TE>
<TE>   The special prosecutor is summoning members of Echeverria's
Cabinet as well. Like Echeverria, many of them face lawsuits for
participating in the "dirty war" from 1970 to 1980, during which
government agents killed or "disappeared" thousands of suspected
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens and relatives of the victims set in motion Mexico's
current openness by refusing to forget and forgive. For more than
three decades, presidents offered empty promises.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox listened to the call of the people and
appointed a special prosecutor to investigate. His administration has
opened to the public millions of government security documents and
shepherded through the Mexican Congress a freedom-of-information law
that bars the government from withholding any official document
describing "grave violations" of human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Forcing Echeverria and other leaders to face their actions in
public does more than fill in ugly gaps of a period that for Mexicans
remains painfully raw. It shows a nation finally committed to full
democracy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pleading for Less Secrecy in Juvenile Courts," July 5:</LD>
<LD>   The balance between the public's right to know and the interest in
privacy is often delicate. In this instance, the privacy interest is
of particularly vital importance--no less than the protection of
already abused or neglected children.</LD>
<LD>   Having represented numerous children in juvenile dependency cases
at the appellate level (under appointment by the Court of Appeal), I
can see both sides of the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Although appellate oversight seems to be working well, the system
might benefit by more public oversight. The proposed pilot program
[to measure the effect of opening juvenile dependency hearings] could
at least provide insight into whether open courts would indeed
improve the system.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever approach is pursued, however, it should be infused with
essential safeguards. Children should not suffer at the hands of the
media or any others given access to the courts. The decision makers
should keep the focus on how their decisions affect the children. It
is vital that they never lose sight of the paramount goal of
protecting the children.</TE>

<LD>Re "Zionist Dreams Sinking Into Despair," July 7: Liberal Israelis,
"who came to Israel to build a state so that the word 'victim'
wouldn't be part" of the vocabulary, are surprised that the
vanquished in the state-building contest would resort to violence in
the face of further settlements?</LD>
<LD>   Liberal Israelis, who "want enough money to live well and have a
good, interesting job," are surprised that Palestinians, who have
limited access to jobs and education, are hostile to Israelis? Israel
and its citizens have legitimate concerns. This type of article does
not help them.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth C. Hardy</LD>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article paints a true, sad story of despairing Israelis who
longed for peace and now find their lives broken. But there is
another side of the story. Jews all over the world will still come to
Israel to settle, especially in times of extreme anti-Semitism--like
now. Jews all over the world revere Israel and will never give it up.</TE>
<TE>   Jews all over the world pray for peace in Israel every week on
Shabbat and will never give up the hope for peace. Even the
right-wing Israeli political parties, which are staunch in defending
Israel, pray for peace in Israel and hope to live there without
hatred and bloodshed. Jews have survived all these thousands of
years, and now that we have returned to Jerusalem, we will defend it.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian people will never accept this. The Arabs have been
fighting and killing the Jewish people since World War II. With every
suicide bomber, the Palestinian people lose their chance for
statehood. We don't need another anti-democratic state in the Middle
East.</TE>

<TE>   What these families don't seem willing to admit is that their
dream has caused a nightmare for another. That their security has
produced insecurity for another. That the prosperity their society
has experienced has come, in a very real sense, as a result of the
ongoing exploitation of the labor of another. While their supposedly
liberal Zionist myth may seem like a utopia to them, their
Palestinian neighbors have lived under the boot of occupation for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, those decades of belligerent Israeli disregard for the
conditions of their existence have driven a militant segment of the
Palestinian population to take the sort of extreme action that has
become an almost daily aspect of life there. No amount of liberal
angst will obfuscate the moral failure of what was then, and still
remains, a fundamentally anti-democratic Zionist dream.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Bowers</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I spent this last year studying at an Israeli university. Most
Israelis do not feel despair. They feel betrayed by the very
Palestinian Authority that they helped set up and are resigned to the
fighting that must follow.</TE>
<TE>   This is not despair but acceptance of bitter truths. Among the few
despairing Israelis are the dwindling members of Peace Now, a group
neither mainstream nor Zionist. Peace Now is willing to sacrifice
almost everything to achieve a dubious, ephemeral peace. With the
failure of such a doctrine staring them in the face, members cannot
bear to accept the demise of Oslo and the bloodshed that must follow.
To say that Israel is awash in despair is to slander the bravery and
determination of a people long under siege.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps your juxtaposing of a committed Hamas leader with innocent
young Israeli victims in "Terror's Aftermath" (Opinion, July 7) was
meant to help mute ever-louder protestations of a pro-Palestinian
bias in your coverage of the Middle East atrocities. After all, it's
quite easy to side with the innocent Israelis when the Palestinian
steps forward to take credit for his murderous actions (however
righteous he proclaims his means and ends to be).</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that your placing these two accounts side by side
has the obvious effect of even further grossly distorting our view of
the situation in the Middle East. In the present, tense atmosphere of
charges of reporting bias by both Israelis and Palestinians, you
should have found not a Hamas extremist but a Palestinian mother
whose innocent daughter was a victim of Israeli fire. (Such
Palestinian mothers are quite numerous.) Or perhaps even an
"extremist" Orthodox Jew whose commitment to an Israeli state is at
the expense of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wilde</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Salameh and the "Hammascide" bombers he has trained
continue their jihad to overthrow the state of Israel. If a Native
American plotted to expel U.S. civilians from "their land by whatever
means," including murdering children, what should our nation's
response be? Publishing an interview with the killer explaining his
bomb-making techniques wouldn't be my first response. My prayers go
out to the Palestinian and Israeli people and leaders to find a just
peace. The way of Salameh and Hamas is surely not the path to peace
nor an independent Palestinian state.</TE>

<LD>Re "Baseball's Last .400 Hitter Dies," July 6: Ted Williams was
controversial. You liked him or hated him.</LD>
<LD>   In my youth, I took on additional chores around the house so I
could muster up the 75 cents to walk to Fenway to see Williams. Herby
K. and I sat in the right-field bleachers for more than 50 games. We
saw Teddy hit many sky-high homers into the bullpen or into the
bleachers. We saw him hit his 400th. We saw him spit at the press. We
saw him round the bases and never tip his hat.</LD>
<LD>   We loved our Teddy. He could do no wrong with us. He had an
attitude, an ego and a temper. We didn't care. He was a perfectionist
at everything he did. There were no drugs or steroids in his day.
There were no instant replay and camcorders to assist with
self-improvement. Heck, there was no TV for most of his career. He
had to rely on his God-given skills and his personal commitment to
excel to become the greatest hitter of all time.</LD>
<TE>   His career was shortened by more than five years so that he could
fight for his country in both World War II and Korea. He was very
involved in charitable activities. His name is synonymous with the
Jimmy Fund, a program in Boston that raised millions of dollars for
cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   He truly was the John Wayne of baseball. He is the one person whom
all of us would march with during wartime.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry that many of you are too young to have experienced Teddy
Ballgame as Herby and I did.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Kramer</TE>
<TE>   Cambria</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball was my first love. As a kid of 11 or 12, I'd play ball
with my dad and he'd say, "Sis, if you were only a boy, I'd have you
in the Yankees by the time you're 18." So, it was natural that Ted
Williams was my hero, my idol. He dominated baseball during my youth.
I could give out statistics and talk baseball to the best of the
cognoscenti. And surprise them because, after all, I was only a girl.
We've lost a great American, the greatest hitter of all time--an
American original. We'll never see the likes of him again.</TE>

<LD>Re "School Libraries Poorly Managed, Report Finds," July 3: This
should come as no great surprise in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, which has not adequately supported its school libraries for
almost 40 years. A school library is a well-organized, well-stocked
center of learning where up-to-date materials are easily accessible
to students and teachers. It takes a lot of work to keep a school
library functional. Elementary school libraries in the LAUSD do not
have credentialed librarians. Middle and high school libraries do
have credentialed librarians but no adequate clerical assistance to
do the kinds of tasks that are necessary to keep the library working
properly.</LD>
<LD>   Ordering, processing and shelving books takes specific knowledge
and a lot of time. Elementary library aides who work three to six
hours a day cannot be expected to do all of this plus aid classes
every hour. And secondary librarians also cannot fulfill the jobs of
information literacy teacher, resource consultant and library manager
without having full-time clerical help.</LD>
<LD>   If the LAUSD had specific standards for school libraries, then the
funding for adequate staffing both in school libraries themselves and
at the district level would be the logical next step.</LD>

<LD>In "You've Got Spam" (Commentary, July 8), on proposed solutions to
the problem of unsolicited e-mail, Sonia Arrison asks: "Is [making

engineers thought so." Why, of course they would.</LD>
<LD>   Once they have "spammers" paying for the unsolicited e-mail they
send, it would just be a matter of time before Microsoft and the
Internet service providers use the same "feasible system" to find a
way to make all of us pay for all e-mail. The only thing shocking
about this shortsighted solution is how someone who could propose it
has managed to become the director of a technology institute.</LD>

<LD>I was surprised to read that the Stockton Unified School District
named a new school for President Bush ("Bush Gets His Name on Another
Close Vote," July 7). But after reading board member Clem Lee's
quote, "It might be premature to honor a sitting president. But it's
quite defensible. We've got schools in Stockton named after
Cleveland, Harrison, Garfield, Tyler and Fillmore. These were truly
mediocre presidents," I realized that George W. would fit right in.</LD>

<HD>200 Homes in Path of Fire</HD>
<DH>Santa Clarita: Some residents move to safer ground after
one house is severely damaged and others are threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire heavily damaged one home, threatened at least 200 others
in the Santa Clarita community of Golden Valley and caused the
shutdown of the Antelope Valley Freeway on Monday afternoon,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A small fire of undetermined origin started about 12:30 p.m. at
San Fernando Road and the Antelope Valley Freeway, and flying embers
ignited a second fire that burned at least 200 acres nearby,
according to Los Angeles County Fire Department officials. There were
no serious injuries, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   On Crystal Spring Court, where embers fanned by strong winds
landed on the roof of the house that was damaged, some residents
quickly left the neighborhood, fearful that flames would spread from
house to house.</LD>
<TE>   Jeannine Bohning was advised to evacuate shortly after 2 p.m. She
said her son and two grandsons helped her "pack the things you can't
replace and leave the things you can buy again."</TE>
<TE>   '"You'd be stupid not to be a little scared," said Bohning, 62.
"It was really hot, and the smell ... it was really smoky. You
couldn't keep it out of the house."</TE>
<TE>   But by early evening, many people were confident that the fire was
no longer a threat.</TE>
<TE>   The northbound lanes of the Antelope Valley Freeway, closed
shortly after the fire started, were reopened about 5:30 p.m. between
Via Princessa and Placerita Canyon Road. Southbound lanes were
expected to reopen soon after.</TE>
<TE>   "The winds are picking up," Capt. Brian Jordan, a spokesman for
the Fire Department, said about 6 p.m. "We don't know what's going to
happen. Hopefully, we'll have this contained by 6 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, firefighters had thought the initial blaze, which quickly
spread to 30 acres, was under control. But embers jumped the Antelope
Valley Freeway and sparked a second fire near Placerita Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a [wildfire] with sporadic winds that have been changing
at a moment's notice," Fire Inspector Mike Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "These [fires] are more dangerous because they're so
unpredictable. We don't know where the fire is going next."</TE>
<TE>   About 400 firefighters from Los Angeles County, the U.S. Forest
Service and other agencies fought the blaze. Forty engines were aided
by half a dozen helicopters and other aircraft dropping water and
fire retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Four firefighters suffered heat exhaustion and one injured an
ankle, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   By 4:30 p.m., traffic on the northbound lanes of the Antelope
Valley Freeway was backed up more than 15 miles.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol Officer Doug Sweeney said, "It couldn't
have happened at a worse time as far as the traffic goes."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was moving northeast by late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the home at 19654 Crystal Spring Court was
heavily damaged after an ember landed on its wood shake roof and the
residence was quickly engulfed by flames.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still shocked," said homeowner Mike Zeballos, 32, as he stood
on his lawn later with his fiancee, Lorena Acevedo, 30, and
neighbors. "I don't know how the fire jumped all these houses and
landed on my roof.'"</TE>
<TE>   Two nearby homes sustained moderate damage, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire had burned more than 200 acres by late afternoon, and 300
residents from 100 homes in the Golden Valley area were told they
could go to La Mesa Junior High School for safety. Officials said
few, if any, did.</TE>
<TE>   "In areas where people have money, they rarely go to evacuation
centers," Jordan said. "They go to a movie or a hotel."</TE>
<TE>   Bohning's husband, Dan Bohning, 64, got home from work at 4:30
p.m. to find that his wife had packed family pictures and other
valuables in their car.</TE>
<TE>   Bohning's grandson was hosing down the wood roof. And the family's
Irish setter sat in the air-conditioned car.</TE>
<TE>   "It's precautionary," said Bohning, who lives five houses from the
house that was engulfed by flames. "This is the third fire in the 30
years I've been here. I'm not scared. There's firetrucks everywhere."</TE>

<HD>Ward Kimball, 88; Key Disney Animator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Kimball, the most colorful and eccentric of the Nine Old Men,
the key group of Disney artists whose work set the standard by which
all animation is judged, died Monday at Arcadia Methodist Hospital in
Arcadia. He was 88 and died of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his work on the classic features "Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs," "Pinocchio," "Fantasia," "Dumbo," "The Three
Caballeros," "Melody Time," "Cinderella," "Alice in Wonderland" and
"Mary Poppins," Kimball directed the Oscar-winning shorts "Toot,
Whistle, Plunk and Boom" (1953) and "It's Tough To Be a Bird" (1969).</LD>
<LD>   "Ward is one man who works for me that I am willing to call a
genius," Diane Disney Miller quoted her father as saying in "The
Story of Walt Disney."</LD>
<TE>   Born on March 4, 1914, in Minneapolis, Kimball attended the Santa
Barbara School of the Arts, intending to become a
painter/illustrator. In March 1934, an instructor persuaded him to
submit a portfolio to the Walt Disney Studio in Los Angeles. Kimball
later told an animation historian, John Canemaker, that he had
insisted that the studio accept or reject him on the spot, declaring
"I don't have enough money to buy gas to come back!"</TE>
<TE>   Kimball began work at Disney a month later and remained there
until he retired in 1973. He received his first solo assignment in
1935, animating a grasshopper-musician in the "Silly Symphony"
"Woodland Cafe." Kimball quickly rose through the ranks to become a
supervising or directing animator.</TE>
<TE>   He spent months animating a sequence for "Snow White" in which the
dwarfs eat the soup Snow White has prepared for them; he was ready to
quit when it was cut from the film.</TE>
<TE>   He made an appointment to see Walt Disney, but Disney began
talking about "Pinocchio" and how he wanted Kimball to animate the
cricket who would serve as the title character's conscience.
Recalling how deftly Disney had defused a problem on one film by
building his enthusiasm for the next one, Kimball said, "Walt was a
salesman!"</TE>
<TE>   The design of Jiminy Cricket proved difficult. Kimball explained,
"Normally, an artist caricatures an animal by learning to draw it
correctly--then the caricature becomes a simple problem of degree.
But a cricket looks like a cross between a cockroach and grasshopper.
I did 12 or 14 versions, and gradually cut out all the insect
appendages. I ended up with a little man who looks like Mr. Pickwick,
but with no ears, no nose and no hair. The audience accepts him as a
cricket because the other characters say he is."</TE>
<TE>   Kimball ranked as among his best work the animation of the jaunty
but sympathetic crows who give Dumbo confidence in the form of a
"magic feather." A jazz fan and a musician, he found the crows
"exactly what I had in mind for animation: I realized you had to
create a personality for each one, just as Walt had always insisted
that the Dwarfs had to have seven distinct personalities with clean
demarcations between them."</TE>
<TE>   But the madcap finale of "The Three Caballeros" (1945) is
generally considered Kimball's finest and most characteristic work.
Donald Duck, Jose Carioca and Panchito zip around the screen,
performing the title number as props appear and disappear. The song
ends with Panchito holding the last note for an impossible 20
seconds, while Donald and Jose scramble for ways to silence him.
Director Clyde Geronimi objected to Kimball's illogical cutting
within the sequence: Donald may exit to the right and re-enter from
the left.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney liked the effect and, as Kimball noted, "that was all
that mattered."</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Kimball formed a Dixieland jazz band, The Firehouse Five
Plus Two, with other Disney artists, including Frank Thomas, another
of the Nine Old Men, on piano. They began playing for noon dances on
studio sound stages, with Kimball leading and playing trombone. The
Firehouse Five soon graduated to nightclubs, including the Mocambo in
Hollywood, appeared on the Milton Berle and Ed Sullivan television
shows, and recorded 12 albums (which have been reissued on CD). In
his later years, Kimball received fan mail--and royalty checks--for
his work with a group that disbanded when the members tired of "the
late hours, the extra effort and the frenzy."</TE>
<TE>   After working on the spoiled cat, Lucifer, in "Cinderella,"
Kimball animated Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter and the
March Hare and the Cheshire Cat in "Alice in Wonderland" (1951).
Although he found the finished film disappointing, Kimball said, "I
didn't realize it at the time, but the Cheshire Cat is the maddest
thing in the whole picture because he was underplayed. He didn't move
much--he'd finish a word and accent it with a quick flipping back and
forth of the tail, then he'd go into that grin. I didn't realize it
was so mad." Kimball's increasingly stylized approach to animation
didn't fit into the personality-driven features of the '50s, and
Disney assigned him to direct two short films for release in 1953.
"Adventures in Music: Melody" was the studio's first 3-D cartoon;
"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom," Disney's first CinemaScope short,
won an Oscar for Best Cartoon. He directed a second Oscar-winner in
1969, the 22-minute "It's Tough To Be a Bird," which featured
stylized visuals and irreverent humor.</TE>
<TE>   He followed the shorts with three one-hour programs for the
"Disneyland" TV series: "Man in Space" (1955), "Man and the Moon"
(1955) and "Mars and Beyond" (1957). Kimball described these off-beat
mixtures of animation, live action, fact, fiction and humor as "the
creative high point of my career." He later worked on the live-action
musical "Babes in Toyland" (1961), and produced and directed 43
episodes of the syndicated series "The Mouse Factory" (1972-73).</TE>
<TE>   Kimball retired from the Disney Studio in 1973, but emerged for
special assignments. In 1978, he served as the conductor on the
"Birthday Special," a whistle-stop train tour from Union Station in
Los Angeles to New York City in celebration of Mickey Mouse's 50th
birthday. He also helped to design the 1982 "World of Motion"
attraction for the Epcot Center in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   These projects combined two of Kimball's great loves: animation
and railroads. In 1938, he bought a full-sized 1881 steam locomotive,
which he restored and installed with other cars and engines on a
track in the backyard of his San Gabriel home: the Grizzly Flats
Railroad. He amassed an extraordinary collection of model trains and
helped to fire Walt Disney's interest in railroading. In 1992, he
donated some of his rolling stock to the Orange Empire Railway Museum
in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   An irreverent, iconoclastic man, Kimball was an exceptional
caricaturist: During the late '30s, he and his assistant Walt Kelly,
the future creator of "Pogo," drew countless gag cartoons about each
other. The same quirky spirit pervaded his animation, as Canemaker
concluded in his recent book, "Walt Disney's Nine Old Men &amp; the Art
of Animation":</TE>
<TE>   "Ward Kimball's contribution to Disney animation was unique; it
represents an exciting alternative approach to character animation
and narrative--open, fresh, and experimental. It reflects the man
himself, who had within him the spirit of an independent filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   Kimball is survived by his wife of 66 years, Betty; three
children, John Kimball, Kelly Kimball and Chloe Lord; five
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private with plans for a remembrance to be
announced later. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that
donations be made to any of the following: Berklee College of Music
(Boston); Ward Kimball Memorial Fund (California Institute of the
Arts, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia, Calif.); the Cartoon Art Museum
(San Francisco); or the Orange Empire Railroad Museum (Perris,
Calif.)</TE>

<HD>Kenneth Koch, 77; a Founder of N.Y. School of Poets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Koch, whose humorous, passionate, casually erudite poetry
drew as freely on comic books, movies and other pop-culture ephemera
as it did on Surrealist art and French Symbolist verse, died Saturday
at his home in Manhattan after a lengthy struggle with leukemia. He
was 77.</LD>
<LD>   A founding member of the so-called New York School of Poets in the
1950s, along with his friends John Ashbery and the late Frank O'Hara,
Koch reveled in a form of lyrical production regarded by some as the
verse equivalent of Abstract Expressionist painting: a robust,
acerbic, self-contemplating, nonconformist, purposefully irreverent
and often erotically charged mode of artistic communication.</LD>
<LD>   Boisterous and uninhibited, Koch's poems revealed his love of
puns, tricky internal rhymes and what one critic described as his
"kind, flexible, winsome, soulful irony." Another critic in the New
York Review of Books once observed that "Koch is fond of making
poetry out of poetry-resistant stuff. Locks, lipsticks, business
letterheads, walnuts, lunch and fudge attract him; so do examples of
inept slang, silly sentiment, brutal behavior and stereotyped exotica
and erotica."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to about 30 volumes of poetry, Koch (pronounced
"coke") also wrote short fiction and several plays produced
off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway. Most of these were spirited
pastiches of Western myth and burlesques of national folklore that,
despite their lightly mocking tone, invested their subjects with a
kind of rapturous childlike innocence reminiscent of Pop Art.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and former students said Koch brought that same ardency
and freewheeling adventurism to teaching, whether his pupils were
Columbia University undergraduates, elementary schoolchildren or
elderly patients at a nursing home on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
Under Koch's guidance and encouragement, a number of these patients
produced a 1977 collection of poems titled "I Never Told Anybody;
Teaching Writing In A Nursing Home."</TE>
<TE>   "Often I wondered, 'Why is he so intense about this [teaching]?' "
said painter Jane Freilicher, who became friends with Koch after he
began graduate work at Columbia University in the late 1940s. "But he
really had a mission. He had almost a naive faith in the value of
poetry that was rather admirable."</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting the highbrow literary attitudes of T.S. Eliot and Ezra
Pound and their academic apostles the New Critics, Koch and his New
York School colleagues sought to capture the more spontaneous,
improvisational voice of postwar American society--the bearable
lightness of being alive in a time of peace, prosperity and dynamic
social change. While the energetic O'Hara was the group's catalyst,
Koch performed a different role.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenneth was a great professor who could be likened to a sort of
sorcerer who attracted a lot of apprentices to him, like a pied
piper," said David Lehman, a poet and author of "The Last
Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets." "He was
very committed to a certain aesthetic point of view, and he was very
hard-line about it."</TE>
<TE>   Much as Abstract Expressionist artists such as Jackson Pollock and
Willem de Kooning were often perceived, somewhat simplistically, as
hurling paint at a canvas and letting meaning take shape from the
inchoate splatters, New York School poets were sometimes regarded,
both by critics and admirers, as flinging words at a page and letting
readers determine the subject--if they could.</TE>
<TE>   Attuned to the staccato rhythms of modern city life, the rumble of
subway trains and the flutter of bebop jazz, the New York School's
urban-populist sensibility can be glimpsed in poems such as Koch's
"Spring" (from the anthology "On the Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected
Poems 1950-1988"):</TE>
<TE>   Let's take a walk</TE>
<TE>   In the city</TE>
<TE>   Till our shoes get wet</TE>
<TE>   (It's been raining all night) and when</TE>
<TE>   We see the traffic</TE>
<TE>   Lights and the moon</TE>
<TE>   Let's take a smile</TE>
<TE>   Off the ashcan, let's walk</TE>
<TE>   Into town (I mean</TE>
<TE>   A lemon peel)</TE>
<TE>   One signature of Koch's poetry was a slapstick wit worthy of a
Catskills comedian. Sometimes this would erupt into language that was
irrepressibly silly, but usually with an undertow of seriousness: "I
have a knocking woodpecker in my heart and I think I have three
souls/One for love one for poetry and one for acting out my insane
self." In book-length contemporary epic poems like "Ko; or, A Season
on Earth" (1959) and "The Duplications" (1977), written in Byronic
ottava rima stanzas, he grappled with trying to make sense of the
absurd human condition. It was a more measured and comically savvy
version of the famous beatnik howl.</TE>
<TE>   A gifted mimic, he would break into imitation of movie stars,
politicians and other famous personages to illustrate a point or act
out an idea that had seized him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very witty, very quick with comebacks or with
improvisation; he could improvise in blank verse for your
entertainment," Lehman said. "He was charismatic, dynamic,
flamboyant, very imaginative in presenting material and also in
getting you excited and in getting you to do things that you didn't
realize you could do."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Cincinnati on Feb. 27, 1925, Kenneth Jay Koch was the son
of Stuart Koch, a furniture store owner, and Lillian Amy Loth Koch,
who wrote book reviews.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from high school, where at age 17 he produced his
first stream-of-consciousness literary rants, he saw action with the
Army in the Philippines during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to the U.S. to study at Harvard, coming under the
influence of poet Delmore Schwartz. He later earned his master's and
doctorate at Columbia after moving to New York.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his lifelong friendships with Ashbery, O'Hara and
Freilicher, Koch formed a deep attachment during that period with
painter Larry Rivers, with whom he collaborated on a series of
painting-poems called "Post Cards" and "New York, 1950-1960."</TE>
<TE>   It was Rivers who organized a Monday night program of jazz and
poetry readings at the Five Spot Cafe in New York, a popular hangout
for artists and bohemians.</TE>
<TE>   On one of these evenings, Rivers played saxophone while Koch read
from a telephone book. Among those attending one night was singer
Billie Holiday, who later approached Koch and told him, "Man, your
poems are weird." The good-humored Koch might have happily agreed.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Karen; a daughter, Katherine; and a
grandson, Jesse Statman.</TE>

<HD>LAX Killer Had Sought Asylum</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Man who killed two had worked the system until
his wife won a visa lottery. One victim is buried in Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL, RICH CONNELL and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Egyptian immigrant who gunned down two people at Los Angeles
International Airport in a Fourth of July rampage applied for
political asylum shortly after arriving in the U.S. in 1992,
according to government sources.</LD>
<LD>   Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, 41, filed his application just weeks
before his six-month visitor's visa was due to expire. Although
asylum was denied, the application and a subsequent appeal in 1996
allowed Hadayet to obtain temporary residency and work permission.
That lasted until August 1997, when his wife won legal residency
status for their family in a federal visa lottery.</LD>
<LD>   Documents and interviews show that Hadayet, who was killed by an
El Al Israel Airlines security guard during the shootout last week,
had sporadic contact over the last two decades with immigration and
Social Security authorities, and had made several attempts to obtain
legal permission to work here. One of those attempts may have
involved fraud, according to a knowledgeable government source.</LD>
<TE>   Hadayet, who had driven limousines and taxis since 1992, had his
earliest known contact with the Social Security Administration in
August 1981, when he received a Social Security card after applying
at the agency's Wilshire Boulevard office.</TE>
<TE>   The card, often issued to students or dependents, carried a
restriction prohibiting Hadayet from working.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he was classified as a noncitizen immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   Such a process would have to have been done in person, according
to Lowell Kepke, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.
"We do ask for identification," Kepke said.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear where Hadayet lived between 1981 and 1992, when he
arrived in Los Angeles from abroad with a six-month visitor's visa.</TE>
<TE>   His next contact with the Social Security Administration did not
come until December 1998, when he applied for and received a
replacement card at the agency's Newport Beach office. He also
corrected the spelling of his first name and obtained full work
permission, Kepke said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his 1992 asylum application, such applications
provided a virtually automatic means to obtain temporary work visas.
For example, the assailant who mowed down employees in front of the
CIA's Langley, Va., office in 1993, Mir Aimal Kansi, had obtained
temporary residency by seeking asylum in 1991; his case would later
bring a congressional reform of the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the problem with the whole system," said Carl
Shusterman, a former Immigration and Naturalization Service
prosecutor who now works as an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles. "A
lot of people [without] good asylum applications saw it as a great
way to get a work card."</TE>
<TE>   In denying his application, INS authorities apparently did not
believe Hadayet had met the benchmark of having a "well-founded fear
of persecution" based on race, political or religious beliefs or
membership in a group.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hadayet and his wife, Hala Sadek el Awadly, 42, come from
prominent families well ensconced in the Muslim mainstream in Egypt,
according to a relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Hadayet's father is a former general and El Awadly's father is a
clothing merchant who owns factories and shops in downtown Cairo, the
relative said.</TE>
<TE>   While appealing his asylum case in federal immigration court,
Hadayet got lucky--his wife was among 55,000 annual winners in a
so-called "diversity" visa lottery through which the INS grants
residency to immigrants from countries it considers underrepresented
by immigration rules and practices.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet quickly won approval to legalize his status in 1997, as
the husband of a newly named legal resident.</TE>
<TE>   INS authorities now believe that fraud was involved somewhere
along the trail of applications, visas and court cases Hadayet filed,
according to a government source.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet indicated he had gone to work within months after arriving
in the U.S. in 1992. When he applied for a job with A-AAA Yellow Cab
in Santa Ana, in September 1996--using the last name Ali--he told
company officials he had been working for a rival Yellow Cab company
based in Anaheim since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time he obtained permanent residency and work
permission in 1997, Hadayet started a limousine company, Five-Star
Limousine. The insurance and state permit for that business were
canceled last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Hadayet said that if he was struggling in business,
he kept it to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Tarek Oraby, an Egyptian immigrant taxi driver, recalled last
seeing his colleague five months ago driving a leased black Mercedes
limousine into John Wayne Airport to pick up a fare.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Let me show you my new car,' " Oraby said. The two
talked for 10 minutes before Oraby left to pick up a customer, and he
never saw Hadayet again.</TE>
<TE>   With Hadayet dead, and his role in the LAX shooting clearly
established, authorities are focusing, not on guilt but on the
gunman's motives and whether he was affiliated with any organized
terrorist network. Answers so far have been sparse.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet had no business relationship with El Al, and the
state-owned airline had never heard of the gunman before Thursday,
said David Douek, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and local authorities said Monday that they had no new
information on why Hadayet had opened fire at the Tom Bradley
International Terminal. The investigation was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokesman Matt McLaughlin said authorities were still pursuing
all probable motives in the case, including possible terrorism, hate
crimes or random violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not at a point in the investigation where we have fully
vetted any of the possible motives," McLaughlin said. "To say
anything more at this point would be premature."</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, Hadayet's wife--who had left the U.S. several days
earlier with the couple's two sons--told the Associated Press that
she spoke to her husband the day of the shootings, and he gave her no
indication of plans for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Hesham called on July 4; it was his birthday," she said. "His
voice was very beautiful. He asked about the boys, asked me to take
them out a lot and to review their lessons with them in order to be
ready for next year."</TE>
<TE>   El Awadly expressed disbelief that her husband had carried out the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   And she told AP that she has been unable to mourn or cry over her
husband's death because she had not yet told their sons, ages 11 and
7.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the family in Irvine have described the boys as
relatively Americanized, and El Awadly said she was thankful their
Arabic was so poor that they could not understand media reports or
the conversations of adults discussing what happened at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem on Monday, shooting victim Yaakov Aminov, a
46-year-old diamond importer from Valley Village, was laid to rest,
his casket draped in an Israeli flag after its arrival aboard an El
Al flight from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The second victim, El Al ticket agent Victoria Hen, 25, was buried
in Los Angeles on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Lore Noto, 79; Producer of 'The Fantasticks'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lore Noto, producer of "The Fantasticks," the world's longest-
running musical, died Monday in New York City after a long battle
with cancer. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   It was Noto, a former actor and artists' agent, who saw the
possibilities in a small one-act show written by Tom Jones and Harvey
Schmidt when it was first produced in 1959 at Barnard College in New
York.</LD>
<LD>   "It's weird, but ... I was directed by the muses to go there, to
do it, to be there," Noto said on ABC's "Nightline" after the show
rang down the curtain Jan. 13 after 42 years and a record 17,162
performances.</LD>
<TE>   Noto, who didn't know the show was a musical when he went to
Barnard, became hooked by the signature song "Try to Remember," heard
audience members humming it in the campus theater men's room, and
commissioned the authors to expand the book and lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   When the refurbished show opened at the tiny Sullivan Street
Playhouse in Greenwich Village on May 3, 1960, reviews were mixed,
and Noto was advised to close it immediately. Instead, he dug in,
used his savings as a rainy day fund to keep the show going on nights
the audience numbered as few as five, and daringly took it out of
town to the Hamptons for a week. He attracted celebrities at leisure
who liked what they saw enough to permit Noto to use their names as
endorsements in advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   The show returned to New York, the ads ran, and because famous
people liked the little musical, others began calling to buy tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The simple tale of first love, with some allusion to Shakespeare's
"Romeo and Juliet," is the story of a young girl and young boy,
secretly brought together by their fathers and an assortment of odd
characters who include a rakish narrator, an old actor, an Indian
named Mortimer and The Mute.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, scores of performers appeared in the New York
production. Among the musical's better-known alumni are its original
El Gallo, Jerry Orbach, and such soap-opera stars as Eileen Fulton
and David Canary. F. Murray Abraham, long before his Academy Award
for "Amadeus," played the Old Actor for a while in the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Noto, a sometime actor whose previous play, aptly named "The
Failures," had closed in five nights, played the role of the boy's
father off and on for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   He also produced and, with Herbert Martin, co-wrote the book for
the 1965 Broadway play "The Yearling."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York, the son of a billiard academy owner, Lorenzo
Noto graduated from the New York School of Industrial Art and
attended acting workshops.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Merchant Marine and U.S. Maritime Service during
World War II, earning a Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Noto is survived by his wife of 54 years, Mary, three sons and one
daughter.</TE>

<HD>Secession to Remain on Nov. 5 Ballot</HD>
<DH>Challenge: LAFCO agrees issue will go to voters, rejects
higher alimony payment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK MCGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state commission on Monday denied a request by the city of Los
Angeles to reconsider putting San Fernando Valley secession on the
Nov. 5 ballot and found that the city's demands for $288 million a
year in separation payments were unjustified.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission voted 6 to 2, with one
abstention, to deny the request for reconsideration. The majority
found that the agency's financial analysis of the breakup had been
sound and rejected the city's claim that the rest of Los Angeles
would be hurt by splitting the city under the rules set by LAFCO.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, the LAFCO majority said that the Valley's
$127.1-million payment to Los Angeles in the first year after the
breakup would be adequate compensation for the loss of the area north
of Mulholland Drive. Under the formula approved last month by LAFCO,
that payment would decline by 5% every year for 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   City officials had asked LAFCO to reconsider that formula. They
said the payment should start at $288 million and should continue at
that amount for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of LAFCO, said any
adjustment in the separation payment, or alimony, would have
postponed the cityhood vote until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done the best we can with the information we had,"
Yaroslavsky said. "We have a difference of opinion with the city."</TE>
<TE>   He said the city has other options if the alimony is not enough to
cover some centralized costs. "One may be to modify the way they
spend money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president of Valley VOTE, Jeff Brain, ridiculed the claim that
Los Angeles could not substantially cut centralized costs if it had
one-third fewer residents to serve.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears the city through ... this request for reconsideration
continues to try to block the people from simply having an
opportunity to vote on this," Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ellen Sandt of the city administrator's office told the panel
that a consultant hired by the city had shown that there would be
costs not covered in the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   For example, she faulted LAFCO for apportioning costs for building
maintenance on the basis of the percentage of city buildings in each
city, noting that the facilities in downtown Los Angeles are much
larger and require more maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners Beatrice Proo and Cindy Miscikowski, who voted in
favor of reconsideration, and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who abstained,
indicated that they remained concerned that the breakup might not
create a financially viable Valley city without harming the rest of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said she wanted more analysis of the amount of alimony
needed so the remainder of Los Angeles would not be financially
harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairman Henri F. Pellissier said it appeared the city
had made the request in a last-ditch attempt to block a vote or to
set the agency up for a lawsuit if secession passed.</TE>
<TE>   "Reconsideration is not appropriate," he said. "It would keep this
off the November ballot."</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, an advisor to Mayor James K. Hahn on secession, took
the ruling in stride. "LAFCO is like the French judge in the Winter
Olympics," he said. "They predetermined what they were going to do,
so it is no surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley cityhood measure next goes to a hearing on July 25
before the county Board of Supervisors, which is required by state
law to put it on the Nov. 5 ballot unless 50% of the registered
voters in Los Angeles file protests in writing, an unlikely prospect.</TE>
<TE>   The city has also requested reconsideration of a Hollywood
secession measure for the same ballot. LAFCO is to take up that issue
July 26.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, although Valley VOTE has proposed that the new Valley
city council members be paid $75,000 annually and the Valley mayor
$100,000, Miscikowski and other city officials said Monday that their
reading of state law is that salaries would be limited to $1,000 per
month, at least at first.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said state law would require the new Valley city
council to go to the voters to set salaries higher than $1,000 per
month.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO counsel John Krattli said Miscikowski's interpretation of
the law is correct.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also rejected requests from residents of North Hills and
the Sherwood Forest section of Northridge to redraw council district
boundaries for the new Valley city so that communities would not be
split between council districts. Former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler said
communities had been improperly split to concentrate Latino voter
strength.</TE>

<HD>Man, 18, Gets Life for Murder in $20 Theft</HD>
<DH>Court: Gang member will not be eligible for parole in
shooting of retired schoolteacher, a longtime family friend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gang member convicted of killing a longtime family friend in a $20
robbery was sentenced Monday to life in prison without the
possibility of parole.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Patrick Gaines, 18, was one of two teenagers found guilty of
fatally shooting a retired schoolteacher, Kathryn Dawson,
execution-style in her Compton home last year.</LD>
<LD>   Because of Gaines' age, Compton Superior Court Judge Jack W.
Morgan could have imposed a lesser sentence, 50 years to life.</LD>
<TE>   "The judge did the right thing," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Danette
Meyers. "There was no reason to give this guy a break."</TE>
<TE>   Last July, Gaines and his friend Ollie Wayne Hawkins Jr., 17,
robbed Dawson. Hawkins, who will be sentenced in August, testified
that he watched Gaines force the 73-year-old woman to lie down with a
pillow over her head, then shoot her once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's daughter, Yolanda Spooney, said that Gaines, because of
family connections, had been considered a family member by her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother had been good to him and his family for years," she
said, adding that her mother had known Gaines since he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines also was ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution, which will
come out of his prison wages.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said the sentence is fitting for Gaines, who at the time of
the murder was on probation for carrying a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines persuaded Hawkins to carry his gun, Meyers said. After the
robbery and the shooting, Gaines buried the gun in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson taught second- and fifth-grade students in the Los Angeles
Unified School District for 38 years. In February 2001, Dawson began
working part time as a substitute teacher before retiring.</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine Business Ethics Class: In a Word, Enron</HD>
<DH>Education: It leads in focusing on the collapse. Many
colleges find such scandals instructive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As business schools around the nation rush to explore recent
revelations of corporate fraud, UC Irvine has taken an extra step,
planning a course this fall exclusively on Enron--with company
whistle-blower Sherron Watkins as the star speaker.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past two decades, business schools have increasingly
emphasized ethics as part of the curriculum. But professors from a
number of major business schools say the host of scandals over that
same period suggests that schools should do more to moderate a
culture in which profits and stock prices are valued above all.</LD>
<LD>   "Business schools have trailed the development of the business
culture in the [United States] rather than led it," said Kirk O.
Hanson, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics
at Santa Clara University. "Business schools are creatures of the
dominant culture rather than creatures of a better culture."</LD>
<TE>   Hanson said ethics classes were introduced in major U.S. business
schools in the 1970s after revelations of illegal contributions to
Richard M. Nixon's 1972 presidential campaign and later of U.S.
companies paying bribes overseas to get business. Since then, the
number of professors teaching ethics in business schools has climbed
from 20 to more than 700.</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, the country has seen one business scandal
after another--from insider trading to the savings and loan debacle,
starring characters from junk bond king Michael Milken to Enron Chief
Executive Kenneth Lay.</TE>
<TE>   While business schools must teach ethics to be accredited, it
doesn't have to be a separate course, and it's often pushed to the
side.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hermalin, interim dean of UC Berkeley's Haas School of
Business, said his is one of the few schools that requires MBA
students to take an ethics class.</TE>
<TE>   Success and Setbacks</TE>
<TE>   And W. Michael Hoffman, executive director of the Center for
Business Ethics at Bentley College in Massachusetts, said his college
is one of the few in the country where students can choose a
specialty in business ethics. Hoffman said he couldn't convince
faculty members that ethics should be a required course.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody liked the idea, but nobody wanted to give up their part
of the academic pie to do it," he said. Instead, ethics is folded
into other courses.</TE>
<TE>   The professors need ethics training before integrating it into
their courses, said Hoffman, who also founded the Ethics Officers
Assn., a group of more than 800 such corporate specialists.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to be comfortable about what you're teaching," he said.
"It's not something you have just from sheer osmosis. It has to be
developed and cultivated ... and that's part of what ethicists have
been trained to do."</TE>
<TE>   For the past decade, Harvard MBA students have been required to
take a nine-week course in leadership, values and decision-making. A
task force recently recommended that the course be expanded to 15
weeks and broadened to include law, regulation and corporate
accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally got to the stage that we should work harder to get our
students to recognize that as future leaders of organizations, their
actions would define the values of those corporations," Harvard MBA
program Chairman Carl Kester said. "They should set high standards
for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey, by the Aspen Institute's New York-based
Initiative for Social Innovation Through Business, suggests that
business students learn to value high stock prices so much that their
innate sense of social responsibility fades. The survey found that as
they go through business school, their priorities shift from consumer
needs and product quality to shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   The survey of 2,200 MBA students from 13 major business
schools--including Columbia, Yale and UC Berkeley--also found that
many MBA students believe they will have to make decisions that
conflict with their values, and that they cannot change a company's
culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still a long way from integrating what we call 'social
impact management' ... into the core MBA curriculum," said Nancy
McGaw, the group's associate director. The initiative's mission is to
increase the number of business leaders who balance business success
with social and environmental concerns. "What business schools need
is to have students understand that business is part of the greater
social environment," said David Besanko, associate dean for academic
affairs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern
University.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing headlines on Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom,
among others, underscore that point.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's making all of us somewhat more sensitive to ethics,"
said Dave Stewart, deputy dean at USC's Marshall School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   Professor's Homework</TE>
<TE>   At UC Irvine, 55 students have signed up for Richard McKenzie's
six-week Enron class, which will be offered in the fall. Unlike other
business courses at the university, the class will include
traditional MBA students and those in the executive MBA program.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we could have had 100 people on the waiting list," said
McKenzie, who holds the Walter B. Gerken endowed chair in enterprise
and society at the Graduate School of Management.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie hopes the course "becomes an investigation into Enron's
rise and collapse, what Enron did right and wrong. There are lessons
to learn."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the course, McKenzie is studying the intricacies of
the company's rise and fall. After looking at an Enron-commissioned
report that explained the off-the-book partnerships that got the
company into trouble, he complained, "You need a PhD to understand
some of this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   When reminded that he has one, he laughed. "I write about
economics, not about finance."</TE>
<TE>   The class will use Enron to discuss broader topics, such as what
effect incentives have on the management of a company. For example,
he said, stock options were once thought to be a way to align
executives' personal goals with corporate goals. But since many of
the scandals have involved propping up the stock price, people now
question the tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Each session will have a different speaker: a partner from the
accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche to discuss accounting fraud, an
energy economist from Rand to provide the backdrop for the changing
regulatory market, and faculty members addressing ethics and
corporate strategy. One session will pair an assistant U.S. attorney
with a defense attorney to discuss legal aspects of the case. Watkins
will speak Oct. 14 on corporate reform.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the questions she can address is how you keep a job after
being a whistle-blower," McKenzie said.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Rosener, a professor of public policy at the school of
management, persuaded Watkins to speak at UC Irvine. The two met at a
Forbes magazine conference this year in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine will cover Watkins' plane fare and hotel, but she won't
receive a speaking fee.</TE>
<TE>   As the class proceeds, former Enron executives could be on trial,
providing students with more fodder, McKenzie said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Schools React</TE>
<TE>   While UC Irvine's appears to be the only large U.S. business
school devoting an entire course to Enron, professors elsewhere are
incorporating the company's real-world lessons into their classes.</TE>
<TE>   David Baron, a Stanford University professor of business ethics
and strategy, said Enron will show up in at least two courses
required of first-year MBA students.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry E. Trapnell, dean of the business school at Clemson
University in South Carolina, said Enron is already being discussed
in a variety of classes there, from accounting to personnel to
management strategy to ethics.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Stewart, however, said some professors don't believe
business schools need to change their courses to prevent what are
clearly misdeeds or corporate meltdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "What Enron was involved in was a Ponzi scheme," Stewart said. "We
have generally at USC focused on how do you generally create value;
you deliver a product or service to people that meets needs to make a
profit."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, how much impact these courses will have is uncertain, say
some professors.</TE>
<TE>   "No walk of life is immune to people who don't have the will or
conscience to keep them from responding to temptation," Berkeley's
Hermalin said. "There's a lot of money out there."</TE>

<HD>Ventura Broker Given Prison Term for Scheme</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura mortgage broker who admitted bilking dozens of California
investors out of nearly $6 million in an elaborate Ponzi scheme was
sentenced Monday to 21 months in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Curtis Waltz, 57, was also ordered to repay the money to
investors, many of whom were elderly and had entrusted their life
savings to him. Waltz, who remains free on his own recognizance, will
begin serving his prison sentence on Oct. 7. He also received three
years' probation.</LD>
<LD>   Waltz, who operated a Ventura-based lending agency, would solicit
investors to provide loans to people buying a home or refinancing an
existing property, authorities said. In exchange, investors would
receive monthly interest payments throughout the term of the loan.</LD>
<TE>   Investors were told they would get all their money back in one
lump sum. They were provided with fabricated documents that appeared
to be signed by legitimate borrowers, authorities said. Because Waltz
managed the monthly interest payments, he was able to keep the
operation going by paying investors with money collected from other
victims.</TE>

<HD>Broker to Serve Time for Bilking Investors</HD>
<DH>Crime: Judge sentences the Ventura man to 21 months in
prison. Many clients lost life savings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura mortgage broker who admitted bilking dozens of California
investors out of nearly $6 million in an elaborate Ponzi scheme was
sentenced Monday to 21 months in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Curtis Waltz, 57, was also ordered to repay the money to
investors, many of whom were elderly and had entrusted their life
savings or retirement nest eggs to him.</LD>
<LD>   Waltz, who remains free on his own recognizance, will begin
serving his prison sentence on Oct. 7. He also received three years'
probation.</LD>
<TE>   Several of Waltz's victims attended the sentencing hearing in Los
Angeles before U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow. They said they
doubted they would recover their money because Waltz will essentially
be forbidden from entering the investment business after his prison
term.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see him locked up, but what good will that do us?"
said Mark Erickson, an Anaheim resident who lost more than $300,000
in bad investment deals with Waltz. "I want him out so he can work
and pay us back."</TE>
<TE>   Waltz, who operated a Ventura-based lending agency, would solicit
investors to provide loans to people buying a home or refinancing an
existing property, authorities said. In exchange, investors would
receive monthly interest payments throughout the term of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were told they would get all their money back in one
lump sum. They were provided with fabricated documents that appeared
to be signed by legitimate borrowers, authorities said. Because Waltz
managed the monthly interest payments, he was able to keep the
operation going by paying investors with money collected from other
victims.</TE>
<TE>   But Waltz's scheme eventually collapsed. He acknowledged his guilt
in letters sent in January 2001 to more than two dozen investors who
lost money.</TE>
<TE>   "You have wrongfully entrusted money to me to invest on your
behalf," Waltz wrote. "I have wrongfully placed this money in risky
investments, which you did not authorize. These investments failed. I
have only a limited ability to pay you."</TE>
<TE>   Waltz also wrote that he "no doubt violated a number of laws" but
expressed hope that some investments "still have a chance of
producing funds, which would enable me to pay you and other
investors."</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's hearing, Waltz dabbed tears from his eyes as the
judge read the terms of his sentence, which came five months after
Waltz pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Waltz's attorney, Gary Lincenberg, and Assistant U.S. Atty. Angela
Davis asked Morrow to sentence the defendant to 18 months in prison
because he surrendered voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "He lost a lot of his money and his clients' money," Lincenberg
told Morrow. "This was eating at my client ... and he didn't want to
continue down that road, so he went to investors and told them there
were bad investments."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge questioned whether Waltz turned himself in out of
conscience or because he felt several investors were about to go to
the authorities. She then added three months to his sentence based on
several letters she received from investors detailing the depth of
their financial loss.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the proceeding, Waltz had asked the judge to consider a
letter of apology he sent her as well as notes of support from
several friends and business partners.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty bad about what I did," Waltz told Morrow. "I wrote
you a letter and I would like to let that stand."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Waltz's victims said the former mortgage broker used
charm, guile and even religion to gain their trust and get them to
invest.</TE>
<TE>   "It did well for 20 years, and then one day the check bounced,"
said Wendy Elwyn, an Encinitas resident who attended the hearing on
behalf of her 81-year-old mother, who invested more than $200,000
with Waltz.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, Elwyn said her mother was able to live on
the $2,300 monthly interest payments she received from Waltz--until
December 1999, when the checks stopped. She said her mother has since
moved in with her and gets by on a monthly $770 Social Security
check.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother can't believe it," Elwyn said. "He sat in our living
room and prayed with us."</TE>

<HD>City's Parking Crunch Creates Exclusive Spots</HD>
<DH>As demand increases, so do preferential districts.
Hollywood residents fume over new restrictions imposed merely a block
away.</DH>

<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Feeling lucky? Try finding an empty parking space on Vista Street in
Hollywood at night.</LD>
<LD>   The aged apartment buildings on that narrow street north of
Fountain Avenue are so tightly packed it is hard to tell where one
ends and the next begins.</LD>
<LD>   Off-street parking spaces are small or nonexistent. Tenants have
been known to circle the neighborhood for half an hour in search of a
stretch of empty curb.</LD>
<TE>   Those lucky few who find a space in front of their homes cling to
it as if it were undeveloped beachfront property. They will walk,
ride a bicycle or hitch a ride--anything to avoid moving the car and
giving up that prime spot.</TE>
<TE>   But parking spaces in that crowded neighborhood just became even
more elusive.</TE>
<TE>   One block away, south of Fountain Avenue in West Hollywood, city
officials recently imposed a preferential parking district that
prohibits overnight parking for everyone but residents with permits.</TE>
<TE>   Residents, that is, of West Hollywood. Hollywood residents need
not apply.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes it even worse," said Bunny Hale, a Hollywood resident
of Vista Street for more than 30 years. "That was the last bastion
for parking. If you had to, you could go across the street to park.
Not anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As the battle for scarce parking spaces intensifies in Southern
California, preferential parking districts have become one of the
most popular tools wielded by frustrated homeowners and city
officials to preserve valuable neighborhood parking space.</TE>
<TE>   But as the dilemma on Vista Street shows, the proliferation of
such parking restrictions often comes with pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Preferential districts are typically found in well-to-do
neighborhoods that border busy commercial strips, high schools,
colleges or densely populated neighborhoods where parking already is
at a premium. The idea behind the restrictions is to preserve the
curb space for homeowners and their guests, barring "outsiders" from
grabbing those precious spots.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners and tenants can establish a parking district by getting
the support of at least a majority of the residents on a block. Local
transportation officials usually follow up a successful petition
drive with a study to determine how many cars on the street belong to
nonlocals. Public hearings usually follow, allowing critics to
object.</TE>
<TE>   After the district is established, residents must pay for parking
permits, which range in cost from $6 to $15 a year, extra for guest
passes. Some cities reserve the right to withhold permits from those
with unpaid parking tickets.</TE>
<TE>   But such restrictions have generated protests from business
owners, students and others who, after losing their regular street
parking, are forced to pay for spaces in garages or resort to another
unpopular option: walking.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complain that residents don't deserve parking priority
just because they own or rent property on a street. They argue that
public streets are funded with tax dollars generated by an entire
region, not a single block.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a controversial issue," said Bahman Janka, transportation
administrator for Pasadena, home to four parking districts. "Some
people like them, and some people don't."</TE>
<TE>   Since the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of
restricted parking districts in 1977, they have become nearly as
popular as strip malls nationwide. Los Angeles has about 65
preferential parking districts. Santa Monica has 48, Long Beach has
24 and West Hollywood has nine.</TE>
<TE>   With each district has come new problems.</TE>
<TE>   In Sherman Oaks, parking was in such short supply near a
restricted district that some nonresidents began forging parking
permits to poach those coveted neighborhood spots. Los Angeles is
designing a forgery-proof permit that residents can place against
their car windshield.</TE>
<TE>   In Mission Viejo, where preferential parking districts were
imposed near Capistrano Valley High School to keep students from
taking residential spaces, some bold youngsters have taken to
knocking on doors, introducing themselves and asking homeowners
whether they can borrow guest permits to park on the street. And some
residents have obliged.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, the city imposed parking restrictions around Long
Beach City College to prevent students from filling the curb spaces
in surrounding neighborhoods. But business owners west of the college
protested a recent expansion of that district, saying their customers
rely on those residential streets for parking.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, several parking districts near the beach were in
danger of being nullified two years ago when the California Coastal
Commission learned that the city had failed to get the panel's
approval for such restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, worried that the parking districts would limit
visitors to the beach, has since given Santa Monica retroactive
approval with a few added restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on Vista Street in Hollywood, Sascha Strebel, a
resident of 17 years, is fuming over the new restrictions imposed in
West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, she said, parking is so tight that neighbors on her
street often park as far as three blocks from home.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is upset because the owner of her apartment building has
threatened to pave over the front lawn to add parking spaces to make
up for those lost by the restrictions in West Hollywood. That could
mean an increase in her rent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But across Fountain Avenue in West Hollywood, reactions to the new
parking restrictions are much more positive.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just thrilled," said Richard Schultz, who lives in a home
on Vista in West Hollywood just a few yards from Strebel's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz said he signed the petition to create the preferential
parking zone because he and his neighbors were tired of coming home
from work to find the curb in front of their homes crammed
bumper-to-bumper with cars. He said the district has worked so well
that city officials might consider expanding the restrictions to 24
hours a day, seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just so much better now," Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   What about his neighbors in Hollywood, he was asked. What should
they do about their parking crisis?</TE>
<TE>   "They should do the same thing we did and try to get their own
restrictions," he said.</TE>

<HD>Boy's July 4 Death Ruled a Homicide</HD>
<DH>Crime: Buena Park police find bullet, apparently fired in
air, nine feet from where he was watching fireworks.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 9-year-old boy killed while celebrating Independence Day in Buena
Park died from a stray bullet shot into the air, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Xavier Morales of Anaheim was struck by a .22- or .25-caliber
bullet found about nine feet from where he was standing watching
fireworks on the Fourth of July at Boisseranc Park on Dale Street,
Buena Park Police Sgt. Rich Pena said.</LD>
<LD>   A third search of the park over the weekend turned up a bullet
from a small-caliber handgun, prompting police to label the incident
a homicide, Pena said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said three vehicles parked nearby were also hit by gunfire.
A woman sitting in one of them told authorities that a bullet
narrowly missed her.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier was with his 17-year-old brother, Arturo, two cousins and
Arturo's girlfriend at a neighborhood Fourth of July celebration when
he collapsed shortly after, telling his brother that he wasn't
feeling well.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he's just tired, then he started yelling that his
stomach hurt," Arturo Morales said Monday, clutching a picture of his
brother in a baseball uniform. "I thought it was just food poisoning
or something."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Morales walked toward the entrance of the park, where
he collapsed, said Buena Park Police Det. Shawn Morgan. When his
brother tried to help him up, the boy vomited, then he fell
unconscious, Morgan said. Arturo Morales called police after spotting
blood on his brother's right side.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier, who would have started fifth grade in August at Sunkist
Elementary School, died Saturday at UC Irvine Medical Center in
Orange. Police and coroner's officials said the bullet went down
through the boy's right side, puncturing a lung and severing the
aorta before coming out near his hip.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends gathered at the boy's home on Billie Jo Circle
on Monday to mourn their loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very healthy and very loving," said his mother, Vicky
Morales, adding that he had wanted to be a firefighter when he grew
up. "He was the happiness of this house. Instead of us being here for
him, he was always here for us. He was just a great kid."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the bullet that struck Xavier could have been fired
from as far as a mile away from the park.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Goodrich, 49, of Garden Grove was sitting in her truck
preparing to leave the park when a bullet hit the passenger's window
and whizzed past her.</TE>
<TE>   "All the glass blew up in my face," she said. "The police told me
it was fireworks until we found bullet fragments inside the car."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the bullet that almost hit Goodrich was from a
small-caliber handgun. Officers are investigating whether it came
from the same gun that killed Xavier.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's death marked the first Independence Day fatality in
Buena Park in at least 25 years, Pena said.</TE>

<LD>A 9-year-old boy killed while celebrating Independence Day in Buena
Park died from a stray bullet shot into the air, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Xavier Morales of Anaheim was struck by a .22- or .25-caliber
bullet found about nine feet from where he was standing watching
fireworks on the Fourth of July at Boisseranc Park on Dale Street,
Buena Park Police Sgt. Rich Pena said.</LD>
<LD>   A third search of the park over the weekend turned up a bullet

<TE>   Police said three vehicles parked nearby were also hit by gunfire.
A woman sitting in one of them told authorities that a bullet

<TE>   Xavier was with his 17-year-old brother, Arturo, two cousins and
Arturo's girlfriend at a neighborhood Fourth of July celebration when
he collapsed shortly after, telling his brother that he wasn't

<TE>   "I thought he's just tired, then he started yelling that his

<TE>   Police said the bullet that struck Xavier could have been fired
from as far as a mile away from the park.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Goodrich, 49, of Garden Grove was sitting in her Toyota
Tacoma truck preparing to leave the park when a bullet hit the
passenger's window and whizzed past her.</TE>
<TE>   "All the glass blew up in my face," she said. "The police told me
it was fireworks until we found bullet fragments inside the car."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the bullet that almost hit Goodrich was from a
small-caliber handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Officers are investigating whether it came from the same gun that
killed Xavier.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's death was the first Independence Day fatal shooting in
Buena Park in at least 25 years, Pena said. Another 9-year-old boy
was killed in Los Angeles on July 4, 1999, when a stray bullet struck
him in the head while he was playing with friends on the front porch
during a family gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said they have tried to curb such
gunplay by educating the public on the dangers of firing guns in the
air, a popular antic during Fourth of July and New Year's
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of people it goes through one ear and out the other or
they just don't understand it," said Deputy Bill Spear, spokesman for
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "By the time the bullet
comes down through people's roofs, homes or cars, innocent people are
injured or killed unnecessarily. The word is: Don't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials ran television commercials in English,
Spanish and Vietnamese before the holiday to remind the public not to
shoot guns into the air. Buena Park police passed out fliers to
residents, and Anaheim officers have staged community forums.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done as much as we could and we don't know what it's going
to take for people to understand," Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services for Xavier will be at 3 p.m. Thursday at Forest
Lawn, 4471 Lincoln Ave., Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the shooting is asked to call police at
(714) 920-1120.</TE>

<LD>A former United California Bank officer was sentenced Monday to 27
months in prison for embezzling $2.1 million from the bank's
customers. U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian also ordered Gary
Wei Wu, 21, to pay $1.1 million in restitution.</LD>
<LD>   Wu, free on $200,000 bond, pleaded guilty to three counts of
embezzlement. Prosecutors said he took the money through unauthorized
advances and transfers from credit line accounts and unauthorized
withdrawals from commercial accounts belonging to at least seven
customers, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   The bank recovered some of the money, but lost about $1.1 million,
officials said.</LD>

<LD>Three suspects pleaded not guilty Monday to charges stemming from a
robbery and car chase in which a teenager was shot to death by
police.</LD>
<LD>   The two boys from Pico Rivera, one 15 and the other 17, were
charged with assault with a deadly weapon and firing at an occupied
vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Because of their ages, their names were not released.</LD>
<TE>   A third suspect, Richard Rafael Gutierrez, 21, also of Pico
Rivera, is charged with two counts of robbery and one count each of
assault with a firearm, shooting at an occupied vehicle and evading
police.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth suspect, Michael Bilderrain, 18 of Pico Rivera, was
shot to death last week when he allegedly pointed a gun at a
California Highway Patrol officer who had stopped their car in the
San Fernando Valley. Police chased the car after a robbery at a
public storage facility in South Gate.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill making it a misdemeanor to sell food products falsely labeled
as halal, or sanctioned by Islamic law, was signed into law Monday by
Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Davis signed AB 1828, by Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park),
during a news conference at the Islamic Cultural Center in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Halal is the Islamic equivalent to the Jewish kosher, and
therefore a sacred necessity for the Islamic faithful," Davis said.</LD>
<TE>   The law establishes a penalty of as much as 90 days in jail and a
$600 fine for misrepresentation of foods that have not been prepared
in accordance with Islamic dietary laws.</TE>
<TE>   Halal foods are outlined in the Koran, the Muslim holy book, as
the only acceptable foods for observant Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   They must be prepared and stored using equipment that has been
cleansed according to Islamic law.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Long Beach man was sentenced to two years in prison Monday for his
part in a scheme to cash a stolen $161,171 tax refund check intended
for Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder sentenced Kenneth Reeves, 42,
who had pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Co-defendant Dwayne Kellum, 38, also of Long Beach, is scheduled
for sentencing Aug. 12 in two cases.</LD>
<TE>   A month before Kellum pleaded guilty to charges involving Buss'
check, he was convicted of cashing $141,000 worth of stolen checks in
another case.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators do not know who stole Buss' state refund check from
the mail, but they believe the culprit is neither Reeves nor Kellum,
the U. S. attorney's office said.</TE>

<LD>Castlemont School in Woodland Hills closed for the summer a month
ago, and parents wonder if it will reopen this fall, after the
principal announced that the private elementary school was $1 million
in debt and renewal of its lease in doubt.</LD>
<LD>   The school's 10-year lease with Los Angeles Unified School
District expires in August, and the district plans to sell the
Collier Street site to the highest bidder or convert it back into a
public school, said Harold Kwalwasser, general counsel for L.A.
Unified.</LD>
<LD>   The school's debt was caused by a drastic drop in enrollment in
the last three years, said Principal Martin Duberstein, who bought
the school in 1984 after teaching there since 1970.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Castlemont has 70 students, down from 335 in 1999.
Uncertainty about the lease caused the exodus, Duberstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not angry, and I don't blame them [for leaving]," the
principal said. "They were looking for security."</TE>
<TE>   Parents have also raised questions about Castlemont's finances.</TE>
<TE>   The school, where tuition is $11,500 a year, stopped paying
teachers June 8, when funds ran out, Duberstein said. "Where did all
the money go?" asked Marla Epstein, who paid $23,000 in tuition for
her son and daughter to continue at Castlemont in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews Monday, several angry parents accused Duberstein of
mishandling the school's money, something he denies.</TE>
<TE>   The principal said the school has run a deficit for several years
and used new tuition to pay the previous year's debt.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, he said, he won't be able to return tuition money for
39 children and 31 deposits of $1,000 each that were supposed to pay
for the next school year.</TE>
<TE>   Duberstein said he is working to keep the school open, adding that
he is trying to secure an investor or strike a deal with a nearby
private school that would funnel some of its students to Castlemont.</TE>
<TE>   "I've put 32 years of my life into this, and I don't want it to
end," Duberstein said. "They're going to have to pry the keys from my
hands."</TE>

<HD>Suspect's Wife Had Access to Trial Information</HD>
<DH>Law: A clerk in the district attorney's office, she looked
into a confidential computer file in the gang murder case, officials
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For five months last year, a prosecutor's clerk looked into a
confidential computer file listing witnesses in the murder case
against her husband, a gang member, investigators say.</LD>
<LD>   LaShonn Roberts-Devault took her first unauthorized peek at the
file on the day her husband was charged, March 27. It was not until
mid-September, after she had accessed the file 37 more times,
authorities said, that officials in Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's office
discovered what their employee was doing.</LD>
<LD>   Police suspected that she had passed the names of the witnesses to
her husband, Lamont Devault. Devault threatened the girlfriend of a
key witness two days after Roberts-Devault first accessed the
computer, according to court records. Four months later, the same
witness was stabbed seven times one day before Devault's trial was
scheduled to begin. Before that incident, prosecutors had disclosed a
list of witnesses in the public court file.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors acknowledged that the case points up troublesome
aspects of the ability of the legal system to protect witnesses and
ensure that justice is done in gang cases. Gang homicides are often
the most difficult to solve, police say, because of the reluctance of
witnesses, who fear gang retribution, to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts-Devault admitted that she had accessed her husband's file
but denied divulging the names of witnesses to him. She said she had
read the file only to keep up with the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I need to look 38 times just to get the names of
witnesses?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's office referred Roberts-Devault, a 10-year employee, to
Long Beach authorities for criminal prosecution on misdemeanor
charges of unauthorized access to computers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Long Beach assistant city prosecutor, Dan Lenhart,
rejected the request because Cooley's office had submitted it after
the statute of limitations had expired, making prosecution
impossible. Even if he could legally have prosecuted the case,
Lenhart said, he believed that there was not enough evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's investigators bugged Roberts-Devault's jailhouse
conversations with her husband, searched her home, examined her
computer and, under court order, placed electronic devices on her
phone to identify incoming and outgoing calls.</TE>
<TE>   Although she told investigators she had accessed the file only
once or twice, their investigation turned up many other instances,
according to court records. She accessed the computer file six times
on the day charges were filed, three times on the day he was taken
into custody and five times on the day he was arraigned, the records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts-Devault also acknowledged to authorities that she had
looked in the file of her husband's co-defendant, Ruben Jones,
another instance of unauthorized computer access. She said she had
acted at the request of Jones' sister and wanted only to learn the
amount of his bail.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office placed Roberts-Devault on paid
administrative leave in November. She resigned in February.</TE>
<TE>   The internal computer system, access to which is limited to
employees of the district attorney's office, includes basic
information about the defendant, court dates, a list of witnesses and
the names of the prosecutors. It does not provide any information
about evidence or witness statements.</TE>
<TE>   Any access of computer records for personal reasons is deemed
unauthorized, according to Cooley's office.</TE>
<TE>   The head deputy of the district attorney's hard-core gang unit,
Janet Moore, said the full extent of Roberts-Devault's involvement
had never become clear. Moore said the "mere prospect" that
Roberts-Devault could have relayed sensitive information about a
murder case to her husband "cannot be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot say conclusively if there was interference," she said.
"It looks suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   Police agreed that Roberts-Devault's actions were worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say exactly what she did," said a Los Angeles police
detective, Matthew Spillane. "Everyone was concerned with what she
could have done." His partner, Rudy Flores, wrote in court papers
that a danger existed to potential witnesses in the case, in part
because of Roberts-Devault's access to sensitive and confidential
material and her marriage to Devault.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Roberts-Devault shared this information with her
husband, defendant Lamont Devault," he wrote in the application to a
judge for an order to monitor her phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The Devault case began in June 2000, when a bystander was shot and
killed in a gun battle between rival gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Clarence Hardiman told detectives that he had
been at Jones' house on the night of the shooting. He said he had
seen Devault and Jones with AK-47 rifles and later heard them talking
about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   On the day he was arrested, Devault visited Hardiman's girlfriend
and told her to tell Hardiman to stop talking to police, according to
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Hardiman was taken from state prison, where he was serving a
sentence for robbery, to the County Jail to testify in the trial,
which was scheduled to start July 13, 2001. On July 12, Hardiman was
stabbed seven times in the stomach, chest and upper back.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Dave Long said inmate witnesses are kept segregated
from the general jail population for their protection.</TE>
<TE>   Although statistics are not available, prosecutors said witnesses
can be at risk both inside the jail system and outside. Deputy Dist.
Atty. Jennifer Lentz Snyder said four witnesses--not in custody--in
her cases had been killed in 1992 through 1995. The deaths prompted
Snyder to work with legislators to strengthen and expand the state's
witness protection program.</TE>
<TE>   "When a witness is killed, obviously there is a tremendous
chilling effect on a community and its willingness to cooperate," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder also prosecuted a case involving a County Jail killing that
resulted in a California Supreme Court decision allowing prosecutors
to withhold specific witnesses' names from the defendants until
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Their right to survive is at least as important as the
defendant's right to a fair trial," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hardiman stabbing prompted a judge to order the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department to electronically monitor all
conversations during jailhouse visits to either Devault or Jones.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until September during a preliminary hearing that
Devault's attorney, while questioning a police officer, mentioned
that his client's wife worked for Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   Devault and Jones were convicted of murder in February and are
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 10. Hardiman recovered from his
wounds and testified for the prosecution in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts-Devault said that neither she nor her husband had anything
to do with the stabbing of Hardiman, who she said was a known
informant. She said, "I didn't provide any information to" Devault.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura man was sentenced Monday to nine years in state prison for
embezzling about $700,000 from charities that aid the developmentally
disabled, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Allen Henry Norton, 51, was also ordered to pay nearly $450,000 in
restitution to the Foundation for Retarded Citizens of Ventura County
and $94,025 to the California Franchise Tax Board.</LD>
<LD>   Norton pleaded guilty in February to two counts of felony grand
theft and one count of failing to pay income taxes.</LD>
<TE>   He admitted stealing around $700,000 from two nonprofit groups
that operate thrift stores in Ventura and Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Norton was responsible for managing the
stores and used the funds to buy property, clothing, stereo
equipment, patio furniture and luxury vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a bookkeeper for the two charities, Paul
Peachey, was sentenced to nine years in prison for embezzling $1
million from the stores in a separate scheme.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Brenda van Dam was drunk and dancing provocatively at a bar with the
man who later allegedly kidnapped and murdered her 7-year-old
daughter, defense witnesses testified Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony contradicts Van Dam's sworn statements that she was
not drunk and never danced with David Westerfield, who is on trial
here in the girl's killing.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman has asserted that the sexually
permissive lifestyle of Brenda and Damon van Dam may have left their
family vulnerable to someone sneaking into their home and kidnapping
their daughter, Danielle.</LD>
<TE>   Patricia LePage, who was at the bar with her daughter, said Brenda
Van Dam was acting "frisky" and "flamboyant" on the night before her
daughter was found missing. She said she saw Van Dam dancing with
Westerfield in a manner akin to the movie "Dirty Dancing."</TE>
<TE>   "She was rubbing herself all over him," LePage said. "She was all
over the place. She was very much socializing, talking with a lot of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Duane Blake, another patron of Dad's Cafe and Steakhouse in Poway,
testified that Van Dam and Westerfield were dancing "huggy, huggy"
and that Van Dam and her friends appeared "loaded and stoned."</TE>
<TE>   Blake said it appeared that Westerfield was trying to pick up Van
Dam while dancing. When Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek asked what made
him think that, Blake answered, "Because I've been there and done
that."</TE>
<TE>   Two witnesses testified that Brenda van Dam tried to interest them
in returning to the Van Dam home after the night of drinking and
dancing at the bar.</TE>
<TE>   "They were drunk at the time, and they were a little flirtatious
toward me," Ryan Tyrol said of Brenda van Dam and her two female
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dam, while denying that she danced with Westerfield, had
testified that she and Damon engaged in spouse-swapping with friends
on at least one occasion. Damon remained at home the night of Feb. 1,
when Brenda and two friends went to Dad's Cafe and Steakhouse to
dance, drink and smoke marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle was found missing the next morning. Prosecutors allege
that Westerfield--his sexual advances rebuffed by Brenda Van Dam and
the other women--left the bar, entered the Van Dam home and kidnapped
Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, friends of Westerfield testified that it was not
unusual for him to drive his recreational vehicle to the desert on
the spur of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 2, Westerfield drove his RV to the Silver Strand, then to
the Imperial County desert. He used the trip to dispose of the girl's
body, prosecutors have alleged. But the defense says the excursion
was innocent.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Acts to Clean Up Ocean Water</HD>
<DH>Environment: City passes laws, adds enforcement staff to
cleanse urban runoff and cut down on sewage spills. Critics are
encouraged but say they want to see results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach, long criticized by environmentalists for being lax
about urban runoff and sewage spills, has taken several steps that
could make it a model among coastal cities.</LD>
<LD>   The city has formed a new division in its Public Works Department
to improve ocean water quality, and hired five employees and
reassigned another to enforce urban runoff regulations. An ordinance
passed in December allows tough fines for violators.</LD>
<LD>   The city is not yet enforcing the new regulations, but if
employees see especially flagrant violations of long-standing rules
that had not been enforced, a fine could be imposed, said John
Pietig, assistant city manager.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to enforce upon them the new rules without
educating them first," Pietig said. The new rules include a ban on
hosing down driveways and on over-watering lawns, and allow for
enforcement fines.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach now joins cities such as Dana Point, Encinitas and
Santa Monica in having an aggressive program to stem the flow of
chemicals, animal waste and debris into storm drains and then into
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Local environmental activists question whether the city will
enforce the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one thing to issue decrees, it's another to actually do
something," said Roger von Butow, an environmental activist in Laguna
Beach with a water quality coalition called Clean Water Now! "We've
seen a lot of rhetoric, but we've seen very little change."</TE>
<TE>   However, Pietig said the city has shown its commitment by
increasing the staff that handles water quality issues, spending more
than $1 million to repair old sewer lines and enacting an ordinance
with teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Cities are now being required to meet tough federal Clean Water
Act regulations. All are required to comply within a year of
receiving updated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permits, which are issued every five years. Permit applications and
approvals are staggered throughout the year. Laguna Beach received
its permit in February.</TE>
<TE>   Cities that don't comply with permit regulations within a year can
face daily fines of up to $1,000, as well as $10 per gallon for
sewage spills.</TE>
<TE>   Since February, the city has issued 39 courtesy citations and
three fines. One resident who was washing off paint brushes in the
gutter was fined $50. A homeowner and his subcontractor were fined
$500 and $1,000 respectively for a broken water main that sent a
plume of dirt into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Wayne Baglin said the subcontractor apparently had broken a
water main at the home and did not repair it quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Pietig, who was hired in January at a salary of $80,000 to head
the new water quality division, said a key aim will be educating
residents and businesses about the program's goals and the
consequences of not meeting them.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to not fine people," said Pietig. "Our goal is to
raise their level of awareness and get them to comply voluntarily....
But we will enforce if we have to."</TE>
<TE>   If the city does follow through, Von Butow said, that would make
it a leader in water quality enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach was pressured to clean up its act.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board fined
the city $60,000 for 23 sewage spills, eight of which closed beaches
for 29 days over 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of complying with regional standards are small in
comparison to the stigma of knowingly polluting the ocean, Baglin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials "look very bad in front of their electorate" if the city
has a reputation for unclean water, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents say the measures are needed and that they are
willing to change their habits for the sake of water quality.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Dietrich, who lives on Holly Street, says city officials have
told him he can't hose his driveway anymore. "I assume the city is
doing what's best for the environment, and I think it's the
appropriate thing to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Wintz, who with his wife, Peggy, owns the Golden Spoon frozen
yogurt shop on Broadway, said they sweep in front of their shop and
use biodegradable cleansers on their machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Any reasonable steps we can take to protect the environment is
something we should all be in favor of ... without having to be
told," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Except for egregious violators, Pietig said, the city will
continue to issue courtesy citations as employees educate residents.</TE>
<TE>   After a first warning, residents will be fined for hosing down a
driveway or over-watering the lawn, acts that weren't prohibited
under old rules. Fines range from $50 for a first offense to $200 for
third and subsequent violations.</TE>
<TE>   Building permit applications also must show that a project would
not contribute to water pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Critics remain skeptical because the city backpedaled recently on
a grease-control proposal aimed at reducing sewage spills caused by
restaurant grease. It dropped an earlier plan to require grease
interceptors at all restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Pietig said the city found that after an extensive education
program for restaurants, the number of sewage spills caused by grease
blocking lines was drastically reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin said he believes the new program and ordinances will make a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to catch the pollution as close to the source as
possible," he said. "That's what we're doing now and what we should
have been doing years ago."</TE>

<HD>Molester Who Had Himself Castrated Must Remain in Custody</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Ventura County jury says that, despite his surgery,
Stephen Norten still represents a danger to society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County jury on Monday turned down a plea for freedom from a
convicted child molester who had himself surgically castrated in an
effort to eliminate his sexual desire.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors sided with prosecutors, who argued that the operation did
not make Stephen Norten less dangerous. Norten, 41, has been
convicted of seven sex offenses involving young boys and has been in
and out of prisons and mental hospitals for more than 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means that Norten must remain at Atascadero State
Hospital. State law allows severe sex offenders to be held
indefinitely if, every two years, prosecutors prove they still pose a
threat.</LD>
<TE>   Norten underwent his surgery in January after earlier receiving
approval for it from a Ventura County judge. At Atascadero, he had
submitted to "chemical castration"--injections of a medication that
lowers testosterone levels--but the treatments were stopped after he
suffered severe side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Classified legally as a "sexually violent predator," Norten told
therapists that he had hundreds of encounters with young boys.
According to testimony, he told a psychologist at Atascadero that he
used to frequent malls and video arcades.</TE>
<TE>   At least three of his victims were from Simi Valley, where Norten
lived in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled by his obsessive need for sexual contact with boys
despite years of therapy, Norten saw castration as the only way he
could safely live outside an institution, Chief Deputy Public
Defender Neil Quinn told jurors. In his closing argument, Quinn said
his client took to heart the adage: "If thine eye offends thee, pluck
it out."</TE>
<TE>   While disappointed in the jury's decision that Norten still is a
sexually violent predator, Quinn said he believes the panel
considered the complex case carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to put this question to them in any way other
than, 'Do you fear this person?' That answer is usually going to be
yes," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors spent a day deliberating after listening to conflicting
expert testimony for two weeks. The six experts who took the stand
were all psychiatrists or psychologists and were split down the
middle on whether castration would end Norten's compulsion.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, jurors agreed with prosecutor David Lehr, who
contended that Norten's taste for stalking boys is ingrained and did
not disappear when he was castrated. "His fondness for boys has
lasted a lifetime," Lehr said. "It doesn't just go away with a few
strokes of the surgeon's knife."</TE>
<TE>   After the jury's verdict, Lehr said he believed the panel may have
been swayed by testimony about the lax supervision Norten would
receive if he were released. His plan was to live near his father in
Arizona, where he would be placed on long-term probation.</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring would consist of monthly check-ins with a probation
officer. Medical tests to gauge Norten's sex drive and testosterone
level could be administered, but only if Norten were to pay for them,
Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of supervision is that?" asked Lehr. "He could be out
molesting 29 days a month and go see his probation officer on the
30th."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Donald D. Coleman ordered that Norten stay
hospitalized until at least September 2003. At that time, prosecutors
will again have to prove he presents a danger in order to keep him in
custody. Norten has lost two previous bids for freedom; the hearing
that just ended was delayed by his surgery.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Press Case for a Union</HD>
<DH>Labor: State is entering dispute after Antelope Valley
Hospital refuses to recognize workers' vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurses at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster say they hope a union
will help make conditions better for patients and themselves.</LD>
<LD>   A recent push for union representation was generated by concerns
among registered nurses that patient care was suffering because
staffing had not kept pace with the area's growing population and its
need for medical care.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, the Antelope Valley's population grew by about
27%, to 318,000, but two of five hospitals closed. Now, 350-bed
Antelope Valley Hospital could face even more pressure because of Los
Angeles County's planned termination of inpatient care at nearby High
Desert Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "Pay is not the issue," said Colleen Sichley, a registered nurse
at Antelope Valley. "It's unsafe staffing."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the California Nurses Assn. say that in May a
majority of the hospital's registered nurses voted in favor of
joining the union in hopes of strengthening their position.</TE>
<TE>   But union and hospital officials cannot agree on the total number
of registered nurses at the hospital: The union says there are 575
and the hospital says there are 653.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said nurses are continuing to send them pro-union
votes, but hospital officials have refused to recognize the union
because of a disagreement about how a union election should be held.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the state's Public Employment Relations Board issued
a complaint on behalf of the nurses. Union and hospital
representatives are scheduled to explain their positions to an
administrative law judge July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hill, chairman of the hospital board, said a shortage of
nurses is a nationwide phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses and the union are taking advantage of jitters caused by
what the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided to do with
High Desert Hospital to cut costs in their troubled health-care
system, Hill said. "I think [the union] is engaged in hyperbole," he
said. "We know they are making a major statewide push to increase
their membership."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, nine Democratic state lawmakers, including Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) and Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles), sent a letter to the Antelope Valley Hospital board
outlining the perceived problems at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The letter includes allegations that some hospital staffers
engaged in "a wide range of anti-union activities." Lawmakers
threatened to investigate the hospital if administrators do not
recognize the union.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Callahan, a spokesman for the hospital, denied any anti-union
activity has occurred. And while he said patients have waited long
periods for service, he said it's the result of "forces beyond our
control."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem," he said, "is we're the only full-service hospital"
in the region.</TE>

<HD>Man Killed by Police on Freeway Is Identified</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Investigators say man who assaulted officers,
stole patrol car had been using drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 36-year-old man had been "smoking crack" when he struck a Los
Angeles police officer, stole the officer's patrol car and then
struggled with other police before they shot him to death,
investigators said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Cecil Rudolph Menifield of Los Angeles was identified Monday by
the Los Angeles County coroner's office as the man killed Saturday
night by LAPD Officers Charles Wunder and Carter Fenstemacher.</LD>
<LD>   Wunder and Fenstemacher opened fire after they saw the man was
attempting to wrest away another patrolman's gun, said Lt. Horace
Frank of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The incident began about 7:30 p.m. Saturday when two officers with
the LAPD's 77th Street Division approached Menifield on 79th Street
because he was "smoking crack," Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant said that as an unidentified officer who was a
passenger got out of the patrol car, Menifield ran up to him, punched
him and knocked him down.</TE>
<TE>   Frank said the officer and Menifield struggled for the patrolman's
weapon. Officer Matthew Jacobik, who was driving the patrol car, then
got out and fired his weapon at Menifield, who jumped into the empty
patrol car and drove off, police said. Investigators said it is not
yet clear whether Menifield was wounded in the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobik and his partner notified dispatchers, and police units
soon spotted the missing patrol car on the Harbor Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Menifield was stopped near Exposition Boulevard, where he got out
of the patrol car but failed to comply with orders to surrender,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Beanbag rounds were fired at Menifield, but he continued to
resist, Frank said. The lieutenant said the officers then shot
Menifield with a Taser gun, which knocked him to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   But Menifield reportedly kept on struggling. When one of the
officers yelled a warning, Wunder and Fenstemacher, seeing the
suspect grabbing for a gun, opened fire, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   David Campbell, a spokesman for the coroner's office, said
Menifield died at the scene. An autopsy has yet to be scheduled to
determine the precise cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   An unnamed officer was shot in the wrist during the final struggle
that ended in Menifield's death. Who fired that shot was not
immediately clear. The wounded officer is expected to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Wunder, 37, has been with the department more than seven years.
Fenstemacher, 29, and Jacobik, 36, are six-year veterans.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting forced closure of the freeway in both directions for
several hours, causing a backup that stretched for miles.</TE>

<LD>The police log of the Huntington Beach Independent reported an
outraged resident's complaint that a man was at a "tire store with
his underwear outside of his pants."</LD>
<LD>   A fashion crime here, to be sure, but I couldn't help thinking how
warmly the offender would be accepted in the mythical nation of San
Marcos in Woody Allen's "Bananas."</LD>
<LD>   In that film, a power-crazed rebel leader seizes control of a
Latin American country and, in addition to changing the official
language to Swedish, declares: "All citizens will be required to
change their underwear every half hour. Underwear will be worn on the
outside so we can check."</LD>
<TE>   Hardly the Fourth of July spirit: The Marina del Rey Argonaut said
a man confronted a passerby "with a barbecue fork and demanded money,
but fled without taking any property."</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Today's shoppers' specials (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house that would sleep occupants comfortably as long as the
occupants were mice. (Jeanne Kinsey of La Quinta)</TE>
<TE>   * A surprising credit card statement--and you thought interest
rates had gone down! (Lois Willows of Beverly Hills)</TE>
<TE>   * An offer apparently aimed at Leisure World habitues who can't
adapt to all the fresh air on the coast. (Dorothy Behm of Laguna
Woods)</TE>
<TE>   * And a Pasadena restaurant with a quirky sense of humor. (James
Rodriguez of Fontana)</TE>
<TE>   This just in! Mia Lee of KCAL and Paul Moyer of KNBC were voted
most irritating TV news anchors in L.A. by readers of the media Web
site ronfineman.com.</TE>
<TE>   (Oddly enough, neither KCAL nor KNBC have taken note of the
honors.)</TE>
<TE>   The flashy Lee received 22% of the vote, compared with 20% for the
folksy Moyer.</TE>
<TE>   A runoff has been declared to determine who is No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up were Michele Ruiz of KNBC (17%), Linda Alvarez of KCBS
(13%), Hal Fishman of KTLA (10%), Lauren Sanchez of KCOP (8%), Harold
Greene of KCBS (8%) and Kelly Mack of KNBC (3%).</TE>
<TE>   Lee is believed to hold the edge over Moyer in the runoff since
her often revealing outfits have drawn critical comments from
readers. I sometimes quarrel with Moyer's choice of ties, but I
really can't fault him on appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, I'm hoping that Web site chieftain Ron Fineman, a radio
newsman, intends to host an awards show at a suitable location to
present the winner her (or his) trophy.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police log of the San Clemente Sun Post News
carried a "report of a man beating on a car in anger." Sounds like
the driver has come into possession of my old Mitsubishi Montero.</TE>

<HD>Illegal Pharmacies Plague Immigrant Areas</HD>
<DH>Health: Legislation would stiffen penalties against
non-drugstores that are dispensing medications without prescriptions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO and JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than three years after a toddler died from an injection at a
backroom clinic, Orange County and state officials said illegal
pharmacies remain a serious problem in immigrant communities.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are now wrapping up what they consider several
important cases against the clinics. The Orange County district
attorney's office is expected to file charges this week against four
Little Saigon businesses it raided in April.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) is
pushing a bill that would stiffen the penalties against those who
operate illegal pharmacies.</LD>
<TE>   "We give people harsher sentences for drunk driving and other
crimes than what we give people playing doctor in the back of a
liquor store," said Maddox, who is trying to get his bill out of an
Assembly committee. "It's just another way to exploit the poor, [who]
most often tend to be immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   Backroom clinics are tucked inside gift shops, health-food and
fabric stores, even bakeries. Poor residents, usually immigrants,
often look to the clinics for cheap medication without having to
worry about seeing a doctor first.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the clinics pose a significant danger by peddling
drugs that are sometimes illegally manufactured or whose expiration
dates have passed. Often, the medications are administered by people
who are not doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "They [patients] don't get the right drug for the right
condition," said Susan Bond, drug and consumer product safety section
chief for the state Department of Health Services. "Some drugs may be
counterfeit. They may be toxic. They may be unsafe."</TE>
<TE>   They may also be deadly.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1998, 13-month-old Christopher Martinez died in Santa Ana
while being treated for the flu at a storefront clinic by a man not
licensed to practice medicine.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, an 18-month-old Anaheim girl was given an injection
of illegal imported drugs at a gift shop in Tustin that doubled as a
clinic. Her parents, who did not have medical insurance, paid $37 for
what they thought was a shot of penicillin. Selene Segura Rios died
hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they don't have a good handle on how many illegal
clinics are operating. Tips from the public--which jumped in the
months after the baby's death--have declined. But authorities said
their investigations continue to uncover clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Some clinics are becoming more sophisticated. They move their
businesses more frequently and have new ways to avoid detection.
"I've heard of cases where they keep it in their cars, not in their
stores," said June Nakagawa, a senior investigator with the state's
Department of Health Services' food and drug branch.</TE>
<TE>   Operating an illegal pharmacy is a misdemeanor. But Maddox's
proposed law would allow district attorneys to prosecute the crime as
a felony.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent cases, investigators from the Orange County
district attorney's office and the state Department of Health
Services teamed up for a yearlong probe into several businesses in
Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   According to search warrants:</TE>
<TE>   Undercover investigators entered one small, crowded shop in the
Asian Garden Mall in Westminster and discovered products labeled "Rx
Only," indicating they can be sold only with a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator bought one of the products for $35. Investigators
also bought a prescription ointment for itchy skin for $1.50, along
with two more prescription drugs. Most of the labeling was in
Chinese. At other stores, the investigators purchased topical
prescription skin creams, all without prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of two of the targeted businesses had been warned not to
sell the pharmaceuticals during a similar crackdown by state
investigators in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, investigators told the store operators how to
distinguish between drugs that could be sold over the counter and
those that require a prescription. In turn, the operators promised to
stop illegally selling the drugs and avoided prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   This time, prosecutors are taking a tougher approach. Orange
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Byron Nelson said the shop operators will
face charges that include sale of illegal narcotics, operating a
pharmacy without a license and dispensing mislabeled and dangerous
pharmaceuticals without a license.</TE>
<TE>   One business owner, Nicholas Chung, said he did not know the drugs
he was selling were illegal. "They told me and I stopped right then.
I'm not selling anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities acknowledge they face hurdles in their attempts to
stamp out the practice, including the continued support of the
makeshift clinics by residents.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, they are "trying to get the message out that ...
we'll be watching," Nakagawa said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ordered to Reconsider Plants' Status</HD>
<DH>Court: Activists had sued after agency decided not to set
aside protected areas for eight threatened species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In response to a lawsuit by environmentalists, a federal judge here
has ordered the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider within
three years its decision not to set aside protected areas known as
"critical habitat" for eight imperiled plant species.</LD>
<LD>   The plants are found in scattered spots across the state, ranging
from Otay Mesa near the U.S.-Mexico border to Inyo and Mono counties
in the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   "Critical habitat is essential to species survival and recovery,"
said Daniel Patterson, desert ecologist with the Idyllwild office of
the Center for Biological Diversity. The center and the California
Native Plant Society have sued the Department of Interior seeking
protection for the eight plants.</LD>
<TE>   Although the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Irma Gonzalez
was hailed as a victory for environmentalists, it does not require
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to grant any of the plants habitat
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The agency could determine that it is still "not prudent" to
declare critical habitat for "some, if not all, of the species," the
decision said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Geoff Hickcox, the Durango, Colo., lawyer who represented
the environmental groups, said he doubts that the Fish and Wildlife
Service will again decide that it is not prudent to provide habitat
protection for the eight species.</TE>
<TE>   He said the government voluntarily agreed to reconsider its
determination on the eight plants, and the only issue before Gonzalez
involved the timeline.</TE>
<TE>   "They know that if they make a 'not prudent' decision again
without any additional information, they'll just land back in court,"
Hickcox said. "We feel good about the results. We've got them to go
back and reconsider the rules, which they would not have done
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Under Gonzalez's decision, the government has until 2004 to
determine whether three plants deserve critical habitat designation
and until 2005 to make the same decision on five others.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs had wanted all the determinations made more
quickly--on the theory that some of the plants are rapidly nearing
extinction. But the Fish and Wildlife Service had argued that it
needed until 2005 and 2006 because of its substantial workload.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Hendron, spokeswoman for the Carlsbad office of the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said the decision will add to the "staggering
amount of litigation-driven" work at the wildlife service.</TE>
<TE>   "This work has hindered our ability to set our own priorities, to
determine for ourselves which species need protection and where,"
Hendron said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that, in some cases, determining that a certain area
provides critical habitat actually can hasten the destruction of a
plant or animal species because it will lead to "collecting" and
unauthorized use of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez gave the Fish and Wildlife Service until 2004 to make
final determinations on the Peirson's milk vetch, the Lane Mountain
milk vetch and the Fish Slough milk vetch.</TE>
<TE>   The Lane Mountain milk vetch is found in four western Mojave
Desert sites near the Army's Ft. Irwin in San Bernardino County.
Environmentalists are concerned that expansion of the Army's tank
training and civilian off-road vehicles will damage the plant.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish Slough milk vetch is in the Great Basin Desert region of
Inyo and Mono counties, where cattle grazing and off-road vehicle use
have sparked debate.</TE>
<TE>   The Peirson's milk vetch arguably is the most controversial of the
eight plants covered by the ruling. The plant is found in the
Algodones Sand Dunes of Imperial County, where environmentalists and
off-road enthusiasts are disputing motorized use of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Land Management is developing rules for use of the
area, under legal and political pressure from both sides. Hendron
said it is unclear how the decision will affect the rules'
development.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez gave the wildlife service until 2005 to decide about the
Coachella Valley milk vetch, the Munz's onion found in western
Riverside County, the San Jacinto Valley crownscale, the
thread-leaved brodiaea found predominantly in northern San Diego
County, and the spreading navarretia in Otay Mesa and in western
Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's imperative that scientists and conservation advocates work
with governments to conserve our remaining species and their
habitats," said Illeene Anderson, Southern California botanist with
the California Native Plant Society.</TE>

<HD>Coastal Panel OKs Widening Lincoln Blvd.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Coastal Commission voted unanimously Monday to allow
Caltrans to widen a stretch of Lincoln Boulevard between Marina del
Rey and Westchester to help ease traffic that is expected to grow
worse as the giant Playa Vista development comes online.</LD>
<LD>   Playa Vista opponents immediately countered that the $9-million
road project is bound to exacerbate the already nasty traffic by
creating a mini-freeway with bottlenecks at both ends of the stretch
of road between LMU Drive and Jefferson Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   "That does not solve traffic problems; it makes them worse," said
Marcia Hanscom, executive director of Wetlands Action Network, which
has long fought development of the big residential and commercial
project.</LD>
<TE>   Peter M. Douglas, the coastal commission's executive director,
said the 10 commissioners meeting in Huntington Beach expressed
strong doubts that the project will relieve the severe traffic along
that stretch of road. They urged the California Department of
Transportation and the city to move aggressively to bolster public
transit in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so obvious that we have to move to public transit," Douglas
said. "The notion that this somehow will address congestion into the
future is simply misplaced."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Caltrans maintained that the expansion of Lincoln to eight
lanes--10 including the two turn lanes at Jefferson--from six "will
help to move traffic," said spokeswoman Deborah Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said the project will also provide improved coastal
access for pedestrians and bicyclists by creating two bike paths, one
that would run alongside vehicles and a wider one that would be
separated from traffic by a strip of vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Boulevard expansion is one of a handful of projects
planned by Caltrans to relieve the traffic that Playa Vista is
expected to create. A few weeks ago, the Coastal Commission approved
a lengthening of the Marina Freeway. In coming months, the commission
is expected to vote on Caltrans' plans to widen Lincoln to the north
between Jefferson and Fiji Way in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Tyrrell, Playa Vista's director of coastal and
environmental affairs, said that widening Lincoln should go a long
way toward improving the road's safety, particularly at the curve
near Loyola Marymount University. She said that stretch of road has
three times more fatalities than is the average for Caltrans roads
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   But Hanscom said the Coastal Commission has erred in considering
Caltrans' proposals piecemeal. "There's no way for someone to
ascertain what the real environmental impacts would be when you're
deciding them one by one," she said.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Wants Murder Case Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Simi Valley man's lawyers say evidence of prior
sexual assaults were improperly introduced at a hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for a Simi Valley serial rapist accused of killing a woman
during a kidnapping and rape attempt urged a Ventura County judge
Monday to dismiss the case.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy public defenders Neil Quinn and Jan Helfrich argued that
prosecutors should not have been allowed to present evidence of
Vincent Sanchez's prior sex assaults during a monthlong preliminary
hearing in the murder case.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, a Simi Valley handyman, has admitted to raping seven
women and assaulting three others over a five-year span.</LD>
<TE>   But he has denied killing 20-year-old Moorpark resident and
community college student Megan Barroso during a kidnapping and rape
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso's bullet-ridden car was found abandoned near a freeway
overpass in Moorpark on July 5, 2001. Her body was found a month
later in a ravine near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Sanchez forced Barroso off the highway,
shot up her car and tried to rape her before she died from a gunshot
wound in the abdomen. They are seeking the death penalty. Defense
lawyers say there is no evidence of a rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   At a court hearing Monday, Quinn argued that testimony about prior
rapes by Sanchez amounted to improper character evidence and should
have been kept out of the preliminary hearing in April.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said that prosecutors used the evidence to prop up their
theory that Sanchez killed Barroso during an attempted rape. The same
evidence was used to support a charge of attempted kidnapping for
sexual purposes involving a 21-year-old Simi Valley woman, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman testified that nine months before Barroso's slaying,
Sanchez had tried to ram his truck into her car as she drove home
from work.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona argued that the evidence was
properly admitted and supports the theory that Sanchez was gradually
becoming more brazen in his attacks on women.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers are also challenging the manner in which the
criminal case was filed, and they want specific charges dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. is expected to issue a
written ruling later this week.</TE>

<HD>Captain, Mate Seek to Detain 5 Chinese</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge is asked to declare the men material
witnesses in an Orange County smuggling case and thereby halt their
deportation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two accused high-seas smugglers hope to stop the deportation of five
Chinese nationals who jumped naked from a fishing trawler two months
ago and swam ashore near Laguna Beach in a botched attempt to enter
the country.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed Monday in federal court in Santa Ana, lawyers
representing the fishing boat captain and his chief engineer say the
Chinese men hold information critical to their clients' freedom. But
U.S. authorities have put the potential witnesses on the fast track
for removal from the country, the lawyers said, which jeopardizes the
men's defense.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers representing Jinn Yinn Wang, captain of the Taiwanese
fishing vessel Fuxing N.06, and co-defendant Jin Long Guo asked a
U.S. judge to declare the five men material witnesses in their
smuggling case and thereby halt their deportation by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler
took the matter under advisement and said she would rule on the
matter within a day.</LD>
<TE>   While federal prosecutors say the five Chinese men were among a
group of 10 would-be immigrants who paid thousands of dollars to be
smuggled ashore, defense lawyer Steven J. Riggs insisted that the men
were members of the Fuxing N.06 crew. Instead of being victimized by
the captain and engineer, Riggs said the crew turned on them, locked
them away and eventually jumped ship.</TE>
<TE>   Among other evidence Riggs and co-counsel William Morrissey plan
to present at trial is proof that the Fuxing N.06 was loaded with two
tons of fish--a payload that would suggest it was actually a fishing
vessel and that the captain and his engineer had help from other
willing hands.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an oceangoing vessel," Riggs said. "There's no way these
two individuals maintained the boat, fished, kept 10 people in
custody, fed them and otherwise looked after them."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. attorney Lawrence Kole and other officials say all
10 Chinese nationals were held in squalid confinement during their
journey and forced to call the captain "boss." Authorities have
already designated five as government witnesses; the men have
allegedly declined to speak with defense lawyers for the accused
smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 men paddled ashore north of Laguna Beach in May, naked and
clinging to makeshift floats. Once on the beach, the men changed into
suits and baseball caps that had been stored in plastic bags. The
group was taken into custody when they were observed changing on the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the men paid $10,000 each to be smuggled more than
7,000 miles from China, through Taiwan and into the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Spielbergs Keep Brentwood Range Open</HD>
<DH>Preservation: The director and his wife donate $12 million
for school district land used by horse lovers but marked for
developers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddlebags bulging with cash, movie director Steven Spielberg and
actress-wife Kate Capshaw have galloped to the rescue of Brentwood
horse lovers threatened by home builders.</LD>
<LD>   The two are donating $12 million for the purchase of surplus Los
Angeles school property in Sullivan Canyon that, for more than three
decades, has been used as a community equestrian club.</LD>
<LD>   The gift will ensure that the 8.3-acre site north of Sunset
Boulevard remains open space accessible to horse riders, according to
leaders of the Sullivan Canyon Preservation Assn., which operates
riding rings there and will own the land.</LD>
<TE>   Until the Spielbergs' offer, the unused school site had been
earmarked for sale to private developers, who would have built more
multimillion-dollar homes in the ritzy canyon between Brentwood and
Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredibly generous gift," said Mary Sweeney, who heads
the association. Its 140-member riding club is open to the public for
yearly fees that total $350 per rider and $500 per horse.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon land was acquired in 1961 by the Los Angeles Unified
School District in anticipation of a Westside enrollment explosion.
But the elementary school planned for the site was never built. The
surrounding hillside neighborhoods were soon dotted with large homes
occupied by people who either had no children or sent them to private
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The empty school site was used for horseback riding--informally at
first. By the late 1960s, local people asked for permission to set up
riding rings and jumps. To handle liability issues, riders formed the
Sullivan Canyon Riders Club and entered into what became a series of
three-year contracts with the school district.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, however, school officials were criticized for what
some categorized as "welfare for the rich." The district was renting,
for $16,000 a year, a site on which it was paying $55,000 annually in
property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   After first suggesting that the land might fetch as much as $27
million if sliced up into private home sites, officials eventually
settled on the $12-million selling price. The Riders Club countered
by forming the Preservation Assn. and linking up with a
state-authorized conservation group in hopes of buying it.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority--an entity
tied to local park districts in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks--sued
in an attempt to force the school district to sell the land to the
authority for $2 million. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled
against that group in January.</TE>
<TE>   The Recreation and Conservation Authority, which has been engaged
for years in a fight with the city of Malibu over its commercialized
use of mountain parkland donated by singer Barbra Streisand, will
have no further role in the equestrian club's operation, Sweeney said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't plan to build anything. We'll probably clean up the old
fencing and secure it a little better," Sweeney said. "We're not
looking to make it a Bel-Air country club. We're not going to have a
clubhouse. We've operated 30 years without one just fine."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the agreement, Spielberg will retain a  3/4-acre
portion of the equestrian site adjoining residential property that he
and Capshaw own. The two have built a residence and a large outdoor
riding ring on 2.8 acres there.</TE>
<TE>   Those relatively modest facilities took the place of an earlier,
controversial proposal to build a five-story, 27,000-square-foot
domed equestrian center on the lot, the former home of the late actor
Dane Clark that the Spielbergs had bought for $5.75 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Spielbergs were unavailable for comment Monday. But a
spokesman, Andy Spahn, said the  3/4-acre chunk will be used as a
"turnout" where horses unwind before and after being exercised.</TE>
<TE>   "Kate and Steven discussed it and made the decision together as a
way of allowing the community to have open space," Spahn said. "The
Preservation Assn. would have had to sell off three-quarters of the
property to developers" to afford to buy any of the school site for
equestrian use. "That prompted Kate and Steven to step forward."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles school board approved the sale June 26. A Board of
Education member, Marlene Canter, praised the deal as one that
provides "badly needed funding for our facilities program while
preserving scarce open space for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who
represents the Brentwood area, characterized the sale as a "great
ending" to "so many years of contention between the school district
and the community over the disposition of this property."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said escrow would close in about 18 months.</TE>

<HD>Recall of College Trustee Launched</HD>
<DH>Vote: Republican group seeks the ouster of Allan Jacobs
over his support of the chancellor. Special election may be needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The group seeking to recall Ventura County Community College District
Trustee Allan Jacobs will have to collect at least 12,500 signatures
from registered voters to force a special election, which could cost
the district $100,000, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Republican Assembly filed paperwork Monday with
the registrar of voters to launch a recall against Jacobs, 72, for
his public support of Chancellor Philip Westin, who has come under
fire for spending $119,000 over a four-year period on
business-related expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobs, a Republican first elected to the nonpartisan seat in
1991, said last week that he stands by his support of Westin and that
voters should look at the district's accomplishments before rushing
to judgment.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want this job necessarily," Jacobs said. "I'm on the
board only because it's a public service and someone asked me to do
it. I'll just throw out my [voting] record and let the public take a
look at it."</TE>
<TE>   But organization President Mike Robinson said Monday that Jacobs
has "abandoned the hard-working taxpayers of Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   "Allan Jacobs has allowed the chancellor to charge outrageous
reimbursements to the taxpayers," Robinson said in a statement filed
with the registrar. "He has failed to hold the chancellor accountable
for his use of taxpayer dollars.... When the chancellor's abuse of
office became public, Allan Jacobs states that his spending 'wasn't
something we felt needed to be reviewed.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said the conservative group is also upset that Jacobs
voted with a majority of board members last spring to grant Westin a
$30,000 raise after learning about the chancellor's spending habits
and after county voters approved a $356-million bond measure to
upgrade the district's three campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Norman Nagel and trustees Art Hernandez and John
Tallman are up for reelection in November. Robinson said his
109-member group is monitoring the statements and actions of trustee
Bob Gonzales to see where he stands on Westin's future with the
district.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of both Gonzales and Jacobs expire in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the organization gathers the necessary number of
signatures from residents of Simi Valley, Somis and Moorpark--the
area that Jacobs represents on the five-member board--the recall
would not make the November ballot because of verification deadlines,
said Assistant County Registrar Bruce Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Signed petitions would have to be submitted to the county and
certified by Aug. 9, he said. Because the county has a minimum of 88
days to verify that the signatures match voting records, they would
not be certified in time to make the deadline, Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the registrar would have to call a special election after
November at a cost of at least $100,000 to the cash-strapped
community college district.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley resident Mary Albanese, a member of the organization,
said it would not be difficult to gather the required number of
signatures within the allotted time.</TE>
<TE>   "People are outraged," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Spadaro, a Moorpark resident who will coordinate the
signature-gathering effort, said volunteers will fan out to shopping
centers, neighborhoods and churches with petitions in hand.</TE>
<TE>   In general, only 80% of signatures collected on election petitions
are verifiable, Bradley said.</TE>

<HD>Boroughs Proposal Advances to City's Neighborhoods Panel</HD>
<DH>Government: Critics say the councilwomen's plan is too
vague and is mainly intended to confuse voters while deciding on
secession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to decentralize Los Angeles government by creating a
system of boroughs to make local decisions is expected to move
forward today, but critics say it is too vague to offer real change.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members Janice Hahn and Wendy Greuel said Monday that
under their plan, voters would decide whether to establish a borough
system for Los Angeles, and then a commission appointed by the
council, mayor and other elected officials would work out the details
of how the system would operate.</LD>
<LD>   Their proposal does not go nearly as far as an option developed by
former California Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who has
recommended abolishing the City Council and replacing it with nine
elected borough chiefs from various parts of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Greuel and Hahn said they expect their proposal to win two of
three votes on the Education and Neighborhoods Committee this
afternoon. If their measure eventually wins the backing of a council
majority and of the electorate, it would give borough governments
"authority over local issues, including budgeting, land use and
delivery of services," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   It is designed to answer concerns about whether Los Angeles is too
big to be governed as a single entity--concerns that are helping fuel
movements for independence by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood.
Critics, however, said it principally is intended to sidetrack a vote
on secession by offering voters a confusing alternative to breaking
up the city.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposal went on to be approved by the City Council next
week, a borough commission would be appointed within the month and a
charter amendment mandating the creation of boroughs would be placed
on the ballot in November, along with the cityhood questions for the
Valley and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   But the Greuel/Hahn plan does not say how many boroughs would be
established, how they would be governed or whether their governments
would be elected or appointed. It also does not say whether their
authority would be binding--or whether the City Council would have
veto power over borough decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Under Hertzberg's plan, each borough would be run by a council of
five elected officials, who would choose a president from among them.
The boroughs would have binding power over local decisions, including
land-use authority over many proposed developments.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, whom Greuel said she has asked to serve on the borough
commission if the council supports the motion, declined to comment on
the plan other than to say he hopes it leads to broad reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful that it will lead to a system that creates local
control and brings government closer to the people," Hertzberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and Greuel did change their proposal in one key area as a
result of discussions with Hertzberg: They originally wanted borough
governments to be appointed, and therefore under state law purely
advisory.</TE>
<TE>   Now that language has been omitted, and the commission could
theoretically set up boroughs that elect their own governments, which
would allow them more power.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Close, who heads the pro-secession group Valley VOTE
and supports making a separate city from the San Fernando Valley,
said the proposal is a fraud, designed to trick voters into thinking
that their concerns are being addressed by City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were serious about boroughs, they would adopt the
Hertzberg plan," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   By leaving the details to be worked out by a handpicked
commission, Close said, the City Council and mayor would assure that
they don't have to give up real power to borough leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn and Greuel said a more radical proposal would not have
won enough votes on the mostly skeptical council to be placed on the
ballot at all.</TE>
<TE>   Any plan to create a borough system is expected to have trouble
winning support from the council, many of whose members believe
secession will be defeated without it.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Greuel said she is certain only of "six or seven" votes
for her plan--not quite the eight needed for passage in the 15-member
body.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the council agreed to place the measure on the ballot in
November, it is not clear if Mayor James K. Hahn, who has veto power,
would approve.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has refused to take a position on boroughs, other than
to say he believes the city's newly created system of neighborhood
councils should be given a chance to work.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has been so cool on the plan that Janice Hahn, his
sister, was reluctant to predict whether he would support it. "Oh
God," she said Monday, "I hope he doesn't veto this."</TE>

<HD>Simon Slams Davis Over the Military</HD>
<DH>Campaign: GOP gubernatorial candidate says the state's
National Guard units need more support and training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. charged Monday that
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has allowed the state's National Guard to
deteriorate during the last four years, and said he could do a better
job looking out for the units.</LD>
<LD>   Countering, Davis defended his record and suggested that he is
better equipped to handle the National Guard's needs, in part because
he served in the military while Simon did not.</LD>
<LD>   Standing outside the U.S. Naval Station on Treasure Island, with
the steel-girded San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the background,
Simon said that the National Guard's facilities and equipment are
inadequate, and that many of the 21,000 troops are insufficiently
trained.</LD>
<TE>   "The men and women of the California National Guard have earned
our gratitude and our respect for their willingness to serve," Simon
said. "While they enjoy the admiration of the public, they have not
received the support they deserve in the form of training and
equipment from their leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's criticism prompted a sharp rebuttal from the commanding
officer of the California National Guard, Gen. Paul D. Monroe Jr.,
who said that while the state volunteer corps needs twice the federal
funding that it currently receives, the troops are in excellent form.</TE>
<TE>   "The National Guard's readiness has gone up over the last four
years," said Monroe, who has commanded the state's troops since 1999.
"If we were not prepared, the Army and the Air Force would not take
our units."</TE>
<TE>   Davis dismissed Simon's remarks, saying his challenger was
undermining the work of the National Guard with his comments. And in
his own comments as well as a new ad, the governor attempted to turn
the military issue to his own favor, calling attention to his own
service and contrasting it with Simon's lack of a military record.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon does a great disservice to the country," the governor
said during a visit to the Islamic Center of Southern California. "He
did not serve in the Armed Forces himself, as I did, and now he does
a disservice to the National Guard."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the governor released a new television commercial
emphasizing his military experience in Vietnam, for which he was
awarded a Bronze Star. The ad, which is being shown in Northern
California and the Central Valley, also notes that Simon did not vote
in 13 out of 20 elections since he registered in California in 1992,
and that he will not release his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that he's choosing to run a campaign based on
negative ads," Simon spokesman Mark Miner said. "He's been in office
for four years and he has nothing to show for it."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's news conference Monday was the first in a weeklong series
of appearances he plans to make throughout the state talking about
homeland security, including a speech scheduled for today in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   During his appearance at Treasure Island, Simon was joined by
retired Maj. Gen. Frank J. Schober Jr., who commanded the National
Guard from 1975 to 1984. Schober, who now lives in New Mexico,
criticized Davis for ignoring the needs of the Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Schober's warnings should be heeded.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last four years, there have been plenty of photo
opportunities ... but there has been precious little action," Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>   The businessman pointed to a state audit released in February
showing that 17 out of 29 of the Army National Guard's helicopters in
the state were inoperable in December because of delayed maintenance.
In addition, the audit found that several Guard units had overstated
the number of soldiers available for deployment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, this spring the National Guard removed some soldiers
posted at Bay Area bridges who had failed a basic weapons test.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe said that while the Army has grounded many of the Guard's
Vietnam-era helicopters for safety reasons, the majority of its
equipment, such as trucks and tanks, were purchased in the last two
years. The California National Guard receives nearly all its money
from the federal government. Annually, that comes to about $480
million, and the Guard is getting authorization for new helicopters
and other needed equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are much better than we were, and we're getting better all the
time," Monroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would be more effective than Davis in getting money
for training and maintenance of the Guard from the federal
government. He also proposed new incentives to encourage people to
join the Guard, including fee waivers at state universities and
colleges and better pay for Guard troops on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not say how he would pay for the incentives, except to
suggest that private businesses could make up the difference in
salary when their employees were called to duty in exchange for tax
incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of employers that I'm quite sure would consider
that," said the GOP candidate, who manages an investment firm. "And I
would be one of them, myself."</TE>
<TE>   Davis noted that he already signed legislation this year allowing
state workers to receive compensation for any salary lost while on
active duty.</TE>
<TE>   "As usual," he said, "Mr. Simon is a dollar short and a day late."</TE>

<LD>A Palestinian man who lived in Orange County for two decades will be
sentenced to up to six years behind bars after pleading guilty to
making threats aboard an aircraft while in the custody of INS agents
taking him to a detention facility in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammad Mahmoud Bachir, 43, admitted in federal court Friday that
he resisted boarding the flight at Los Angeles International Airport
in February and threatened to try to make the plane crash.</LD>
<LD>   Bachir had been in custody off and on since losing his status as a
legal resident after he was convicted in 1995 of parental abduction
for taking his son to Lebanon during a dispute with his American-born
wife, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Owens said.</LD>
<TE>   An immigration judge then ordered Bachir deported to Lebanon,
where he was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee camp, but that
country refused to take him because he is not Lebanese. "He is a
stateless person," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   Bachir, who has worked as an accountant and operated a video store
in Anaheim, remained in INS custody for more than three years before
being released last year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
nondeportable detainees cannot be jailed indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   He was then picked up again by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in January for violating conditions of his release,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, the agency attempted to transfer him to a detention
facility in Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Shackled at the hands and feet, Bachir kicked and struggled with
four INS agents as they led him onto the Northwest Airlines aircraft,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Bachir screamed that he was a terrorist and would blow the plane
up, prosecutors said. In his plea agreement, Bachir admitted that he
yelled words to the effect, "I will crash this plane if I have the
chance. I don't care if this airplane goes down."</TE>
<TE>   Bachir's outbursts alarmed crew members, who asked the agents to
remove him from the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Bachir is set to be sentenced Sept. 30 by U.S. District Judge
Lourdes Baird in Los Angeles for resisting an officer and for his
statements threatening the flight.</TE>

<HD>African Leaders Pinning Hopes on New Union</HD>
<DH>Alliance: The successor to the Organization of African
Unity debuts today. Supporters are counting on it to boost democracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>It is being billed as Africa's best attempt to save the world's
poorest continent from the blight of conflict and underdevelopment,
but the launch of the new African Union today comes amid mixed
reviews.</LD>
<LD>   African leaders are placing big hopes on the bloc of 53 countries,
saying that by this joining of forces, the continent will have more
political, economic and military clout and will eventually be taken
more seriously.</LD>
<LD>   "The forward march toward democracy and good governance is
unstoppable and irreversible," South African Deputy President Jacob
Zuma told foreign ministers and diplomats gathered last week in the
port city of Durban, where all 53 heads of state were expected to
convene for today's launch.</LD>
<TE>   Though supporters have hailed the African Union's tough mandate to
promote democracy and respect for human rights, some political
observers have warned that poverty, corruption, lawlessness and a
multitude of wars racking Africa could undermine the union's success.</TE>
<TE>   Given the typically slow process of getting anything done in
Africa, it could take years for the African Union, or AU, to make an
impact, critics say. And they warn that the pro-democracy institution
will eventually face resistance from member countries that remain
intent on defying democratic principles.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, they fear, the AU will simply be old wine in new
bottles.</TE>
<TE>   The AU will formally replace the almost 40-year-old Ethiopia-based
Organization of African Unity, which nurtured African liberation from
colonial rule but saw its effectiveness decline amid an onslaught of
financial and administrative woes.</TE>
<TE>   The AU will consist of four branches: an assembly composed of
heads of state, an executive council of foreign ministers, a
committee of ambassadors and a secretariat. At a later stage, a
pan-African parliament, a court of justice and a central bank are to
be launched.</TE>
<TE>   "The AU is more ambitious, in the positive sense, than the OAU,"
said Eddie Maloka, director of the Africa Institute, a Pretoria,
South Africa-based think tank. "It wants to address the weaknesses of
the OAU. It has the potential to address pertinent problems of the
continent."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the OAU, the AU's Peace and Security Council will have the
right to intervene in the internal affairs of member states to stop
human rights abuses, war crimes and genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The OAU was criticized for failing to intercede in the 1994 ethnic
slaughter in Rwanda and for its inability to defuse conflicts in
Congo, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s and 1970s, observers say, when many African states
succumbed to authoritarian rule and military dictatorship, the OAU's
response was simply to turn a blind eye.</TE>
<TE>   "It was for many years a toothless organization," said Jakkie
Cilliers, executive director of the Institute for Security Studies in
Pretoria. "Its main focus was freeing Africa from colonialism and
apartheid. That was finally achieved in 1994 [with the end of
apartheid]. Now the future challenges are the issues of stability and
development."</TE>
<TE>   Confidence in a Pledge</TE>
<TE>   Other observers expressed confidence that the African Union will
be different. Madagascar, for example, has been barred from joining
the AU after a disputed election there, under the organization's
pledge to deal decisively with illegitimate regimes.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues of peace, security and democracy should be dealt with
in a more decisive manner now, because Africans cannot afford to lose
any more time," OAU Assistant Secretary-General Said Djinnit told
reporters in Durban last week.</TE>
<TE>   Many are anxiously waiting to see how the AU will deal with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, whom many local and international
observers accused of rigging the country's presidential election in
March. The OAU endorsed the poll results.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwe "will ultimately be the test case for the African Union,"
Cilliers said. "Will they really be prepared to put on the agenda a
country that has stolen an election? My feeling is no. They are busy
trying to push a whole continent ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign diplomats have raised concerns that the AU might adopt the
OAU's style of defending state sovereignty and even authoritarian
rule because of a rigid adherence to consensus.</TE>
<TE>   In one case that will be closely watched, Daniel Arap Moi, Kenya's
president for nearly a quarter of a century, has not made clear
whether he will attempt to prolong his rule.</TE>
<TE>   "The political culture of African governance, characterized by the
'elite sovereignty' of ruling parties in the continent's 53 states,
is going to take a long time to change," Francis Kornegay, program
coordinator at the Center for Africa's International Relations at
University of the Witwatersrand, wrote in a recent opinion piece in
South Africa's Business Day newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Reluctance among some African leaders to hold one another
accountable could hamper the AU's economic rescue plan--the New
Partnership for Africa's Development, or NEPAD--because it requires
leaders to do exactly that in order to win foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   Under that program, countries that failed to comply with the rules
of economic integrity and good governance would face punitive
measures, such as the denial of transportation and communication
links with other member states, said Maloka, the Africa Institute
specialist. NEPAD anticipates that, if successful, it will generate
$64 billion in investment a year.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's most likely that countries that are really committed to
the NEPAD process will want to see the AU succeed, so they will throw
their weight behind the group," Maloka said.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers caution that lack of readily available cash could
slow the African Union's moves toward economic integration.</TE>
<TE>   The OAU is still owed an estimated $50 million, more than its
operating budget, because fewer than one-third of its members have
paid their dues. Hopes for a common African currency remain a pipe
dream.</TE>
<TE>   'No Easy Solution'</TE>
<TE>   "There is no easy solution to the problems of Africa," said
Cilliers. "Expecting more than a symbolic change is expecting quite a
lot. It's going to take a long time for the union to be in a position
to make a substantive impact on anything."</TE>
<TE>   The OAU's main diplomatic achievement in recent years was helping
to end a two-year border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many are
confident that this is the type of accomplishment the AU will be able
to emulate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a clear acceptance of African ownership of its own
destiny," Cilliers observed. "Until recently, the game in town was
the blame game. We blamed everybody else for our problems. The
debates now are about governance, about democracy and taking
responsibility."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Could Slash Work Force</HD>
<DH>Africa: Sub-Saharan countries might lose 25% of their labor
by 2020, a U.N. official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>A top U.N. health official warned Monday that some African countries
could lose a quarter of their work force to AIDS in the next 20
years.</LD>
<LD>   The 14th International AIDS Conference began its first full day
with scientific briefings and updates on the disease, which officials
say is now the worst epidemic ever faced by mankind.</LD>
<LD>   Bernhard Schwartlander, director of the HIV/AIDS department of the
World Health Organization, said more than 20% of adults in seven
sub-Saharan African countries are infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. In Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, the rate
is one in three.</LD>
<TE>   He warned that the loss of workers due to AIDS could stunt
economic growth and undermine key sectors of society in the worst-hit
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "By 2020, more than 25% of the work force in some countries may be
lost to AIDS," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Already in Kenya, AIDS accounts for up to three of every four
deaths in the police force, while Swaziland would have to train
13,000 new teachers over the next 17 years to maintain services.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. AIDS agency warned last week that the epidemic is still
in its infancy and could kill 70 million people over the next 20
years as it spreads deeper into Asia and Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   While antiretroviral drugs make HIV/AIDS manageable for many
people in rich Western countries, the disease claims millions of
lives in poor countries, where few can afford the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS activists are calling for drug prices to be slashed and for
antiretrovirals to be made available to at least 2 million people in
developing countries within the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Many speakers condemned a poor response to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's Global AIDS fund to raise money to fight the epidemic.
Less than $3 billion of its $10-billion goal has been raised.</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Thai Trial for AIDS Vaccine Slated</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The joint $36-million effort will be the largest
yet. Also, a California company says its vaccine could be available
by 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>The U.S. and Thai governments will shortly begin the largest trial
yet of a preventive AIDS vaccine, testing a combination of vaccines
on more than 16,000 subjects in the general Thai population,
researchers from the two countries announced here Monday at the 14th
International AIDS Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The trial, originally sponsored in a slightly different form by
the Defense Department, was canceled in February. After a small
reconfiguration to change its goals, the $36-million effort will now
be funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, which has taken over the AIDS programs formerly operated by
the military.</LD>
<LD>   There has been much debate over when new candidates should be
tested and what criteria should be used, said NIAID director Dr.
Anthony Fauci. "But at the end of the day, we have to have candidates
in trials. Even if they fail, we will learn things that are very
important."</LD>
<TE>   In another development, Brisbane, Calif., biotechnology company
VaxGen Inc. said a commercial AIDS vaccine could be available by 2005
if two major trials now nearing completion are successful.</TE>
<TE>   Although data from VaxGen's trials of 7,900 subjects will not be
available until early 2003, experts said the mere fact that the
trials were successfully carried out represents a substantial step
forward in the quest to control the AIDS virus, which is expected to
have infected 110 million people by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Critics had argued that it would not be possible to complete the
study because of the difficulties involved in monitoring large
numbers of high-risk patients for three years or longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the fact that they pulled this off is reason for optimism,"
said Dr. Carl Dieffenbach of the NIAID.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, critics cautioned that AIDS vaccines have offered
high promises in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have been searching for an AIDS vaccine since the
syndrome was first recognized 21 years ago. "An effective vaccine is
our only hope of stemming the epidemic," said Sandra L. Thurman,
president of the International AIDS Trust.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 candidate vaccines have already been put through
phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, designed to test safety and
determine whether the candidates have any effect. Eight are currently
undergoing such trials.</TE>
<TE>   The VaxGen product, called AIDSVax, was the first to enter phase 3
trials, the final large trials required before a new drug or vaccine
can be approved by a regulatory agency.</TE>
<TE>   AIDSVax is a classic vaccine very much like those used to control
polio, measles and a host of other infectious diseases. Viral surface
proteins produced by genetic engineering techniques are administered
to stimulate production of antibodies that will attack viruses before
they can invade cells.</TE>
<TE>   "Antibodies protect against viral infection, we know that," said
Dr. Donald P. Francis, president of VaxGen. "Everyone who gets the
vaccine develops an immune response. The question is, does it last
long enough and provide protection?"</TE>
<TE>   VaxGen is sponsoring two trials, one in North America and the
Netherlands involving 5,400 people who are at risk of contracting the
virus through sexual transmission, and one in Thailand involving
2,500 intravenous drug abusers. In each group, half receive the
vaccine and half a placebo. The three-year project has involved 1,000
workers, 127,408 blood samples and about 1.3 million paper forms,
Francis said--enough to form a stack "30 feet taller than the Statue
of Liberty."</TE>
<TE>   Francis said that, despite rumors, VaxGen had received absolutely
no hints about the potential results of the trials. He called the
rumors "hogwash."</TE>
<TE>   What they do know, he added, is that the safety data monitoring
board, which oversees the trials, has said that there are sufficient
numbers of infections in the placebo group to indicate that the
trials will provide a result.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects the vaccine to be 100% successful. But extensive
modeling studies have indicated that even a 30% efficacy rate would
be enough "to drive the epidemic into the ground," Francis said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit of immunity goes a long way," said the NIAID's
Dieffenbach.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a 30% efficacy, I'll be thrilled," Francis said. "Once
we have some efficacy, we can always increase it."</TE>
<TE>   Francis noted that the company has already begun building a
manufacturing facility in anticipation that the trials will prove the
vaccine works.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative approach to AIDS vaccine development--one that
many experts hold higher hopes for--aims to stimulate the production
of white blood cells called cytotoxic lymphocytes that attack and
destroy cells already infected by the virus.</TE>
<TE>   The NIAID's Thai test will use such a vaccine, developed by the
French company Aventis Pasteur and called Alvac-HIV, followed by
administration of AIDSVax. This approach is called "prime-boost"
because the immune system is primed with the first vaccine, then
boosted with the second. That test will be the second phase 3 trial
to take place.</TE>
<TE>   Alvac-HIV is a live-virus vaccine based on the canary pox virus,
which has previously been used in veterinary vaccines and does not
infect humans. Aventis Pasteur researchers have engineered the virus
so that it contains the genes for several proteins that are normally
part of HIV.</TE>
<TE>   The canary pox vaccine has been tested in humans for more than six
years and has been shown to be completely safe, NIAID director Fauci
said. Those tests have suggested that it provides protection, but
that can be determined only in a much larger trial.</TE>
<TE>   The original Defense Department-sponsored trial that was canceled
in February was designed to determine what researchers call
"correlates of immunity"--that is, what changes in the immune system
indicate that vaccination produces protection. But an analysis of the
proposed trial indicated that, as designed, it could not yield that
information.</TE>
<TE>   With slight changes, however, it can determine whether the vaccine
works, he said. "This is an efficacy trial, with those other things
only secondary."</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being conducted in Thailand, which has a long history
of work on an AIDS vaccine, because the prevalence of the disease
there means meaningful results can be obtained relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what the outcome will be," said Dr. Vallop Thaineau
of the Thai Ministry of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   "But we know for sure that we will learn a lot."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>U.N. officials and AIDS activists denounced Asian leaders Monday for
remaining silent in the face of concern that Asia might overtake
Africa as the continent hit hardest by the disease.</LD>
<LD>   "The silence about the epidemic in Asia is even more deafening
than elsewhere," Hakan Bjorkman, an advisor on AIDS to the U.N.
Development Program, said at the 14th International AIDS Conference
in Barcelona.</LD>
<LD>   The news about China and India was particularly distressing,
researchers said. Chinese know very little about AIDS, with nearly
three-quarters of the population unaware that a virus causes the
disease or unable to describe how to avoid becoming infected,
researchers said. About one in six has never heard of the disease.</LD>
<TE>   In India, the number of HIV infections has increased tenfold in a
decade, but almost no one is taking life-sustaining antiretroviral
therapy, even though Indian manufacturers of generic drugs are
rapidly becoming the suppliers of choice to the developing world.</TE>

<LD>Mexico's former ruling party appeared headed for a comeback in
elections in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, dealing a blow to
President Vicente Fox's party.</LD>
<LD>   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was ahead in votes
tallied from Sunday's election for the mayoralty of the state
capital, Tepic, according to partial vote counts. The PRI also led in
13 other cities. Fox's National Action Party, or PAN, led in just
four.</LD>
<LD>   With about 62% of the votes counted, the PRI also appeared likely
to win a majority in the state assembly. The PAN, in a coalition with
other parties, had won Tepic, a majority in the assembly and the
governorship in 1999 elections.</LD>

<LD>Slobodan Milosevic shrugged off accusations of "ethnic cleansing" by
Serbs in 1999 by telling a peace negotiator that ethnic Albanian
refugees from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo had simply gone on a
picnic, his war crimes trial heard.</LD>
<LD>   The ex-Yugoslav president dismissed reports of atrocities in the
province as "nonsense," former Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek told the Hague court.</LD>
<LD>   Refugees spilled into Macedonia and Albania with their meager
possessions loaded on tractors.</LD>
<TE>   "When I confronted Mr. Milosevic with that, he said they were just
picnicking, so I shouldn't be concerned. They were just on a trip
having a picnic," Vollebaek said.</TE>

<HD>Sect Hacked Into TV, China Says</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing accuses outlawed Falun Gong movement of
disrupting broadcasts with images. It vows to punish the spiritual
group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Chinese officials vowed Monday to punish the banned Falun Gong
spiritual movement for allegedly hacking into Chinese satellites to
broadcast its messages on state-run television.</LD>
<LD>   Liu Lihua, China's chief broadcast regulator at the Ministry of
Information Industry, said broadcasters had discovered and traced an
unauthorized signal aimed at the nation's Sinosat 1 satellite.</LD>
<LD>   "We have sufficient evidence to show that this was perpetrated by
the overseas Falun Gong cult organization, manipulated and directed
by Li Hongzhi," he said, referring to the group's U.S.-based leader.
Liu declined to specify the source of the interfering signals.</LD>
<TE>   As Chinese viewers tuned in to the evening news June 23, screens
went black, according to the New China News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with classical Chinese music playing in the background,
images popped up showing tidy rows of Falun Gong practitioners doing
yoga-like exercises in a large public square.</TE>
<TE>   The disruptions continued sporadically for a week, affecting more
than a dozen hours of programming, Liu said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing outlawed the group in 1999 after 10,000 of its members
surrounded the central government compound seeking official
recognition in a peaceful protest.</TE>
<TE>   The electronic intrusion "is extremely despicable and represents
yet another crime committed by Falun Gong," Liu said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the hacking violated international
telecommunications conventions, threatened China's national security
and could disrupt the Sinosat's navigation, meteorological and flood
warning functions.</TE>
<TE>   "They can run, but they cannot hide forever," Liu said. "They will
be subjected to severe punishment according to the law."</TE>
<TE>   An editorial in Friday's Communist Party flagship People's Daily
lambasted the hacking as "a challenge to human civilization."</TE>
<TE>   With many Falun Gong disciples jailed, under surveillance or
driven underground in China, propaganda battles between authorities
and the group have shifted to the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Liu confirmed that Falun Gong disciples had hacked into cable TV
systems in the cities of Changchun and Chongqing this year. Several
group members convicted of the acts were sentenced to prison terms of
up to 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, Falun Gong's information center said followers
had hacked into cable systems seven times and were "revealing the
truth about [Chinese President] Jiang Zemin's persecution of Falun
Gong and demonstrating the true nature of the practice."</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that Falun Gong might hijack broadcasts of Jiang's speech
marking the fifth anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese
sovereignty, China Central Television, or CCTV, scrapped plans for
live coverage of the event, Hong Kong media reported.</TE>
<TE>   When the BBC's World Service channel showed footage of Falun Gong
adherents protesting Jiang's visit in Hong Kong, Beijing cut its
signal, which is also beamed into China from the French-built Sinosat
satellite.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Falun Gong's signal interruption last month
affected nine CCTV channels and 10 provincial channels that are part
of a government project roughly translatable as "Every Village
Wired."</TE>
<TE>   The project aims to expand signal coverage to China's most
isolated and mountainous regions. Before they had television, some
locals did not know who their country's leaders were.</TE>
<TE>   CCTV news previously reported that the project's programming had
helped villagers see through Falun Gong's teachings.</TE>

<HD>Karaoke Club Fire Kills 46 in Indonesia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Police using explosives blew a hole in a nightclub wall to allow
desperate patrons to escape a raging fire that killed at least 46
people in Indonesia's South Sumatra province, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Some people leaped to their deaths from the top of the four-story
karaoke bar in the provincial capital of Palembang as flames engulfed
the roof, police Capt. Arum Prioyono said.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started late Sunday and is believed to have been caused
by faulty wiring. Firefighters extinguished the fire Monday morning.</LD>
<TE>   Officials offered conflicting reports on the number of dead.
Police said this morning they could confirm that 46 people were
killed, but Rudi, a fire brigade official who, like many Indonesians,
uses only one name, said rescuers had retrieved 52 bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Police also said that the bar manager had been detained for
questioning and that they were looking for the owner.</TE>
<TE>   "We're questioning [the manager] as a witness first, but we will
indeed determine if the incident can be linked to the criminal code,"
Prioyono.</TE>
<TE>   Palembang is an industrial city about 250 miles northwest of
Jakarta, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The karaoke bar, in a busy downtown shopping area, did not have
proper fire exits and the only elevator was broken, Prioyono said.
Several of the victims died after jumping from the upper floors to
escape, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of karaoke bars, cinemas, Internet cafes and other
entertainment businesses in Indonesia frequently ignore fire safety
rules or fail to provide emergency exits on the premises.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Dancer Convicted of Corrupting Youth in Iran</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Mohamad Khordadian had returned to visit family.
'We are happy that they didn't kill him,' says an L.A. TV station
owner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>A popular Iranian American dancer who returned to Iran for the first
time since fleeing two decades ago has been convicted of corrupting
the nation's youth through classes and performances he gave in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   A Tehran court prohibited Los Angeles resident Mohamad Khordadian,
46, from leaving Iran for 10 years, barred him from giving dance
classes for the rest of his life and banned him from public
celebrations or weddings of non-relatives for three years. He was
also given a 10-year suspended prison sentence.</LD>
<LD>   After the judgment Sunday, Khordadian was freed from Tehran's Evin
prison and driven away by a family member. The prison sentence may be
imposed at any time if the government deems he has violated the terms
of his release.</LD>
<TE>   Khordadian is a classically trained dancer who studied in Iran
before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and once headed the Niavaran
ballet company in Tehran. Like many artists, he fled after the
revolution, fearing that the nation's strict new moral code would
lead to repression or worse.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in recent years his performances were popular here,
broadcast into Iran via satellite and smuggled into the country on
CD-ROM and video.</TE>
<TE>   At his trial, Khordadian rejected the notion that he was
corrupting youth, and he seemed to express bewilderment at the
charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Dancing does not incite young people to moral corruption,"
Khordadian told the judge at his trial, according to Iranian press
reports. He said dancing was his "job" and could be considered a
"sport."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge said he had seen videos of the performances and
concluded that the charges were warranted. Khordadian could not be
reached for comment Monday and was advised by his lawyer to avoid
publicity for a few days. He has 20 days to file an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Khordadian is innocent. He has done nothing wrong to deserve
punishment. The whole verdict is irrelevant," his lawyer, Abdolrahman
Rasouli, told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' large Iranian community held on to hope that
Khordadian would somehow return to the U.S., said Hooshmand Aghili, a
well-known Iranian singer based in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "All the Persians know his name," Aghili said. "He was very, very
famous. We hope that he can defend himself and ... can get free from
[this] sentence."</TE>
<TE>   Shahram Hashemizadeh, owner of the Los Angeles-based Melli TV
network, said several Iranians had called the station to complain
about the sentence. Some expressed doubts about returning to Iran
because they were afraid they might be arrested as well, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Melli TV, a 24-hour cable and satellite station, often broadcast
Khordadian's performances. The dancer was especially popular during
Persian New Year, which is celebrated in March or April.</TE>
<TE>   Hashemizadeh said he wasn't surprised by the Iranian government's
ruling but was somewhat relieved. "We are very happy that they didn't
kill him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the revolution that toppled the shah of Iran, the newly
formed Islamic Republic tried to distance itself from what it saw as
the shah's un-Islamic excesses. Prostitution, which had been legal,
was prohibited. Alcohol was banned. Women were required to cover
their heads and bodies with loose-fitting gowns in public. Chess,
music and dancing between men and women were prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   Since the early days of the revolution, social restrictions have
eased, partly because the age of Iran's population has dropped and
reformers have come to power, led by President Mohammad Khatami. But
there remains a constant tug of war between hard-liners and
reformers, a struggle for power that often manifests itself in the
social arena. Khordadian was snared in the most recent tussle.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners have reportedly begun a crackdown on what they deem to
be depravity, and special police forces canvass the capital to make
sure women are wearing head scarves and car music is not played too
loud.</TE>
<TE>   "Our patrols are spread across the city to reestablish social
order and against all forms of depravity," Tehran police official
Mohammed Mehdi Sadoughi was quoted as saying in the reformist daily
newspaper Norouz last month.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, women are regularly seen wearing relatively
stylish red over-shirts instead of flowing black chadors. Some even
wear toenail polish and open shoes, something that would have been
unthinkable not long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Khordadian, who has a dance school and troupe in Los Angeles,
reportedly returned to Iran to visit his ailing father and other
relatives. He was arrested in May at Tehran's airport while waiting
for his flight back to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The judiciary that found him guilty of moral corruption is
appointed by the country's hard-line religious hierarchy. In a swipe
at the United States, the court banned Khordadian from leaving Iran
to keep him from a "provocative environment that could lead him to
repeat the offenses," according to press reports here.</TE>

<HD>Bush Reaffirms Stance on Hussein</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The president describes his approach to a 'regime
change' as vigilant but not rushed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday renewed his administration's commitment to
ousting Saddam Hussein as the leader of Iraq, but he left open the
prospect that something short of a second Gulf War could achieve that
goal.</LD>
<LD>   Noting his personal involvement in the military, diplomatic and
financial planning to remove Hussein as Iraq's president, Bush said
he would use ''all the tools'' at his disposal and described his
approach as vigilant but not rushed. His comments came amid leaks of
the details of a developing Pentagon plan for an invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   ''It's the stated policy of this government to have a regime
change. And it hasn't changed,'' Bush told a White House news
conference. ''And there's different ways to do it.... I'm a patient
person.''</LD>
<TE>   Hussein has remained a thorn in the side of the United States
since early 1991, when Bush's father, President George Bush, ended
the Gulf War without sending U.S. troops into Baghdad to remove the
Iraqi leader.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Bush has since authorized clandestine efforts to
remove Hussein, even as his administration is debating a military
effort to oust him. Military analysts say a flicker of hope remains
in some corners that U.S. encouragement could help to foment an
internal revolution that would unseat the Iraqi leader.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the Pentagon favor an Afghanistan-style effort to mingle
air power with indigenous forces among the ethnic Kurds in northern
and southern Iraq, aided by U.S. Army Special Forces troops. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that U.S. diplomats
remain in close contact with Iraqi opposition groups.</TE>
<TE>   Others are skeptical of the Kurds' ability to take on an Iraqi
army that dwarfs the force called forth by the Taliban. Instead, they
have called for a massive attack by conventional infantrymen.</TE>
<TE>   Bush declined to comment on news leaks about a plan for 250,000
U.S. troops to attack Iraq on three fronts from bases in Kuwait, or
to say whether he intended to force a regime change by the end of his
term in 2004. But defense officials and military analysts have
cautioned that the classified plan, dubbed Operation Polo Step and
originally reported in the New York Times, has not been approved by
either Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld or the president and is
merely one of perhaps a dozen proposals circulating.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the failure of talks between Iraqi officials and the
United Nations last week, in which the U.N. sought renewed
inspections of Iraqi weapons facilities, Boucher said Hussein's
government continues to violate the terms of an agreement it entered
at the end of the Gulf War. Intelligence reports suggest that Hussein
is still developing chemical and biological weapons, both of which
are barred.</TE>
<TE>   Any effort to oust Hussein is unlikely this year, analysts say,
because the predominantly Muslim nations the administration wants to
be part of a coalition against Iraq are preoccupied by the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. soldiers remain embroiled in a
dangerous cleanup operation in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   There, American forces continue to seek top Taliban and Al Qaeda
leaders, including the man most wanted by the Pentagon, Osama bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   ''Osama bin Laden, he may be alive. If he is, we'll get him. If
he's not alive, we got him,'' Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Racism Debate Flares in Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Plan to ban sale of land to Arab citizens hits at
heart of the controversy over Zionism versus democracy. Sharon
endorses legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has endorsed a proposed
law that would allow Jews to bar Arab citizens of Israel from
purchasing homes or living in many Israeli communities, a move that
has touched off a divisive national debate.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt to legalize "Jews-only" towns was swiftly criticized
by numerous Israeli politicians and human rights groups, who said it
was a discriminatory and racist proposal. Supporters praised the bill
for protecting what they called the essence of Zionism.</LD>
<LD>   The debate goes to the heart of Israel's existential
contradiction: How can it be both a Jewish state and a democratic
state?</LD>
<TE>   "Israel is the state of the Jewish people," said Cabinet minister
Dan Meridor, who opposed the legislation, "but because it is a Jewish
state, it must not practice against its non-Jewish citizens the kind
of discrimination to which Jews were subjected in the diaspora."</TE>
<TE>   Drafted by members of an ultranationalist right-wing party, the
bill comes in response to a landmark decision by the Israeli Supreme
Court in March 2000 that said Arab citizens were equally entitled to
purchase, lease or live on state-owned land. The court ruled on a
petition from Adel Kaadan, an Israeli Arab who had been turned down
repeatedly in his efforts to buy a home in an all-Jewish community in
the Galilee region of northern Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing and religious parties in Sharon's coalition endorsed
the proposed law in a closed Cabinet session Sunday, with most
members from the center-left Labor Party absent. When it was
publicized Monday, the decision triggered a firestorm.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said his Labor Party would "fight
with all its power against the racist decision"--even if it means
quitting the government.</TE>
<TE>   The bill still faces legal hurdles in the Israeli Knesset, or
parliament, before it becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   Assigning land for Jewish-only housing opens Israel to criticism
at a time when its reputation in the Arab and Muslim worlds is
especially low because of Israel's war with the Palestinians, Meridor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Education Minister Limor Livnat, a member of Sharon's Likud Party
and the legislation's main proponent in the Cabinet, said it was a
mistake to see the decision as racist. Instead, it would protect
Israeli security by helping to ensure a Jewish majority in the
heavily Arab Galilee, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not stem at all from discrimination, rather from the
main basis of Zionism: the return of the Jewish people to its land,"
Livnat said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Zionism is racism, then we are all in trouble," Communications
Minister Reuven Rivlin, also of Likud, told Israeli radio.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to convince the whole world there is no gap between
Judaism and democracy, but when there is a conflict, everyone has to
remember there is only one Jewish state. We have to keep it secure
[for its] future.... This is the state for the Jewish people, not the
state for all its citizens. That has to be obvious."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein opposed the legislation,
saying it was unnecessary and would further strain Jewish-Arab
relations in Israel. If the new measure does become law, it could be
challenged before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million Arabs live in Israel and hold Israeli citizenship,
roughly 20% of the population. They have long complained that
predominantly Arab areas are given inferior state services, their
schools are underfinanced and their roads go unrepaired.</TE>
<TE>   Kaadan, the original plaintiff, works as an emergency room nurse
in a hospital in the Israeli city of Hadera. He was eager to escape
the poverty and neglect of his Israeli Arab hometown, Baqa al
Gharbiya, where his three daughters had to walk in streets filled
with sewage and attend a school contaminated with asbestos. But the
governing board of nearby Kazir, a town of manicured lawns and neat
fences, repeatedly rejected Kaadan's application to purchase a plot.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of the Assn. for Civil Rights in Israel, Kaadan sued
in 1995. Five years later, the high court ruled in his favor, citing
Israel's declaration of independence, which enshrines social and
political equality regardless of religion, and declaring that the
state cannot discriminate between Jews and Arabs in the allocation of
land.</TE>
<TE>   The state controls most of the land in Israel. Most non-urban land
is distributed by the government or government-designated agencies;
the ruling does not apply to the sale of private property in most
cities.</TE>
<TE>   With its ruling, the court challenged the very land-distribution
policy on which the Jewish state was founded more than half a century
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The right, led by Knesset member Haim Druckman of the National
Religious Party, quickly vowed to write a law that would bypass the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their legal victory, Kaadan and his family still have not
been allowed to move to Kazir. Speaking Monday in reaction to the
Cabinet's endorsement of the proposed law, Kaadan expressed
disappointment and accused the ministers of forgetting the lessons of
equality and coexistence espoused by the founders of Zionism.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Herzl didn't mind having an Arab minister," Kaadan said,
referring to Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl.</TE>
<TE>   The head of Kazir's governing board, Dubi Sandrov, said the
community was trying to preserve its Jewish character. He told
Israeli radio that "political elements," including members of an
Israel-based Islamic movement, were trying to settle Arabs in Kazir
"to push the Jewish population out."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Ring Suspect Is at Siberia Home</HD>
<DH>Russia: Alexandr Afonin, wanted by the FBI in a Los Angeles
case, says he's not hiding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A Russian businessman who is the target of a worldwide FBI
manhunt--and a suspected member of a kidnapping ring responsible for
the slaying of five Los Angeles County residents--is living openly
and quietly in his hometown in Siberia.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not hiding," Alexandr Afonin said in a telephone interview
from his home in Barnaul, where he runs a hodgepodge of businesses,
including a film shop and a bodyguard service. "I can be found right
here in Barnaul.... So far no one has approached me from any law
enforcement agency."</LD>
<LD>   According to FBI affidavits, Afonin, 41, oversaw the transfer of
$234,000 in ransom money, some of which went to bank accounts
controlled by suspects in the slaying of the five victims, whose
bodies were pulled from a Northern California reservoir in October
and March. They are believed to be the victims of a brutal kidnapping
ring that targeted wealthy businessmen in the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<TE>   In a 45-minute interview, Afonin acknowledged arranging the money
transfers but described his actions as a misguided effort to do a
favor for an acquaintance. He also expressed remorse that two
business associates who carried out the bank transfers on his behalf
have spent six months in custody in Los Angeles on charges of
conspiring in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They never committed any crime. They did what they did because I
asked them to," Afonin said. "I didn't commit any crime, either. I
just made a mistake, a terrible mistake. I trusted people I hardly
knew and shouldn't have trusted."</TE>
<TE>   Manhunt Still On</TE>
<TE>   Afonin acknowledged that he has not sought contact with U.S. law
enforcement officials to clear his name and those of his associates.
He has simply kept his head down and has canceled trips outside
Russia, which has no extradition treaty with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. authorities ask the Russian authorities to hand me
over, I hope our authorities will be reasonable about it," he said.
"In any case, I am not hiding, I am not running away."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, FBI spokesman Matthew McLaughlin said Monday that
Afonin was still the target of an international manhunt. A warrant
for his arrest has been entered into the Interpol databank,
McLaughlin said, adding that the FBI believes that Russian
authorities have been cooperating in seeking his capture.</TE>
<TE>   But Russian law enforcement officials said they were not seeking
Afonin. "We have no information about this case here," said Sergei
Shtin, spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Siberia's Altai
Territory, of which Barnaul is the capital. "We have received no
orders or instructions about it."</TE>
<TE>   Two suspects in the case--Iouri Mikhel, 37, and Jurijus Kadamovas,
35--are accused of running the kidnapping ring and have been charged
with conspiracy and hostage-taking resulting in death. Facing similar
charges are alleged accomplices Petro Krylov, 29; Natalya Solovyeva,
26; and Aleksejus Markovskis, 32.</TE>
<TE>   All five suspects are in custody in Los Angeles and face the death
penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The victims whose bodies were found in the reservoir have been
identified as Beverly Hills businessman and would-be film producer
George Safiev, his associate Nick Kharabadze, their bookkeeper Rita
Pekler, North Hollywood businessman Alexander Umansky and real estate
developer Meyer Muscatel. All except Muscatel were emigrants from the
former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   In federal court in Los Angeles on Monday, charges of receiving
ransom money were dropped against Afonin's associates, Andrei Liapine
and Andrei Agueev, Russian nationals who had been living in the
United Arab Emirates. The men have been named as material witnesses
in the remaining criminal case, however, and will remain in custody
until they give their depositions Aug. 1-2. The government may then
move to deport the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev, 34, and Liapine, 41, were arrested by Emirates authorities
in January and flown to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview, a shackled Agueev said he wasn't necessarily
angry with the way he was treated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at the beginning," he said. "But I've kind of gotten used
to it."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI believes that the men are the only witnesses who can
authenticate bank records that show the path of ransom payments made
by Umansky's family. It also believes that the pair will help link
Afonin to defendants Mikhel and Kadamovas.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev's attorney, Victor Sherman, said he was able to show that
there was insufficient evidence to charge them with any crime. He
said that neither Liapine or Agueev profited from the money transfers
and neither knew where the money came from.</TE>
<TE>   It Started With Dinner</TE>
<TE>   According to Afonin, his involvement with the alleged kidnappers
began at a dinner party in a Moscow restaurant last summer, when he
made the acquaintance of a former model named Marina Abramkina, who
also uses the surname Karagodina.</TE>
<TE>   Abramkina told Afonin that she was planning to marry a Russian
immigrant in the United States named Mikhel, whom she described as
being in "the gambling business." She told Afonin that Mikhel needed
to wire some money to China, the United Arab Emirates or Turkey and
asked if he knew anyone who could help for a commission.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Afonin recounted, he was operating a tourism and
cargo company in the Emirates called Saisan Cargo, and he agreed to
help in return for a 10% commission.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, Afonin said, he again assisted Abramkina by
enlisting the help of two old acquaintances from Barnaul: Agueev,
owner of a building materials export company and a customer of his
cargo company, and Liapine, former general manager of Saisan Cargo,
which Afonin had closed down. Agueev agreed to let the money be
transferred to his company's business account, then pass it on to
Liapine, who would wire it elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Agueev received four wire transfers
between Dec. 22, 2001, and Jan. 7 totaling about $234,000. He turned
over the money in cash and personal checks to Liapine, who then used
a Thomas Cook office to wire some of the money to accounts in Latvia
and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 15, Agueev and Liapine were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "To think what these people have gone through because of my
mistake," Afonin said. "They didn't do anything bad."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Agueev, Emirates police detained his wife, Irina
Agueeva, and their three children. In an interview from her home in
the Emirates, Agueeva said police also sent two of her sons, aged 13
and 8, to juvenile jail.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they took my children to a 'playroom.' I didn't
understand right away that there was no playroom at a police
station," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She and her third son, age 3, were transferred to an overcrowded
female detention facility. They spent six nights sleeping on the
floor of a corridor with about two dozen Russian prostitutes, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   They were released after a week because she argued that her
youngest son suffers from phenylketonuria, a metabolic disease
requiring strict diet control.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Afonin suggested that he was not culpable in the
case because the transactions were made through banks. He said he
spoke to Mikhel only three times, although he communicated frequently
with Abramkina.</TE>
<TE>   "I had every right to feel safe about this deal," he said. "It was
all about official bank transfers, no suitcases full of dirty money.
How could I imagine that those immigrants were so stupid that they
would wire the ransom money via a bank transfer? It is so easily
traceable, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Abramkina has been living in London, according to attorney
Sherman, who briefly represented Mikhel until the court ruled he
could not take him as a client along with Agueev.</TE>
<TE>   In Barnaul, Afonin says he is spending his time running his
company, Technics, which recently started a new publishing arm.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll laugh, but I'm now the publisher of Kriminfo [Criminal
Information]," he said. "I know all the people from the regional law
enforcement press offices."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kriminfo's Web site, the editor in chief is a retired
police colonel and the journal enjoys "permanent cooperation with ...
former and active members of law enforcement agencies."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met with Palestinian Finance
Minister Salam Fayed on Monday in the first Cabinet-level meeting
between an Israeli and a Palestinian in four months.</LD>
<LD>   Yoram Dori, a spokesman for Peres, said the meeting lasted about
an hour and covered economic issues. Fayed said that this was a
preparatory meeting and that he expected "more expanded meetings will
be held in the future between us."</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had given the
go-ahead for the meeting on the condition that the deliberations not
touch on peace issues.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Army Radio said Fayed and Peres discussed transferring to
the Palestinian Authority tax revenues that Israel has collected from
Palestinian workers. Israel has frozen the funds during the current
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Palestinian official said Interior Minister Abdel-Razak
Yehiyeh would also see Peres in the next 24 hours.</TE>

<HD>Pakistanis Admit to Role in Car Bombing</HD>
<DH>Asia: Commandos arrest three militants. Two speak to media
of U.S. Consulate attack.</DH>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Paramilitary commandos stormed houses in this port city Monday and
arrested three members of a banned militant group suspected in a
bombing outside the U.S. Consulate last month.</LD>
<LD>   The three are members of Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi, Maj. Gen.
Salahuddin Satti said. The organization is a splinter group of
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen, an extremist group whose members fought in
Afghanistan, provincial police chief Syed Kamal Shah said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they also seized large quantities of explosives
and weapons, which were displayed at a news conference Monday evening
along with two of the accused men, who admitted their guilt in the
June 14 bombing, which killed at least 12 Pakistanis.</LD>
<TE>   The two admitted their involvement and said the car bomb used
outside the consulate had originally been prepared for Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf. The men--identified as Mohammed Imran and
Mohammed Hanif--said they tried to detonate the bomb near Musharraf's
motorcade in Karachi in April, but the remote control malfunctioned.</TE>
<TE>   "I, along with my other friends, were involved in the U.S.
bombing," said Hanif. "One of our friends, who was willing to be a
suicide bomber, carried out the attack."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Flee Leading Turkish Party</HD>
<DH>Politics: Defections by 23 officials leave Bulent Ecevit's
government hanging by a thread. Efforts to join the EU may be
threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>This country's fragile coalition government teetered on the brink of
collapse Monday after three Cabinet ministers and 20 lawmakers bolted
from the party led by ailing Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.</LD>
<LD>   The defections are likely to undermine Turkey's efforts to carry
out wide-ranging reforms that the European Union has demanded as a
precondition for launching membership talks and to stall efforts to
end a crippling recession.</LD>
<LD>   The wave of resignations from Ecevit's Democratic Left Party began
when Deputy Prime Minister Husamettin Ozkan, until recently the prime
minister's closest aide, said he was leaving the government and his
party.</LD>
<TE>   If more than 59 legislators leave Ecevit's party, the three-way
coalition would lose its parliamentary majority and the government
would collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Ozkan, who is widely credited with bridging differences within the
fractious government, quit over growing differences with Ecevit and
the prime minister's highly influential wife, Rahsan. Ecevit was
reportedly angered that Ozkan had given his tacit backing to a
growing number of politicians, business leaders and commentators who
have urged Ecevit to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit's Grip Weakens</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit's illnesses, which include an intestinal problem, blood
clots in his legs and a neurological disorder, have steadily weakened
his grip on the government and his party.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, during his most recent public appearance--the
first in more than a month--the prime minister was at pains to form
intelligible sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit is widely blamed for the current political crisis because
he has ignored calls to name a successor as party leader.</TE>
<TE>   Economy Minister Kemal Dervis is seen by many as the best man for
the job. The snag is that he isn't a member of parliament, which
rules him out as prime minister under the Turkish Constitution.
Another contender is Ismail Cem, Turkey's popular foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are seen as well positioned to steer the country out of
its worst recession since 1945 and to help push through a deal on the
divided island of Cyprus that would ease Turkey's entry into the EU.</TE>
<TE>   But Ecevit insists that he must lead the country until April 2004,
when general elections are next scheduled. "The love of power
overtook [his] love for Turkey," said Hakan Tartan, one of the
defecting lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is watching the crisis in Turkey with
mounting concern. The country is the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's sole Muslim-majority member and Israel's closest
regional ally. With its embrace of secularism, Turkey's strategic
value has increased in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Turkey assumed command of the international peacekeeping
force in Kabul, the Afghan capital, clinching its role as a committed
U.S. ally.</TE>
<TE>   "It is in Turkey's interests and our interests that the country
remains stable," said a Western diplomat who declined to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   The government, an awkward coalition of left- and right-wing
parties, had until recently been praised by the International
Monetary Fund and Western governments for enacting sweeping economic
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   But cracks began to emerge in recent months as the
ultranationalist wing of the government opposed moves to lift
existing bans on broadcasting and education in the Kurdish language
and to abolish the death penalty in line with European Union demands.</TE>
<TE>   Ultranationalists Gain</TE>
<TE>   With Monday's defections, the ultranationalists overtook Ecevit's
party to become the largest in the 550-member parliament, with 127
seats, and will play a key role in shaping any future government.</TE>
<TE>   Ultranationalist leader Devlet Bahceli appeared to rule out
forming a new government when he said last weekend that the country
should go to the polls to clear the "prevailing atmosphere of
uncertainty." On Monday, the main opposition True Path Party
presented a motion to parliament calling for elections Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "This government is unraveling as we speak," Sevket Bulent
Yahnici, a prominent ultranationalist lawmaker, said in a telephone
interview. "Early elections have become inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   That prospect is as troubling for Turkey's influential and
fiercely secular military leaders as it is for the United States.
According to recent polls, Istanbul's Islamist former mayor, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, and his party would bag the largest number of votes.</TE>
<TE>   The same polls indicate that none of the ruling-coalition parties
could individually muster the minimum 10% of the national vote needed
to win seats in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan has faced a host of legal problems over claims that he
incited religious fundamentalism during his term as mayor. In 1998,
he was forced to quit his mayoral post over those charges and spent
four months in jail for reciting a nationalist poem--taught in
Turkish state schools--that was deemed as inciting religious hatred.
Erdogan has since sought to portray himself as a moderate who doesn't
believe in mixing religion with politics. But he has failed to
impress the generals, who say he cannot be trusted to lead the
country.</TE>

<HD>Officer Relieved of Duty in Inglewood Beating</HD>
<DH>Violence: The three-year veteran was videotaped during
incident at gas station with 16-year-old. Airing of tape on TV
prompts investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Inglewood police officer was relieved of duty Monday after
television broadcast a videotape of him lifting a limp, handcuffed
teenager by his clothes, smashing his head on a car trunk and then
punching him in the face.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for Donovan Jackson, 16, described the slender youth
as particularly vulnerable, saying that he is developmentally
handicapped, a special education student who has no arrest record and
who did not understand what was happening.</LD>
<LD>   While Jackson paid for fuel at an Inglewood gas station, two
sheriff's deputies approached his father Saturday evening about the
expired license plates on his 1997 Ford Taurus. Jackson returned to
the car, and the two deputies ordered him to drop the potato chips he
was eating and to put his hands on the vehicle, said Jackson's
lawyer, Joe Hopkins.</LD>
<TE>   A struggle ensued. Jackson's family says the boy did not provoke
the scuffle. Law enforcement officers say he was combative.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins and Jackson's family members say race was a factor in the
encounter, that Jackson's father was questioned because he is African
American.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Deputy Steve Jauch said race was irrelevant: "Race had
nothing to do with the stop. We are prohibited from stopping people
based on race."</TE>
<TE>   The videotape aired on television, shot by a bystander, shows a
portion of the event. In a rawness reminiscent of the 1991 Rodney
King beating, it captures an Inglewood police officer slamming the
teen onto the police car and then striking him with a closed fist.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Los Angeles County district attorney's office have
opened investigations into the fray. The Inglewood officer, Jeremy
Morse, a three-year veteran of the Inglewood Police Department, will
continue receiving pay while his department and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department also launch separate investigations, said
law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The incident is being taken very seriously," said Lt. Eve Irvine,
spokeswoman for the Inglewood police.</TE>
<TE>   Images from the gas station's surveillance camera will be reviewed
to determine what happened, Irvine said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy and three law enforcement officers were treated and
released Saturday from a local hospital. The boy's right eye was
bloodied and his throat bruised after he was choked with a chain he
wore, his attorney said. Morse suffered cuts on his knee, elbow and
ear, Irvine said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was booked on suspicion of assaulting a police officer,
and was later released.</TE>
<TE>   "We want this police officer fired and prosecuted," said Najee Ali
of Project Islamic HOPE, a community activist group. "This is another
Rodney King beating; it's not a matter of race, it's a matter of
police culture."</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn called the footage "very
disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   But "it doesn't resemble Rodney King," he said, "because you don't
have four or five officers beating this one young man. What I saw was
one officer .... The only concern I have at this point is to see
justice is done. One officer's conduct is not going to destroy this
city."</TE>
<TE>   After viewing the videotape, attorney Thomas E. Beck, many of
whose clients claimed to be victims of police abuse, said, "The
officer was being physically and unnecessarily abusive to that boy.
There's no amount of fact that would justify what the officer did."</TE>
<TE>   The videotape was shot by Mitchell Crooks, a 27-year-old DJ
staying in a nearby hotel while he waited to switch apartments after
returning from vacation. Hearing a woman screaming about someone
being beaten, Crooks ran outside with his video camera. He said he
was not shocked by what he saw and did not realize what a stir the
videotape would cause.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was standard procedure; I thought it was normal
in Los Angeles," said Crooks. "I didn't think it was any big deal at
all."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Neilson Williams, 32, said Morse and other officers
handcuffed him and beat him with batons and hands near Ashwood Park
on June 23. Williams said the officers gave no explanation for
stopping him.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he filed a formal complaint with the Inglewood
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police, contacted late Monday, said they had not had a
chance to confirm that Williams had filed a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies on Monday offered the following account of
Saturday's incident at the gas station. It began shortly after 5
p.m., said Lt. Carl Deeley, when two deputies, Carlos Lopez and
Daniel Leon, noticed that Jackson's father, Coby Chavis Jr., 41, had
expired registration tags, and pulled behind him as he entered the
station.</TE>
<TE>   As the deputies began talking to Chavis, who lives in Inglewood,
his son went into the mini-mart. He came out and began arguing with
them, Deeley said.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies tried to calm the son, telling him that they were
just going to talk to his father about the expired registration. The
boy kept arguing, Deeley said.</TE>
<TE>   So Lopez, who has been with the department seven years, told him
to sit in the back seat of the patrol car while they investigated the
vehicle violations, Deeley said.</TE>
<TE>   But the boy protested and lunged at Lopez, Deeley said. Two patrol
units from Inglewood Police Department pulled up and intervened. They
saw the two struggling and attempted to help handcuff the boy, Deeley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four Inglewood police officers approached. This group included
Morse, and three others: Mariano Salcedo, an eight-year veteran and
training officer, Antoine Crook, who has been on the force one year,
and Bijan Darvish, a veteran of two years.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether officers used excessive force, Irvine said, "I'm
certainly not saying it was justified at this time. It's too
premature to say."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, Chavis and another witness recounted the episode
differently:</TE>
<TE>   Jackson stood upright when he spotted four Inglewood police
officers approaching, said his father.</TE>
<TE>   These officers, said Chavis, "began beating him [Jackson] in the
face."</TE>
<TE>   Chavis said his son was hit repeatedly and slammed into the
pavement by an officer.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Chavis said, an officer knelt with his knee on his
son's back. Chavis said his son was hit by an officer with a closed
fist and then dragged by the 18-inch silver chain that he wore around
his neck. The officers, said Chavis, lifted the boy by the chain,
which broke. The boy then fell to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "They were choking me," said Jackson, in a barely audible whisper.
Police declined to discuss the incident in detail.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis said he tried to intervene on his son's behalf but was
restrained. Chavis said he heard one officer call him by a racial
slur.</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Andres Mejia, 24, of Inglewood, said, "We didn't
understand why they were doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Mejia said he also saw police throw the youth on the ground, and
an officer kneeling on his back. He said he saw an officer punch
Jackson with a closed fist.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia said he watched the incident unfold in broad daylight 20
feet away. Mejia said he never saw the youth offer any resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It did just seem vengeful and racist," said Mejia.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's attorney, Hopkins, says his client's "only crime was
paying for gas at the wrong time on the wrong day."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Beth Shuster, Sandra Murillo, Jill Leovy and
Steve Berry contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Animals Aren't Property, Pet Activists Proclaim</HD>
<DH>Rights: Protectors say people should be 'guardians,' not
'owners.' L.A. City Council would have to sign off on wording change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of pets across Los Angeles might soon find themselves no
longer straining under the yoke of "owners." Denouncing the word as
demeaning to pets, animal-rights activists are urging the City
Council to strike the term from local codes and replace it with
"guardian."</LD>
<LD>   Prodded by In Defense of Animals, a rights group based in Mill
Valley, Calif., the Los Angeles Animal Services Commission last month
unanimously voted to replace the term in its documents and
conversations. On July 22, the three members of the commission will
consider whether to urge the City Council to make the policy
citywide.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a tidal wave of cataclysmic change that people are going
to be thinking of pets as human children or anything like that," said
commission President Paul Jolly. "It subtly moves the thought process
so that animals are treated as sentient beings that deserve our
respect."</LD>
<TE>   If the council goes along with the change, the city will join in
the "pet guardian" camp the state of Rhode Island and the cities of
Berkeley; West Hollywood; Boulder, Colo.; Amherst, Mass.; Sherwood,
Ark.; and Menomonee Falls, Wis. San Francisco and Marin County
officials are expected to consider similar proposals soon.</TE>
<TE>   Elliot M. Katz, a veterinarian and founder of In Defense of
Animals, said he has seen people abandon a cat because it clawed
furniture or because they were moving, or euthanize a dog with a
broken leg rather than pay for its medical care. The name switch
should make people think of pets as more than disposable property, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The word 'owner' is outdated and doesn't reflect the human-animal
bond that exists in our culture today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of a change of conscience, just as there was a
change of conscience in terms of how society should treat minorities,
how they should treat the handicapped, how they should treat children
and how they should treat women. There's always been a gradual change
as society becomes more enlightened and progressive."</TE>
<TE>   But some critics are worried that this gradual change could
ultimately lead to fundamental changes for veterinarians, farmers,
ranchers and society as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Some veterinarians and the American Kennel Club are concerned that
the proposal would afford animals rights that are now only associated
with humans. They wonder, for instance, if veterinarians would be
obligated to ignore the wishes of an owner/guardian if they thought
it was in the best interest of the pet.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously support anything that would deal with improving the
status of animals," said Dick Schumacher, executive director of the
Sacramento-based California Veterinary Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, he and others remain concerned that its
ramifications have not been investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Duane Flemming, a veterinarian and a lawyer in Pleasant Hill,
Calif., and president of the American Veterinary Medical Law Assn.,
said that although the group hasn't taken a position, he fears it
sets a "dangerous precedent."</TE>
<TE>   He contends that animal-rights groups ultimately hope to use the
change to gain legal standing as guardians for animals in court,
where they could argue that certain activities are not in the best
interest of the "ward." He cited performing in rodeos and circuses,
being milked at dairy farms and killed at slaughterhouses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a slippery slope. It is a very dangerous situation,"
Flemming said. "The real, true, underlying sub-goal is to ultimately
change people's perceptions, all the time heading toward the concept
of getting [legal] standing. Once you can do that, the animal-rights
people can change the fabric of our nation."</TE>
<TE>   When the city's Animal Services Commission approved the name
change in its documents and workings, the agency and the city
attorney's office found that the move would have no impact.</TE>
<TE>   The change will mean that residents who apply for pet licenses
will be referred to as guardians rather than owners. Other changes
will include referring to guardians, not owners, at meetings and
animal shelters. If the city adopts the change, it would apply to
city ordinances as well.</TE>
<TE>   At its July 22 hearing, commission President Jolly said the panel
will seek information about the economic and legal ramifications of a
citywide switch. If the commission recommends that the City Council
adopt the term guardian, the proposal will go to the council's Public
Safety Committee and eventually the 15-member council.</TE>
<TE>   Some Los Angeles leaders are skeptical, questioning whether the
change is a "feel-good" move that would do nothing to lessen concrete
animal problems such as overpopulation, an influx of coyotes into
residential areas and rabies.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla's spokesman said, "A much higher
priority for the councilman, especially in his northeast Valley
district, is the number of stray and often rabid dogs that roam the
alleys and vacant lots."</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like window dressing," Councilman Dennis Zine said.
"What does it do for animals? Does it improve their quality of life?
Or is it just changing the name to change the name?"</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss jokingly speculated whether calling his kids
"guardians" will make them remember to feed their goldfish.</TE>
<TE>   On a more serious note, Weiss said he wants to focus on issues
such as citywide emergency preparedness and the quality of life in
his West Los Angeles and southwest Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it hard to believe that this is the sort of pressing
public problem that people want us spending our time on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, dog owners at the Silver Lake Recreation Center were
divided about whether the change would make any difference.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Goldberg, whose young Labrador-Doberman mix, Hero, was
playing in the mud, said she could support the name change.</TE>
<TE>   "Language changes our perspective on how things are valued," the
Echo Park resident said. "It begins to shift how people do things."</TE>
<TE>   Anastasia Stafford of Silver Lake, who was watching her pug, Mum,
mill around a fenced area for small dogs, said she was doubtful that
the change would make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things--if you're a good person, you're good to
your dog," she said. Regardless, she added, "I think my dog owns me
more than I own it."</TE>

<LD>The state acted to take over the finances of Flint, a battered Rust

<LD>   Flint, with a population of 125,000, is the biggest Michigan city
to face such a takeover.</LD>
<LD>   Flint has been plagued by high unemployment. General Motors Corp.,
its biggest private employer, has cut its Flint work force from
80,000 to 19,000 in the last 15 years. In March, the city recalled
its mayor over the financial crisis.</LD>

<LD>In his first public comments since ABC's end-run to land him in the
spring, David Letterman indicated that he never had any intention of
leaving CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Letterman, the inaugural guest on "Nightline's" new midnight
companion show, "Up Close," told Ted Koppel, "In practical terms, I
don't think I could ever make that move" from CBS to ABC "because I'm
quite comfortable here, very comfortable here, and it would have been
an enormous challenge to go anywhere, not just ABC."</LD>
<LD>   "Speaking for myself completely, the comfort and ease and
surroundings are far more important than taking a new challenge."</LD>
<TE>   The comments are part of a larger interview that also covered his
bypass surgery 2 1/2 years ago as well as his much-praised show after
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have raided 75
jewelry stores and kiosks in U.S. shopping malls as part of an
investigation into suspected money-laundering by the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   About a dozen men, mostly Pakistanis, remain in custody on
immigration charges as a result of the sweeps, which also netted
documents, computer records and other evidence being examined by
anti-terrorism investigators, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials said the sweeps, carried out in late
June, represented the early phase of a probe centering on a chain of
stores, most of them called Intrigue Jewelers, that is owned by a
Florida company under suspicion of funding terrorist activities and
laundering terrorist money.</LD>

<HD>Bush Defends Chief of SEC, His Own Sale of Energy Stock</HD>
<DH>Business: In a news conference, he also offers preview of
today's speech on corporate reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday stood by the besieged chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission while rejecting suggestions that
his own past business conduct may rob him of credibility.</LD>
<LD>   During a news conference, Bush found himself repeatedly on the
defensive on the eve of his long-awaited speech on Wall Street, in
which he is expected to demand tougher penalties against dishonest
executives and give the SEC significantly more money to investigate
illegal business practices.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt has come under fire for not taking
tougher and more timely actions against corporate wrongdoers. But
Bush said he has no intention of heeding calls for Pitt's ouster.</LD>
<TE>   "Pitt's doing a fine job," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the news conference focused on Bush's own record as a
businessman. In recent days, new questions have arisen about his
tardiness, by eight months, in reporting to the SEC his sale of
nearly $850,000 worth of stock in a Texas-based energy firm 12 years
ago. Just weeks after Bush sold the stock, its value plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   The president flatly refuted the notion that he had sought to
enrich himself improperly by engaging in insider trading or sought to
hide the stock transaction. He noted that before the deal occurred,
he had properly filed with the SEC an intent-to-sell notice.</TE>
<TE>   The White House last week, in a new explanation of why Bush was
late in filing the required post-sale report with the SEC, cited "a
mix-up with the attorneys." That contradicted Bush's statements in
past years that he had indeed filed the report and that the SEC must
have lost it.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also counseled against a rush to judgment in the current
scandal atmosphere, saying that there can be genuine differences of
professional opinion--as in the case of his 1990 sale of 212,140
shares of stock in Harken Energy Corp. and a dispute over the
company's accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is--is that in the corporate world, sometimes
things aren't exactly black and white when it comes to accounting
procedures," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Monday blamed the renewed focus on his business dealings
as "old politics." He added: "This was fully looked into by the SEC,
and there's no there there."</TE>
<TE>   When Bush sold his stock, it was worth $4 a share. It subsequently
fell to about $1 per share, but later rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Bush noted that 14 months after the sale, "the person who bought
my stock could have sold it for 8 [dollars]--could have doubled his
or her money."</TE>
<TE>   In a preview of his remarks today in New York, Bush said the
proposals he will unveil are intended to restore investor confidence
in corporate America. He warned that the recent spate of scandals
could cause the public to "lose confidence in the free enterprise
system," making clear his concern that the misdeeds could undermine
the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If people lose confidence in the system, it will be hard to
attract capital in the markets," Bush said. "And that's one reason
I've reacted so steadily against what I have seen. And I don't like
it a bit, and I'm going to talk about it" today.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also argued anew that the rash of high-profile cases of
corporate accounting abuses and questionable financial practices does
not suggest a systemic problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I think by far the vast majority of CEOs in America are good,
honorable, honest people who have nothing to hide and are willing to
let the true facts speak for themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the few that have ... created the stains that we must deal
with."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made his comments in a wide-ranging news conference shortly
after returning from a long holiday weekend in Kennebunkport, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   His news conference came on the same day a congressional hearing
probed WorldCom Inc.'s recent report of a $3.9-billion accounting
irregularity. It was that report that set off the renewed focus on
corporate wrongdoing and may have provided the impetus for passage of
business reform legislation that had been stalled on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's hearing by the House Financial Services Committee,
lawmakers threatened former WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard J.
Ebbers with contempt for refusing to testify and called for jail time
for others involved in the phone giant's accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Capitol Hill, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined the ranks
of those calling for Pitt's resignation, saying that the
Bush-appointed SEC chairman has seemed "slow and tepid in addressing
accounting abuses."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous lawmakers, mostly Democrats, have leveled similar
accusations against the former securities lawyer, whose clients
included accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush did not waver in his support of Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvey Pitt has been fast to act," he said, noting that Pitt was
unanimously approved by the Senate a year ago. "He was the right man
for the job--and I still think he is."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over Pitt unfolded as the Senate began debating a
Democratic-sponsored accounting reform bill that had been stalled, in
part due to administration qualms about it. But the WorldCom scandal
has given the measure momentum and it is expected to pass the Senate
this week with considerable GOP support.</TE>
<TE>   Bush indicated a more favorable attitude toward the bill. He said
he and its sponsor, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, "share the same goals."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush said he disagrees with Sarbanes' desire to create an
independent board appointed by the SEC to broadly police the
accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern ... is that there's overlapping jurisdiction, which
will make it harder to enforce rules and regulations--not easier,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also disagrees with a provision that would require
the SEC to go to court before taking action against corporate
directors or officers, said White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "The president sees that as slowing down tough enforcement," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Bush said he was "confident we can get a good piece
of legislation out of the Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Before about 1,000 Wall Street executives today, Bush is expected
to call for tougher enforcement, stricter penalties and a significant
increase in the SEC's annual budget of $467 million for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, I'm a believer in the free enterprise system," Bush said.
"But I'm also a strong believer in holding people accountable when
they betray the trust of employees and shareholders. And that's
exactly what we're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting suggestions that he had engaged in wrongdoing while a
director of Harken Energy Corp. more than a decade ago, Bush said his
sale of company stock two months before the firm reported a big loss
had been fully "vetted" by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The president also denied that Harken recorded a phantom profit on
the 1989 sale of one of its subsidiaries, Aloha Petroleum, in an
effort to deceive investors by reducing the size of its reported
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC determined that Harken had used improper accounting
procedures and required it to restate its earnings to reflect
millions of dollars in losses that had been masked by the sale of
Aloha.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an honest difference of opinion as to how to account
for a complicated transaction," Bush said. He then made his comment
that "things aren't exactly black and white when it comes to
accounting procedures."</TE>
<TE>   Bush opened his 36-minute news conference by urging Congress to
act on a long list of legislative priorities he called "unfinished
business"--including bills to expand his power to negotiate
international trade treaties, to increase domestic energy production
and to create a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   "The agenda is full, the time is short and the nation is
watching," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was particularly urgent in his demand that Congress approve his
request for about $27 billion in supplemental funding for the
military operation in Afghanistan and other anti-terrorism
initiatives. Bush submitted his request four months ago.</TE>
<TE>   A $29-billion version of the bill has passed the House and a
$31.5-billion bill has passed the Senate. Bush budget officials have
threatened to veto a compromise bill if it goes beyond what the House
approved.</TE>

Warren Vieth contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Hijackers' Roommate to Remain in Custody</HD>
<DH>Law: A Jordanian man is held on visa-fraud charges.
Investigators want to see what he knows about two of the terrorists
who crashed a jet into the Pentagon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A Jordanian citizen who FBI officials believe lived with two Sept. 11
hijackers last year will remain in federal custody, a magistrate
ordered Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Rasmi Al-Shannaq, 27, is charged with obtaining a fake visa from
the U.S. Embassy in Qatar.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Harvey Eisenberg asked to keep Al-Shannaq in
custody, saying he is a flight risk because he is a Jordanian citizen
and because of the charge against him.</LD>
<TE>   Magistrate Susan Gauvey appointed an attorney to represent
Al-Shannaq. In a written statement, Al-Shannaq told the court he is
unemployed and does not have any money.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence Al-Shannaq aided the hijackers, said his
newly appointed attorney, Jim Wyda. He described his client as living
a "relatively normal life" until his June 24 arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have right now is a relatively minor fraud case," Wyda
said. He noted that the only charge Al-Shannaq faces involves his own
visa.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Shannaq had been held by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service since his arrest in Baltimore. Gauvey ordered him transferred
to the custody of U.S. marshals.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Shannaq is scheduled to appear Wednesday in court for a
detention hearing. The immigration charge carries a maximum of 10
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators want to know what Al-Shannaq knew about the
hijackers and any possible plans they might have discussed, Justice
Department officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   The men Al-Shannaq is said to have lived with in the Washington
suburbs--Hani Hanjour and Nawaq Alhamzi--are suspected of hijacking
American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. A law
enforcement source has said Al-Shannaq has acknowledged that he lived
with two of the hijackers.</TE>

<HD>Executions Put on Hold in Florida</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Saying it needs more time to assess the effect of a recent U.S.
Supreme Court ruling, Florida's highest court put Florida's death
penalty on hold Monday by delaying the executions of two inmates
scheduled to die this week.</LD>
<LD>   In a 6-1 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued an indefinite
postponement of the executions of Linroy Bottoson, 63, and Amos King,
47.</LD>
<LD>   The stay was announced a few hours before Bottoson was scheduled
to die by lethal injection. The court majority said it must first
address whether the recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court outlawing
Arizona's death penalty procedure applies to Florida.</LD>
<TE>   The court will hear oral arguments on Aug. 21 and a ruling could
take weeks longer. Until the court rules, Florida's death penalty is
on the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Ring vs. Arizona that
juries, not judges, must decide whether to sentence a defendant to
death. Arizona was among a handful of states where trial judges held
sole responsibility for imposing a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Florida is among four states in which the jury makes a
recommendation but the judge imposes the sentence. State officials
said recently that the ruling would directly affect 10 cases in which
a judge overruled a jury and imposed a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, said the ruling may have a more widespread
effect and could affect the 371 inmates on Florida's death row.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Charles Wells, the court's sole dissenter, said the U.S.
Supreme Court already decided the Bottoson case. Four days after
issuing its opinion on the Ring case, the nation's high court
rejected Bottoson's request for a hearing. By its action, Wells said,
the high court had given Florida plenty of direction.</TE>

<HD>Highest Award Given to Hero</HD>
<DH>Military: Bush bestows a Medal of Honor on Army Capt. Rocky
Versace, 37 years after he was killed by Viet Cong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush presented a posthumous Medal of Honor on Monday to
Army Capt. Rocky Versace, a Green Beret who defied his Viet Cong
captors and was executed in 1965.</LD>
<LD>   "He was fluent in English, French and Vietnamese and would tell
his guards to go to hell in all three," Bush told a group of about
200 in the East Room of the White House. The audience included
Versace's friends and family members, including three brothers.</LD>
<LD>   The president gave the framed medal to the captain's brother
Steve, who was applauded as he held it over his head and turned
slowly to display it to the audience.</LD>
<TE>   Versace would have been 65 on July 2. He grew up in Alexandria,
Va., and went to high school in Washington, White House officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from West Point and served as an intelligence advisor
in the Mekong Delta.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1963, two weeks before his tour in Vietnam was to end,
Versace set out with several companies of South Vietnamese troops in
a planned attack on a Viet Cong command post.</TE>
<TE>   They were ambushed by a much larger Viet Cong force. Versace was
wounded but kept providing cover fire so the troops with him could
withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   Versace and two other officers were captured and marched to a
prison camp in the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Given little to eat and held in mosquito-ridden conditions, he
tried to escape four times and refused to cooperate with his captors.
Eventually he was separated from the other prisoners, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time they heard his voice, he was singing 'God Bless
America' at the top of his lungs," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Versace was executed Sept. 26, 1965.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we award Rocky Versace the first Medal of Honor given to an
Army POW for actions taken during captivity in Southeast Asia," Bush
said.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Claims FBI Planted Fan</HD>
<DH>Courts: Accused terrorist claims an electric device that
appeared on his car hid a tracking device.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, accused of conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks,
claims the FBI planted a tracking device in an electric fan that
mysteriously appeared on his car in Oklahoma four months before his
arrest in Minnesota, according to court records unsealed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The motion, one of more than four dozen Moussaoui has filed since
becoming his own lawyer last month, adds a new element to the
34-year-old French citizen's contention that U.S. authorities know he
is innocent of the attacks on New York and Washington because they
had him and the 19 hijackers under surveillance for months.</LD>
<LD>   The government has said neither Moussaoui nor any of the hijackers
were being watched by U.S. authorities before Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Monday was the deadline for Moussaoui to file motions before his
trial this fall on charges that he conspired to commit acts of
terrorism, commit aircraft piracy, destroy aircraft, use weapons of
mass destruction, murder U.S. employees and destroy property. The
government has said it will seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui asked last week for permission to testify before
Congress about his conspiracy theory. U.S. District Judge Leonie
Brinkema relayed his request to congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees will
discuss the request later this week, a spokesman for Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate panel, said Monday. But there seemed
to be little interest among lawmakers to hear from the only person
charged in connection with the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the motions unsealed Monday, Moussaoui asked for an independent
forensic examination of an electric fan he said was "mysteriously
left on my car like a present or gift" when he was living in
Oklahoma. He said he left the fan in his apartment when he moved to
Minnesota, where he was arrested Aug. 16 after raising suspicions of
instructors at a flight school.</TE>
<TE>   He said the FBI "must have used the stratagem to avoid to have to
go to a judge to get a warrant to plant electronic surveillance
device."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui took a shot at President Bush in one motion, comparing
him to the Roman emperor in the movie "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   "The one who say that he was going to return honors to the office
was definitely talking about Ceasar Type Honors like in Gladiator:
Stabbing the enemy in the back before the fight. Not surprising for
Daddy son. Leading (or I must say cheating) from the back," he wrote.</TE>

<HD>NAACP Leaders Say Bush Has Slighted Civil Rights, and Them</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The day after the NAACP chairman assailed President Bush's record on
civil rights, its other top leader chided Bush for skipping a chance
to speak at the group's annual convention.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't be the president of all the people when you only want
to deal with some of the people," NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said
Monday during a speech at the convention.</LD>
<LD>   Bush addressed the meeting as a presidential candidate in 2000 but
has declined written invitations from Mfume for the last two years.</LD>
<TE>   Mfume called Bush "a likable fellow" but added that he doesn't
like "his presidential practice of divide and conquer when it comes
to black organizations and black people."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Bush was asked to respond to the NAACP's
feeling that he has slighted the group, and to general criticism that
his civil rights record has been lackluster.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to his black secretary of State and his national
security advisor, Bush replied: "Let's see, there I was sitting
around the table with foreign leaders, looking at Colin Powell and
Condi Rice." He then shook his head as if disgusted with the premise
of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Bond, the NAACP board chairman, opened the group's
convention Sunday night with a speech that attacked the Bush
administration's record on civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Bush "promised to enforce the civil rights laws,"
Bond said. "We knew he was in the oil business--we just didn't know
it was snake oil."</TE>

<HD>Trials of 50-Year-Old Smallpox Vaccine Underway in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Bioterrorism: Volunteers receive diluted versions to gauge
the side effects and its effectiveness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1950s, a pharmaceutical company in Pennsylvania created a
stockpile of smallpox vaccine for the U.S. military, unaware that
decades later, the frozen cache would be vital in protecting the
entire country from the deadly airborne virus that has no known cure.</LD>
<LD>   "We held on to it, just in case," said Len Lavenda, spokesman for
Aventis Pasteur in Swiftwater. But after the Sept. 11 attacks raised
the specter of bioterrorism, the company agreed to hand over its more
than 85 million doses of vaccine stock to the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, scientists began testing the effectiveness of the
50-year-old supply on more than 300 volunteers in Oakland, Calif.;
Iowa City, Iowa; Nashville; and Houston as part of the government's
heightened post-Sept. 11 preparations for a biological attack.</LD>
<TE>   Although a worldwide immunization campaign eradicated naturally
occurring smallpox in the late 1970s, small quantities of the virus
are stored at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
headquarters in Atlanta and a similar lab in Russia. But U.S.
officials are afraid some supplies may have fallen into the hands of
rogue nations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is vulnerable because vaccinations against the disease
haven't been required here since 1972, and those inoculated likely
would no longer be protected from infection. The vaccine confers full
immunity for perhaps five to 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Production of the vaccine stopped in 1983. But because of concerns
about bioterrorism, President Bush last month signed into law a
$4.6-billion bioterrorism prevention program, of which $640 million
went to producing and stockpiling the smallpox vaccine. Moreover, the
government announced last week it would soon inoculate as many as
500,000 emergency workers as a precaution against an attack.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine is now offered only to lab workers who handle the
virus. Last month, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,
which sets U.S. vaccine policy, rejected smallpox vaccinations for
the general public.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people would be susceptible if an outbreak occurred," said
Steve Black, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study
Center in Oakland, one of the four test sites sponsored by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "It's a
gruesome possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The trials in Oakland, the University of Iowa, Vanderbilt
University and Baylor College of Medicine will determine the side
effects of the supply that was stored at Aventis Pasteur and whether
it is still effective. If researchers find that it can be used, it
could then be diluted to create an emergency supply large enough for
the U.S., Canada and part of Mexico, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   During the testing in Oakland, nurses are injecting diluted
versions of the Aventis vaccine in about 40 to 50 people ages 18 to
32. Volunteers, drawn from a list of Kaiser members, will be paid $50
per visit and will keep a daily record of their physical symptoms,
returning for periodic checkups and responding to follow-up telephone
calls over the course of six months.</TE>
<TE>   Black said many volunteers are not motivated by the money. Some
are children of firefighters and police officers who seek to protect
themselves and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Although volunteers are not expected to have severe adverse
reactions, the vaccine can cause rashes, brain swelling and, in
severe cases, permanent brain damage and even death.</TE>
<TE>   Infants younger than 1, pregnant women, people with eczema and
similar skin diseases and those with immune disorders face greater
risks from the vaccine. But even people without these risk factors
could develop negative side effects or die. The chances of dying from
the vaccine are about 1 in 1 million, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Young volunteers like Sarah Palmer, 20, of Oakland said her
parents had been vaccinated when they were kids and suggested she do
the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I might end up staying home from work for a day," Palmer said.
"But the symptoms are unlikely so I wasn't worried."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Pereira, an 18-year-old college student from San Francisco,
said the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a terrorist attack and the vaccine works, I'll be
the first one vaccinated and won't have to worry about catching
disease," Pereira said. "Also, I'll be one of the people to test it
for other citizens of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to starting the vaccine trials, the federal government
is preparing plans in coming weeks for quarantining Americans exposed
to smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   The plans, soon to be circulated among top officials, address such
questions as where people would be kept, possibly against their will,
while officials confirmed their exposure and possibly administered
vaccinations.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for 2 in Alleged Race Plot</HD>
<DH>Courts: The white supremacist couple used counterfeit money
and conspired to ignite a 'racial holy war' in Boston, prosecutors
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The trial of a couple described by prosecutors as white supremacists
who planned to set off a "racial holy war" got underway here Monday
with jury selection, in a case that the judge said has taken on new
significance "in a post-9/11 setting."</LD>
<LD>   Along with hate crimes and domestic terrorism, Leo Felton and his
girlfriend, Erica Chase, are charged with conspiracy, making
counterfeit bills, obstruction of justice, and firearms and
explosives violations.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-year-old Felton could be sentenced to life in prison.
Chase, 22, could get a maximum of 35 years behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the pair intended to "blow up some
structure, building, property or memorial associated with Jewish-
and/or African Americans, thereby advancing the defendants'
anti-Semitic and white-supremacist goals and igniting 'a racial holy
war.' "</TE>
<TE>   Felton, a 6-foot-7-inch ex-convict with the words "skin" and
"head" tattooed in Gothic letters on his skull, has pleaded not
guilty. Chase, who also entered a not guilty plea, told investigators
the couple wanted to explode a homemade bomb on a beach "for
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged plot unfolded in April 2001, when Felton and Chase
reportedly tried to use counterfeit $20 bills at a Dunkin' Donuts.
Police searching their apartment found brochures about building bombs
and forging identities. They also discovered books on terrorism and a
50-pound bag of ammonium nitrate--the same type of fertilizer
employed by Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities linked Felton to a supremacist organization called the
White Order of Thule. Members of the group, which disbanded in the
summer of 2000, advocated the superiority of the Aryan race as
represented by Norse, Viking and other ancient Nordic cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say newspaper clippings and other material found at
the couple's apartment led them to believe Felton and Chase may have
planned to blow up Boston's African-American Museum, the New England
Holocaust Memorial or a new bridge named for the late Leonard P.
Zakim, former head of the Anti-Defamation League here.</TE>
<TE>   A bioterrorism guidebook that explains how to kill people with
nerve gas also was found in Felton and Chase's apartment in Boston's
North End.</TE>
<TE>   Felton's lawyer, Lenore Glaser, said in court papers that
prosecutors have no evidence of an actual bomb. Glaser also contends
that the government cannot prove Felton and Chase intended to bomb an
ethnic target.</TE>
<TE>   Chase insisted in court documents that "there were not any kind of
terrorist plans at all."</TE>
<TE>   Felton is the son of a white mother and an African American
father, both former civil rights activists. He was released from a
New Jersey prison in January 2001 after serving 11 years for
attempting to murder a black taxicab driver in New York with a
crowbar. While imprisoned, authorities said, he tried to slit the
throats of an African American and a Latino inmate.</TE>
<TE>   Felton attempted suicide in jail following his indictment in June
2001 after news reports revealed his racial heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Writing to a Boston newspaper while he was in jail, Felton
attributed his problems to his parents and their interracial
marriage. He blasted the mixing of black and white blood as "evil."</TE>
<TE>   Chase, a slight woman who wears her dark hair in long ringlets,
began writing to Felton in prison two years ago through an outreach
ministry run by the World Church of the Creator--a religion
established for "the survival, expansion and advancement of [the]
White Race exclusively."</TE>
<TE>   Because of "the inflammatory nature of the accusations," U.S.
District Judge Nancy Gertner said she expected jury selection to
continue for at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   Gertner said Monday that of 100 prospective jurors, 19 were
excused.</TE>
<TE>   Although she turned down a defense request to hold a bench
trial--in which the jury is waived--Gertner conceded that some jurors
could feel "nervous" about a trial involving explosives "in light of
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the defendants' guilt or innocence, the case, said Amy
Yellin, spokeswoman for the New England office of the Anti-Defamation
League, serves as "a reminder of the significant threat to our
communities that is posed by modern-day extremists who have access to
weapons that can cause significant harm." The trial is scheduled to
last five weeks.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Bush dresses down the nation's business leaders today,
he is likely to rely heavily on tried and true techniques for coping
with corporate corruption.</LD>
<LD>   What he is unlikely to do, however, is offer anything approaching
a comprehensive answer to how so much could have gone so wrong so
quickly for corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Most of Bush's reforms, like those of his Democratic critics, will
represent old-time fixes for what at least until recently was
considered a New Economy.</LD>
<TE>   That worries a wide array of analysts, who say the president's
proposals may not be up to the task of catching corporate crooks and
restoring public faith in the nation's financial markets. They say
that the country needs a new system for keeping tabs on its
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key elements: new accounting to unmask the new ways
companies take risks; replacement of the "carrot capitalism" of
lavish executive pay packages with a "watchdog capitalism" that gives
the public a greater say in corporate affairs; and a Federal Reserve
willing to apply to stock prices the same tools it uses to prevent
consumer prices from getting out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy has changed and we need to change with it," said New
York's Democratic comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who, as the sole
trustee for the state's $112-billion public pension fund, is one of
the nation's biggest investors.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of fraud has reached the wallets and pocketbooks of all
Americans and created a crisis of confidence," said McCall, who
recently co-chaired a New York Stock Exchange panel that called for
major changes in the way publicly traded companies are managed. "We
need a system that holds [companies] more accountable to shareholders
and to the public."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, not everyone is convinced the nation's economic
landscape has changed so drastically it needs a new regulatory scheme
for business. Even McCall cautions: "I guess we're starting down a
path here and, if it appears that this is not enough, I think we are
all prepared to do more."</TE>
<TE>   By now, most Americans are especially skeptical about talk of a
New Economy, viewing it as little more than a figment of some tech
whizzes' overwrought imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   But against this popular view, a wide array of analysts from Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan on down continue to believe that the economy
has indeed undergone a fundamental shift that promises greater
growth, but at a cost of new vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   One indicator that analysts cite as evidence of the shift--and of
the need for substantial change in regulations--is the growth of
corporate "intangibles."</TE>
<TE>   Consider: As recently as 20 years ago, the value investors placed
on the nation's major corporations was roughly equal to the worth of
all their factories, machines, vehicles and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about 70% of the value of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
companies consists of intangible assets that are hard to quantify.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all the research and development, the brands, the
technology and the employee know-how that are at the core of a
company's value, and never show up on its balance sheet," said New
York University accounting theorist Baruch Lev.</TE>
<TE>   Lev and others argue that the growth of intangibles is one measure
of the nation's transformation from an old-line, industrial economy
to a new, knowledge-based one. It is also an indication of the
trouble confronting the president and the Congress in coping with the
current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Because if intangibles give U.S. companies a leg up in the global
race for valuable new ideas, they also present a problem. By being so
hard to count, track and audit, they have made it harder to follow
how a firm operates and much easier for its executives to commit
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "An economy in which the most valuable assets are intangible is a
very different and more difficult one than the old physical economy,"
Lev said. "Our ancient accounting system is completely broken when it
comes to handling them."</TE>
<TE>   Here are three proposals that analysts say would start to address
the real problems in corporate America:</TE>
<TE>   * Count More Than Dollars: Virtually the entire debate over the
accounting breakdowns behind Enron's collapse and the string of
corporate calamities since has centered on how to ensure that
accountants properly count a company's valuables. There has been
almost no discussion about what they should be counting.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all the reform proposals--including a bill written by
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), which has emerged as the gold standard
for toughness on this issue--assume that the nation's "generally
accepted accounting principles" properly capture firms' value and
portray their most important activities. Critics assert they do no
such thing.</TE>
<TE>   Economists Robert E. Litan of the liberal Brookings Institution
and Peter J. Wallison of the conservative American Enterprise
Institute argue that changes in the economy--especially the rise of
intangibles--require "a fundamental rethinking of the kinds of
information that corporations should be disclosing" and accountants
should be checking.</TE>
<TE>   As examples of key measures, they cite the pattern of patent
applications and approvals for drug companies, subscription trends
for Internet service providers and customer complaint statistics for
consumer product firms.</TE>
<TE>   "People think accounting is an exact science; you add up numbers
and you get the right answer," Wallison said in an interview. "But
especially with intangibles, companies have to guess at what the
value is." Only by receiving nonfinancial information about companies
can investors and others judge whether the guesses are correct, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   * Call in the Watchdogs: Greenspan warned this year that
knowledge-based companies appear particularly prone to trouble if
investors and the public come to doubt their disclosures, which are
the only way to judge their performance.</TE>
<TE>   Commentators argue that much of the run-up in executive pay during
the last decade can be seen as an attempt to cope with this
problem--as it turns out, a failed attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The lavish pay packages gave top managers huge stakes in the
companies they ran--chiefly through stock options--in hopes that by
enlarging their own wealth they would improve that of the
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   But this "carrot capitalism" failed because some executives found
it was easier to increase their wealth by cooking the corporate
books, and thus raising the stock price to unwarranted levels, than
by improving their companies' performance, said Litan, the Brookings
economist. The failure is likely to usher in a new era.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had to think of where we're headed, it's toward 'watchdog
capitalism,' where we have independent boards of directors and
independent audit committees and a lot more SEC audits," Litan said.</TE>
<TE>   * A Fed That Fights Bubbles: Under the law, the Fed's job is to
protect the economy from inflation by maintaining price stability.
Greenspan and other Fed officials insist that they are not
responsible for managing stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   But recently released transcripts show the central bank was
worried about a stock bubble as early as 1996, and Greenspan engaged
in an attempt to talk the market down that December by labeling its
activities "irrational exuberance."</TE>
<TE>   The most vocal advocate for the Fed taking on the stock market was
then-Fed governor Lawrence B. Lindsey, now President Bush's top
economic advisor, who called for knocking down stock prices by
raising interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the case for doing so was as strong as it had been
in the U.S. in the late 1920s and in Japan in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "It is far better we do so while the bubble still resembles
surface froth and before the bubble carries the economy to
stratospheric heights," he pleaded with his Fed colleagues. "Whenever
we do it, it is going to be painful."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the central bank held interest rates steady for almost
two years, then cut them dramatically in the face of the Asian
financial crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.
The result was the most spectacular stock boom in U.S.
history--setting the stage for the market collapse and today's
emerging scandals.</TE>

<HD>Jury Gets Case of Georgia Sheriff Accused of Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutor cites power as lawman's motive in slaying
of his successor. The defense likens the trial to those given to
Salem witches.</DH>

<DL>ALBANY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>When J. Tom Morgan leveled his finger at Sidney Dorsey's chest in
court on Monday, it was the closest the two men had come to a
face-to-face confrontation.</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey, a man once celebrated for being the first black sheriff of
suburban De Kalb County, stood accused of assassinating his rival.
Morgan, the district attorney, had been pursuing him for the last
year and a half.</LD>
<LD>   "This man," Morgan said, his voice beginning to crack, "this man
was the only person in the whole wide universe who had the motive to
gun down Sheriff-Elect Derwin Brown. Why? Because he was so obsessed
with power."</LD>
<TE>   The stare-down was an intense finale to the prosecution's closing
arguments. Just before that, Dorsey's attorney, Brian Steel, called
the case "a witch hunt."</TE>
<TE>   "Sidney Dorsey is not a killer. He's been manipulated. This is
like going back to the Salem witch trials and throwing people into a
lake and seeing if they drown."</TE>
<TE>   Facing Life in Prison</TE>
<TE>   For the last month, many people in De Kalb County and the
surrounding Atlanta metro area have been closely following Dorsey's
case. The once-popular sheriff faces life in prison if he is found
guilty of arranging to kill Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, also black, had defeated Dorsey in an acrimonious election
after vowing to clean up the De Kalb Sheriff's Department. Dorsey,
like several of his predecessors, was under investigation on
corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Brown was shot to death in his driveway on Dec.
15, 2000, Morgan began circling Dorsey. He checked his alibis, put
his house under surveillance and pushed a grand jury to connect the
corruption investigation with the killing. But Morgan, in his third
term as De Kalb's district attorney, didn't find much evidence and
was criticized for an investigation that didn't lead to any arrests
for almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   The break came in November when Morgan persuaded a former protege
of Dorsey to testify against him. Patrick Cuffy, a thickly built
sheriff's deputy, said he was among four men Dorsey assigned to kill
Brown. In exchange for testifying against Dorsey, Cuffy was granted
total immunity and even asked for reward money (which nobody has
given him yet).</TE>
<TE>   On top of murder charges, Dorsey faces 14 counts of racketeering,
bribery, theft and abuse of power allegations. Dorsey, 62, has said
he had nothing to do with the killing. He did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors called more than 50 witnesses, including ex-lovers,
pastors, former employees and former friends who detailed alleged
abuses of power, including the murder plot.</TE>
<TE>   The defense fired back, often colorfully. One lawyer, Don Samuel,
slipped into a velvet smoking jacket during a cross-examination to
show that a woman who had accused Dorsey of raping her had given him
many gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Steel asked Cuffy whether he repeatedly played the popular
Bob Marley song "I Shot the Sheriff" after Brown was killed, implying
that Cuffy was celebrating Brown's death.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's main message was that Dorsey was corrupt and
wanted Brown dead because he didn't want his crooked ways to be
exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Sidney Dorsey turned proud, trained deputies into chauffeurs,
baby-sitters and go-cart fetchers," said prosecutor John Petrey. "He
turned sheriff vehicles into taxicabs. He just wanted to strut and
flaunt and show people how powerful he was."</TE>
<TE>   The defense was more philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision you make here will be one of the most important
decisions of your life," defense lawyer Samuel said.</TE>
<TE>   He downplayed allegations of corruption, telling the jury: "Your
job is not to deliberate questions of morality or judgment, but
questions of law."</TE>
<TE>   Credibility Challenged</TE>
<TE>   The sharpest words were saved for Cuffy.</TE>
<TE>   The former deputy, who said Dorsey had treated him like a son,
testified that shortly after Dorsey lost the election, he handed
Cuffy a note that read, "Kill Derwin Brown." Dorsey then ate the
note, written on a full-sized sheet of paper, Cuffy said.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Steel poked holes in several parts of Cuffy's
testimony and told jurors during his final argument: "Patrick Cuffy
is not truthful. You have a reasonable doubt right there."</TE>
<TE>   The 11 women and one man in the jury box sat with granite faces,
giving little insight into what they were thinking. They began
deliberating later Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In March, two other suspects, including alleged trigger man Melvin
Walker, were acquitted after Cuffy testified against them. Jurors
said they thought Cuffy was lying.</TE>
<TE>   But this trial has been longer and included many more witnesses
than the last one. It's being held in Albany, a small town in the
middle of cotton fields three hours south of Atlanta, because the
judge feared that publicity surrounding the case had tainted the
Atlanta-area jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Morgan left the jury with the words, "Do it for
Derwin." But not before he reminded them that although he works in
the big city upstate, he was born and raised right here in Albany.</TE>

<HD>The Code of the Cosmos</HD>
<DH>A genius to some, a crackpot to others, Stephen Wolfram
says it's all very simple: The universe can be reduced to a computer
program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen Wolfram was in his Caltech office more than 20 years ago,
working late on an autumn evening, when he saw something on his
computer screen that shocked and confused him.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old physicist, already a member of the Caltech
faculty, had been experimenting with elementary computer programs. He
expected them to generate simple, predictable patterns: checkerboards
or nested triangles.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, one of the programs spawned complex images that resembled
the veins in a leaf. Another filled the screen with what looked like
the elegant lace of snowflakes. A third spun out wave after wave of
shapes that grew increasingly intricate and varied.</LD>
<TE>   Wolfram had stumbled onto a few lines of computer code that
mimicked the ordered chaos of nature. Infinite complexity seemed to
arise from ultimate simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, that revelation has blossomed into a grand
theory that has raised a furor in the scientific world and sparked a
rush by laymen to grasp Wolfram's audacious thesis: The universe is
no more than a computer playing out a program of stupefying
simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   "If things work out as I expect, there will come a day when one
can hold the lines of code that created the whole universe in one's
hand," said Wolfram, who revealed his big idea in a 1,200-page
self-published opus titled "A New Kind of Science."</TE>
<TE>   Released in May, the tome has soared to the top of Amazon.com's
bestseller list, selling out its first printing of 50,000 at $44.95
each.</TE>
<TE>   To Wolfram, a British-born prodigy who earned a doctorate in
theoretical physics at age 20 and won a MacArthur "genius" fellowship
at 21, rules as simple as tick-tack-toe are the driving force behind
all of nature--from single-cell amoebas to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The universe began, he maintains, with a few basic instructions
that played themselves out over billions of years to produce
everything that exists today. This simple code, he says, underlies
consciousness itself, giving rise to our every thought--from the
sudden desire for a scoop of chocolate ice cream to Wolfram's own
theory.</TE>
<TE>   Like a literary big bang, Wolfram's book has stimulated dozens of
reviews and articles in the general and scientific press and has lit
up Internet discussion groups. Much of the scientific world is
howling in protest, calling his theory the product of a monumental
ego unleashed from reality.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, scientists have sought to explain the natural
world--from the rotations of galaxies to the spin of subatomic
particles--with mathematical equations. From Isaac Newton's epiphany
about gravity and a falling apple to the building of the atomic bomb,
the arcane abstractions of calculus have been the key to the
universe.</TE>
<TE>   But math falls short when it comes to describing the soft-edged
diversity of the natural world. Scientists could fill all the
chalkboards in all the universities in the world with equations and
still fail to explain the brilliant spots on tropical fish, the
contours of wind-blown sand or the shifting shape of a plume of cigar
smoke. Mathematics is even more inadequate when it comes to
simulating intangibles such as the economy, let alone the vagaries of
human thought.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram, 42, says the answers lie not in the limited tools of old
science but in simple computer programs.</TE>
<TE>   He does not pretend to know what lines of code would create a
sausage, let alone a solar system. His point is that the basic
instructions that create intricate patterns on a computer screen will
help us understand what creates similar patterns in nature.</TE>
<TE>   His book is packed with images of Sumerian mosaics and
strawberries, earthquake fissures and leopard spots, thermonuclear
mushroom clouds and streams of clear water--all modeled with uncanny
precision, he says, by shimmering dot patterns generated on a
computer screen by a few simple rules.</TE>
<TE>   These pictures, Wolfram argues, reveal a pervasive truth that has
been hiding in plain sight.</TE>
<TE>   In presenting this notion to the world, Wolfram has sidestepped
time-honored scientific procedures. Instead of submitting a paper to
a peer-reviewed scholarly journal and letting colleagues try to pick
it apart, he is making his case directly to a mass audience in
simple, nontechnical language. This fall, he plans a road show to
proselytize about his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "There just isn't a mechanism within the current structure of
science to present things as big as what I'm trying to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, "big" doesn't begin to capture it, Wolfram says. He
describes his theory as "one of the more important single discoveries
in the whole history of theoretical science," akin to those of
Copernicus, who overturned centuries of orthodoxy by proving in 1530
that the Earth was not the center of the universe, and Charles
Darwin, whose 1859 theory of natural selection shattered religious
dogma about creation.</TE>
<TE>   A Leap of Faith?</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Kurzweil, a celebrated inventor and expert in artificial
intelligence, has posted on his Web site a stinging 8,000-word
critique that faults Wolfram for an outrageous leap of faith--for
concluding that because simple rules can spin out beguiling
complexity, they must be behind the deepest mysteries of life.</TE>
<TE>   Kurzweil finds elements of Wolfram's theory intriguing but says he
fails to prove that the unending variation of dots on a page explains
higher orders of complexity. "How do we get from these interesting
but limited patterns," Kurzweil asks, "to those of insects or humans
or Chopin preludes?"</TE>
<TE>   Chris Adami, a Caltech theoretical physicist who is a leader in
using computers to model complex living systems, dismissed Wolfram's
work as "pathetic" and "exasperating."</TE>
<TE>   "Wolfram's naivete about biological complexity is stunning," Adami
said. "We call this 'crackpot science.' "</TE>
<TE>   But amid the criticism is a persistent murmur of curiosity from
general readers and scientists alike.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram's premise is particularly seductive for anyone who has
ever struggled in physics or math class. Instead of relying on
impenetrable equations to describe the universe, he sees the
boundless complexity of the natural world--from the coloration of
seashells to worldwide weather patterns--as the result of inherent
rules simple enough for anyone to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Sequestered near Boston--his precise location kept secret to foil
"the next Unabomber"--he talked nonstop recently for nearly two
hours, with the unique confidence of a millionaire genius who has
been building his case for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "There will come a time when we can emulate the essence of human
thinking in machines," he said, characteristically racing ahead to
the outer edge of his idea.  "What does that mean for the future of
the human condition?"</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram's theory traces its roots to a computer game created by
Princeton University mathematician John Conway more than 30 years
ago. The game, called simply Life, became a cult classic after it was
reviewed in Scientific American magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Players begin by using their cursors to blacken selected squares
on a grid. Then they click on the "go" button and the game unfolds
according to three rules. Any blackened square with two or three
blackened neighbors "lives." Any square with four neighbors
"dies"--that is, disappears from the screen. An empty square bordered
by three blackened squares gives birth to a new blackened square.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing patterns, basic at first, soon develop mesmerizing
complexity as the game's logic plays itself out. As successive
generations of blackened squares breed and die, the computer screen
becomes a roiling stew of activity that looks like a petri dish of
bacteria blooming at high speed.</TE>
<TE>   Each game varies according to how many squares were darkened at
the beginning and in what pattern. Most starting points end up as
static patterns after bubbling through many generations. But others
cause unending growth and perpetual motion.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Wolfram had dismissed Life as a toy. Then he began to
experiment with his own simple computer programs, called "cellular
automata" for their property of automatically generating cells, or
squares. By 1981, he came to see Life as a validation of his budding
theory.</TE>
<TE>   The programs with which Wolfram was tinkering are slightly more
complex than Life, governed by eight rules, rather than Life's three,
for determining whether squares "live" or "die." These programs come
in 256 variations. Wolfram began testing all 256 of them.</TE>
<TE>   He discovered that some--such as Rule 30, on which many of his
conclusions are based--build infinitely varying patterns. He
gradually came to believe that the frenetic disorder generated by
Rule 30 was as complex as anything in the universe.</TE>
<TE>   Credibility an Issue</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram nurtured his obsession as he migrated from Caltech to
Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies, where colleagues expected
him to expand his promising career in cosmology and particle physics.
Instead, Wolfram stubbornly pursued his research in the obscure field
of automata, working in an office upstairs from one Albert Einstein
had occupied two generations earlier.</TE>
<TE>   His ideas would have been ignored as the ravings of a crank, were
he not Stephen Wolfram.</TE>
<TE>   His staggering intellect had long set him apart. Aside from his
early theoretical achievements, at age 27 Wolfram created
Mathematica, a software program widely used to perform complex
mathematical functions and analyze and display data. It became the
dominant software for math and physics and made Wolfram rich.</TE>
<TE>   With Mathematica, "Wolfram's already taken over a large part of
how science is done," said Mott Greene, another MacArthur fellow and
a science historian at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash.
"His influence is felt everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Unshakable confidence and financial independence freed Wolfram to
follow his passion. For 10 years he became a recluse--a phantom whose
occasional appearances sparked the question: "What is Stephen Wolfram
really up to?"</TE>
<TE>   On the first page of his long-awaited book, he answers:</TE>
<TE>   "Three centuries ago, science was transformed by the dramatic new
idea that rules based on mathematical equations could be used to
describe the natural world. My purpose in this book is to initiate
another such transformation, and to introduce a new kind of science
that is based on the much more general types of rules that can be
embodied in simple computer programs."</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the book lays out how cellular automata model
natural phenomena, such as the shapes of snowflakes. Wolfram then
extends the idea to living or dynamic systems--from wasp nests to
water jets--and argues that these too can be simulated by simple
computer programs.</TE>
<TE>   Next, he moves on to human-designed systems and says that he was
able to mimic the gyrations of financial markets with a program that
uses just four rules for buying and selling securities.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of his argument is that his computer patterns are as
intricate as any object in nature, and that, therefore, the screen
images and the objects in nature must have a common origin.</TE>
<TE>   This idea finds its most ambitious expression as Wolfram's
"principle of computational equivalence." It holds that a leaf, a
star, a human being and one of Wolfram's cellular automata are all
equivalent in that they arise from the same kind of simple rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If we compare ourselves with other systems in nature, we might
ask, 'What's special about us?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram believes his ideas will transform science and engineering
and influence philosophy, economics, even art.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems so easy for nature to produce forms of great beauty," he
writes. "In the past, art has mostly just had to be content to
imitate such forms." But with his discoveries, he says, "extremely
simple rules will often be able to generate pictures that have
striking aesthetic qualities--sometimes reminiscent of nature, but
often unlike anything ever seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Simple programs, he says, may one day unlock problems too complex
to solve even with today's massive computer power, such as how
traffic jams form and how they can be unwound. Basic rules that model
the growth of a tumor could explain how to stop cancer. Programs that
simulate neural pathways might lead to super-intelligent machines.</TE>
<TE>   "One can imagine building things that capture the essential
purposes achieved by natural systems," even the brain, Wolfram said,
"but without the extra baggage of, for example, having the actual
hairy animal."</TE>
<TE>   No leading scientist has endorsed Wolfram's theory wholesale, but
many say his ideas are provocative.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling is that this is written by a genius," said H. Eugene
Stanley, a physicist at Boston University. Maybe not all of nature is
as described by Wolfram, he said, "but at least a big part of it is."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram's "new kind of science" entices specialists frustrated
with mathematical formulas that explain hydrogen atoms or planetary
orbits but "fail miserably" in fields such as biology, where systems
are much more diverse, said Terry Sejnowski, director of the
Computational Neurobiology Laboratory at UC San Diego and a Wolfram
confidant.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Jeanloz, a UC Berkeley geophysicist, says Wolfram's
hypothesis has revolutionary potential.</TE>
<TE>   "The modern approach in much of science has been reductionist: You
take a complicated thing and split it up into units that are less
complicated," he said. "Wolfram's approach is the direct opposite:
Start with simplicity instead of complexity. If he's right, this
could be a huge step forward in the way we approach scientific
problems--and maybe most complicated issues in life as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Links to Chaos Theory</TE>
<TE>   Other scholars regard many of Wolfram's "discoveries" as
uncredited borrowings. They note that physicist Richard Feynman and
mathematician Norbert Weiner described the universe as kind of a
giant digital computer decades ago, and that physicist Edward Fredkin
explored biological processes and consciousness through the framework
of simple computer programs.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say Wolfram also borrows heavily from chaos
theory--the study of complex interactive systems.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, Wolfram's hypothesis also embraces one of
humanity's earliest attempts to comprehend the natural world--the
pre-Christian creed of animism, which considers living beings and
inanimate objects equal in that all possess a soul.</TE>
<TE>   In Wolfram's "new science," a person, a dog and a rock all emerge
from the same kind of simple rules and therefore are, in an essential
way, the same.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram's theory also could bolster the age-old belief in
predestination. The idea that God preordains all things is uncannily
similar to simple computer programs playing out in inevitable, though
unpredictable, ways.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent interview, Wolfram acknowledged that the
implications of his theory sometimes scare even him. He began to
sputter, stumbling over his words in an effort to explain. Gradually,
he regained his footing. He said he expects, before he dies, to
discover the simple source code from which all works of creation have
flowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Will that be fundamentally disappointing?" he asked softly. "That
this is all there is, a few lines of code?"</TE>
<TE>   Then he fell silent.</TE>

<HD>Smart Bomber</HD>
<DH>Baumgartner smashes hockey's goon stereotype</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his 12 seasons as an NHL enforcer, including stints with the Kings
and Mighty Ducks, Ken Baumgartner made his living mostly with his
fists, rarely backing down from a fight while amassing 2,244 penalty
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   But his biggest quarrel was with those who branded him a goon.</LD>
<LD>   As proud as he was to last a dozen years in the league with only a
modicum of talent and almost no scoring ability, netting 13 goals in
696 games, Baumgartner never wanted his on-ice role to define him,
nor did he believe it should.</LD>
<TE>   "For the fear of being mislabeled," the former "Bomber" says, "I
did go the extra mile when I was away from the arena."</TE>
<TE>   It led him eventually to the prestigious Harvard Business School,
from where Baumgartner, 36, graduated last month, accepting his
master's degree in a hockey rink, oddly enough, after rain had forced
the commencement ceremony inside.</TE>
<TE>   After spending his NHL career shepherding the likes of Wayne
Gretzky and Paul Kariya, keeping them out of harm's way, Baumgartner
will embark next month on a new career in private wealth management
at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in Century City, where he will guide the
fortunes of the super rich.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems an unlikely transition, Baumgartner has always smashed
stereotypes, exuding the same gusto with which he once busted heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody could make the transition, but Kenny is unique,"
says Tom Schwartz, a regional manager in charge of private wealth
management at Goldman, Sachs. "He's very cerebral, he's very
team-oriented. He's got a good sense of urgency about him, which you
need to have in this business."</TE>
<TE>   A husband and father of two young girls, Baumgartner was active in
the NHL Players' Assn., serving as vice president for several years.
In his last NHL stop, with the Boston Bruins, he was an alternate
captain.</TE>
<TE>   And over 14 years, balancing his NHL duties with part-time
studies, the native of the tiny mining town of Flin Flon, Canada,
earned a bachelor's degree in business administration, graduating
summa cum laude from Hofstra University in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't think a guy who could drop the gloves and beat you
up could beat you in algebra too," Steve Heinze, a former teammate,
once said of Baumgartner. "He's quite a versatile guy."</TE>
<TE>   Says Baumgartner, "Anyone who has followed my career will
understand that I put a lot of effort into preparing myself for life
after hockey and showing hockey fans there's more to Ken Baumgartner
than they may have seen on the ice....</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I was never able to evolve into a 40-goal scorer
who could have someone look after him. I never had those skills. But
perhaps that motivated me to become involved with the business side
of the sport ... and I created a balance in my life by attending
school in the off-season."</TE>
<TE>   Baumgartner played his last game in April 1999 and, while serving
as an assistant to then-Bruin coach Pat Burns in the 1999-2000
season, applied to Harvard Business School with an eye toward
returning to the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it provided the clear transition," he says. "I was a
laborer, then I was middle management. I'll go to business school and
I'll come back and move into a front-office position."</TE>
<TE>   He had a change of heart after the Bruins faltered.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad season," he says. "We didn't make the playoffs.
Although we weren't fired, the head coach was fired eight games into
the next season. It just led me to reassess the insecurity of that
profession."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Baumgartner says his background served him well even
as he shifted his focus to investment management.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the same skills that one acquires in a team sport or a
locker-room surrounding transfer very positively to not only a
classroom but a business environment--dedication, discipline,
accountability, the ability to speak up amongst your peers. Things
that were second nature that I developed in the NHL--teamwork,
leadership skills--came in very handy in a business school
environment."</TE>
<TE>   The presence of a former NHL player, meanwhile, was handy for his
classmates, who enlisted his help as a defenseman on the HBS Blades
hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet it was the only time since I was 10 years old that I felt
there was the expectation of how the team did was based on my
performance," Baumgartner told the Boston Globe.</TE>
<TE>   The business school graduate won't rule out a return to the NHL
but says, "If that were to happen, it would be quite a ways in the
horizon."</TE>
<TE>   After a playing career that also included time with the New York
Islanders and Toronto Maple Leafs, Baumgartner is looking forward to
settling down with his family in their new home in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great advantages of the job I'll be entering is, if
I'm successful, I won't be traded," he says. "I could still be doing
it 20 years from now."</TE>
<TE>   And no one will be calling him a goon.</TE>

<HD>Mets Lose Davis for Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kane Davis of the New York Mets had surgery on his right
elbow Monday and will sit out the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, a right-handed reliever, was 1-1 with a 7.07 earned-run
average in 16 appearances. He walked 11 and struck out 24 in 14
innings.</LD>
<LD>   The Mets said Davis is expected to resume baseball activity in six
months.</LD>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers claimed infielder Donnie Sadler off waivers from
the Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers optioned outfielder Jason Romano to Oklahoma of the
triple-A Pacific Coast League. In two stints with the Rangers this
season, Romano batted .204 with four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Sadler, 27, batted .191 with five RBIs in 35 games with the
Royals. He has played second base, shortstop, third base and the
outfield this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The gates were padlocked and hundreds of fans of the Charleston
Riverdogs gathered outside Joe Riley Stadium on Monday at Charleston,
S.C.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a strike of any kind, just another outlandish promotion
by the Riverdogs, the Class-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody except employees, scouts and media was barred from
entering the stadium on "Nobody Night."</TE>
<TE>   It was all part of a promotion designed to set the record for
professional baseball's lowest attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans stood on ladders peaking over the fence, but Stephen
Parker, 50, and Ute Appleby, 47, chose safer seats. The two plopped
beach chairs behind the center field wall and peered through an
opening in the fence where the view was strained, but decent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Riverdogs fans and could not pass up the opportunity to
have truly terrible seats," Parker said. "I've had bad seats but this
is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverdogs, continuing their tradition of zany promotions,
turned fans away and sent them to a party with discounted food and
beer just outside the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Fans were scheduled to be let in after the fifth inning, once the
game is declared official and the actual attendance is recorded as
zero.</TE>
<TE>   There's some dispute about the actual lowest attendance record,
but radio play-by-play announcer Jim Lucas said the record is the 12
people who braved a rainstorm to see Chicago defeat Troy on Sept. 17,
1881.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa's wife, Sonia, had surgery to repair a deep cut in her
right hand. Sosa sat out the Cubs' weekend series at Atlanta to be
with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She's doing great," he said. "Thank God everything went perfect.
She got surgery already and she's home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball fans are using the Internet to call for a strike of their
own.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of fans have visited at least four Web sites calling for
a boycott of Major League Baseball on Thursday to protest a possible
work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get their attention and let them know there is a
third party that they may not be aware of," said Don Wadewitz, who
designed the Web site calling for the boycott.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a second fan strike Aug. 1 if no contract has been
signed by then. The group is calling for a boycott of one game for
each game canceled.</TE>
<TE>   If the postseason is wiped out again, "It's strike three and we're
out," Wadewitz said.</TE>

<KH>MORNING BRIEFING</KH>
<HD>All-Star Appearance Was Special for Aaron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time the All-Star game was played in Milwaukee, in 1975, it
was also the 24th and last appearance of Hall of Famer Hank Aaron,
whose career began in Milwaukee with the Braves. In his final game,
he represented the Milwaukee Brewers and lined out as a pinch-hitter.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just a shell of myself," he said. "But I still considered
it an honor to have played my last game in Milwaukee."</LD>
<LD>   It was his only appearance as an American League player. In his 23
All-Star games as a Milwaukee/Atlanta Brave, Aaron batted .179 with
two home runs in 67 at-bats.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is baseball's only most valuable player who never
played in an All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   Home, sweet home: Jarrod Washburn, the Angels' 9-2 southpaw, is in
Wisconsin but not for the All-Star game. He took the red-eye home to
tiny Danbury in the northwestern part of the state but will be back
with the team to pitch in Thursday night's game in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he was disappointed that
Garret Anderson was the only Angel selected for tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was right that we only got one guy picked, with
as well as we've played and as many guys as we have doing well," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Everything: When Cincinnati outfielder Adam Dunn was told that
he would be the youngest player in the All-Star game, at 21 years 8
months, and the biggest, at 6 feet 6 and 245 pounds, he grinned and
replied, "And, I'm the best looking, and the smartest."</TE>
<TE>   Arnie's advice: Senior tour pros are permitted to ride in carts,
but Arnold Palmer vehemently opposes the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start complaining about the heat and humidity, the hell
with that," he told USA Today. "Just go home, sit in front of the TV
and have a beer."</TE>
<TE>   Another opinion: Then there is comedian Joe E. Lewis, who when
asked how he played golf, said, "I play in the low 80s. If it's any
hotter than that, I won't play."</TE>
<TE>   Talking the talk: Rick Nash may be only 18, but the first pick in
the NHL draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets is not short on
confidence. When asked to describe his strengths, the left wing from
the Ontario Hockey League said, "Go in the corners, dig the puck out,
forechecking, can score in front of the net, a good talent, and still
comes back in our own end and plays a defensive role too. I think I
bring an all-around game, a Brendan Shanahan type."</TE>
<TE>   Seen in Cincinnati: A fan carrying a sign in Cinergy Field that
read: "4 Reds Tickets $30, 4 Sodas $10, 4 Hot Dogs $15, Ken Griffey
Jr., worthless."</TE>
<TE>   Fair warning: "Clip and save," said Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas
News. "Your grandson will see the day of the 8-foot center in the
NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Former Dodger Kirk Gibson, the National League MVP
in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After Brazil had won the World Cup over Germany, all
of CART's Brazilian drivers cut their hair to match the style of
soccer star Ronaldo, but Rubens Barrichello, their countryman in
Formula One, decided against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't risk it," the Ferrari driver said. "The way my hair is
thinning, I was afraid it wouldn't grow anymore."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Introduce a Pair That Almost Got Aced Out</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Almost-traded Wilcox and Ely welcomed with
Baylor insisting 'we're happy to have them.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers introduced two fresh-faced young men to a room filled
with skeptics Monday. Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely donned red, white
and blue Clipper caps and held up jerseys during a news conference at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Neither player has signed an NBA contract but it's expected that
each will soon put his name on a three-season deal with a fourth year
as a team option. Neither seemed all that comfortable on the dais
with General Manager Elgin Baylor and Coach Alvin Gentry.</LD>
<LD>   Who could blame them?</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers were trying to trade them on the night of the NBA
draft, June 26, trying desperately to acquire point guard Andre
Miller from the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a proposed deal that would have sent Miller and
Cleveland's first-round pick (No. 6 overall) to the Clippers for the
eighth pick and Lamar Odom collapsed. The Clippers selected Wilcox,
from Maryland, eighth and Ely, from Fresno State, 12th.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make one thing clear," Baylor said Monday, prefacing
his introduction of Wilcox and Ely. "There were questions about a
spur-of-the-moment deal, but when it came time for us to draft, these
are the players we wanted to get. That's who we had on our board.
We're happy to have them."</TE>
<TE>   A trade with the Cavaliers for Miller remains a possibility,
although there is nothing imminent. Neither Wilcox nor Ely will play
in the Dada Summer Pro League at Long Beach State, but they will join
some of their new teammates for workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Both players seemed eager to get started. Playing time, however,
could be scarce if they remain Clippers. Both are power forwards and
would play behind Elton Brand, a first-time All-Star last season.</TE>
<TE>   Ely, 6 feet 10 and 260 pounds, probably has a slight advantage
over Wilcox, 6-10 and 221 pounds, because he can also play center.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this misconception that we have all these big guys,"
Gentry said, referring to a logjam at power forward. "It gives us the
opportunity to run guys in and out of the games. When you play Tim
Duncan one night, Shaq [O'Neal] on another and then Chris Webber on
another, you need big people."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about finding sufficient playing time for all his
forwards, Gentry said, "I don't mind having that problem. I would
rather have guys upset about not playing than have guys content about
just getting a paycheck."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, 19, has experience playing his way into the starting five.
He worked his way into Maryland's rotation and led the Terrapins to
the NCAA championship as a sophomore after filling a reserve role as
a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got into it," he said of moving into the starting five
early last season, "I wasn't going to give it back." Of joining the
Clippers, he said, "It's a great team to play with. I think I'll fit
in great."</TE>
<TE>   Ely, 24, played as a youth with Clipper guard and fellow
Chicago-area native Quentin Richardson, but began to wonder while at
Fresno State whether he could join his childhood teammate and friend
in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "The older I got, the more I realized how unlikely it was that I
would get picked," Ely said. "But by staying in school, I learned a
lot. I spent five years with [former Bulldog Coach] Jerry Tarkanian
and that could only help."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul, The 2nd Round"</LD>
<TE>   Authors: Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, Jeff Aubery, Mark and
Chrissy Donnelly</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Health Communications</TE>
<TE>   Price: $12.95</TE>
<TE>   The best-selling "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series consists of
about 50 books that are collections of feel-good stories. This is the
fourth with a sports theme. There is one for the sports fan's soul,
one for the baseball fan's soul and this is the second for the
golfer's soul.</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason two books have been devoted to golf stories:
there are a lot of good golf stories. But maybe not enough to fill
two volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Although this book contains many fascinating stories, readers of
"Chicken Soup for the Sports Fan's Soul" and/or Volume I of "Chicken
Soup for the Golfer's Soul" may be disappointed. This book doesn't
quite match up.</TE>
<TE>   The authors/editors selected short stories from reputable writers
and professional golfers, and also from weekend hackers and ordinary
people.</TE>
<TE>   There are four columns from Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly,
which is a bit of overkill.</TE>
<TE>   However, one of the columns is vintage Reilly. It's about Tiger
Woods keeping a promise to a childhood friend and letting him caddie
for him, enabling the friend to make about $25,000 to help pay for
medical school.</TE>
<TE>   There are two pieces from Miami Herald humorist Dave Barry, who
admittedly is not a golfer. Barry usually is very funny, but not when
he's writing about golf. There is a poignant column from Dan Jenkins,
formerly of Sports Illustrated, who is now a writer-at-large for Golf
Digest, which was involved in publishing this book.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins has two pieces in the book, and the one that stands out is
titled "Thursday Is Men's Day."</TE>
<TE>   He writes a fictional piece about his country club being taken
over by women, and this results in male members being treated as
second-class citizens.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Dial Up for Assistance: Here's Sykora</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim hopes the 25-year-old forward, acquired in
trade for Tverdovsky and Friesen, will add punch to one of the
league's worst offenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Petr Sykora finally answered the telephone Saturday. It had been
ringing periodically at his home in the Czech Republic and he finally
relented.</LD>
<LD>   "The phone had been ringing the whole night," Sykora said. "I
couldn't figure out who would be calling. I finally answered and it
was my agent. He told me I was traded."</LD>
<LD>   Goodbye New Jersey. Hello Anaheim and welcome to the Mighty Ducks,
words that could have caused deep depression in past summers.</LD>
<TE>   But Sykora's arrival may change the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bryan Murray pulled off the Ducks' biggest trade
since the team acquired Teemu Selanne in 1996; the key figures were
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky and left wing Jeff Friesen going to the
Devils and Sykora coming west.</TE>
<TE>   There is still no rush to line up for playoff tickets, and the
Ducks have to at least partially fill Tverdovsky's role of
puck-handling defenseman. But acquiring Sykora and signing free agent
Adam Oates should address the Ducks' biggest problem: offense.</TE>
<TE>   Only Columbus scored fewer goals than the Ducks, who also ranked
last on the power play last season.</TE>
<TE>   With Sykora on the right and Oates at center, left wing Paul
Kariya becomes a bigger threat. And the power play has a point man
(Sykora) and one of the NHL's all-time leaders in assists (Oates).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Oates, who will turn 40 next month, Sykora is 25 and in his
prime.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be different," Sykora said. "In Jersey, they
played four lines. It didn't matter if you were great or not. You
played your role. I'm going to get more ice time than I'm used to, so
it will really be a challenge. But playing with Paul Kariya, that's
not a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Sykora, a childhood friend of Duck defenseman Pavel Trnka, is
coming off a down season. But he still scored 21 goals. He had 35 in
2000-01, including nine power-play goals. He had 15 power-play goals
in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   The adjustment for Sykora will be going from the Devils, who won
the Stanley Cup in 2000 and reached the finals in 2001, to the Ducks,
who have made the playoffs only twice in nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks hope that Sykora and Oates will put them in the
playoffs. They finished 35 points out of the playoffs last season and
needed to make significant moves to keep up in the tough Western
Conference. Dallas, which missed the playoffs last season, already
has signed Bill Guerin, one of the top free agents on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks searched for a point man for the power play all last
season, trying every option. Sykora can fill that role. He played the
point on the Devils' top power-play unit the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "What was sorely missing was scoring and scoring on the power
play," assistant captain Dan Bylsma said. "Our defense is fairly
solid and the goaltending is good. If we could have added 40 more
goals to the power play, we would have been in contention for a
playoff spot. That is obviously what Bryan is searching for right
now."</TE>
<TE>   What Murray needs to search for next is a defenseman with
puck-handling skills. He is unlikely to find one as good as
Tverdovsky, who is among the best defensemen on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky was expendable in part because he and Murray, the Duck
coach last season, did not mesh. With Sykora, the Ducks upgraded
considerably from the disappointing Friesen, who was acquired in the
deal that sent Selanne to San Jose in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The trade frees up about $2 million to use toward a defenseman or
to sign forward Stanislav Chistov, the Ducks' top pick in the 2001
draft. Tverdovsky will make $3.6 million and Friesen $3 million next
season. Sykora, who won the largest arbitration ruling in NHL history
last summer, will make $3.535 million next season.</TE>
<TE>   The other two NHL players the Ducks acquired in the deal will make
less than $1 million--defenseman Mike Commodore ($500,000) and goalie
J.F. Damphousse ($175,000).</TE>
<TE>   "My memories of Jersey are awesome," Sykora said. "They gave me a
chance to play in the NHL. I won a Stanley Cup there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks announced their exhibition schedule, including home
games against Minnesota (Sept. 20), San Jose (Sept. 27), the Kings
(Sept. 29) and Phoenix (Oct. 4). They also play the Kings Sept. 22 in
Bakersfield.... The Ducks signed free-agent right wing Cory Pecker,
who played in the Ontario Hockey League last season.</TE>

<DH>Sanderson is a virtual unknown, but he earned his ESPY
nomination</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaq. Tiger. Barry. Lance.</LD>
<LD>   And oh, yes.</LD>
<LD>   Cael.</LD>
<TE>   The nominees for male athlete of the year at the ESPY Awards show
Wednesday at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood read like a who's who of
sports.</TE>
<TE>   But one name on the list might leave people wondering, "Who's he?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of cool. All those names are all household names," Cael
Sanderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there's my name. Nobody knows how to pronounce it or who the
heck I am."</TE>
<TE>   Sanderson, for the uninformed, is the Iowa State wrestler who went
undefeated throughout his college career, finishing with a 159-0
record.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Shaquille O'Neal and Lance Armstrong have their three-peats
in the NBA and Tour de France. Sanderson is one up on both.</TE>
<TE>   He has a four-peat after winning the NCAA title in his weight
class four consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   Only one other Division I wrestler has won four titles, but
Sanderson is the only unbeaten four-time champion and the only person
named the NCAA championships' most outstanding wrestler four times.</TE>
<TE>   Sanderson is a champion by any name, but people still stumble over
his first name, which is pronounced more or less like that of Cale
Yarborough, the former Daytona 500 winner.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it's not Cal or Carl," Sanderson said. "A lot of
people call me Kyle. Even wrestling fans are no different. It's kind
of like, 'Hey, dude, I thought you'd know.' "</TE>
<TE>   He might not seem to have much in common with O'Neal, Tiger Woods,
Barry Bonds and Armstrong, but look again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know--they're athletes, trying to do the best they can.
That's what I try to do," Sanderson said. "They just get paid a
little more than me."</TE>
<TE>   He was not under such intense scrutiny as they are, but there was
indisputably pressure as Sanderson tried to complete his college
career without a defeat. Sports Illustrated rated that accomplishment
the second-most impressive in the history of college sports, behind
Jesse Owens' four-world-record day in track and field as an Ohio
State sophomore in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   "Pressure, I think, is about the same in any sport," Sanderson
said. "It's all in the mind and the way you choose to deal with it.
The way Tiger deals with it, that's part of his game. That's why he's
the greatest."</TE>
<TE>   One of four wrestling sons of a former high school coach from
Utah, Sanderson didn't set out to go undefeated in college.</TE>
<TE>   "A goal of mine before I started was to win four titles," he said.
"That was kind of a lofty idea, I knew that. But I thought I might as
well go for it and believe I could do it. Going undefeated wasn't
really that important."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime during his sophomore season, people started talking about
the possibility. At his final NCAA tournament in March, it seemed
everyone was. An Iowa public television crew followed him around.
ESPN dropped in.</TE>
<TE>   And with a 12-4 victory over one of his closest rivals, Jon Trenge
of Lehigh, Sanderson completed his undefeated career. The crowd at
Albany, N.Y., gave him a standing ovation that lasted five minutes or
more.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of overwhelming," Sanderson said. "I was kind of at a
loss, emotionally, just because it all had come to a climax and just
ended abruptly. It was something I'd been thinking about for four
years and then it was over."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's hardly as if Sanderson can't remember the last time he
lost. His streak was in collegiate competition.</TE>
<TE>   In freestyle competition--the road he hopes to travel to the
Olympics--Sanderson occasionally takes his lumps.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, at the U.S. trials for the World Championships,
Sanderson lost to Lee Fullhart on a two-point move late in the match
before coming back to win the best-of-three series and the 185-pound
title.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was his first to an American since the 2000 Olympic
trials.</TE>
<TE>   "The streak, that stuff's all over," Sanderson said. "I want to
win a world championship and a gold medal in the Olympics. I'm not
concerned with anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not that ESPY Award, though he's looking forward to the
experience.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Sanderson and Bonds are the only nominees in their
category expected to attend the ESPYs. Armstrong, after all, is
scheduled to be somewhere around Reims, France, and Woods will be
preparing for the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't ever met any of them," Sanderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched them just like everyone else has, on TV."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Closing Ranks Behind Gagne</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Among his peers, Dodger pitcher's emergence as a
relief ace is regarded without surprise, or suspicion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Dodger closer Eric Gagne arrived at his first All-Star game Monday,
seemingly bursting onto the stage from nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   But his show-stopping act has steadily improved, Gagne's All-Star
peers said, helping the Dodgers move atop the National League West.</LD>
<LD>   The stunning success of Gagne was one of the hot topics before
All-Star game workouts at Miller Park, and he handled the national
spotlight as calmly as approaching the ninth inning. The National and
American leagues meet today in the first All-Star game at Miller Park
and the third in Milwaukee, and Gagne fits right in among baseball's
best.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not so much surprised he could [close], he has a 97-mph
heater and that changeup to go along with it, but I kind of sit back
and just marvel at the fact that he's been so dominant," San Diego
Padre closer Trevor Hoffman said. "He really makes our job look
pretty darn easy."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, 26, leads the major leagues in saves despite less than four
months on the job, emerging as the top on-field story of the first
half. He is thriving after two-plus shaky seasons in the Dodger
rotation, converting 32 of 34 save opportunities without a decision,
and has a 1.39 earned-run average in 42 appearances. The right-hander
has overwhelmed the competition, limiting batters to a .167 average
and striking out 62 in 45 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the rest of the NL West to do?</TE>
<TE>   "When a player has got confidence going out there, like what he
feels right now, you feel you're invincible," said Arizona
Diamondback left fielder Luis Gonzalez. "All we can do is hope he
loses that confidence real quick, so we can catch up with [him]."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne said they shouldn't hold their breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I can get three outs in the ninth inning," he said. "I
know I can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Formerly obscure players making strides this season face
speculation about using performance enhancers because former
All-Stars Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco alleged that steroid use is
rampant in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne has become the closer after going 11-14 with a 4.61 ERA in
two-plus seasons as a starter, and players believe he has blossomed
because of fewer innings, maturity and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Gagne felt compelled to address speculation in June, telling
The Times, "I know what I did, I know how hard I worked in the
off-season, and it didn't have anything to do with [steroids]." He no
longer comments on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi said steroid
speculation is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of sickening," he said. "Guys work their butts off
year-round, and now it's, 'He's having success because he's on
steroids.' It doesn't work like that. Guys take a lot of pride in
what they do, and all this speculating gets kind of ridiculous.
People do have great years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no longer a sport where guys report to spring training
and get in shape. Guys are showing up in shape. They're working out
year-round. The talent level has moved dramatically [over the years].
Guys take a lot of pride in what they do. I know it's a hot topic,
but all this speculation is just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers confirmed that Gagne gained fewer than 10 pounds in
the off-season. His fastball increased from about 94 mph to 97 mph,
but players said that should not be taken as a sign. It is not
uncommon for velocity to improve when starters are converted to
relievers and aren't required to pitch as long.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, players said, Gagne isn't some journeyman stiff who
suddenly burst onto the scene. He was considered one of baseball's
top prospects and may have simply turned a corner.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really good starter," said Atlanta Brave center fielder
Andruw Jones. "I faced him and he was always tough. The difference is
he's making [fewer] mistakes now than when he was starting.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a totally different pitcher now because he pitches
[smarter]. He faces three or four batters and pitches better to those
guys than when he faced the [whole lineup]. That's why he's
different."</TE>
<TE>   Boston Red Sox right-hander Derek Lowe took the opposite route to
becoming the AL starter. The former closer, booed off the mound at
Fenway Park last season, is 12-4 with a 2.36 ERA, earning his second
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I was here two years ago as a reliever, and this team, I came in
here with no expectations," Lowe said. "To be here, starting an
All-Star game, is more than I could have anticipated. Coming in here
and looking at that lineup, it's going to tough, but it's going to be
a great challenge."</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee Manager Joe Torre, guiding the AL for the fifth
time, tabbed Lowe when Pedro Martinez backed out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro Martinez, in my opinion, is one of the best pitchers in
baseball," Torre said of the three-time Cy Young Award winner. "I'm
sure Derek would have understood if we decided to go with Pedro
because of what he's done in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great game to honor people [for breakthrough
seasons], but I'm not sure we would have done that. It sure would
have been very difficult to not seriously consider Pedro. I'm glad I
didn't have to make that decision."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Manager Bob Brenly is leading the NL for the first time.
He said his choice was simple, naming Diamondback 14-game winner Curt
Schilling.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling, leading the majors in victories, is scheduled to start
for the second time. He backed out of last season's start because he
pitched two days before the game, but plans to take the turn this
time.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Many theories have been developed on why home
runs are going out in bunches, but no one really knows for sure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ted Williams ended his career in 1960 by hitting a home run into
Fenway Park's right-field seats in his final at-bat, the "Splendid
Splinter" stood third on the all-time home run list, and his total of
512 made him one of only four members of the 500 home run club.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 42 seasons later, membership in the group has climbed to
17, and the latest additions, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, have
maintained the exclusive feel of the club.</LD>
<LD>   But that distinction appears temporary. In this homer-happy era,
when fan interest in the All-Star home run derby has come to rival
the popularity of the All-Star game, baseball is undergoing an
unquestionable power transformation.</LD>
<TE>   Statistics of baseball legends are being surpassed with
unprecedented quickness and several never-before-seen developments
have left the game's historians struggling for explanations, such as
how to interpret the fact that four players--Sammy Sosa, Rafael
Palmeiro, Fred McGriff and Ken Griffey Jr.--are on pace to join the
500-homer club within a year.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on? That's a loaded question, with an answer shrouded
by innuendo attached to the allegations and admissions of steroid use
and obscured by multiple theories.</TE>
<TE>   Has the quality of pitching been depleted too severely by
expansion? Are new, small ballparks to blame for big, warped numbers?
Is someone doctoring the baseballs or bats?</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, strange things are happening," said Seymour Siwoff,
the president and a 40-year employee of the official major league
statistician company, Elias Sports Bureau Inc. "The story here is,
what has happened to baseball? How did this suddenly happen? I have
no answer. There is conjecture about many things, but not one of them
is conclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Siwoff speculates the ball is being manufactured differently and,
in the absence of steroid testing, says it is unfair to disparage
players such as Bonds and Sosa with unfounded accusations while
failing to appreciate their magnificent hand-eye coordination.</TE>
<TE>   But Siwoff, one of baseball's most respected number-crunchers,
admits baseball's statistics reveal a mighty story.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a new major league record was established when 62 home
runs were hit in one day.</TE>
<TE>   The number of players who've produced 30-homer seasons bulged from
13 players in 1986 to 47 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Of the top 100 home run hitters of all time, 20 are active
players.</TE>
<TE>   When Bonds was 29, he led the NL with 46 homers in 1993. At 37, he
established the single-season record with 73 homers last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The game has certainly been affected by home runs. There are more
long home runs and guys are certainly moving up the all-time list
faster," said Jerome Holtzman, Major League Baseball's historian and
a Hall of Fame baseball writer from Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't care if guys are taking steroids or not. The numbers
are genuine. You can't eliminate them. You can't put an asterisk next
to them, can you? More hitters are bigger and stronger these days. If
they are taking these drugs and if they want to risk their bodies so
they can hit 20 more homers a year, that's their decision."</TE>
<TE>   Spokespersons for several members of the 500-homer club, including
Hank Aaron, Harmon Killebrew, Frank Robinson and Reggie Jackson, said
those players are refusing to answer questions about the presence of
steroids in baseball and if they believe their legacies are being
diminished by this power surge.</TE>
<TE>   One member's spokesman explained: "If they're not banning it,
there's really nothing he can say about it. He's not pleased that
it's going on. He didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "But for him to say anything about it would make him look like he
was crying about it, and he refuses to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Siwoff said Williams deserves to be eternally regarded as a great
of the game, regardless of his drop from No. 3 to No. 12 on the home
run list since his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy who was so superior to so many others," Siwoff
said. "It's unfair to number them one, two or three. Just call him a
great hitter, the greatest student of the game and the art of hitting
ever. He was a virtuoso. Not only was he great, he understood why he
was great.</TE>
<TE>   "In my lifetime, Mickey Mantle hit a ball farther than any player
I've seen and Jimmie Foxx could hit the ball a mile too. Those guys
like that will remain legendary."</TE>
<TE>   The 60-home run barrier, untouched for nearly 37 years after Roger
Maris hit his record 61 in 1961, has been eclipsed six times since
1998--three times by Sosa, twice by McGwire and Bonds' 73.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Cincinnati Red outfielder George Foster hit 52 homers. No
one hit 50 again until Detroit first baseman Cecil Fielder in 1990.
There have been 15 50-homer seasons since 1995 and three players,
Dodger outfielder Shawn Green, Colorado first baseman Todd Helton and
Cleveland first baseman Jim Thome, hit 49 homers last year.</TE>
<TE>   Siwoff points to 1987 as the beginning of the power era. In 1986,
there were 18,545 runs scored and 3,813 home runs hit. In 1987, runs
increased to 19,883 and homers spiked to 4,456.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of an altered baseball, wound tighter to allow greater
distance, permeated the '87 season.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Gessley, the public relations manager for St. Louis-based
Rawlings Sporting Goods, said his company has made only two changes
to the official major league baseball since it started making it in
1977.</TE>
<TE>   One change was cosmetic, altering the stamp on the surface from
the signatures of the NL and AL presidents to that of Commissioner
Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Rawlings, which manufactures the parts and pieces of the
baseballs in the U.S., relocated its baseball sewing facility from
Haiti to Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   "The humidity may be a little different, but we still test balls
the same way we have, with the same standards," Gessley said.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2000 study, University of Rhode Island scientists analyzing
baseballs from the 1963, 1970, 1989, 1995 and 2000 seasons concluded
there was a greater concentration of rubber in the cores of the 1995
and 2000 balls and that the windings in those balls were made with
synthetic materials, not wool.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball commissioned a study of 1999 and 2000
baseballs led by James Sherwood last year. Sherwood found no
significant differences in those balls, although he said
specifications should be tightened by Rawlings because two balls
deemed legal traveled as differently as 49 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of four teams since 1993 through expansion has
predictably resulted in bloated earned-run averages, from 3.51 in the
NL in 1992 to 4.63 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And since 1982, 17 new ballparks have been built. The architects
have been kind to hitters. Only four of those 17 parks require a home
run to dead center field to carry more than 410 feet. Two of those
are homer-mad Coors Field in Colorado and Houston's Minute Maid Park,
which offers a left-field wall that's only 315 feet from home plate.</TE>
<TE>   Siwoff said it's also important to note the introduction of hard
maple bats in 1998 and more emphasis from managers on homers and less
on disciplines such as bunting, the hit and run and stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   "You also have to look at the idea that has always been out there:
that guys come into their own," Siwoff said. "I've read stories about
McGwire spending a lot of time sitting with scouts when he was
injured [during the mid-1990s] and how that might have helped him
against pitchers. I saw something about [Arizona Diamondback
outfielder] Luis Gonzalez [who hit 57 homers last year] and how
learning to pull the ball really helped him in that park.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't condemn guys until you know all the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully, who has called the team's games
since 1950 and was a 1982 Hall of Fame inductee, said: "That's all
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   "The fans like home runs, the fans like action. I can remember
those games in the '60s when the pitching mound was so high ... there
were just so many low-scoring games. I can remember walking out of
the stadium so many nights and thinking, 'Did the fans really get
their money's worth tonight?' Unless you were fans of Sandy Koufax
and Bob Gibson, I don't know if that was the case."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the average game has more than 10 runs and, on a night like
last week, nearly four homers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know if what we're seeing now is better," Scully
said. "It's like beauty--it's all in the eye of the beholder--but
I've always thought the best score possible was 6-5, with the home
team scoring two runs in the bottom of the ninth to win.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't compare eras in this game. All you can do is appreciate
what you have in the era you are in."</TE>

<HD>Union Avoids Setting Date</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Officials, nonetheless, remain prepared for
strike. Fehr says all options discussed at meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSEMONT, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The executive board of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. did
not set a strike date Monday, but many of the estimated 30 players
who attended a five-hour meeting with union officials said they
remained prepared for the possibility of a work stoppage this season.</LD>
<LD>   "On the basis of history, you always have to be prepared, and
that's the message I'll take back to my team," Cleveland pitcher Paul
Shuey said.</LD>
<LD>   Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said it was "neither the
purpose nor result" of a regularly scheduled board meeting to set a
strike date but added, "All options were discussed."</LD>
<TE>   Sources familiar with those discussions said that if union
officials conclude that the setting of a strike date is the only way
to accelerate negotiations with the owners, or is the union's only
option if convinced the owners plan to declare an impasse and
unilaterally implement new work rules, the players will display their
normal solidarity in support.</TE>
<TE>   "A strike is a last resort," Fehr said. "Hopefully, in the next
few weeks, we can get down to the type of substantive discussions
that we've not had to this point."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr will be in Los Angeles next week to continue updating all 30
teams--he has met with seven so far--while he and his staff also
continue to negotiate with management.</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely, he suggested, that the union will consider setting
a strike date before he is finished meeting with the teams--at the
end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The timing is similar to that of 1994, when the executive board
met on the eve of the All-Star game and refrained from setting a
distracting strike date.</TE>
<TE>   About two weeks later, however, the union--suspecting that the
owners were intent on implementing new rules--called for a walkout
Aug. 12. The deadline failed to produce an agreement, and the
resulting 232-day work stoppage ended only when a federal judge found
the owners guilty of illegal labor practices and threw out their
implementation.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain whether the union is again thinking of an August
strike date, or would delay until September. However, several
players--acknowledging the complexity of the issues and the slow pace
of the talks--expressed cautious optimism regarding an agreement ("If
we honestly didn't think a settlement was possible, we'd have set a
date today," Minnesota infielder Denny Hocking said), and Fehr seemed
to narrow the crux of negotiations to revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   He called it "the single biggest issue" and said, "If we can
resolve it, I think it would make the other issues [among them a
luxury tax on high payrolls and a worldwide draft] easier to handle."</TE>
<TE>   The high-revenue clubs transferred $167 million to the
lower-revenue clubs last year. Fehr chronicled the history of the
current proposals, and although he accused the owners of going
backward from where they were last June, he suggested that on the
basis of numbers, a compromise would seem possible. The owners,
including the commissioner's proposed $85-million discretionary fund,
are seeking to transfer about $298 million from the high-revenue
teams. The union, concerned about inhibiting the clubs that drive the
salary market, is at $228 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sides differ on the method of distribution, with union
officials believing the owners' plan actually pushes the low-revenue
teams "even further from the middle," but an agreement on numbers,
they concede, might lead to an agreement on method.</TE>
<TE>   The officials concede that there seems to be less rancor and a bit
more optimism than there was at a similar point in 1994, but they do
not minimize the complexity of the issues, including steroid testing,
and the history of mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   The owners, in addition, may be determined to implement new work
rules no matter what the union proposes, ignoring the potential
damage of another work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Rob Manfred, management's lead lawyer, said he
welcomed the players' decision not to set a strike date.</TE>
<TE>   "We're anxious to get back to the table," he said.</TE>

<HD>Complex to Bear Home Depot Name</HD>
<DH>Business: AEG agrees to 10-year, $70-million deal with
company for title rights at ever-growing facility in Carson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Anschutz's desire to find a new home for his Galaxy soccer
team has developed into plans for a sports venue so large and
ambitious that it will have a naming rights deal that rivals recent
contracts involving the Philadelphia Eagles and Houston Astros.</LD>
<LD>   The Anschutz Entertainment Group will announce today it has
reached a 10-year, $70-million agreement with The Home Depot for name
rights to the ever-growing National Training Center in Carson.</LD>
<LD>   The $130-million complex, which broke ground in February, will
include a 27,000-seat soccer stadium, a 13,000-seat tennis stadium, a
cycling velodrome and, it will also be announced today, a track and
field stadium expandable up to 30,000 seats.</LD>
<TE>   "We have been preaching that this facility is going to be
revolutionary, a brand new dream of sports in this country, and this
deal is very representative of that," Tim Leiweke, AEG president,
said Monday. "We have found in The Home Depot a company that shares
our vision for the potential of this facility."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement includes a clause stipulating that AEG will purchase
$30 million of building supplies from the Atlanta-based home
improvement chain.</TE>
<TE>   The Home Depot National Training Center will be constructed on 85
acres at Cal State Dominguez Hills. The center is due to be completed
in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond the business-to-consumer appeal to the individual who has
shelves to hang up, there's a business-to-business play being made
here, where The Home Depot can say they helped build that facility
and they can tell that story over and over to other businesses," said
David Carter, principal owner of Los Angeles-based Sports Business
Group and a USC sports business instructor.</TE>
<TE>   The naming rights contracts signed by the Eagles and Astros each
are longer in duration, but the $7 million a year AEG will get is
$300,000 higher annually than the deal the Eagles signed with Lincoln
Financial and $1 million better than the Astros' agreement with
Coca-Cola for Minute Maid Park.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Anaheim Sports' contract with Edison International
requires an annual payment of $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the deal is so lucrative because Robert L. Nardelli,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of The Home Depot,
realizes AEG's ambitions for the center, which will be the Galaxy's
regular-season home, training center for U.S. men's and women's
soccer teams, a venue that is expected to host U.S. Tennis Assn.
events, and now a stadium that is expected to host major track and
field events.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Leiweke said he is negotiating for the center's
planned Olympic velodrome to be the home for USA Cycling athletes who
compete in track racing, which accounts for 12 of the 18 cycling
events in the Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think that in Southern California, where a high
percentage of the competitors in these sports are from, we should
have a complex in place to finally put the U.S. on the map by hosting
world-class events," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not only going to create a facility that allows athletes
to take steps up in competition, but we want to have a facility where
the world's best and most prestigious events will be held."</TE>
<TE>   The track and field stadium will have 5,000 permanent seats and
can be expanded by 25,000 using mobile temporary seating sections
that will be shifted among the center's venues.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the track and field facility allows for grander
challenges, like pursuing bids to host the 2006 International Assn.
of Athletics Federations World Cup, the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials and,
perhaps, the 2009 World Championships. The World Championships and
World Cup have never been held in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get one of the two and maybe both, I promise,"
Leiweke said. "And when we host it, it will have an amazing,
significant impact on the sport in this country. That's what the NTC
is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Even at 30,000 seats, the track stadium will lack the capacity
typically reserved for World Championships, but a top U.S. Track and
Field official said the IAAF has expressed interest in putting the
meet in Carson. The 2006 World Cup bid is expected to be determined
in September, before this year's event in Madrid. If Carson wins, it
is likely to receive the U.S. Track and Field Championships in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Carson is also seeking to become a hub for cycling. Sean Petty,
vice president of marketing for USA Cycling, said negotiations to
move the organization's track-racing operation from Colorado Springs,
Colo., to Carson are "on the fast track," and could be settled within
two months.</TE>
<TE>   Petty said USA Cycling needs assurances the center will be
equipped with a 250-meter covered velodrome with adequate dormitories
and sports medicine facilities for the athletes. Leiweke said he will
meet those requests and estimated the cycling facility will cost $10
million.</TE>
<TE>   Petty said representatives from the Switzerland-based Union
Cyclists International are interested in holding their World
Championships in Carson. The event hasn't been in the U.S. since
1986.</TE>
<TE>   The strong embrace of Olympic sports has the center positioned to
be named one of four U.S. Olympic Training Centers, U.S. Olympic
Committee spokesman Mike Moran said. The others are in Colorado
Springs, Lake Placid, N.Y., and Chula Vista, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "There are active talks about that designation, Moran said. "We're
fully supportive of what AEG is doing at the center. Our central
mission is to improve our athletes and a primary objective is to
bring international events to the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Moran said the center's development has caught the attention of
the Olympic community.</TE>
<TE>   "Oddly enough, even though Los Angeles lost out in its bid to
become one of the four U.S. finalists for the 2012 Summer Games, this
complex near Los Angeles may assist our chances of getting the Games
[in the U.S.] in 2012," Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke hinted of plans to add facilities for other Summer Games
sports, including volleyball and softball. Already the center has
attracted the NFL's San Diego Chargers, who will move their summer
training camp to Carson in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   AEG, an Anschutz subsidiary, owns Staples Center and all or part
of 17 sports franchises, including the Galaxy and the NHL's Kings.
Leiweke announced last month that AEG was backing off from an earlier
plan to build a new football stadium in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said the magnitude of the National Training Center naming
rights deal could haunt AEG should it decide to re-enter the NFL
discussions and seek public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The ramifications would be people asking, 'Why should there be
any type of corporate welfare for you when you can potentially sell
the naming rights of your NFL stadium and make two or three times
this?' " Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Home Depot, which ranks second to Wal-Mart among the nation's
largest retailers, enjoyed a popular advertising campaign during the
Winter Games, featuring employees such as two-time medal-winning
speed skater Derek Parra.</TE>
<TE>   An AEG source said The Home Depot will receive additional exposure
in the form of marquees that will be visible from the 405 and 91
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "This really could be a panacea for Home Depot," said Dean Bonham,
a sports marketing expert. "In this deal, you hit everyone from women
to men with a variety of income brackets and year-round action."</TE>

<HD>Warriors, Dunleavy Sign Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Dunleavy, the third overall pick in the NBA draft, signed with
the Golden State Warriors on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Dunleavy, a 6-foot-9 forward, was a member of Duke's 2001 national
championship team. He averaged 17.3 points for the Blue Devils last
season as a junior. He then made himself eligible for the draft.</LD>
<LD>   The Warriors wouldn't discuss the terms of Dunleavy's three-year
contract, but the deal is in line with the rookie pay scale
determined by the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Last year's No. 3 overall pick, Memphis forward Pau Gasol, signed
a three-year deal worth $9.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy is working out with the Warriors' summer league team,
which begins play Wednesday in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State still hasn't hired a coach for next season, though
Dunleavy's father, Mike, is one of the top candidates for the post
currently held by interim coach Brian Winters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Allen Iverson met with police to discuss
allegations that the NBA All-Star threatened two men at a
Philadelphia apartment complex last week.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson's attorneys said in a statement they have provided
information to police "and will continue to do so as needed." The
statement did not say whether Iverson denies the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frank Williams, a first-round pick in the NBA draft, signed with
the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, out of Illinois, was the 25th overall pick in the draft,
chosen by the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Denver then traded the rights to Williams, along with Antonio
McDyess and a 2003 second-round pick, to New York for Marcus Camby,
Mark Jackson and the draft rights to Maybyner Hilario.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of Williams' contract were not disclosed.</TE>

<HD>Barcelona Ready to Sign Riquelme</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Roman Riquelme, billed as the next big star to come out of
Argentina, is poised to join Barcelona in Spain from Boca Juniors in
Argentina for $12.8 million, Spanish newspapers reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "All we have to do is put on paper what we have already agreed
verbally," Pedro Pompillo, a Boca Juniors vice president, told the
Barcelona sports daily Mundo Deportivo. "There shouldn't be any
problems now."</LD>
<LD>   Riquelme, a 24-year-old midfielder, narrowly missed being selected
for Argentina's World Cup team, but has helped Boca Juniors win the
Copa Libertadores twice since joining the club in 1996 and also led
it to the Toyota/Intercontinental Cup in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   His arrival at Nou Camp could lead to the departure of Brazilian
midfielder Rivaldo, if not this season then certainly in the near
future.</TE>
<TE>   A Russia Revolution</TE>
<TE>   The Russian Football Union appointed Valery Gazzayev as its
national coach and Gazzayev, 48, immediately promised a turnaround in
the way things are done.</TE>
<TE>   "My first steps as head coach will be to make the national team
open to the media and to the public," he said in Moscow. "I am for
complete openness and democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Gazzayev, who will continue as coach of CSKA Moscow, the Red Army
team, until December, replaces Oleg Romantsev, whose World Cup team
and tactics were branded as being "from the Jurassic age" by a
Russian media angered by the team's first-round ouster.</TE>
<TE>   New Coach for Slovenia</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia has selected Bojan Prasnikar as its new coach in place of
Srecko Katanec, who resigned after the country's first-round
elimination from the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Prasnikar, 49, has twice previously coached the national team. He
agreed to a four-year contract and will simultaneously coach six-time
Slovenian champion Maribor.</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia plays Italy in a friendly in mid-August before beginning
qualifying play for Euro 2004 in September.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman Hangs On</TE>
<TE>   David Seaman, the England goalkeeper whose blunder gave Ronaldinho
the goal that earned Brazil a 2-1 World Cup quarterfinal victory,
said that he does not want to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman, 38, told SkySports News in England that he would like to
play one more season for Arsenal if a contract agreement can be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened at the World Cup was a big setback, but you've got
to keep with it as a goalkeeper," Seaman said. "It's like [Germany
goalkeeper] Oliver Kahn found out--[he] played a great tournament and
then he makes a mistake and that's what people remember."</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink Takes Over PSV</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Guus Hiddink, the Dutchman who coached South Korea to
fourth place at the World Cup, agreed to become coach of the Dutch
first division club PSV Eindhoven for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, 55, whose coaching career was launched as a PSV assistant
in 1983, later went on to lead the club to three Dutch championships,
three Dutch Cups and the European Champions Cup in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to be back and to work with a warm and ambitious club,"
Hiddink said. "Those were the most important reasons for me to come
back. I am a happy coach."</TE>
<TE>   Venables Resurfaces</TE>
<TE>   Terry Venables, former coach of both England and Australia, agreed
to leave the television studio, where he has served as a pundit for
the last couple of years, and become coach of Leeds United of the
English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Venables, 59, was wooed in whirlwind fashion, Leeds having first
contacted him at his home in Spain as recently as Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The club finished fifth in the league last season, thereby failing
to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League, a fact that
contributed to the ouster of former coach David O'Leary.</TE>
<TE>   K-League Record Crowds</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's K-League opened its 2002 season in front of record
crowds as World Cup fever showed little sign of abating.</TE>
<TE>   Teams averaged close to 30,000 a game during the opening weekend,
compared to last season's average of 13,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Pusan I-cons drew 34,000 for their home game against the Ulsan
Tigers; there were 31,000 on hand to see Chonbuk Motors beat the
Anyang Cheetahs in Jeonju, and similar crowds were reported in other
K-league cities.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal's Cisse Moves On</TE>
<TE>   Aliou Cisse, the 26-year-old defender who led Senegal into the
quarterfinals of the World Cup, has agreed to join Birmingham City of
the English Premier League from Paris Saint Germain of France for
$6.9 million. Details of the four-year contract have yet to be
finalized.</TE>

<HD>Award Will Honor Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The All-Star MVP award will be named after Hall of Famer Ted
Williams, who died last week at age 83.</LD>
<LD>   The first winner of the Ted Williams Award will be picked after
tonight's game at Miller Park, Major League Baseball announced on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   There will also be a tribute to Williams during the game.
Williams, the last player to hit better than .400 in a season, played
in 18 All-Star games, batting .304 with four homers and 12 runs
batted in.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again, when it comes to hitting home runs, Sammy Sosa is
second.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi overcame Sosa's dazzling display of longballs early
in the All-Star home run derby and easily beat him, 7-1, in the final
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   After Sosa hit seven 500-foot homers in the first two rounds,
including three that left Miller Park on the fly, the Chicago Cub
slugger could only go deep once in the final.</TE>
<TE>   "Yellowstone might be the only park that could hold him," Giambi
said. "He's the best of the best."</TE>
<TE>   But Sosa couldn't defeat Giambi.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa, the runner-up in the NL homer race in three of the last four
years, finished second in the Derby for the second straight year. He
lost to Arizona's Luis Gonzalez last year in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "I came up a little bit short, but it's no big deal," Sosa said.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa easily put on the best show of the night. With flashbulbs
popping before every swing and the crowd of 41,732 chanting, "Sam-my!
Sam-my!"</TE>
<TE>   Sosa hit the ball a mile in the first round--literally. His 12
homers traveled 5,719 feet, including the first two balls hit out of
the two-year-old ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's longest drive traveled 524 feet and landed in the middle of
Bernie Brewer's slide deep in left-center.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's home run king and the leading sluggers in each league
were eliminated quickly. Barry Bonds, who hit a record 73 homers last
season, was knocked out with just two in the opening round.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Lance Berkman, who leads the majors with 29 homers, hit
only one, and Texas' Alex Rodriguez, who leads the AL with 27, had
two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curt Schilling of Arizona gets another chance to start for the
National League, this time against Boston's Derek Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling, whose 14 wins lead the majors, was tabbed as the
starter last year, too. But the five-time All-Star was a late scratch
and didn't even get in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no less an honor than it was the first time being at one of
those games," said Schilling, who started the 1999 game in Boston.
"It's a lot of fun. It's an honor and a privilege."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (12-4) made the All-Star game as a reliever in 2000. Put in
the starting rotation this year, he's flourished, leading the AL with
a 2.36 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "To be here starting an All-Star game is more than I could have
anticipated," Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Garret Anderson and Manager Mike Scioscia, serving as
a coach, are the only Angels on the American League squad despite the
club's strong first-half performance in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The second-place Angels trail the leading Seattle Mariners by only
three games, but Anderson is not surprised several of his teammates
were overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing, but it's not an indication of what we've done
this year as a team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always going to be some people who get left off the
roster, and I've been part of that for a few years. This year, I was
fortunate enough to put up numbers across the board, which gave me a
great chance to be a reserve."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson believes playing on the West coast is a factor in
All-Star selections.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't have the same exposure," he said. "You watch ESPN
and national TV stations, you see a lot of what happens on the East
coast because that's where those stations are based. We just go
unnoticed because of lack of exposure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American League Manager Joe Torre might have a harder time dealing
with his rotation of five shortstops as opposed to the nine pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure they will all play shortstop," Torre said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll get as many in as I can. With the National League rules,
there will be a lot of double-switching going on to keep the pitchers
from having to hit. So probably for that regard, we'll get most of
the shortstops in."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez will start the game for the AL, with Derek Jeter, Nomar
Garciaparra, Omar Vizquel and Miguel Tejada backing up. Torre said
Jeter might only pinch-hit after spraining his left knee Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago isn't one of the 29 first-time All-Stars this week
but it's easy to understand why he feels that way.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giant catcher is back at the All-Star game for
the first time in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a rookie again," Santiago said.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 years, I don't know how to explain it. I feel like a
kid."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago, the 1987 NL Rookie of the Year, was almost out of
baseball after breaking his knee and pelvis in a car crash four years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   But Santiago has battled back and will play in his fifth All-Star
game today.</TE>

<HD>A Baseball Great's Legacy May Be Frozen in Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball great Ted Williams, a symbol of the game's bygone era, has
in the days since his death become the center of an uproar more
befitting science fiction.</LD>
<LD>   According to one side of his family, the former slugger's corpse
has been quietly transported from a Florida funeral home to a
cryonics lab in Arizona. They say it's part of a plan by the other
side to freeze the remains of the man known as "Teddy Ballgame" with
the idea of someday selling his DNA and cloning baseball's next great
hitter.</LD>
<LD>   "His body was packed in ice, it was filled with blood thinners,
and he was flown out," said Mark Ferrell, Williams' son-in-law.
"We've been going crazy here."</LD>
<TE>   Williams' daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, told a Boston television
station, "My dad's in a metal tube, on his head, so frozen that if I
touched him it would crack him because of the warmth from my
fingertips."</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams, who was born of a different mother and is
Ferrell's half-brother, allegedly made the arrangements. He could not
be reached for comment Monday. Officials at the funeral home and the
cryonics lab refused to confirm or deny the story.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy will move into a courtroom as early as today, when
the executor of Williams' estate plans to ask a Florida probate judge
to decide if the remains are to be frozen or cremated.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' will clearly states his desire to be cremated, his ashes
to be commingled with those of Slugger, his beloved Dalmatian, and
scattered across the Florida Keys, Mark Ferrell said.</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic a public squabble would erupt around a man who,
despite his fame, balked at the spotlight. Williams, who died Friday
at age 83 in Florida, preferred the solitude of fishing. During his
playing days, he let his bat do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 61 seasons have passed since he hit .406 in 1941, a
watermark no player has since equaled. Now the idea of creating
another .400 hitter through cloning causes medical experts to
alternately cringe and laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Though researchers can extract DNA from tissue and store it for
long periods of time, the process of freezing all or part of a body
creates rapid crystal formation that can harm genetic material, said
Dr. Laurence Kedes, director of USC's Institute for Genetic Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the DNA were effectively stored, medical science is still
far from translating it into an outfielder who can see the stitches
on an approaching fastball, as Williams claimed he could.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you had a gene and you knew this was the gene for Ted
Williams' quick reflexes, how do you change the donor egg and sperm?"
Kedes asked. "That's still science fiction. We are still not capable
of modifying a human gene."</TE>
<TE>   The facility where Williams' corpse is allegedly being stored,
Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., makes no claims
about preserving DNA for future cloning. And any attempt to do so
would raise numerous ethical questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Our society, at least for the time being, has pretty much made up
its mind," said Dr. Stanley Korenman, an associate dean for ethics at
the UCLA medical school. "It's repugnant to think of altering the
human genome simply to enhance someone's characteristics, to make
them see a baseball better."</TE>
<TE>   If Williams' daughter is correct, the remains of the "Splendid
Splinter"--another nickname--currently reside at Alcor, one of
numerous cryonics facilities that exist at the fringe of mainstream
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Freezing or "suspending" a corpse most often involves the use of
liquid nitrogen at minus-196 degrees Centigrade, said Jim Yount,
chief operating officer of the American Cryonics Society, a Mountain
View, Calif., organization that promotes research and information
about cryonics.</TE>
<TE>   The process is meant to preserve the corpse until medical science
finds a cure for the disease that killed the person, or a means for
combating the aging process.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a simplistic leap of faith that takes current knowledge and
misinterprets it," Kedes of USC said. "I just have to chuckle."</TE>
<TE>   An Alcor executive declined to discuss the technology used at her
lab and said the foundation never comments on its "patients."</TE>
<TE>   Alcor opened for business in Southern California in 1972,
initially operating from a large van. As the foundation attracted
more members, it moved to an industrial space in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside County Coroner's office took notice in 1987 after
the foundation decapitated the corpse of an 83-year-old woman, Dora
Kent, and froze her head. The coroner's office labeled the case a
homicide after claiming to have found a lethal dose of barbiturates
in Kent's headless body.</TE>
<TE>   The sedative was injected after death to preserve brain cells,
Alcor executives said.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities demanded the head for testing, Alcor moved it to
a secret location. A raid of company headquarters uncovered numerous
rifles, pistols and a plastic jar containing Kent's severed hands.
The weapons were legal and, after a judge blocked further searches,
the case was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   By 1994, Alcor had purchased a building in Arizona and was
continuing to freeze bodies.</TE>
<TE>   According to its Web site, 49 patients are suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Freezing and maintaining a head costs $50,000; a body costs
$120,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Cryonicists are not people with an unusual fixation on cold
temperatures," the foundation's Web site states. "None of us want to
be frozen. We are simply individuals who enjoy being alive, and who
want to see the future and all its wonders."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby-Jo Ferrell was born of Williams' first wife.</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent marriage produced another girl, Claudia, and John
Henry, who has been no stranger to controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old moved into his father's home in Inverness, Fla.,
when the elder Williams became seriously ill in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say he brought a history of failed business ventures. They
say he dominated his father and shooed away old friends.</TE>
<TE>   There were snickers this summer when John Henry apparently used
the family name to grab a spot on a Boston Red Sox minor league team
in Fort Myers, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   It was a low-level team, but John Henry was much older than the
usual prospects, had little history of playing organized baseball and
scant discernable talent.</TE>
<TE>   After a short time with the team, he ran into a dugout rail while
chasing a foul ball and broke a rib.</TE>
<TE>   Now he could find himself competing in the legal arena, battling
with his half-sister over the fate of their father's corpse.</TE>
<TE>   The cryonics industry will monitor the unfolding story with
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "I especially cringe if there is a fight among relatives," Yount
said. "Assuming he was frozen, it also discourages anyone of fame or
wealth from doing this because they won't want their names dragged
through the news."</TE>
<TE>   Others are watching with equal parts disdain and bemusement.
Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy has written about the case of
"the Frozen Splinter." Mainstream medical experts shake their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Stupid," Korenman of UCLA said. "Stupid is what I would call it."</TE>

<DH>Cycling: Defending champ finishes second stage in relaxed
fashion and is in fourth overall; Spain's Freire wins stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SAARBRUECKEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong enjoyed a relaxed ride in Monday's stage of the Tour
de France, but some riders struggled to get to the finish.</LD>
<LD>   "It was nervous today, but quite easy," the three-time defending
champion said.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong finished the second stage in 61st place, and slipped to
fourth in the overall standings. He isn't expected to bid for the
lead until the race reaches the mountains next week.</LD>
<TE>   Oscar Freire of Spain won the 112.2-mile trek, sprinting over the
line just ahead of the main pack that included Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering I didn't even want to take part [in the Tour de
France], it's not so bad," Freire said. "[My teammates] told me it
was such a big race I had to go--I guess they were right."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss rider Rubens Bertogliati retained the leader's yellow jersey
he took from Armstrong on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Texan is taking the early, flat stages easy. But for some,
even Monday's ride was nearly too much.</TE>
<TE>   Norway's Thor Hushovd shared the lead for much of the day but
finished last after stopping several times with cramps. At one point,
he hunched over his handlebars in pain and had to have his thigh
massaged by a trainer. He was cheered on by fans as he struggled to
the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised by the huge crowds--I was impressed," said
Armstrong, favored to win a fourth consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands lined the stage route between Luxembourg and the west
German city of Saarbruecken to cheer him and other riders,
particularly Erik Zabel. One woman had "Zabel" written on her belly
in the pink colors of his Telekom team.</TE>
<TE>   But Freire, the world road champion, spoiled the party by
outflanking the German in the final few yards to win in 4 hours 19
minutes 51 seconds. Australia's Robbie McEwen placed second and Zabel
finished third, in the same time as Freire. The main pack also had
the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel, who turned 32 on Sunday, was wearing the green jersey
awarded to the Tour's fastest sprinter as he entered Saarbruecken.</TE>
<TE>   "To return to my country in the green jersey, it's still not too
bad," he told France-2 Television.</TE>
<TE>   Freire said riders can't always win on their home turf.</TE>
<TE>   "In cycling, when you arrive in your home country, you indeed have
more desire to win," Freire said. "But the other rivals also want to
win."</TE>
<TE>   There were four crashes in Monday's stage. One of them involved
Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teammate Benoit Joachim, who wasn't
seriously hurt. Spain's Samuel Sanchez was taken to a hospital in
Saarbruecken for X-rays after injuring his right knee and right elbow
in the second crash.</TE>
<TE>   Bertogliati said he hadn't expected to retain the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I had a bit of luck to retain the yellow jersey for a
second day," Bertogliati said. "If I hold it again after tomorrow's
stage, I'm going to go buy a lottery ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Today's third stage moves into France, a 108.19-mile run from Metz
to Reims, the capital of the Champagne region.</TE>

<KH>WNBA MIKE TERRY</KH>
<HD>Cooper Is Taking It in Stride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those accustomed to seeing Michael Cooper prowling the sidelines
like a starving panther, agonizing over any perceived bad call
against his Spark team, these are strange times.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper this season is so calm, you want to check his pulse. Once
he sits down, he puts his chin in his left hand, then rarely moves
until the game ends--win or lose.</LD>
<LD>   Mention this to Cooper and there is a quick smile. He does not
want people to think he cares any less about winning since the Sparks
won the WNBA championship last year. But winning that title did
change him.</LD>
<TE>   He is less animated, more reflective. He learned that the game
does not have to be micromanaged. That, sometimes, it's OK to sit
back and watch.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team knows what to do, as far as winning [goes]," Cooper
said. "We as a coaching staff try to get them as prepared as possible
before a game, and then let them do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we were trying to figure out who could get it done, who
we hoped could get it done. This year we know who can get it done. If
I were to become less serene, it would be to some players who make
bad fouls or unforced turnovers. But no, this year has been easier
because they know how to win now."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Glenn McDonald agrees that Cooper is more trusting of
the players.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, you want to show your players you are as involved as
they are," said McDonald, who has been Cooper's top assistant since
2000. "Last year, when we knew we were supposed to win the
championship, everybody was on edge. This year, he lets them take
care of business. He's still intense, but he wants them to know it's
a game, not the end of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Cynics could argue that Cooper, 70-10 since taking over the Sparks
in 1999, can afford to be more relaxed because he has, arguably, the
best team. How hard could it be to roll out the ball to Lisa Leslie,
DeLisha Milton, Tamecka Dixon, Mwadi Mabika and Latasha Byears?</TE>
<TE>   But those people apparently don't remember Cooper as a player. A
1978 third-round pick of the Lakers from the University of New
Mexico, the 6-foot-6 Cooper, who never weighed 200 pounds, was a
defensive warrior with a capital W.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack McKinney told me that was the best way for me to make the
team," Cooper said of the Laker coach at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Pride drove him every night to try to frustrate the best NBA
scorers, from Julius Erving and Alex English to Michael Jordan and
Larry Bird.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to keep them from scoring 20 points on me," Cooper
said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change he brought to the Sparks was a defensive edge.
As a player he wanted to be inside an opponent's head and under his
skin from jump ball to final horn. He wants that from his players
now. A year ago, he prodded Leslie into her finest WNBA season. She
was the most valuable player in the regular season, All-Star game and
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper didn't want to radically alter his approach this season,
but he knew some things would have to change if the Sparks were to
repeat.</TE>
<TE>   He expected opponents to be more determined to keep Leslie from
dominating offensively and he was right. Leslie is double- and
triple-teamed in the post, which means she has to pass more. She is
averaging 16.1 points, down from 19.5.</TE>
<TE>   So other Sparks are emerging as offensive threats. Mabika and
Milton have shown the ability to drive to the basket and are not
reluctant to take big shots late in the game. Dixon can be off and
on, depending on her aching feet, but remains one of the league's
better one-on-one players..</TE>
<TE>   Cooper is also pleasantly surprised by another way his team has
evolved.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as communication, it's more of a 'look' now," he said. "It
doesn't have to be a stern look or humorous look. But we can look at
each other without calling timeouts and understand what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cooper's tirades earned him six technical fouls. The
league assesses a fine between $100 and $125 for each technical.
Cooper has only one technical foul this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the league getting in my pocket," Cooper said with a
chuckle.</TE>
