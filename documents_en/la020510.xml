<LD>The world's obsession with Ozzy Osbourne and his family seems to have
reached its peak this week. The motley clan's MTV reality series "The
Osbournes" (currently in negotiations for a second season) landed the
family on numerous magazine covers and talk shows. They were
everywhere. Ozzy and Sharon owned the spotlight at the White House
Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday in Washington, sending gossip
mavens into overdrive. It was the British rock star's first encounter
with President George W. Bush. (At the sight of the president,
Osbourne reportedly grabbed his own long locks and shouted: "You
should wear your hair like mine!" Bush blushed and nodded.)</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Pocket Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster,
announced a two-book deal associated with the show. A paperback that
will be the show's "companion book" is due out in November, and a
hardcover memoir narrated by each family member (even the oldest
daughter Aimee) is due out next spring. The deal was reported as
being worth $3 million but Pocket Books spokesman Seale Ballenger
said the figure is "not that high."</LD>
<LD>   Bantam Books, an imprint of Random House Children's Books, joined
the fray as well, announcing Thursday that it plans to publish an
authorized biography of the Osbournes that is due out July 23.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't turn on a TV or radio or a newspaper without seeing the
Osbournes," Ballenger said. "It's such a sort of oddball mix of what
the American family is all about .... It's addicting."</TE>
<TE>   '24' Actress Makes Time for Vacation</TE>
<TE>   In a part of the world where locals have so little interest in
Western culture that the term "actor" is happily meaningless, actress
Leslie Hope briefly stepped into daily life on the Amazon. She
returned with an adventure traveler's spate of tales describing
tarantula-infested nights, monkey eyes peering out from the brush and
rudimentary toilet facilities. This was Hope's summer vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The co-star of the critically acclaimed Fox series "24" spends her
on-screen time as wife to Kiefer Sutherland's character (she has been
kidnapped and raped and has killed someone, discovered she was
pregnant, confronted her husband's ex-mistress and suffered from
amnesia). In her free time over the last four years, Hope has left
that kind of drama behind, traveling to out-of-the-way places in
Cuba, Peru and Turkey. In two weeks, she is heading to China for a
backpacking tour of Lhasa, Xian and Tibet. "I don't travel high-end,"
she said in a phone interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Her Amazon adventure was part of a three-week trip to Ecuador last
year with boyfriend actor Colin Ferguson, a week of which involved
living with the Huaoroni tribe. To reach the village, the couple flew
into a "tiny little town which makes Tijuana look like Paris," Hope
recalled. "It was a rough place." Then they traveled in the rain for
nine hours by motorized canoe, arriving to find a tiny community of
about 70 residing in thatched huts and living off the yucca plant.
Since most of the female villagers were topless, "it took them two or
three days to realize that I was a woman," Hope said.</TE>
<TE>   For visitors, the villagers had arranged a special hut, elevated
on a platform, and a toilet a few yards away, mounted on concrete and
partially disguised by a garbage bag. Inside the hut, Hope and
Ferguson slept in their tent "with tarantulas crawling all over it,"
Hope said. During her late-night bathroom runs, armed with only a
flashlight, Hope recalled, "You'd just see glowing eyes everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the trip was over and, flashing
forward a century or two, she found herself at the Ritz-Carlton in
Pasadena "talking about a television show and [enjoying] cookies on
plates and Evian. It was such a huge culture shock."</TE>
<TE>   Fans Making a Dash</TE>
<TE>   for Dot Heads</TE>
<TE>   What price Jerry Bruckheimer? Well, the bid on EBay Thursday
morning had reached $20.50, with nine people vying for his dot head.</TE>
<TE>   "Dot heads" are the small ink portraits that appear in the Wall
Street Journal, in lieu of photos. The paper put the originals up for
auction in April, and so far, Bruce Springsteen leads the bids at
$272, ahead of Tom Cruise at $58, Jerry Seinfeld at $113.61, and even
Elvis at $260.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, "Lucille Ball was the top-priced head," said Aaron
Bedy, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Journal.
"Now, Springsteen is leading the pack and should go for well over
$1,000 ....Roseanne Barr is doing surprisingly bad."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier rounds of the online auction, which ends Monday, featured
sports and business personalities. This week, it's a selection of
people in entertainment, except for one mistaken head: Michael
Meyers.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the Austin Powers Michael Myers," Bedy said. "I think
this guy is a civil rights [advocate]. He was mistakenly pulled into
the auction."</TE>
<TE>   The drawings, known within the Journal as "hedcuts," take up to
six hours to create, with artists rendering their drawings as closely
as they can to a photo of their subject, said Noli Novak, a 15-year
veteran of the style and one of the six illustrators.</TE>
<TE>   Working from retouched photos (in which the person's flaws or
wrinkles have been removed) can be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the face that's challenging but the way the photo is
taken," Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   But the photo is the only guide.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how people see themselves in the mirror."</TE>

<HD>Kevyn Aucoin: Celebrating Faces</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Kevyn Aucoin, a face was a canvas. Armed with eye shadow, mascara
and powder, he transformed faces into impeccable, detailed, flawless
works of art, whether it was his mother's mug, a secretary's or Cindy
Crawford's.</LD>
<LD>   He made it look easy and effortless. The legacy of his work can be
seen in his three books, "The Art of Makeup," (HarperCollins, 1994)
"Making Faces," (Little, Brown, 1997) and "Face Forward" (Little,
Brown, 2000). Aucoin died Tuesday in New York from complications from
a pituitary brain tumor. He was 40.</LD>
<LD>   "I've watched a lot of makeup artists who would do a certain face
and that same face would be on everybody," said Joanna Schlip, who
met Aucoin 15 years ago when she assisted him in Milan on an Italian
Vogue fashion shoot.</LD>
<TE>   "He individualized the face. He didn't try to make everybody the
same. He brought out the beauty in each woman instead of looking for
flaws to fix," she said. Schlip recalled how Aucoin transformed Lisa
Marie Presley's face into Marilyn Monroe's in his "Making Faces"
book. "He could see Marilyn in Lisa Marie and brought that out. That
was one of the things I picked up from him. I see what's beautiful
about a client."</TE>
<TE>   Collier Strong, a 13-year makeup artist, remembers Aucoin's
artistry. "He really elevated the world's opinion of makeup. He used
makeup not for enhancement but for transformation."</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a makeup artist or in the industry, you knew Kevyn; he
was such a presence. He just contributed so much," said makeup artist
Carol Shaw, who never met Aucoin. "Thank God his books are around. I
know he's up there doing Audrey Hepburn's makeup as we speak."</TE>

<HD>Busting the Piggy Bank</HD>
<DH>Indulgent parents are spending whatever it takes to bring
up baby in high style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From all appearances, the women nibbling bunny-shaped cookies and
chatting about their children could have been gathered at a baby
shower. But the table full of hand-knitted cotton sweaters and finely
smocked dresses wasn't displaying newly bestowed gifts. These were
samples of an exclusive European baby clothing line, Emma T., and the
occasion was an invitation-only trunk show in the courtyard of Jamie
Tisch's Better Things boutique in West Hollywood. In between their
appointments with personal trainers, manicurists and decorators, the
designer-labeled mothers with nary a sign of fatigue, fat or frizzies
scooped up the $50 sweaters and $75 dresses.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't feel guilty shopping for your kids," said Tisch, wife
of film producer Steve Tisch who sponsored the trunk show and was
buying for their three toddlers. The A-list Hollywood insider and the
other mother shoppers are like many parents who've had it with blah
basics and can afford today's haute tot couture.Whether they buy a
$450 itty-bitty Burberry trench coat, an $85 Banana Republic cashmere
cardigan or a $2,000 hand-painted Silver Cross pram, today's
pampering parents are going positively buggy for babies and kids.</LD>
<TE>   For the money, they earn bragging rights and a stylish
sophistication that's light-years beyond the classic Buster Brown and
Carter's that have stocked kids' closets for generations. Cash
registers are ringing as shoppers respond to slicker styles that
feature superior workmanship and fabrics, a combination that has kept
children's apparel immune from the ills plaguing every other segment
of the luxury apparel business.</TE>
<TE>   Cool baby booty is leading shoppers back into stores, where sales
of infant and toddler wear increased 5.7% last year, making it the
only apparel category that posted an increase. Shoppers are attracted
to an improved variety of clothes for older children, too, as the
very idea of indulgent dressing has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury used to mean some sort of impractical finery that sentenced
little girls to suffer in stiff skirts and boys to struggle in
suspender pants. Now the good stuff is an airy $60 linen shirt, a
comfy $50 designer T-shirt or a one-of-a-kind playsuit that weathers
mud and lots of laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Trunk show shopper and interior designer Elizabeth Dinkel
frequents upscale Neiman Marcus and French boutiques Bonpoint and
Tartine et Chocolat for her two children because the clothing
"teaches them an appreciation for beautiful things." The Beverly
Hills mother, wearing pearls and a Gucci bag, adds, "I appreciate
finer things. Therefore, I want my children to have them too."</TE>
<TE>   A well-dressed child may not guarantee a future art aficionado,
but the dashing tykes have symbolic value for their parents, said
Angela Johnson, editor of Youth Markets Alert, a New York trade
publication. Luxurious children's wear is "a way of displaying your
success," she said. "In some circles, dressing a kid in more special
clothes is a way of showing, 'I have a kid and a career, and I manage
all of this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not every mother of means considers the trend healthy. Actress and
writer Heather Thomas tries not to indulge her 22-month-old daughter
with clothes above $100. "I think it's an obsession," she said, while
scanning the Emma T. sweaters. "I think human beings have switched
their perfectionism to their children, having failed to meet the
standards themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Setting the pace is "the spoiled generation," the baby boomers,
who are the most affluent and influential of all consumer groups,
said Marshal Cohen, president of NPD Fashionworld, a Port Washington,
N.Y., market research firm: "We are bestowing our standards on our
kids." And as boomers become grandparents with each turn of the
calendar, they're generously giving gifts, which constitute nearly
40% of children's apparel purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, pricey and precious baby gifts were
affectionately known as "grandma bait," said Linda Jeffcott,
president of Haute Baby, which has luxury boutiques in Beverly Hills,
Dallas and Houston. "This is a family thing now. Aunts, uncles,
cousins, best friends, husbands--they all want to be in on it now,"
she said. Her boutiques attract celebrities such as Jodie Foster and
Geena Davis, who can easily afford her most expensive items, such as
$100 jean jackets or $750 bedding ensembles. But these aren't her
only clients.</TE>
<TE>   "People of all incomes want something special. Even if they are on
a hamburger income, they are still going to put the baby first. That
is not part of the 'me' era that we saw for the last 10 years," said
the 23-year veteran of the children's apparel industry.</TE>
<TE>   Even in these uncertain times, kids are coming first, said NPD's
Cohen. "People are thinking differently today than they were a year
ago," he said, noting how the terrorist attacks strengthened the
country's growing pro-family sentiment. The material expressions of
our changed priorities are still easy to see.</TE>
<TE>   "The status symbol of the '80s was a car. Of the '90s, it was the
home. The status symbol of the 2000s is the family," said Cohen.
"That includes where you take your family on vacation and buying the
luxury SUV instead of the sports car."</TE>
<TE>   Today's parents are opting to show their love the old-fashioned
way by including children in more activities, including formerly
off-limits resort vacations, restaurant meals and Saturday night
shopping. Parents of these more visible children have been demanding
more sophistication ever since they were expecting, said Laurie
McCartney, chief executive officer of Estyle.com, an online retailer
of baby and maternity gear.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you are pregnant doesn't mean you lose your sense of
style," she said, "and that translates to your children."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney, a mother of two, shares the same disappointment in
mainstream fare as her customers. "You go to the top four or five
retailers, and all their stuff looks the same," she said. "After a
while, people are looking for something different."</TE>
<TE>   The hard work of parenting hasn't changed, but today it's been
made to seem glamorous. Pregnant women are encouraged to show off,
not hide, their rounded bellies in trendy crop tops and stretchy slip
dresses. Magazines from Ebony to People present banner news of
celebrity newborns, famous stay-at-home moms and elegant nurseries
that set the gotta-have-it standard.</TE>
<TE>   With parents of lesser means happily financing finery, children
never need to leave the lap of luxury. They can lounge on a $769
custom easy chair from www.babystyle.com or on cozy if less costly
furniture from the Pottery Barn Kids or new Bombay Kids stores and
catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's furniture or fashion, many of the same vendors offer
children's versions of adult products.</TE>
<TE>   Kids' clothes used to have so little cachet that adult clothing
companies gladly ignored the market. Then a wave of established
grown-up designers and businesswomen became parents, and bingo!
Babies are hip.</TE>
<TE>   Motherhood motivated Jackie Robbins, co-founder of www.flip
floptrunkshow.com, to begin stocking children's sizes of the site's
adult sandals and flip-flops. Young mother Pamela Skaist-Levy,
co-founder of Juicy Couture, simply shrank their mommy-sized sweats
for Juicy Baby, their new toddler collection. This spring, Tarina
Tarantino delivered a daughter and Bambino, a diminutive version of
her jewelry and hair accessories collection.</TE>
<TE>   Cool kid clothes don't always come with triple-digit price tags.
"At all ends of the market, from the high to the low, people can buy
much more fashionable clothing for their children," said Michele
Silver, editor in chief of Earnshaw's, a trade publication for the
children's wear industry.</TE>
<TE>   Even mid-priced major manufacturers are trying to keep up by
offering a handful of slightly more expensive and stylish items,
Silver said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents may be willing to indulge in top-priced designer
children's fashion because a Baby Dior jeans and jacket can cost $200
or $300 apiece, a bargain compared with the nearly identical adult
version, which typically costs nearly 10 times more.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers at all price levels have discovered sales relief in
children's wear. At the besieged Gap, the company's Baby Gap and Kids
Gap divisions have consistently outperformed the adult brands,
particularly in the aftermath of September's terrorist attacks.
Though even big league players such as JCPenney are luring customers
with new and improved children's departments, the most interesting
children's clothing is coming from nimble niche players who dare to
tweak the conventions of kid clothing.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s Anamyn Allen reconstructs adult-sized vintage clothing into
$28 rock concert T-shirts and $30 collegiate sweatpants for her
Claude children's collection. Pasadena designer Ava Walsh has found a
national following for her mid-priced Spunky Punk line, which offers
leopard, camouflage and pony prints in trendy silhouettes.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most unusual approach comes from Australian baby
photographer Anne Geddes, who is famous for her portraits of children
as flowers and bugs. She recently started selling $10 to $60 infant
wear on her www.anneged des.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Though most of the clothes are classic children's wear, her
bunny-ear cardigans and bunny-tail sleepers turn infants into tiny
rabbits that beg for a photo. As a photographer, she imagined
snapshots of the adorable outfits and how her designs could aid a
photo shoot. For example, her oversized baby blankets are flannel
because it minimizes marks on tender infant skin.</TE>
<TE>   Cute, after all, doesn't always guarantee comfort. The best
designers also anticipate parents' reactions to the clothes. That's
something Walsh has learned as she miniaturizes trendy adult clothes
for Spunky Punk.</TE>
<TE>   "It still has to be innocent," she said. "You don't want your baby
to look like Britney Spears."</TE>

<LD>TAKE MY ADVICE</LD>
<LD>   Letters to the Next Generation From People Who Know</LD>
<LD>   a Thing or Two</LD>
<TE>   Edited by James L. Harmon</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster</TE>
<TE>   254 pages, $18</TE>
<TE>   "Take My Advice" is based on the zany premise that a grab bag of
people between, say, 25 and 50 will have something useful and
interesting to say to the class of 2002 as it steps out into the
world.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, James L. Harmon has, over the last 10 years,
assembled this collection of pontificating essays from a group of, as
his publisher says, "major thinkers, social gadflies, underground
artists, provocateurs, raconteurs, film auteurs, cyberpunks, academic
outlaws, icons, iconoclasts, cranks, visionaries, fashionistas,
cultural critics and our greatest living poets." The goal is to
create "a subversively witty book destined for cult status among
discerning, critical and savvy young people around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Beware of the wit who announces he is now going to be witty. Cast
a skeptical eye on the book that brashly aspires to "cult status."
Hailed too soon, it may turn out to be a dud.</TE>
<TE>   "Take My Advice" is a dud. Worse, it is a pompous and boring dud.
True, among the 78 essays and prose snippets there are a few
worthwhile pieces. Martha Nussbaum, the respected University of
Chicago professor of philosophy, in a couple of pages delivers some
sound if unexceptionable words of wisdom, as befits a philosopher:
"Do not despise your inner world ... We are all going to encounter
illness, loss and aging, and we're not well prepared for these
inevitable events by a culture that directs us to think of externals
only, and to measure ourselves in terms of our possession of
externals."</TE>
<TE>   With her little essay Nussbaum provided an amusingly sultry
snapshot of herself as a college freshman. Joe Dallesandro, however,
appears in an unamusingly sultry photograph of himself as an
apparently naked actor, a role he performed in various states of
undress in Andy Warhol films. His essay, which goes on for about six
pages, is titled "If You Have to Be Beautiful." "Beauty," he says,
apparently speaking for himself, "is fun. It has its place. But don't
mistake it for self-worth."</TE>
<TE>   The writer Camille Paglia contributed seven pages of 50
quotations, ranging from Julius Caesar's "I came, I saw, I conquered"
to Jesus' "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
God, the things that are God's"; from Lewis Carroll to Oscar Wilde to
Rhett Butler: "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." These quotes,
she solemnly writes, "fascinated me in my student years and still
echo in my mind like bossy voices from the beyond." She does not
appear to be trying to make a funny spoof of her assignment.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of his nine pages, Bruce LaBruce, a filmmaker and
writer, concludes, "I'm still the reluctant pornographer, but in this
era of rampant assimilationism and gay conservatism, I see
pornography as the last refuge of gay radicalism."</TE>
<TE>   Poet Rita Dove advises: "Read to advise yourself that you are not
alone. And stay curious." The activist John Zerzan reports a Sun
Microsystem scientist's conclusions that, in 30 years, genetic
engineering, nanotechnology and robotics will become fully
self-replicating. "Come alive, and fight back!" Zerzan exhorts.</TE>
<TE>   And, among the contributions, the inscription at the Delphic
oracle, "Know Thyself," makes more than one appearance in "Take My
Advice." It turns out that this cult book is just another college
graduation speech, a Polonius trying to be hip.</TE>

<DH>Giraffe's death raises questions of animal privacy rights
in a dog-eat-dog world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Animals aren't usually known as sticklers for privacy. They don't
wear clothes, they lick themselves in public and, if an amorous dog
decides to have an intimate moment with your aunt's leg, it rarely
bothers to rent out a honeymoon suite at the Ritz-Carlton.</LD>
<LD>   But things are changing. Thanks to a mysterious death in
Washington, animals could soon be entitled to the same privacy rights
as humans.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble started when a gassy, arthritic giraffe named Ryma
keeled over at the National Zoo earlier this year. The official cause
of death was listed as tympany, a digestive ailment in which
cud-chewing animals cannot belch excessive gas from their stomachs.</LD>
<TE>   There was just one hitch. Tympany is common among dairy cows but
rarely kills giraffes. A suspicious Washington Post reporter asked
for medical records on the giraffe.</TE>
<TE>   But zoo director Lucy Spelman refused, saying disclosure of the
records would violate the giraffe's privacy rights. In a letter to
the Post, she said the same privacy principles that protect
physician-patient relationships also apply to veterinarian-giraffe
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that zoo officials see no ethical problems with letting
Internet surfers spy on their beasts via a "Naked Mole-rat Cam," a
"Panda Cam" and a "Giraffe Cam."</TE>
<TE>   And never mind that most legal experts scoff at the notion of
animal privacy. Eric Glitzenstein, an animal-protection attorney
whose clients have included circus elephants and polar bears, called
the concept of critter privacy rights "mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   So why would the National Zoo make such a claim? Is it trying to
hide an unsavory chapter from Ryma the giraffe's past?</TE>
<TE>   To find out, we interviewed the only other giraffe we know,
Geoffrey, the Toys R Us mascot. "Ryma was murdered," Geoffrey said
flatly, puffing on a cigarette. "Think about it. He lived in
Washington, just a few blocks from the White House. And he had a long
neck. Get it? Ryma was 'Deep Throat,' the anonymous source who helped
Woodward and Bernstein unravel the Watergate scandal during Richard
Nixon's presidency."</TE>
<TE>   We had to admit the theory made sense. Why else would a zoo owned
by the prestigious Smithsonian Institution cover up an animal's
personnel file, except to protect national security? And why else
would the Washington Post suddenly drop its investigation of a
mysterious animal death, unless it would mean revealing that the
paper's star reporters based their entire Watergate series on
information from a 17-foot-tall mammal with a 21-inch tongue and a
brain the size of several pingpong balls?</TE>
<TE>   Even if Ryma wasn't Deep Throat, withholding his records for
privacy reasons could set a dangerous precedent. What if other
animals start claiming privacy rights?</TE>
<TE>   For example, in New York City, dogs could file lawsuits forcing
the city to build sidewalk animal restrooms so pooches no longer have
to relieve themselves in public. These Porta-Poodle restrooms would
have doggy-door entrances and fire hydrants in each stall.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, celebrity animals like Mr. Ed, Flipper and Scooby-Doo
could file invasion-of-privacy lawsuits to stop supermarket tabloids
from publishing embarrassing tales about their drug abuse ("Party
Animal Morris the Cat Enters Betty Ford Clinic for Catnip
Addiction"), illnesses ("84 of 101 Dalmatians Afflicted with Worms!")
and affairs ("Tony the Tiger in Secret Tryst With the Exxon Tiger!").</TE>
<TE>   And Beverly Hills pets might decide that nudity is a violation of
their privacy rights and obtain court orders requiring their owners
to buy them Armani wardrobes.</TE>
<TE>   It might sound far-fetched, but judges are already showing undue
sympathy to animal-rights causes. This week, the World Wrestling
Federation changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.
after a London court said the initials WWF could only be used by the
World Wildlife Fund.</TE>

<LD>Breakfast in Bed</LD>
<LD>   Sunday is Mother's Day. Maybe you will treat your mother to
breakfast in bed just like the mother in this painting. It was
created by Mary Stevenson Cassatt, an American painter who lived in
France and became famous for her beautiful paintings of mothers and
their children.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Pennsylvania in 1844, Cassatt attended the Pennsylvania
Academy of the Fine Arts. After that, she moved to Europe to further
follow her dream of being an artist. She settled in Paris and became
a student of Edgar Degas and a close friend of Camille Pissarro. Both
of these men were Impressionist painters and Cassatt began painting
in this style as well.</LD>
<TE>   Impressionism is a school of painting that began in France.
Impressionist painters use short brushstrokes of unmixed colors to
capture the effects of lights. Some people think the paintings look
"blurry." Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley are
also famous Impressionist painters who worked between 1867 and 1886.
Cassatt was one of the few women accepted into this tight group of
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Cassatt spent many years painting mothers and their children.
"Breakfast in Bed" is one of her most famous pictures on this
subject. It shows a mother and child on a bed. The mother holds and
gazes adoringly at her small child while the child looks with
curiosity into the world. It expresses a tension that often exists
between parents and their children. The parent wants to hold onto and
protect the child, while the child wants to break free and go off to
explore.</TE>
<TE>   For all her lovely paintings of mothers and children, Cassatt
never became a mother herself. She decided early in life not to marry
and raise a family so that she could concentrate on her work. Cassatt
lived in France until she died in 1926.</TE>
<TE>   You can see "Breakfast in Bed" in the Huntington's Scott Gallery
as well as many other beautiful paintings. For museum information,
call (626) 405-2141 or visit www.huntington.org.</TE>

<HD>A Farewell to Literary L.A.'s Black Sparrow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Black Sparrow Press, California's preeminent literary publisher, has
sold the rights to its three leading authors and will halt operations
July 1, according to its founder and editor, John Martin.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Ecco, an imprint of News Corp.'s HarperCollins, has
purchased the California publisher's rights to 49 books by Charles
Bukowski, John Fante and Paul Bowles, as well as the rights to five
unpublished collections of poetry by Bukowski, who died in 1994.
Fante, who died in 1983, wrote fiction and screenplays, including the
classic Los Angeles novels "Wait Until Spring, Bandini" and "Ask the
Dust." Bowles, who died in 1999, was a writer, composer and poet,
particularly admired for "The Sheltering Sky." Ecco previously has
published seven of his books and now has acquired six more from Black
Sparrow.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Martin nor Daniel Halpern, Ecco's longtime editorial
director, would comment on the purchase price, but a source close to
the deal said it "involved seven figures." Halpern and Martin said
they are continuing to discuss Ecco's possible acquisition of other
authors from Black Sparrow's extensive backlist, as well as its
contracts with selected contemporary writers, including L.A. poet
Wanda Coleman.</LD>
<TE>   Both publishers also stressed that their agreement had been
reached with the cooperation of Linda Bukowski and Joyce Fante, the
writers' widows.</TE>
<TE>   "I started Black Sparrow 36 years ago to publish Bukowski, and
things just grew from there," said Martin, whose Santa Rosa-based
press helped make the German-born Los Angeles writer one of the 20th
century's bestselling poets. "Then, about six weeks ago, I got a call
out of the blue from Dan Halpern, who asked if I would be interested
in selling Black Sparrow. We talked on and off for a few weeks, and
then it dawned on me that I am 71 years old and my last vacation was
in 1974. Since then, I've worked seven days a week. So, I thought,
what the hell!"</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins, he said, "came up with a number that astonished me.
So, even though they purchased just three authors, they paid as if
they were buying the whole press."</TE>
<TE>   Although Martin is trying to persuade HarperCollins to take a few
more of his authors, he said, he has also lined up a third party,
whom he declined to name, to take over his backlist, keep it in print
and sign contracts with his living authors for their next books. "So,
it's an all-around good deal for everyone," he said, "including my
three employees, who will get pretty generous severance packages."</TE>
<TE>   Halpern, whose imprint also publishes the literary magazine
Antaeus, said he initially approached Martin about Bowles' books.
However, the talks soon expanded to include Bukowski and Fante.</TE>
<TE>   Halpern said Ecco's "goal is to use these two authors to celebrate
Los Angeles and to make contact with all the serious readers there
who have been overlooked and neglected as a market by New York
publishers. One thing we want to do is to stage an event to celebrate
Bukowski, Fante and John Martin, though John hates the idea of
including him so much I told him he could attend in disguise."</TE>
<TE>   Acutely aware that he has acquired the crown jewels of a local
cultural icon, Halpern is at pains to point out that he is "from Los
Angeles--Van Nuys, actually--so even though I've spent half my life
on the other coast, I can be trusted. I'm fully aware that there's
nothing else like Black Sparrow in California--or anywhere else in
the country, for that matter. It's one-off from the imagination of
John Martin."</TE>
<TE>   If it were not true, the story of Black Sparrow's beginnings would
be the stuff of literary legend: In 1966, Martin was the 35-year-old
manager of a Los Angeles office-supply company, a passionate
bibliophile and reader of modern literature. At about that time, he
discovered Bukowski's poems, a handful of which had appeared in
barely circulated magazines. Gripped by their impact, Martin drove to
the writer's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Bukowski, who then was working as a mail sorter, would later
recall that he was on his "ninth or 10th beer of the morning," when
he opened the door of his tiny apartment to an earnest stranger, who
inquired whether the poet had any other work he might read. Bukowski
directed his visitor to a closet stacked with manuscript pages. To
the poet's disgust, Martin declined a proffered beer and sat down to
read. After some time, he looked up and made Bukowski an offer:
Martin would pay the writer $100 a month for the rest of his life if
he would agree to quit the post office and write full time. Stone
sober, Martin had decided to become a publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month later, Martin received a package in the mail
containing the manuscript of Bukowski's first novel, "Post Office."
The would-be publisher raised capital by selling his collection of
D.H. Lawrence first editions and began to publish Black Sparrow
books, though he kept his job at the office-supply house for another
18 months "because I had a wife and a child." Since then, the press
has gone from strength to strength, consistently profitable without
ever accepting a grant or subsidy. Martin's wife, Barbara, has
designed all Black Sparrow's books in an elegant format.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as part of the deal with Ecco, Martin will return to his
first literary love. "I've agreed," he said, "to edit five additional
books of poetry containing the bulk of the 800 unpublished Bukowski
poems, which he thought of as his best work. From the time we met, he
sent me everything he wrote, and when he wrote a poem he really
liked, he put a star or a check mark on it, which meant I was
supposed to put it aside. His idea was that we would continue to
publish a book of his a year, even after he was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already edited the first one and sent it off to
HarperCollins for January publication. So, come July 1, I'll be here
all by myself, back where I was at the beginning--alone with
Bukowski."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Philip L. Fradkin is the author, most recently, of "Stagecoach:
Wells Fargo and the American West," a social history of the
frontier's most influential financial institution.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on a revisionist look at the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake and the fire which followed. My working title is 'The City
That Nearly Destroyed Itself,' and it will be published by the
University of California Press in 2006. It is revisionist history in
the sense that it argues that it wasn't the earthquake and fire that
really destroyed San Francisco, but the foolishness of the people who
ignored their region's history of quakes and fires and built a
crowded, major city without adequate water supplies on the end of a
long peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "When the earthquake struck and touched off the fires that did all
the real damage, there was no water to use, so the military and the
fire department fought the blazes that ultimately consumed
three-fourths of the city by dynamiting the buildings in the fire's
path. In fact, that tactic actually spread the blaze. I've been
working on this project for two years in my role as a consultant to
UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library, which has a grant from the California
State Library to construct an online archive of its 1906 materials."</TE>

<LD>Glamorous folkloric gowns, saucy swimwear and even a combination of
Cleopatra and '80s singer Siouxsie Sioux sashayed down the runway at
the Otis College of Art and Design scholarship benefit Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1,000 guests gathered at the Beverly Hilton for the 20th
annual fund-raiser for the school founded in 1918. They were treated
to the largest Otis fashion show ever, which included the junior and
senior fashion design class projects. Fifteen industry experts,
including fashion legend Bob Mackie and avant-garde design newcomer
Jeremy Scott, mentored the classes through their projects.</LD>
<LD>   Mackie told his students to "create a showstopper," said fashion
design senior Jennifer Hong. Scott urged his students to make one
outfit from two different eras, which resulted in such creative
blends as punk 16th century queens and 1940s gangster geishas. On
Monday, display windows at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills will
feature a selection of the fashion projects.</LD>
<TE>   The event raised $750,000 for Otis students, 78% of whom receive
financial aid. The college also granted its Creative Vision awards to
Seventeen magazine publisher Linda Platzner, Ocean Pacific chairman
and chief executive Richard Baker and Mattel Inc. president for
boys/entertainment Matt Bousquette.</TE>

<TE>   and Fund-Raising</TE>
<TE>   Fashion and fund-raising--peppered with drag queen high jinks on
the catwalk--merged in the men's shop at Neiman Marcus in Beverly
Hills last week. By evening's end, the Washington, D.C.-based AIDS
Action Foundation, an educational and charitable organization, netted
$120,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with Neiman Marcus is a dream," said David Wexler, the
foundation's board chairman and an attorney with the Beverly Hills
law firm Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman about the store's sixth annual
dinner, auction and fashion show attended by more than 200 guests.
"All I have to do is get people there and Neiman Marcus does
everything else."</TE>
<TE>   The event is one of three conducted annually; the other two are
held in Washington and Houston. But the Neiman Marcus show, complete
with over-the-top drag queens in waitress outfits and hunky models in
everything tight for spring from Dolce &amp; Gabbana to Versace, is the
foundation's biggest draw.</TE>
<TE>   "We had men willing to stand and not have dinner," said John
Martens, Neiman Marcus' vice president and general manager--and an
AIDS Action Foundation board member--about last-minute guests who all
were quite nicely escorted to tables. By drag queens, of course.</TE>

called "Decked Out," are $7 ... Long Beach City College's fashion
design department will present its "Roll Out the Red Carpet" show and
awards at its 26th annual event May 23. The 7:30 p.m. show will be

<HD>Strikeout Queen of Sherman Oaks</HD>
<DH>This Little Leaguer has a passion for pitching and an
impressive record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marti Sementelli is getting roughed up by the Reds. She took the
mound in the fourth inning with a 3-2 lead, but it is now the top of
the fifth, and her Mariners are trailing 5-3. With one out and a
runner on first, No. 11 steps up to the plate.</LD>
<LD>   Marti remains poised, confident. She digs around on the mound with
her right foot, then sweeps the dust off the pitching rubber. This is
her obsession. Before games, she goes out with a rake, carefully and
methodically working the sand as if it were a Zen garden.</LD>
<LD>   She faces the batter, glances to her right, where her father/coach
Gary Sementelli is crouched down in front of the bench flashing
signs. She goes into her stretch, purses her lips and fires.
Fastball, low and away. No. 11 shows bunt but misses. Strike one.</LD>
<TE>   At age 9, Marti is the only girl in the minors division of the
Sherman Oaks Little League, and at 4-foot-1, 53 pounds, she's also
the smallest, but in her 2 1/2 seasons in the program, she has
amassed impressive statistics. In 137 innings, she is one strikeout
short of 300. That's not unheard of in Little League; still, it's
more than twice the number of strikeouts per inning as Major League
strikeout king Nolan Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Her statistics are unofficial, compiled by her dad, whose passion
for the game is spelled out in one letter, the "B" on his beloved
Boston Red Sox cap. People who wear the "B" are bonded by three
things: heartbreak, denial and a genetic repugnance for the New York
Yankees. They are, above all, people of faith, and although the Sox
have not won a World Series championship since the year Woodrow
Wilson was elected president, they believe each spring that happy
days will return with autumn.</TE>
<TE>   The BoSox gene was passed down to Marti, who hopes to pitch in the
majors. As she sleeps beneath pictures of Carl Yastrzemski, Luis
Tiant and her favorite, Pedro Martinez, she dreams of the day she
stands atop a perfectly sculpted mound at Fenway.</TE>
<TE>   But, first, she must contend with No. 11, a cool customer who is
holding the bat with only his left hand as he takes practice swings
in anticipation of the 0-1 pitch. Marti takes her sign from Dad,
reaches back and uncorks another fastball, this one directed toward
the inside corner. The batter swings and fouls the pitch off. No
balls, two strikes. Marti smells blood.</TE>
<TE>   She knows better than to get too excited, to try to push beyond
her limits. She paraphrases legendary hurler Tom Seaver. "When you
try to throw harder," she says, "the ball just goes slower." So she
focuses on staying within herself, forgetting about the batter and
concentrating, instead, on throwing to the catcher's target.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching is her favorite part of baseball, and her favorite part
of pitching is "striking out boys." She is specific about this. She
does not say "batters," and if she were playing against girls, she
says, it would not be nearly as fun. She likes striking out boys. Of
course, they like to strike her out too. Still, her batting average
is a healthy .375.</TE>
<TE>   She slams the ball into her glove before stepping onto the rubber.
It's an old glove, a Rawlings Brooks Robinson model given to her a
few years ago by a stranger named Al who said he used to play in the
St. Louis Browns organization. Al happened by the ballpark one day
while Marti and her dad were working out. It's their daily ritual: He
picks her up from Colfax Avenue Elementary School,  and they head to
the park for a short, casual workout. They start out with a little
catch and a little pepper. They talk about school or other stuff. Or
not at all.</TE>
<TE>   So, one day, this old-timer who introduced himself as Al showed up
at the park and watched Marti bat. They talked baseball, then he
said, "I'll be right back." He walked to his car, where lovers of the
game keep their gloves, and brought back the Rawlings. He held it
like a Bible and handed it to Marti. "I'd like you to have this," he
said. It is heavier than modern gloves, weighted by decades of sweat,
dust and oil, its pocket worn buttery smooth and soft, but suits
Marti fine. "I like how it smells," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon workouts started a few years ago. There is hardly a
day, Marti says, when she would rather do something else, but there
are limits to everything, and her mother, Rosa Sementelli, eventually
had to put her foot down. One day as Marti and her dad were getting
ready to head out the door, she stopped them.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys," she said, "it's Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Marti's dad grew up near Boston, where he fell easily in love with
the game. He would play with neighborhood kids, often using balls
held together by tape, then wait for his father, an electrician, to
come home so they could play catch out front on Charles Street.
Besides now, that was the most special time of his life. He played
through high school and seven years in a semipro league. Then he grew
up. Now 42, he acts and writes but mainly works as a recreation
instructor at the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   He and Marti's mom, 32, a fitness instructor and competitor, had
Marti, then another daughter, Allie, short for Alejandra, age 4.</TE>
<TE>   One strike away from 300 strikeouts, Marti takes the signal from
her dad. The key to calling pitches is to always set up the next
pitch, he says. Her change-up has been an effective strikeout pitch
in recent games, but today she's been hanging them high in the strike
zone, and the Reds have feasted.</TE>
<TE>   He opts, instead, for a cutting fastball on the inside corner.
Marti grips the ball with her index and middle fingers along the
outside seam, goes into her stretch. Her left knee comes up high and
tight to her chest. Her motion is fluid. Her dad calls her a
"ballerina on the mound."</TE>
<TE>   The batter backs away from the pitch, but the ball catches the
inside corner for strike three. Marti leaps into the air, balls her
right hand into a fist and pumps it back as though she were shifting
into fourth gear, reminiscent of Kirk Gibson in 1988 as he rounded
the bases for the Dodgers in Game 1 against Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   There comes no thunder from the stands. Few people are aware of
her milestone. The opposing team doesn't understand why she's so
excited. The batter is unaware that he has struck out.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the inning, Marti's dad greets her as she walks
toward the bench. He puts his arm around her, and they walk together.
Her mother and sister cheer from the stands. The next inning, the
Reds score again and lead 6-3 going into the bottom of the sixth and
final inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get three runs and send this thing into extra innings," her
dad tells his players, as they scramble around for helmets and bats
and something to drink. "Three runs, whadya say?"</TE>
<TE>   He does not ask for four, enough runs to win the game. When you
love baseball, when you savor each moment at the ballpark and the day
is filled with joy and glory, you do not wish for victory. You wish
for extra innings, for the game to never end.</TE>

<HD>Trying New Magazines on for Size</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the fashion "issues" we deal with here at Fashion Police
headquarters, none is so perplexing, so fraught with anxiety and
frustration as size--as in, "I'm large and I can't find my ..." or,
"I'm tall and no one has my ..." or, "I'm short, but even the petite
clothes don't come in my ..."</LD>
<LD>   Although the last decade has seen more designers and manufacturers
offering high-quality, fashionable clothes for women who aren't 5
feet, 10 inches and size 6, many consumers don't know where to find
them or aren't even aware this revolution exists.</LD>
<LD>   So we're happy to report that for you gals, some of your size
needs are being addressed. Plus sizes now have Grace magazine,
debuting its summer issue Tuesday, which has the tag line: "Living
Life to Its Fullest." San Diego-based Petite magazine also makes its
debut next week as a monthly, with a mandate to be "the hip, trendy,
glamorous, sophisticated, stylish magazine for petite women
everywhere," says its editor in chief.</LD>
<TE>   You'd think in this everyone-is-beautiful-in-her-own-way culture
in the year 2002, we might not need separate magazines for women over
size 12 and women under 5 feet, 4 inches. But since the major fashion
magazines continue to pay scant attention to these demographics,
others have sprung up to fill in the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing worse than picking up a magazine and not seeing
yourself in it," said Ceslie J. Armstrong, founder and editor in
chief of New York-based Grace magazine, which starts this summer as a
quarterly, moving to bimonthly in January 2003. "I'm a size 16 and
even being a fashionista insider, to flip through the pages of a
magazine and not see anything I can buy is completely depressing."
Armstrong was editor of Mode magazine, the splashy, glossy
publication for large sizes that abruptly shut down last October.
When it did, she said, such a hue and cry ensued (including readers
and advertisers calling her at home) that another periodical
addressing plus sizes had to be born.</TE>
<TE>   Both Grace and Petite strive to be lifestyle magazines in addition
to offering fashion. Petite's first issue, with actress Susan Lucci
on the cover, has stories on successful petite professionals, fitness
advice from Tamilee Webb, petite sports figures, and bridal gown
designs. Grace's debut issue includes features on Pilates, actor Vin
Diesel, travel, food, plus first-person columns on issues surrounding
size (there's one from skinny-turned-curvy model Carre Otis). One of
Armstrong's mandates is to use "real people" models as much as
possible (the current Grace cover girl is an open-heart surgery
nurse, Krissy Woodard) and give readers copious information on
fashion resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not advocating being really big and unhealthy," Armstrong
said. "We want women to be happy and healthy and fit in the skin
they're in. If you're not happy being a large size, maybe you need to
get into a fitness regime. There's a way to strike a balance in
life."</TE>
<TE>   Though petite women haven't hit the same walls of discrimination
that large women have, Petite magazine's Editor in Chief Deborah
Tumlinson says that at 5 foot 2, she's encountered some unpleasant
stereotyping, including such brilliant comments as, "God, you're
short!" and the ever-popular "Dynamite comes in small packages!"</TE>
<TE>   She hopes that by addressing health, fitness, nutrition and beauty
issues as well as helping women find clothes that fit and flatter
them, the magazine will empower readers who are diminutive, be they
skinny, a plus-size petite, teenagers or on the mature side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much about size as it is about attitude," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tumlinson, a former petite model, motivational speaker and
military police officer in the Navy, hopes to open dialogues between
readers and designers to let the latter know exactly what their
customers want: "In our designer showcase we'll let the designers
tell the readers everything they want them to know, from who's on
their staff to where their clothes are available. But to be in the
magazine they have to agree to listen to what our readers have to
say, what their problems are. Basically what we're doing is a
marriage."</TE>
<TE>   We asked both editors if they thought there would ever come a day
when magazines such as Grace and Petite won't have to exist, a day
when major mainstream fashion publications feature women of all
shapes and sizes, all ethnicities, all ages. Both said an emphatic
"yes."</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely think that will happen," said Armstrong, adding,
"though not in the near future. But there are more social changes
happening. I'm from Texas, and we have a saying down here: 'It's a
long row to hoe.' There's a lot of great women who are evangelists
and advocates for this. There are changes in television and film and
more ad campaigns featuring real women. And with the retail numbers
being where they are, I think it's a winning formula."</TE>
<TE>   We won't hold our breath waiting for the first inclusive fashion
magazine, for fear of passing out. But we do applaud these two
efforts, especially as they're being launched during precarious
economic times. We wish them both success.</TE>

<LD>The next week we went to the shop on jelly doughnut day. When I
opened the glass doors, I stopped dead in my tracks. Behind the
counter stood a short, dark-haired man in a yellow apron.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I help you?" he said.</LD>
<LD>   My dad walked up next to me. "We'll have two jelly doughnuts, a
coffee and a milk, please."</LD>
<TE>   "Excuse me," I asked the man. "Where's Boody?"</TE>
<TE>   The steam from his coffeepot was hot on my face.</TE>
<TE>   "She hurt her back," he said quickly as he poured. "She's at the
hospital across the street."</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, can we ... "</TE>
<TE>   Before I could finish, Dad asked for one more doughnut and led me
out the door. "Let's go see her."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital was cold. When we finally reached her room, I saw the
tips of her feet sticking up from under the sheet. Instantly Boody's
eyes sparkled when I walked in.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you OK?" I asked as I hugged her. "Did you get hurt when you
slipped in the jelly I spilled?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, honey," Boody said, patting my back. "The loads I had to
carry at the shop were too heavy for my back."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to get better?"</TE>
<TE>   "I will," she said, smiling. "But I might not be as quick on my
feet after surgery."</TE>
<TE>   "But what about the doughnut shop?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Boody's smile wilted. "I don't think I'll be able to work there
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "But when will I see you?" I asked, tears now rolling down my
cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   Boody hugged me tight again. "We'll find a way, don't you worry."</TE>
<TE>   We all sat there quietly, without speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dad," I said after a few minutes. "Boody lives near the
doughnut shop. We could have doughnuts there once a week instead,
right?"</TE>
<TE>   My dad smiled.</TE>
<TE>   I felt that warm sunshine flow through my body again.</TE>
<TE>   Boody winked at me, and I winked back.</TE>
<TE>   "So, did you bring me my favorites?" she asked. I reached into the
bag and pulled out the sticky jelly doughnuts. "Let's keep the jelly
inside the doughnut this time!" she said, taking a big bite.</TE>
<TE>   I smiled, and took a big bite too.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of my life, I knew I'd never meet anyone quite like
Boody, the Doughnut Lady.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Polydoros loves doughnuts--but she loves her Great Aunt
Boody, the true Doughnut Lady, even more! This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>Harcourt's Sounds: Grand but Out of Their Element</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big things are sometimes best kept in small packages. And the pop
music of Ed Harcourt is very big: ambitious, multilayered work,
sometimes quiet, often festive. On stage it can have a naked
emotionalism that is sometimes lost on his debut album, "Here Be
Monsters."</LD>
<LD>   All those elements were in play at the El Rey Theatre on Wednesday
at the British singer-songwriter's first headlining show in Los
Angeles. But a smaller setting might have played better to his
strengths, giving proper intimacy to the small musical accents of
Harcourt and his four-piece band. As a largely unknown talent to
American listeners, Harcourt played to a room only about half full.</LD>
<LD>   But the small crowd was no reflection of the music's quality.
Harcourt shares some of the musical flamboyance of Rufus Wainwright,
along with a mischievous sense of humor. Switching from piano to
guitar, he was alternately frivolous and introspective, while
slightly disheveled in a corduroy suit and tie.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful night," Harcourt declared, typically casual and
chummy between songs. "Anyone feeling frisky?"</TE>
<TE>   The song "Something in My Eye" drew on his love of richly arranged
pop music, but he was just as comfortable picking up an acoustic
guitar for "Sleepyhead," a dreamy new song and another understated
lullaby, as the band added soft, lush layers of sound.</TE>
<TE>   Forlorn trumpet notes accompanied "Hanging With the Wrong Crowd,"
and Harcourt had as much ease with darker, moodier passages, closing
the night with a selection of songs that touched on genres stretching
from metal to pop, all of it joyfully, if casually held together by
the grand scale of his music.</TE>

<HD>Maas Veers From Usual DJ Set</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timo Maas has parlayed his status as the fastest-rising electronic
act over the last two years into a successful DJ career, but his
reputation was made in the production world, starting with his 1999
remix of Azzido Da Bass' "Dooms Night." It was definitely that side
of Maas that was on display during his unique DJ experience Wednesday
at the Mayan Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Maas, who released his debut album of original material, "Loud,"
earlier this year, veered more to a traditional concert than a DJ
set, even incorporating a live vocalist for the dub-laden "Shifter,"
from "Loud." Though the use of a singer provided the most obvious
variation from the traditional DJ set, it was hardly the most
intriguing aspect of Maas' performance.</LD>
<LD>   Starting off with a languid techno beat, Maas worked the crowd up
into a typical club state at a pace so methodical that one wasn't
even aware the mood had changed until after the fact. It was an
interesting, bold approach, and it left one always wondering what
Maas would do next. But it didn't always make for a great DJ set.</LD>
<TE>   That ultimately doesn't matter, though. While Maas has been
compared with the likes of fellow German Paul Van Dyk, Moby would be
a more accurate comparison. Like his American predecessor, Maas may
be comfortable behind the deck, but his ambition and talent seem
likely to make his forays into DJing a temporary stop on the way to
his career as one of the scene's most interesting artists.</TE>

<HD>Horror Has Little Life in the Glum 'Blackwoods'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Blackwoods," a glum psychological horror picture, opens today for
what will surely be a quick stopover on the way to video store bins.
Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any
interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that
while cleverly worked out, cannot overcome blah characters.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Sullivan's (Patrick Muldoon) girlfriend of three weeks, Dawn
(Keegan Connor Tracy), wants to introduce him to her family. They
live deep in a forest some distance from the city, and the couple
plan a weekend visit. This premise does not augur well for Matt, yet
the filmmakers still lay in strobe-like flashes of ominousness. Upon
arrival at Dawn's large old family home we sense that Matt is already
in big trouble. Or do Matt's troubles go back further than when he
purportedly met Dawn?</LD>
<LD>   "Blackwoods" is a probe of deep-seated guilt and the elaborate,
distorted ways it can play out. Unfortunately, the way the filmmakers
explore their theme is mechanical and flashy in technique rather than
involving. Michael Pare is the local sheriff and Clint Howard the
clerk at the local motel. Always a welcome presence in any film,
Howard, as a simple-minded hick, gives "Blackwoods" whatever humor
and life it has.</LD>

<HD>Stones Fans Will Get Satisfaction</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* So says the chief of a Web site that crashed in
a mad rush for Rolling Stones tickets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They clicked and clicked and clicked some more, but vast numbers of
Rolling Stones fans across the country who paid $60 for an Internet
promise of an early chance to buy concert tickets instead spent
frustrating hours Wednesday staring at a crashed Web site and
wondering if they had been ripped off.</LD>
<LD>   The word Thursday from the chief of the beleaguered Web site:
Don't worry, everyone who bought a membership to the getAccess Web
site will indeed be able to buy a pair of Stones tickets or they will
get their $60 back. He explained that Wednesday, in rock 'n' roll
terms, the stampede of hundreds of thousands of fans was just too
much to handle.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody just kind of rushed the stage all at once, and it hit
our systems and just fried the brains of the servers that handle the
load," said Chris Hearne of Clear Channel, one of the partners in the
getAccess site. "It took us 31/2 hours to get the site back up."</LD>
<TE>   The getAccess Web site is a partnership between Sam Goody, the
retail music chain, and Clear Channel, the concert promoter giant,
and it launched this week with a pitch to music fans: Give us $60 and
you get one-year access to certain concert ticket "pre-sales"
(including the Stones), discounts and other concertgoer benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The lure of Stones seats is, of course, a strong one.</TE>
<TE>   The band's tours are the biggest-grossing road affairs in all of
pop music and, this time around, the fan excitement is being stoked
by a rare series of theater dates tucked in among the itinerary of
arenas and stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   Those small-venue shows, such as the Wiltern Theatre on Nov. 4, no
doubt added more frenzy to the pre-sale offer, although Hearne now
says there was only a minuscule number of those seats set aside for
the getAccess pool. "We shouldn't have even bothered with the theater
dates because we had such a small allotment," Hearne said. "We took
it down almost instantaneously."</TE>
<TE>   That may not sit well with the online users who thought their $60
investment in getAccess at least meant they had time on their side in
the mad fan scramble to find a seat at one of the theater shows. Many
fans are already seething over the Web site hassles and the whole
concept of pre-sale for a price, which some see as merely a new-look
service charge.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just gouging," says Charles Kornett, a Riverside fan who
took the getAccess route. "If everybody pays in for the presale, then
what are you really paying for? Where's the exclusive deal in that?"</TE>
<TE>   Stones promoter Michael Cohl said it was painful to watch the
problems unfold Wednesday. "People were getting very frustrated and
they couldn't buy tickets, and we are, after all, in the business of
selling tickets and then putting on phenomenal shows," Cohl said.
"It's unfortunate. There was $12 million and six months' worth of
study and everything was working fine in the tests, but they hit a
glitch. But now the site is back up and they've been humming."</TE>
<TE>   As for the thought that pre-sales are a way to gouge more money
out of consumers already paying ever-increasing prices and service
charges, Cohl said he can understand that point of view.</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, the band purposely created a wider range of prices
for this tour and the pre-sale is for the die-hard fans who want to
ensure they will be inside for Mick and Co.'s visit.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-sales are not new for the Stones. A few years ago, the band
agreed to a promotion with Sprint that wooed consumers into switching
to the long-distance carrier by giving them exclusive access to a
pre-sale of Stones seats. Cohl said about 8% of all the fans who came
to the shows on that tour were "Sprint switchers" and he expects the
getAccess members this time will represent a similar audience
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   And, with 25% of all the seats on the tour earmarked for the
getAccess presale, Cohl said there should be no getAccess member who
does not get a seat. "Are they going to run out of tickets for the
L.A. allotment? No, I highly doubt it," Cohl said. (Before the
Wiltern show, the band is scheduled to perform Oct. 31 at Staples
Center and Nov. 2 at Anaheim's Edison Field.)</TE>
<TE>   That does not mean getAccess members will get the exact seats or
even prices they want.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Debbie Yatska of Encino spent six hours trying to
get tickets for the Staples Center show by the Stones and, once she
finally got through to the Web site, she saw the seating chart and
realized the $99 tickets she wanted were too far from the stage to
give a meaningful view of the action. So she ended up paying $160 a
seat (not including the $60 membership fee) and now has buyer
remorse.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I even think this is remotely acceptable?" she said and
moaned.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a weary phone operator handling customer service
calls for the Web site said the fans were unleashing their
frustration on him in colorful ways. "I have to tell them," he said,
"obscenities are not going to help you."</TE>

<HD>'Assassins': Slayings That Wounded a Nation</HD>
<DH>With an accomplished staging, the musical is a timely,
troubling visit to the dark side of the American Dream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Assassins," the controversial Stephen Sondheim-John Weidman musical
about the killers of U.S. presidents, is a tough sell under any
circumstances. Tackling it in a period of surging patriotism is a
particularly gutsy gamble, but Karesa McElheny's accomplished staging
for the Knightsbridge Theatre overcomes resource limitations to
redeem the show's problematic reputation. This hard-hitting
production demonstrates why, now more than ever, attention must be
paid to its troubling questions about the dark side of the American
Dream.</LD>
<LD>   With performances ranging from fully professional to riveting,
this simultaneously hilarious and chilling evening assembles nine
presidential assassins (some successful, some not) in a surreal limbo
to tell their stories. Though crammed with factual detail (an advance
read through the helpful program notes is recommended), the piece
freely mixes fantasy and reality to unearth a common underlying theme
in these characters: the corruption of the right to the pursuit of
happiness into a vengeful sense of unfulfilled entitlement.</LD>
<TE>   This conviction that "everybody has a right to their dreams"
manifests itself in different ways, from the misguided patriotic
zealotry of John Wilkes Booth (Beau Puckett) to the loony ravings of
would-be airline hijacker Samuel Byck (Jeffrey Cabot Myers). (His
crooning "Tonight" into a tape recording for Leonard Bernstein is
especially creepy, given that Sondheim wrote the lyrics.)</TE>
<TE>   Standout performances include Don Schlossman's Charles Guiteau,
the deranged Bible-thumping killer of James Garfield, doing a
cakewalk up the gallows steps. Jay Willick is touching as the
understated, oppressed factory worker Leon Czolgosz, driven by the
promise of socialism to slay William McKinley. Sharonlee Mclean
steals all her scenes with a comic-gem turn as Sara Jane Moore, the
housewife who couldn't shoot straight at Gerald Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The production isn't perfect. A live musical ensemble directed by
Bill Newlin has some sloppy moments, and the lack of horns hinders
the score's various American musical styles. The minimal set
requirements of "Assassins" could also be better served with more
detailed props--it's not readily apparent, for example, that
attempted FDR shooter Giuseppe Zangara (Jamil Chokachi) delivers his
song from the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   Though a few punch lines are lost to imperfect timing, most of the
show's black comedy is played to the audience-lulling hilt--until the
show draws a bead on our most traumatic assassination with an
expertly played confrontation between Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald
(August Vivirito).</TE>
<TE>   Though the brevity of the show's initial New York run was often
blamed on bad timing (the outbreak of the Gulf War), another obstacle
was its lack of any opening for empathy--even the platitudes of the
narrating Balladeer (Nathan Bouldin) ring hollow. That problem was
solved with the addition of "Something Just Broke" (not on the
original cast recording, but here), a heartbreaking number in which
ordinary people sing of their reactions to the JFK shooting.</TE>
<TE>   With the economical, straight-to-the heart musical and lyric
precision that no one executes better than Sondheim, the song
transforms a freak show into a moving collective experience of
national grief.</TE>

<HD>What Factors Led to O'Reilly's Big Debut?</HD>
<DH>Supporters cite the host's popular TV show and books. A
critic says stations in major cities were paid, a charge the
syndicator denies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly's radio program made its debut
this week in what was reportedly the biggest launch ever of a talk
radio show. And his syndicator says it didn't pay stations to make it
happen.</LD>
<LD>   "The Radio Factor With Bill O'Reilly" began airing Wednesday on
more than 200 stations nationwide, including KABC-AM (790). Online
muckraker Matt Drudge alleged in his column that O'Reilly's
distributor, Westwood One, paid stations in major cities as much as
$300,000 to carry the show.</LD>
<LD>   Westwood One Chief Executive Joel Hollander said the claim was
simply sour grapes on the part of Drudge, who has a radio show
distributed by competitor Premiere Radio Networks, which also
syndicates Rush Limbaugh.</LD>
<TE>   In many markets, including Los Angeles, O'Reilly is going
head-to-head against Limbaugh, the kingpin of talk radio. O'Reilly
airs from 9 to 11 a.m. weekdays on KABC, while Limbaugh's three-hour
program is heard on KFI-AM (640) beginning at 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand why any show going up against Rush would want to
put as much support behind that show as possible," said Bill Lewis,
director of AM marketing for Clear Channel-Los Angeles, which owns
KFI. He noted that Limbaugh has held the No. 1 position in his time
slot in Los Angeles for 12 years. "Whether it's marketing or
promotion, you're going to go against Rush, you better back it up."</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for a syndicator to give a station money for
billboards or other advertising to help promote a program, especially
a new one, said John Butler, program director at WMAL-AM in
Washington, D.C., an ABC-owned station that carries Limbaugh and
O'Reilly's Fox compatriot, Sean Hannity.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a little more unusual if they were simply handing
over cash to air the show," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollander said none of O'Reilly's outlets is getting promotion
money for the program, even though Westwood One does that with other
shows. "We deliver the program to the stations, and in return they
give us commercial time."</TE>
<TE>   He credited the strong launch to the host's recognition from his
Fox News Channel program, "The O'Reilly Factor," and his two
best-selling books.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy's a big name. He's got the No. 1 cable show. He's an
author. He's got big brand awareness," Hollander said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he has a long way to go in terms of approaching Limbaugh,
who is heard on nearly 600 stations with an estimated audience of 20
million listeners a week. Limbaugh debuted in 1988 with only 60
affiliates, compared to the 200-plus carrying O'Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big number to start with, but O'Reilly is benefiting from
the success of previously syndicated shows," Clear Channel-Los
Angeles' Lewis said. "The anticipation here is that a conservative
with a national profile based on his TV show is less of a risk than a
total unknown. [But] I don't know if you get 200 stations to pick you
up without a financial incentive."</TE>
<TE>   The raw numbers may be impressive, but O'Reilly's roll-out also
shows how crowded the talk field already is. Of the nation's top 10
markets, only in Philadelphia is his program being carried by the
top-rated talk station. In San Francisco, his program is on a station
that advertises itself as "100% Sports Smack"; in Chicago, he's on an
adult standards outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander said it stands to reason that such stations would seek
out O'Reilly. "He's somebody that can go on a secondary station and
get better ratings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Individual stations were mum on the nature of their deals with
Westwood One.</TE>
<TE>   "My contract with them says I'm not allowed to say anything," said
Lee Hammer, program director of KTCT, the San Francisco station
carrying O'Reilly. A KABC spokeswoman also said the station was not
in a position to discuss its contract.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Buys KCAL, Must Sell a Radio Station</TE>
<TE>   It's not some technological fluke or signal interference, but a
change involving KCAL-TV may soon affect what some listeners hear on
their favorite radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission this week approved the sale
of KCAL to Viacom Inc. The company, which already owns KCBS-TV and
the CBS and UPN television networks, is buying the station from Young
Broadcasting Inc. for $650 million. But the sale means that Viacom
owns two television and seven radio stations in the Los Angeles
market, one more than FCC rules allow. So the agency has given
Viacom's Infinity Radio division six months to divest itself of a
radio station.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, whatever station that is would be pure speculation at
this point," Infinity spokesman Dana McClintock said.</TE>
<TE>   With no obvious dogs in the pack, the question is which of its
high-profile stations Viacom will choose to unload. The company's
crown jewel in L.A. is "the World Famous KROQ," alternative station
KROQ-FM (106.7). It has been the top-rated station in the area for a
year, and its "Kevin &amp; Bean" program was the top English-language
morning show in the first quarter of this year, according to the
latest figures from ratings service Arbitron.</TE>
<TE>   Smooth jazz KTWV-FM (94.7) is Infinity's next-highest-rated
station, at No. 7, playing a format that some observers believe has
the biggest growth potential in the industry. Close behind is KRTH-FM
(101.1), by far L.A.'s most popular oldies station. KLSX-FM (97.1) is
the area's only FM talk station and home to Howard Stern. And Arrow
93 (KCBS-FM, 93.1) just edged out its classic rock competitor,
KLOS-FM (95.5), in the latest ratings.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company owns both local all-news AM stations,
KFWB (980) and KNX (1070). But McClintock said listeners shouldn't
look at the duplication and think, "'Oh, well there it is.' I would
just point them to New York."</TE>
<TE>   Infinity owns the two all-news AM stations in New York City: WINS
and WCBS.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock said the two news stations can appeal to different
demographics and report news in slightly different ways: one quicker
with news and headlines, the other putting more emphasis on features.
The stations can also stagger traffic and weather reports, so a
listener who misses them on one station can catch up on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens--whether the station that is sold remains the
same, altering only its owner, or loses listeners in a format
change--will occur before the end of the year, with FCC Commissioner
Michael Copps stressing that Viacom won't get an extension to make
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The lone Democrat on the four-member commission, Copps last month
criticized an FCC decision to give Viacom a waiver extending the time
the company has to sell TV stations it owns in excess of federal
limits.</TE>

<HD>Getting Up Close and Vertical With the Summer X Games</HD>
<DH>'ESPN's Ultimate X' offers strong visuals as it looks into
the subculture of extreme sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN CRUST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does the sight of bicycle motocross riders sailing through the air
silhouetted against a sunset sky or street lugers careening downhill
at 80 mph, inches from splattering themselves on the asphalt, strike
you as particularly athletic or artistic?</LD>
<LD>   Your response to that question will go a long way toward
predicting your reaction to "ESPN's Ultimate X," the new
action-sports, large-format documentary by filmmaker Bruce Hendricks.</LD>
<LD>   Essentially an extended commercial for the all-sports network's
extreme sports coverage, the film nevertheless transcends its agenda
to deliver awe-inspiring, at times sublime, visuals and offers a
fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose
derring-do puts the X into the games.</LD>
<TE>   Shot in Philadelphia at last year's X Games, an Olympics-style
event for elite skateboarders, Moto X and BMX riders, street lugers
and other extremists, the film aims not only at the faithful but also
seeks new converts.</TE>
<TE>   Hendricks and producer Art Repola were not satisfied to merely
shoot a 40-minute highlight reel and wisely chose to punctuate the
highflying, gravity-defying action with the voices of the
competitors. The result is less the vicarious thrill ride one might
expect, with almost equal time devoted to more traditional
documentary elements. It combines poetic, slow-motion shots that
capture the athletes in midair, twisting and turning as they perform
mind-bending stunts at vertigo-inducing angles, with interviews that
allow some insight into why anyone would do this in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   The film makes clear that these are not cut-rate,
second-generation Jeff Spicolis but first and foremost athletes, and
it doesn't take much footage to convince us. The total abandon and
lack of concern for their physical well-being amaze as much as their
commitment to nailing the stunt.As a made-for-TV event, the X Games
survives on sponsorship. In fact admission to the games is free, with
fans waiting in long lines to secure prime position to witness their
heroes up close and vertical. What we may be seeing here is a
generation so media-savvy that the commercial assault simply doesn't
bother them. One athlete, seemingly oblivious to his logo-saturated
surroundings, was glad his sport had not gone "corporate."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, an analogy is drawn between the lack of acceptance by
parents and critics of early rock 'n' roll and its later widespread
popularity because the kids get it. And the kids of today apparently
"get" action sports.</TE>
<TE>   If you've never heard of Tony Hawk, Mat Hoffman, Travis Pastrana
or Bucky Lasek, this film that will bring you up to speed.</TE>
<TE>   The film's strengths may actually work against it with younger
fans who might be disappointed by the few stomach-churning,
white-knuckler moments. In a fairly obvious nod to reaching a broader
audience, the filmmakers forgo a quick-cut editing style such as
employed in the insider documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys" and the more
assaultive, adrenaline-driven music usually associated with the
extreme scene, for a more accessible approach that will play to
parents. The devoted action sports fan will, however, get to see the
performers from new angles and on a grander scale than ever before.
For the uninitiated, anyone seeing "Ultimate X" will be hard-pressed
to let this summer's X Games pass without at least a peek.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for daredevil sports action and mild language.
Times guidelines: plenty of "don't try this at home" stunts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now it can be revealed: NBC, in a bold programming move, plans to
junk its entire prime-time schedule this fall for an all-"Law &amp;
Order" lineup.</LD>
<LD>   The ratings-grabbing police-and-courtroom drama, already airing in
three versions--"Law &amp; Order," "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit"
and "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent"--will expand its reach even
further. So get the VCR serviced and stock up on tapes. Coming in
September:</LD>
<LD>   "Law &amp; Ardor"--Det. Logan (Chris Noth) returns to the precinct,
but he finds his job complicated by his pairing with a female
partner, the department's most fashionable and neurotic detective,
played by Sarah Jessica Parker.</LD>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: Plagiarism Unit"--Editors and copyright attorneys
work to ferret out unattributed passages in manuscripts. Preceded by
a disclaimer saying "Doris Kearns Goodwin" and "Stephen Ambrose" are
fictitious characters.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Boarder"--Prosecutor Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) rents out
extra space in his Manhattan brownstone to a series of wacky
characters. "Three's Company's" Suzanne Somers and John Ritter show
up for sweeps week.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: Not-So-Special Victims Unit"--The first-ever
hourlong prime-time drama about the Better Business Bureau, as it
doggedly investigates complaints about rude sales clerks and
telemarketers who call during dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: Where Everybody Knows Your Name"--Det. Greevy
(George Dzundza) opens a bar whose regulars include all the actors
who have ever been bounced off "L&amp;O" by producer Dick Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: HBO"--A "Pop-Up Video"-style show that highlights
every "L&amp;O" character played by an actor who also has appeared on
"The Sopranos," "Oz" and "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Odor"--Lt. Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) is demoted to
head a squad of drug-sniffing dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: Caloric Intake"--Detectives and attorneys struggle
to make healthy choices for lunch and avoid the temptations of
squad-room doughnuts and late-night Chinese takeout. Prosecutor Abbie
Carmichael (Angie Harmon) confesses her eating disorder. Billy Blanks
and Richard Simmons guest star.</TE>
<TE>   "Claw &amp; Order"--Jesse L. Martin teams with Benjamin Bratt as
ex-cops who start new lives running a crab shack on Maryland's
Eastern Shore.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: SUV"--Following the lives of attorneys and
detectives who drive gas-guzzling vehicles. Hand-held cameras add to
the realism of the desperate search for a service station near a
highway exit.</TE>
<TE>   "Law &amp; Order: The Collection"--Produced by QVC, this show offers
the pre-rumpled Sam Waterston line, Angie Harmon business wear for
women sizes 0 to 2 and the much-anticipated musical collaboration of
Paul Sorvino and Ice-T.</TE>

<DH>Ewan McGregor is missing Round 1 of the 'Star Wars' hype,
working on a film for neither fame nor fortune.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>GLASGOW, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Ewan McGregor could easily be living the high life right now. He
could be getting wined, dined, fawned upon and treated like a
superstar at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, the press
junket for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" (in which he
plays Obi-Wan Kenobi) hanging on his every word.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, McGregor, 31, has been toiling here in his native land on
"Young Adam," a low-budget British film that calls for its cast and
crew to work in decidedly unglamorous, even spartan conditions. It is
set in 1954, and much of the action takes place on a barge traversing
the canals around Glasgow. The film's producers have re-created the
harshness of life for canal workers in that era and are shooting on
canal towpaths in some of the city's most insalubrious areas.</LD>
<LD>   On this particular day in April, the production finds itself
beside a stretch of canal in Ruchill, an impoverished part of Glasgow
south of the city center. The water is dark and murky, and the grass
areas beside the canal, out of camera range, are strewn with litter.
A preponderance of open, empty potato chip bags suggests that local
juvenile delinquents use this site for inhaling glue or solvents.
McGregor looks around him. "Aye, it's bleak, isn't it?" he says.</LD>
<TE>   It is, and one wonders if he has a masochistic streak, opting for
long hours of modest, low-profile labor over all the attention, perks
and luxury accommodations that a star actor with a mega-movie to sell
can expect. But McGregor's reasons are simple: "Young Adam" didn't
wrap until today, and he is in almost every scene; having committed
to the film last summer, and then having stayed with it even when
funding originally collapsed late last year, he simply wants to see
it through.</TE>
<TE>   He is also eager to stress that his absence from the Lucas ranch
implies no lack of enthusiasm for "Attack of the Clones," which opens
nationwide May 16. (McGregor is planning to attend the film's lavish
Hollywood premiere on Sunday.)</TE>
<TE>   "All that hype looks after itself," he says. "It doesn't have
anything to do with me. The 'Star Wars' series is the star, so the
hype is built in. For 'Attack of the Clones,' I've seen the second
trailer and I thought it was brilliant. It had the flavor of the
first three 'Star Wars' movies. So I think the new film will be an
improvement on the last one we made," "'Star Wars: Episode I The
Phantom Menace" from 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Is McGregor unhappy with that film? "No, it was fine, but it had a
lot of setting up to do. It had six movies to establish. And all that
stuff about the senate wasn't even mentioned in the first three, so
all of that had to be explained."</TE>
<TE>   In the latest episode McGregor plays an older, wiser Obi-Wan--a
change of pace for the boyish-looking actor--who must teach the ways
of the Jedi Knight to the brash Anakin Skywalker (Hayden
Christensen). McGregor thinks the film will be more pleasing than
"Episode I" to the "Star Wars" faithful.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a feeling that in 'Episode II' we have more opportunity to
get back into the heart and soul of what the first three films were
about," he says. "I think it's got more action in it, and it'll be
more fun to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Still, McGregor has no regrets about staying away from the "Star
Wars" junket to complete "Young Adam." He stars as Joe, a young
drifter who works on a barge with Les (Scottish actor Peter Mullan,
from "The Claim" and "My Name Is Joe") and his younger wife, Ella
(played by Tilda Swinton, from last year's "The Deep End"). Joe and
Les find the corpse of a young woman in the canal and fish it out.
Shortly afterward, Joe embarks on an affair with Ella.</TE>
<TE>   "Young Adam" is directed by David Mackenzie, a Scottish veteran of
shorts and documentaries, making his feature film debut.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some beautiful stuff to play in it," McGregor says with
enthusiasm. "A lot of looks and moods, and scenes without words. It's
really tasty stuff. It feels like proper filmmaking. We've really
moved into the area of not allowing the audience to do any work at
all, explaining every line and the one that's just gone--and talking,
talking, talking, like nobody does in real life. It's gone insane.</TE>
<TE>   "But this film isn't like that at all. It's more like Steve
McQueen stuff. He'd cut all his lines and only say the lines he
needed to say. This whole script is written like that.... I think
this film could really make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   The film's producer, Jeremy Thomas, calls McGregor "a real man of
the people." "He's here, he's in one of those little trailers divided
into three tiny spaces for actors, and he doesn't complain. He
doesn't ask for anything special, and he doesn't expect it."</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, McGregor stayed loyal when the film was
postponed in August after funding collapsed. "I'd gone on the trail
of trying to raise money for an adventurous film by a first-time
director," Thomas recalled. "The first time, I failed. We didn't make
it last September, but Ewan and Tilda were so keen to do it they
stuck with us. So I began again. We found another angel and started
shooting" in March.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did McGregor stay with the project, he even publicly
criticized Britain's Film Council for its reluctance to back
commercially risky films. The budget for "Young Adam" was about $6.5
million, raised from the Film Council; Scottish Screen; Warner Bros.
UK, which acquired the British rights; and pre-sales to Spain and
Italy. (By way of comparison, "Star Wars: Episode I" cost a reported
$120 million.)</TE>
<TE>   The script of "Young Adam" is noteworthy for its sexual candor.
Mackenzie, 35, admits that "one or two scenes are fairly frank and
shocking, but I don't know if it's sensible to be courting sexual
controversy at this point in history. You can't go much further into
that territory without entering into pornography. I wouldn't want it
to be sold as the steamiest thing around."</TE>
<TE>   He adapted his script from the novel of the same name by the
intriguing Beat writer Alexander Trocchi (1925-1984), who was born
and raised in Glasgow. Trocchi's underground cult reputation rests
largely on "Young Adam" (first published in 1954) and "Cain's Book"
(1963), a harrowing account of heroin addiction; Trocchi was in
thrall to hard drugs for long spells of his adult life.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Trocchi keeps appearing, in a manner reminiscent of Woody Allen's
Zelig, on the margins of the Beat movement. He befriended William S.
Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Terry Southern. Norman Mailer knew him
and said of "Cain's Book," "It is true, it has art, it is brave."
When Trocchi had to leave the U.S. in 1961 because of his drug use,
he fled to Canada, staying at Leonard Cohen's Montreal apartment. "I
understand it was only four or five days," Cohen recalled later. "In
retrospect it seemed like three or four months or even years, because
you couldn't escape the guy." Cohen wrote a poem about him, titled
"Alexander Trocchi, public junkie, prie pour nous (pray for us)."</TE>
<TE>   Of the film's cast, Swinton is Trocchi's biggest champion. . "This
book reads as a screenplay. It might have been his first experiment
in writing cinema.... I've always found the Beats quite magnetic--the
work itself and the muscular element of the writing, not just the
mystique."</TE>
<TE>   The outspoken Mullan, on the other hand, is rather scornful about
Trocchi: "He's a good prose writer but a bad dialogue writer. I
prefer David Mackenzie's script of 'Young Adam' to the book. I
haven't even got to the end of the book."</TE>
<TE>   But McGregor has the most serious doubts about the Trocchi legend.
"Now that I'm a father of kids, I find that's turned me into a man
who realizes the responsibility of having children," he says. "And I
find such joy and pleasure in it. Trocchi had kids who got in the way
of his writing, so he left. There's a horrible arrogance about that.
At one point he was pimping his wife to supply his heroin habit while
he had this baby who wasn't getting fed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that terrible self-centeredness of the outsider,
that attitude of 'this is how I'm living my life.' Trocchi's an
interesting character, and I like the book, but I love the script
more."</TE>
<TE>   And with that McGregor turns on his heel and walks across the
litter-strewn grassland down to the barge for the next scene of
"Young Adam." Any thoughts about another movie are in a galaxy far,
far away.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You needn't know a theropod from a sauropod to get a big, roaring
hoot from "Dinotopia."</LD>
<LD>   It arrives on ABC only days before the heralded theatrical release
of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." And even an
$85-million budget--supersaurus-sized by TV standards--doesn't
elevate this lavishly mounted, three-night miniseries to Lucasfilm's
digital stratosphere. These are TV special effects, after all, screen
size imposing limits on even the most abundant productions.</LD>
<LD>   But spectacular much of it is, from its flying lizards to its
imagination and symbolic message of peace and love that contrasts not
only with our own news of the day, but also the savage network
warfare of May's ratings sweeps. So enter its fantasy, chill ... and
enjoy.</LD>
<TE>   Despite big-event impresario Robert Halmi Sr.'s recent expensive
clunkers, his effort here is a scaly feast, one marred only by a
dreadful, belabored ending whose hokeyness is unworthy of what
precedes it. What was writer Simon Moore thinking?</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the lizards here are mostly to love in this union of
humans and digital dinosaurs directed by Marco Brambilla and based on
the art and juvenile books of James Gurney. None of it is complex or
even very original, but the simplicity works.</TE>
<TE>   Look around today's universe and you'll find beauty, achievement,
kindness and nature's wonders to admire. But the same world also
spews ugliness, death and pessimism, from today's gory conflict
between Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East to millenniums
of butchery captured in "The Genocide Factor: The Human Tragedy," a
well-meant but tedious documentary series opening Sunday night on
KCET.</TE>
<TE>   In defining "genocide" broadly, the program's sweep is wide. It's
all here, from ancient Greeks, Romans and Mongols to the Jewish
holocaust, the Japanese army's rape of Nanking and more recent
slaughters in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia. If only
so much of humankind's legacy were not body counts.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Dinotopians do have serious wardrobe issues (who dresses
these people, EBay?). But if only our history were as sane and
benevolent as their utopian paradise. It's one, also, where Big Macs
are off the menu and fruit-and-veggie-eating humans and animals not
only coexist harmoniously but also become loving life partners.</TE>
<TE>   Get out! Yes, it's so. In Dinotopia, the lives of humans and
dinosaurs are valued equally.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel superior to them but you're not," a wise Dinotopian
human admonishes a scoffing Karl Scott (Tyron Leitso), one of two
young half-brothers from the outside who are stranded in this lost
continent when their plane dives into the Caribbean. It takes some
doing, including pairing Karl with a cuddly infant dinosaur who's
still incubating inside a shell marked "26" when he's introduced to
her. But he ultimately does come around, joining his more sensitive
brother, David (Wentworth Miller), in accepting this society and
vying for the attention of comely Marion (Katie Carr), Dinotopia's
leader in training. Living here seems to have no affect on
testosterone.</TE>
<TE>   Marion's mother, Rosemary (Alice Krige), is this land's earthy
Matriarch, and her gluttonous father, Mayor Waldo (Jim Carter), runs
Dinotopia's especially idyllic capital, Waterfall City, where much of
the story takes place.</TE>
<TE>   The regimen for Karl and David includes learning the Saurian
language and abiding by Dinotopian codes that ban weapons and dictate
"survival of all or none." Another of their new pals is a timid,
erudite Stenonychosaurus named Zippo who looks after Dinotopia's
ancient library. Although he's much too similar to Jar Jar Binks of
"Star Wars" for comfort, you have to respect a bookish dinosaur that
speaks 17 languages and spends his off time listening to cool jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Even more memorable and picturesque is Canyon City. It's where we
meet the massive pterosaur--you know, a dino with a 30-foot
wingspan--that David learns to fly when training to join the Skybax
Corps. Don't expect a cap and gown, but his graduation ceremony
soars.</TE>
<TE>   Much of "Dinotopia" is predictable, some of it formulaic,
including a threat from outside that has a familiar "Star Wars"
ambience. Except for the story's cockamamie conclusion, though, all
of it can be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   The metaphors here?</TE>
<TE>   Dinotopia's power-giving sunstones are on the fritz. But its
survival is imperiled ultimately by carnivores--Tyrannosaurus rexes
and thousands of screeching, flying, swooping flesh-eaters that
emerge about five hours into the story from a dark, shadowy realm
called the World Beneath. As they zoom toward Waterfall City, it's
apparent that subsisting on red meat has put them in foul moods.
Where is tofu when you really need it?</TE>
<TE>   It's true also that "Dinotopia's" only slippery character is Cyrus
Crabb (David Thewlis), a conniving human descendant of shipwrecked
pirates. He doesn't limp for nothing. Nor does continual fighting
between Karl and David go unnoticed as somehow typical of the
predatory, self-destructive society from which they came.</TE>
<TE>   "Mammals!" sniffs Zippo, surely meaning the human species. Watch a
newscast, read a newspaper. As if we need to be told about ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinotopia" premieres Sunday night at 7 on ABC and continues
Monday and Tuesday at 8. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be
unsuitable for young children).</TE>
<TE>   "The Genocide Factor: The Human Tragedy" will be shown Sunday
night at 11:30 on KCET.</TE>

<HD>88-Toting Gumshoe's Toughest Case</HD>
<DH>The jazz milieu is rarely captured well by novelists and
filmmakers. But Bill Moody's Evan Horne mysteries are a welcome
exception.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When pianist Evan Horne arrived in Europe, hoping to kick-start the
career comeback that had been eluding him, the mystery surrounding
Chet Baker was the last thing on his mind. But when his friend Ace
Buffington, who was writing a book about Baker, asked him to get
together at Amsterdam's Prins Hendrik Hotel, the very place where
Baker died, he agreed.</LD>
<LD>   Why not, Horne figured. Like almost everyone else in the jazz
world, he often had wondered about the circumstances surrounding
Baker's reportedly accidental death in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Matters became considerably more complicated, however, when he
arrived in Amsterdam to meet Buffington, then discovered that his
friend was registered in Baker's old room and--more important--that
he was missing.</LD>
<TE>   What's going on here? Is this all the real deal? And if so, who is
Evan Horne?</TE>
<TE>   Start with the earlier question. It's part real deal and part
fascinating fiction: a book--"Looking for Chet Baker: An Evan Horne
Mystery" (Walker &amp; Co.), by writer-musician Bill Moody--centered on a
search for the truth about Baker's unfortunate demise (was he pushed,
did he jump, or did he slip and fall from his hotel window to the
sidewalk below?).</TE>
<TE>   And Evan Horne? He's the protagonist of four previous Moody jazz
mystery novels, a piano-playing, Bill Evans-influenced sleuth who
constantly manages, despite his better judgment, to find himself in
the middle of mysteries, most of them directly connected to
situations in the real world of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   As in "Looking for Chet Baker" (and I won't give away any more of
the story), Moody has taken his character through some intriguing
plots. In previous books, for example, Horne has tracked down someone
who has been killing smooth-jazz saxophonists and leaving a bird
feather on the bodies ("Bird Lives!"); hunted the killer of a jazz
collector who has discovered long-lost tapes by trumpeter Clifford
Brown ("Sound of the Trumpet"); and attempted to discover who, if
anyone, may have killed tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray, the apparent
victim of a heroin overdose ("Death of a Tenor Man").</TE>
<TE>   Moody, a drummer who has toured and recorded with, to name a few,
Maynard Ferguson, Lou Rawls and Earl "Fatha" Hines, is one among a
very few authors who have attempted to use literary means to bring
the jazz world to life. It's a daunting task, and Moody would
probably be the first to agree that the mystery novel, with its
structured, crime-solving format, makes the chore a bit easier.</TE>
<TE>   Given the difficulties, it's no surprise that the list of less
structured, wide-open jazz novels is as short as it is. Among the
better-known efforts: James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues," John Clellon
Holmes' "The Horn," Rafi Zabor's "The Bear Comes Home" (which
includes some of the most insightful descriptions of jazz
improvisation ever written), Dorothy Baker's "Young Man With a Horn"
and Harold Flender's "Paris Blues."</TE>
<TE>   The latter two were made into movies: the Baker book--loosely
based on the life of Bix Beiderbecke--into a film featuring Kirk
Douglas, the Flender novel into a picture featuring Paul Newman and
Sidney Poitier.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz films, however, have been no more successful--and for the
most part even less successful--than novels in portraying either the
music or the music's practitioners. Two of the better efforts--Clint
Eastwood's "Bird" (with Forest Whitaker) and Bertrand Tavernier's
"'Round Midnight" (with real jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon playing a
role inspired by Bud Powell)--possessed a sort of grim verisimilitude
without managing to capture the lightheartedness that jazz players
often manage to sustain, even in their darkest moments.</TE>
<TE>   Other jazz (and jazz-related) films have ranged from awful ("Lady
Sings the Blues," "The Benny Goodman Story," "The Gene Krupa Story,"
"The Fabulous Dorseys") to moderately intriguing ("Pete Kelly's
Blues," "Young Man With a Horn") to earnest but flawed efforts
(Robert Altman's "Kansas City," Spike Lee's "Mo Better Blues," Woody
Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown").</TE>
<TE>   Why have novels and films produced such a spotty record in dealing
with such an important art form? What's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Primarily this: the difficulties in depicting--in the literal
worlds of words and pictures--the experience of what it's like to
create and perform within a nonverbal, nonvisual artistic medium. As
a result, the emphasis shifts, almost inevitably, to such nonmusical
aspects as a character's individual pathology, the complexities of
the surrounding culture and the material demands of making a living.
In the process, the much more elusive, far more mysterious process of
musical creativity is, so to speak, lost in the mix. (And it's worth
noting that classical music and musicians haven't fared any better.)</TE>
<TE>   Moody doesn't solve the very real complexities of depicting that
elusive creative process (although there are a few passages in which
he approaches Zabor's insightful descriptions). What he does do, with
considerably consistency, is establish a milieu, an atmospheric
setting, that resonates with echoes of the real jazz world. And, in
Horne, he has devised a character who can pass the ultimate test of
ringing true to the jazz musicians who read Moody's entertaining jazz
novels.</TE>
<TE>   Verve Reproduces: There's a distinctly retro look to the 20
releases in the Verve Music Group's LP Reproduction Series. Selected
from the Verve catalog, as well as the archives of A&amp;M, Clef, Coral,
Decca, Impulse!, Limelight, Mercury, Norgran and Philips, the 24-bit,
digitally remastered discs are being released on CD in special
miniature-LP packages reproducing the original album covers.</TE>
<TE>   The CDs are being released in an initial group of 20, with an
additional set of 10 titles scheduled for August; most have never
been issued on CD before, and all will only be available for three
years after their release.</TE>
<TE>   The first set includes albums from Count Basie, Willie Bobo, Dave
Brubeck-Paul Desmond, Rosemary Clooney, Alice Coltrane, Ella
Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Astrud Gilberto, Dizzy Gillespie, Woody
Herman, Stan Kenton, Carmen McRae, Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66, Wes
Montgomery, Gerry Mulligan and the Concert Jazz Band, Anita O'Day,
Oscar Peterson, Mel Torme, Sarah Vaughan and Margaret Whiting.</TE>
<TE>   The quality and the appeal vary from album to album, but there are
some marvelous individual items in the compilation.</TE>
<TE>   The Brubeck-Desmond "1975: The Duets" was released two years
before Desmond's death and displays the last hurrah between these two
longtime companions. Mulligan's "Concert Jazz Band at the Village
Vanguard" album from 1960 is the definitive recording from an
ensemble that brought imaginative new life to the big-band format.</TE>
<TE>   The 1963 Herman album ("Swingin'est Big Band Ever") and the 1954
Basie CD ("King of Swing") display two of the jazz world's finest
ensembles at the peak of their powers. McRae's "Birds of a Feather"
(1958) and O'Day's "Incomparable!" (1960) position these two fine
artists in superb settings--McRae surrounded by an orchestra directed
by arranger Ralph Burns, O'Day accompanied by an orchestra conducted
by arranger Bill Holman.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's "Willow Weep for Me" won a Grammy in 1969, and
Gillespie's "Afro" (1954) successfully fuses jazz with Afro-Cuban
rhythms and features a brilliant four-movement version of "Manteca"
composed by Chico O'Farrill. Peterson takes a rare look to the south
in 1966's "Soul Espanol," although the "Soul" is more Brazilian than
"Espanol," with most of the titles tracing to the bossa nova catalog.</TE>
<TE>   The series, with its appealing selection of material and its firm
dedication to the authenticity of the originals, is in marked
contrast to another current Verve offering. And perhaps the best way
to view the LP Reproduction collection is as a corporate act of
contrition for the unfathomable decision to issue the abysmal,
marketing-department product (how else to explain it?) "Verve
Re-Mixed."</TE>

<HD>A Tall Order for ABC's 'Dinotopia'</HD>
<DH>Television* The network needs big numbers from the pricey
miniseries if it is to begin extricating itself from a ratings
quagmire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Taking a major leap of faith, ABC is hoping "Dinotopia"--a fantasy
world in which humans and dinosaurs coexist--can help breathe life
into a struggling television network that lives in a real world where
big-budget, special effects-laden movies have been on the verge of
extinction.</LD>
<LD>   The miniseries comes at a time when other networks have cut back
on or abandoned the genre after audiences seemed to lose interest.
But ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., is giving the six-hour
"Dinotopia" three consecutive nights beginning Sunday, in the middle
of the important May ratings sweeps, on which stations depend to set
future ad rates.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, without waiting to see whether audiences liked it or
not, ABC--whose ratings are down more than 20% this season--has
already ordered seven episodes of a spinoff "Dinotopia" series for
next season.</LD>
<TE>   And if that pressure weren't enough, the first two installments of
the miniseries, Sunday and Monday, fall on the two days immediately
preceding ABC's "upfront" presentation of its fall schedule to
advertisers in New York on Tuesday. The scheduling was coincidental,
according to ABC executives, but if "Dinotopia" fails, it could cast
a pall over the crucial event, sending the wrong signal to the
advertisers ABC is trying so desperately to woo.</TE>
<TE>   The gamble on the miniseries is the work of Susan Lyne, who
oversaw ABC's movies and miniseries before being named president of
ABC Entertainment in January, after amassing a strong track record of
projects that included the Emmy-winning "Anne Frank."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne--in the midst of screening new-series candidates for ABC's
fall lineup, the first assembled since her promotion--declined to
discuss the project. Quinn Taylor, who took her place overseeing ABC
movies and miniseries, said the network is confident that it's an
ideal family show, calling "Dinotopia" a "calculated risk."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Lyne gave producer Robert Halmi Sr. the go-ahead
for "Dinotopia," based on the books and elaborate oil paintings by
James Gurney that have been a hit worldwide. It turned into an
$85-million production--of which ABC paid more than $20 million,
according to people familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "No guts, no glory," said Halmi, who produced many of the event
miniseries generated during the genre's heyday, including 1996's
"Gulliver's Travels" and 1997's "The Odyssey," which drew
appropriately epic ratings. "Susan Lyne is in the same boat I am. We
have to go out and prove something."</TE>
<TE>   Gurney, in an interview from his home in Rhinebeck, N.Y, said he
deliberately set out to make the world he created--from the wet World
Beneath to sky-high pterosaur nests and a fanciful Waterfall
City--unfilmable, "partly for the fun of it." Indeed, earlier failed
attempts to adapt the book and a sequel to the screen centered on
animated theatricals.</TE>
<TE>   But advances in computer-generated graphics gave Halmi's Hallmark
Entertainment its opening to try a live-action movie, with help from
FrameStore CFC, the special effects production company behind
Discovery Channel's "Walking With Dinosaurs."</TE>
<TE>   "It really took until the last couple years before the technology
was enough in place to make the effects part of the entire film,"
said Gurney, who doesn't own a television and had to buy a tape
machine and monitor to watch tapes of the miniseries.</TE>
<TE>   FrameStore needed a year after initial filming finished to
generate the dinosaurs that populate the film, as well as some of the
elaborate backgrounds. The final effects were delivered to ABC by
Frame- Store's Mike McGee, the project's visual effects supervisor,
in late April, when he came over for the New York premiere. Other
scenery, from Arizona's canyons to jungles in Brazil, was added
separately.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the acting on the set was done against a blue screen, a
process in which the actors pretended to interact with dinosaurs that
FrameStore had yet to create.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the riskiest part of the production--the special
effects--was less of a problem than some of the nuts-and-bolts
acting. Director Marco Brambilla, a top commercial director whose
credits include the film "Demolition Man," was replaced last summer,
after filming finished, when a decision was made to revoice some of
the parts to add more emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Brambilla said a scheduling conflict prevented him from directing
the relooping of the voices. ABC dismissed any perceptions that the
change might reflect badly on the production, with Taylor noting that
it's not easy working with a blue screen, in which actors are talking
to something that isn't there. "It's still his movie," Taylor said
regarding Brambilla. "We just had to make things that didn't work,
work."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Halmi said having extra time to tinker with the
miniseries was beneficial, especially after rushing to get on the air
hurt one of his recent productions, NBC's Chinese mythology-themed
"The Lost Empire." The poor ratings for that project in 2001 helped
spell the end of the genre on NBC just five years after "Gulliver's
Travels" revived big events and inspired a glut of similar projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the community did it to ourselves," said Taylor, about the
saturation of such fare. "The public is too smart. You just can't
throw up X, Y and Z and hope it will work. It has to be a good story.
You can't event-ize the audience to death."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor argues that the genre isn't dead and that with fewer
networks exploring that terrain, ABC has more latitude in deciding
how many of these projects to do and when to play them. He also
maintains the network has been smart about scheduling by premiering
"Dinotopia" in the 7 p.m. "Wonderful World of Disney" slot so younger
audiences can tune in, as opposed to the later hour in which some
fantasy miniseries aired.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, ABC has been able to call on Disney's clout to bolster
its marketing campaign, which started with a float in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade in November. The flagship Macy's store in New
York sports a large "Dinotopia" character on its awning. In
Washington, D.C., a Smithsonian exhibit of Gurney's original artwork
opened April 24, the same day as the premiere in the dinosaur hall of
New York's Museum of Natural History. Some Hallmark stores have a
line of characters for sale, and parts of the original Waterfall City
set are headed to the Disney theme park outside Paris.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's stations are running a "making of" program. So did the ABC
Family Channel, a move that didn't sit well with the rival Hallmark
Channel, though Hallmark will get rerun rights to the miniseries and
the series, not ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   Halmi said "Dinotopia's" success will be his "vindication" for
persevering in the fantasy genre as well as an incentive to get other
networks back on board. Meanwhile, the "Dinotopia" series is already
shooting in Budapest, where some of the sets have been reconstructed,
and he's planning an animated movie about the dinosaur character
"26."</TE>
<TE>   ABC is so confident about the genre's viability that it is already
developing two more Halmi projects, "Aztecs" and "Dreamkeeper," the
latter a four-hour miniseries based on Native American mythology that
began shooting in Calgary this week. Taylor called it one of the best
scripts he's ever read. "People think we've lost our minds, but I'm
mad for it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Rohmer's 'Lady' Is in Step With Revolutionary Times</HD>
<DH>The director's experiment uses technology to poetic effect
in a historical piece about upheaval in France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How did old master Eric Rohmer come to make the technologically
inventive "The Lady and the Duke"? As the 82-year-old writer-director
explained to an interviewer, "I like to get out from time to time."</LD>
<LD>   Given that Rohmer is one of the grand old men of the French
cinema, who's been making films like "My Night at Maud's," "Claire's
Knee" and the more recent "Autumn's Tale" for more than half a
century, you might think that getting out would involve nothing more
taxing than a trip to the local cafe.</LD>
<LD>   But Rohmer, with his gift for surprising audiences, had something
more innovative and even ground-breaking in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Entranced by "Journal of My Life During the French Revolution,"
the little-known memoirs of a Scottish aristocrat named Grace
Elliott, Rohmer decided to make a historical film set in those
troubled times. He wanted to make it in a way that only brand-new
digital technology would make possible.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated that period films set in Paris never look like Paris
because they're filmed in "Le Mans, Uzes or other towns with
well-preserved historic neighborhoods," Rohmer commissioned artist
Jean-Baptiste Marot to paint 37 backgrounds representing the Paris of
the time. These were digitally inserted into the film and combined
with the actors' work, also shot on digital beta, to make a finished
image that was then transferred to 35 millimeter.</TE>
<TE>   This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a
strict reality, creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives
"The Lady and the Duke" something of a theatrical air. Just as
interesting, if not more so, is how Rohmer integrates his very
contemporary concerns into a period drama, how he creates characters
who manage to be true to our times as well as their own.</TE>
<TE>   While a certain familiarity with the French Revolution is helpful,
even viewers who don't know from Robespierre will appreciate the
qualities Rohmer brings to all his films. For the lady and the duke
of the title have one of those intricate, talky relationships all
Rohmer couples have, one characterized by intellectual sparring,
impossible situations and clashes of wills.</TE>
<TE>   The lady, Grace Elliot, gracefully played by Lucy Russell (of
Christopher Nolan's debut film, "Following"), was once the mistress
of the prince of Wales. She left him and moved to France for the duke
of Orleans, a cousin of Louis XVI. By the time the film opens in
1790, a year after the fall of the Bastille, the affair is over but
Grace has remained in France and she and the duke have stayed close
friends.</TE>
<TE>   But just because they're friends doesn't mean they can't (and
don't) have powerful political arguments. Grace is an unapologetic
royalist, a close friend of Marie Antoinette, who believes strongly
in the king. By contrast, the duke, the king's cousin, says he feels
much "more French than Bourbon" (and in fact was eventually to change
his family name to Egalite). Organized around five specific moments
in the revolution, Rohmer's fluid drama reveals personalities as it
shows how lady and duke responded to the momentous times they were
living through.</TE>
<TE>   The duke, convincingly played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus
("Delicatessen," "The City of Lost Children"), comes across as both
oily and earnest, an aristocrat trying hard to be a man of the
people. A citizen with more passion than intellect, he is likely, as
Grace understands, to be led astray and become the prisoner rather
than the leader of his more extreme followers.</TE>
<TE>   As for Grace, the dangers of the revolution enable her to come
into her own. Always a decisive woman used to doing what she wants to
do when she wants to do it, Grace discovers untapped pools of
fortitude and resilience to call upon as she needs them.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially the case when she finds herself, in a typically
impossible Rohmer predicament--albeit one with potential consequences
more serious than usual for his films--risking her life to help a man
she despises escape from the clutches of revolutionary justice. Grace
is so intrepid you instinctively feel this is the section that made
the filmmaker cast his lot with her character.</TE>
<TE>   Although "The Lady and the Duke" has some large-scale crowd
sequences (D.W. Griffith's "Orphans of the Storm" was one of the
films Rohmer viewed before the start of production, and it shows),
it's at its best in its most intimate moments, in depicting how
complicated the reality of these events was for those forced to live
through them. "The revolution will be of great use to our children
and grandchildren," the duke says, speaking for the film, "though it
is terrible to witness."</TE>

<LD>   Pavarotti Cancels, Met Crowd Boos</LD>
<LD>   Tenor Luciano Pavarotti developed the flu on Wednesday and
canceled his appearance in a production of "Tosca" at New York City's
Metropolitan Opera. It was to be his next-to-last scheduled
performance with the company with which he is most closely
associated.</LD>
<TE>   Met general manager Joseph Volpe was booed loudly when he walked
onstage to announce the cancellation. "I know you're disappointed,"
he told the sellout crowd of 4,000. "You can boo some more if it
makes you feel better."</TE>
<TE>   Pavarotti, 66, was advised not to sing for at least 48 hours,
according to his representatives. The singer "very much hopes" that
he will recover in time for Saturday's performance, the statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   So does the Met, which is charging $75 to $1,875, instead of the
usual $30 to $265, for the performance--the last night of its
season--which is to be followed by a dinner and dance.</TE>

<TE>   R. Kelly Tells BET: 'I Didn't Do It'</TE>
<TE>   Grammy winner R. Kelly, under criminal investigation for allegedly
videotaping sex acts with an underage girl, said he is not the man in
the X-rated images. While he had not seen the tapes, he said, "I can
say it in all confidence that it's not me because I didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday on "BET Tonight" with Ed Gordon, the
singer said, "I want America to know that you can't believe
everything you hear, and nowadays, you can't believe everything you
see. I've done a lot of wrong things in my life, but I'm not a
criminal, I'm not a monster."</TE>
<TE>   The singer, known for hits such as "I Believe I Can Fly" and "Bump
'n' Grind," has been mired in scandal since allegations surfaced in
February that he had taped a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old
girl. Since then, a tape purportedly showing Kelly having sex with a
girl and other sexual encounters with women, has been sold on city
streets and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly refused to discuss documents indicating he had married his
protege, the late Aaliyah, when she was 15--a bond that was later
annulled. But he told Gordon that two lawsuits, each claiming that he
had sex with a minor, had no merit and were settled only on the
advice of his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   A third lawsuit was recently filed by a woman who said Kelly had
sex with her when she was a minor and forced her to have an abortion.
That case is still pending.</TE>

<TE>   'Spider-Man' Setting Midweek Records</TE>
<TE>   Schools may still be in session, but that hasn't kept "Spider-Man"
from doing summer-style business midweek. After its record-breaking
$114.8-million debut last weekend, "Spider-Man" has been cleaning up
on the weekdays, starting with $11 million on Monday (the biggest
non-holiday Monday ever), $10 million on Tuesday and about $8.3
million on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's gross was estimated at about $8 million, bringing the
seven-day total to more than $150 million. According to the
box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations, that's another record,
since "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" took eight days to get
there and "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace" took 10.</TE>

<TE>   Jewish Group Urges Boycott of Cannes Fest</TE>
<TE>   After a recent spate of anti-Semitic attacks in France, the West
Coast chapter of the American Jewish Congress is urging Hollywood
power players to reconsider plans to attend the Cannes Film Festival,
which runs May 15-26.</TE>
<TE>   A full-page ad in trade publications this week compared the
current climate with World War II, when France's anti-Semitic Vichy
regime collaborated with Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   If people decide to go anyway, American Jewish Congress executive
director Gary Ratner told the Washington Post, they should raise the
issue while they're there. "People in the entertainment industry who
have been advocates on other world causes, like Tibet, haven't said a
word about anti-Semitism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Luc Sibiude, the French consul general in Los Angeles, called
the campaign "totally unjustified."</TE>
<TE>   The violence in France is a spillover of the Israeli-Palestinian
unrest in the Mideast, he said, and has nothing to do with the
government.</TE>

<HD>The Horse Races of Summer</HD>
<DH>Movies* With so many films jockeying to be seen, release
dates and strategies may be pivotal factors.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>An animated stallion battles Jennifer Lopez and Al Pacino. A
futuristic dragon takes on girl surfers. New action star Vin Diesel
goes mano a mano with old action star Mel Gibson.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the most crowded summer movie season in memory, when
major releases will go head to head on virtually every weekend. So on
May 24, a horse of the Old West (DreamWorks' "Spirit: Stallion of the
Cimarron") has to contend with a fighting J. Lo (Columbia's "Enough")
and an embattled Pacino (Warner Bros. "Insomnia"). On July 12, the
dragon (Disney's "Reign of Fire") goes up against surfing chicks
(Universal's "Blue Crush"). And on Aug. 2, Diesel tests his star
power (Columbia/Revolution's "XXX") against Gibson (Disney's
"Signs").</LD>
<LD>   Right now, 51 films are scheduled for national release (1,500 or
more theaters) between May and August, compared with 43 last year,
according to Tom Borys, president of the movie research firm
EDI/Nielsen. "Even if a couple of them drop out, that's still a 10%
increase in the number of wide-release movies," Borys says.</LD>
<TE>   On most of the prime weekends from mid-June to mid-August (when
schools are out and adults are on vacation), there'll be what Borys
calls "a pile-up of films." Take a look at the July 19 weekend, for
example: The family-oriented sequel "Stuart Little 2" will open along
with the adult action film "K:19 The Widowmaker," starring Harrison
Ford. Those two films will also have to fend off "Eight Legged
Freaks" and "Halloween: Resurrection," which could siphon away much
of the 12- to 25-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Then the four films will have to survive the third "Austin
Powers," which premieres the following weekend. So each has to make a
splash or possibly sink without a trace.</TE>
<TE>   The large number of films has made the choice of the right launch
date even more precarious. (The studios are still playing with some
release dates.) "We're all jockeying for windows this summer," Warner
Bros. distribution head Dan Fellman says. "It's become a risky
business, and the important thing is not what's in front of you or
behind you, but positioning your film on a weekend you think you can
open it."</TE>
<TE>   Open Solidly or Face Ejection From Theaters</TE>
<TE>   Back in the day, a movie could debut to modest business and then
grow through word-of-mouth into a major grossing film. But now the
relentless summer stream--with a heavy emphasis on testosterone
action or take-the-whole-family elements--makes it essential that a
movie open to at least solid business--in the $30 million to 40
million range--or theater owners will quickly dump it, says Fellman.</TE>
<TE>   Even mid-sized business is sometimes not enough, according to Jim
Tharp, DreamWorks' distribution head. The film may stay on the
megaplex marquee, but it likely will be shunted to a smaller
auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, only the just opened "Spider-Man" and the upcoming
sequels to "Star Wars," "Men in Black" and "Austin Powers" will have
the luxury of opening largely unopposed. "The audience decides to go
early to those movies," says Universal marketing executive Peter
Adee. If last summer is any indication, juggernaut opening weekends
will likely be followed by 50% or more drop-offs for the second
weekend, making it possible for new movies to attain some visibility.</TE>
<TE>   But even with a major second weekend decline, if, as expected,
those movies have opening weekends of $60 million or more, they'll
still be doing at least $30 million in Week 2. That means some new
arrivals will have to strive even harder just to get a foothold.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to do that, says Tharp, is concentrate on a target
demographic. When DreamWorks' "Road to Perdition" opens on July 12,
Tharp is hoping to corner upscale adult patrons and Tom Hanks' fan
base with a limited release. That should give the film sturdy enough
legs against its competition, the younger-skewing sci-fi monster film
"Reign of Fire" and the surfer-girl tale "Blue Crush." Then
DreamWorks hopes to broaden the release in the following weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Usually the major films of June and July face less competition
from May releases, which are mostly played out by the time the new
movies hit theaters. However, unlike the previous two or three
summers, Borys says, even May is more crowded--12 national releases
compared with eight last year.</TE>
<TE>   When event films like "Pearl Harbor" and "Star Wars: Episode 1 The
Phantom Menace," opened in May, other studios gave them a wide berth.
That won't happen this year when Memorial Day becomes the first major
horse-race weekend. Through that weekend, the thriller "Enough,"
starring Jennifer Lopez, goes head to head with Christopher Nolan's
"Insomnia," starring Pacino and Robin Williams. Both films are
designed to appeal to an older (than 25) audience. In addition, the
youth and family audience will be courted for "Spirit," the second
weekend of "Star Wars" and "Spider-Man," which is expected to
maintain a high profile throughout the month.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, the adult audience will be deluged with action
movies appealing mostly to men, starting on May 31 with the new Tom
Clancy tale, "Sum of All Fears," starring Ben Affleck. That's
followed by "Bad Company," starring Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins on
June 7; the Robert Ludlum adaptation "The Bourne Identity," starring
Matt Damon, and John Woo's war epic "Windtalkers" on June 14; and the
June 21 premiere of Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report," starring
Tom Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is "to present your movie as fresh and different," says
Disney senior marketing executive Chuck Viane about the crush of
thrillers. The studio hopes to distinguish "Bad Company" by playing
up its comedic nature and the pairing of the irreverent Rock with the
more serious Hopkins. Paramount ("Sum") and Universal ("Bourne") will
go after the Clancy and Ludlum "pedigree" (a fancy word for pre-sold
name recognition) with emphasis on the films' young male stars.</TE>
<TE>   With many colleges out, early June has been hospitable to films
skewing toward the 18-to-24 crowd. That shifts in mid-June, when
summer recess is in full throttle. Companies like Disney take
advantage of kids' seven-day-a-week availability by releasing its
annual summer animated movie, which this year is "Lilo &amp; Stitch"
(June 21). "It's a date that's always worked for us," Viane says.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most contentious release dates is Aug. 2, when Diesel
stars in the espionage thriller "XXX" against M. Night Shyamalan's
suspense film "Signs," starring Gibson. "We expect to play younger"
than "Signs," says Geoff Ammer, Sony's marketing head. Yet if "XXX"
is to truly break through, the studio will want older males as well.
The reverse is true for "Signs," which will want the teen crowd,
whose repeat business made Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" a massive
surprise hit in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 16, there will be five movies with comedic premises: "The
Adventures of Pluto Nash," starring Eddie Murphy; Dana Carvey in
"Masters of Disguise"; a Jackie Chan film "The Tuxedo"; the more
romantic "Saving Sara," with Elizabeth Hurley; and the satire
"Simone," with Pacino.</TE>
<TE>   How big a slice of the pie can each film get?</TE>
<TE>   Ammer contends that the overall pie has gotten larger, allowing
for bigger pieces. "Based on last summer, because of the number of
screens around the country, it wasn't even necessary to be No. 1," he
says.</TE>

<TE>   There's action on all fronts as John Woo's WWII film
"Windtalkers," starring Nicolas Cage, above, takes on the spy film
"The Bourne Identity." They are sandwiched between two other

<HD>A Supersaturated Return to the Spirit of the Punk Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gigantic Technicolor Rorschach blot covers every square inch of the
floor at Karyn Lovegrove Gallery, forcing viewers to stand in the
doorway and gawk like club-goers who can't get past the velvet rope.
On seeing New York artist Polly Apfelbaum's "Gun Club," titled after
an L.A. punk band from the 1980s, your first thought might very well
be: "Forget this, I don't need any more art that's so enthralled with
itself that it leaves no room for me."</LD>
<LD>   But hot on the heels of this knee-jerk reaction follows the
impulse to keep looking. It's irresistible--and a lot stronger than
the desire to walk away.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the draw of Apfelbaum's work (like a moth to a flame) is
the volume and intensity of its supersaturated colors. What keeps you
there is its wild riot of shapes, textures and tints. Their sheer
abundance makes your head spin, but the deliberate composition makes
you see method in the madness.</LD>
<TE>   On the 400-square-foot floor, which is painted the same icy white
as the walls and ceiling, Apfelbaum has laid out more than 1,000
oddly shaped swatches of crushed stretch velvet. Some are the size of
dimes. Others are as big as T-shirts. Many resemble the silhouettes
of chains, whose links are thick enough to pull tractors or as
delicate as finely fashioned necklaces.</TE>
<TE>   She determines the shape of each piece by dripping and pouring
various measures of fabric dye onto long bolts of the material. When
the stains dry, she cuts them out with a scissors, forming circular
shapes that have the presence of glowing halos, tiny targets and
cells undergoing mitosis. The longer you look, the more likely it is
you'll start seeing things--fat caterpillars, pudgy bumblebees and
coral snakes stretching themselves out to maximum length.</TE>
<TE>   Apfelbaum has composed her work on a diagonal axis. It's nearly
symmetrical but filled with too many irregularities to be a mirror
image of itself.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to say just what "Gun Club" is. A two-dimensional
sculpture that does double-duty as a dysfunctional rug? A multi-part
painting whose position and materials push the boundaries of the
medium? An installation that cherishes its privacy? Or a fusion of
drawing and collage in which crisscrossing lines trace
larger-than-life gestures?</TE>
<TE>   Conventional descriptions fall short, calling forth more poetic
interpretations. It could be a liquid rainbow that crash-landed,
splashing puddles of vibrant color in every direction. Or tie-dye
outfits, autumn leaves, flying carpets and melting ice-cream cones.</TE>
<TE>   Apfelbaum explicitly links her work to dreams by gluing more
stained circles of velvet to a bedsheet and six pillowcases, which
hang on the walls outside the main installation. Whatever the case,
you don't need to be a privileged insider (or a rocket scientist) to
get it. There's a world of difference between literally entering a
work and doing so in your imagination. The first is often beyond your
control, but the latter leaves you free to do whatever you want. This
do-it-yourself spirit, which fueled punk in its heyday, comes back
for a rip-roaring encore in Apfelbaum's drop-dead installation.</TE>

<TE>   Like the Real World Only Crisper</TE>
<TE>   If the world suddenly turned into a cartoon, Monique van Genderen
would be its court painter or perhaps its painter laureate. The
artist, who earned a master's of fine arts at CalArts 11 years ago,
wouldn't even have to apply for the job. Her works would simply be
recognized as those that best combine the formal rigor of classic
abstraction with the snap of animated graphics and the dreamy romance
of high fashion.</TE>
<TE>   At Sandroni-Rey Gallery, the colors are more luscious than those
in the real world, and they change right before your eyes. Everything
is a little crisper than usual, like L.A. mornings after nighttime
rainstorms or those adrenaline-fueled moments when every blade of
grass crackles with the clarity of a vivid hallucination.</TE>
<TE>   In cartoons, anything is possible because the rules do not apply.
The same goes for glossy fashion magazines, which are an adult
version of comic strips. A similar feeling is embodied by Van
Genderen's playfully commanding pieces, which never let you forget
that the best fantasies ambush the rational mind with their deceptive
simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   Technically speaking, her works are collages. Each begins as a
smoothly sanded panel ranging from 1 to 7 feet on a side. After
applying an even coat of bright white paint, she adheres oddly shaped
sections of vinyl film to it, sometimes overlapping translucent
layers and other times cutting them to fit together.</TE>
<TE>   Most are reflective and do funny things to the light that bounces
off them. Like hyperactive (or telepathic) chameleons, they change
colors when seen from different positions.</TE>
<TE>   The film Van Genderen uses is the same material museum and gallery
wall labels are made of. In the old days, sign painters painted this
information right on the wall. Today, it's designed on a computer,
printed on adhesive sheets and stuck to the wall. When the show is
over, the information is peeled off and tossed in the trash.</TE>
<TE>   Van Genderen knows the ins and outs of this material. At her day
job, she's a partner in a company that makes such specialized signs.
She made her early works by cobbling together scraps left over from
contract jobs. Her new works include vast expanses of vinyl, which
flaunt her compositional skills and talents as a colorist. In some,
boulder-shaped forms play off squiggly insect silhouettes. In others,
dazzling sunset colors provide tacky backdrops for elegant
arrangements. It's a rich mix that makes odd bedfellows of Emerson
Woelf- fer's painted collages from the 1950s and the latest glossy
advertisements from Prada and Gucci.</TE>

<TE>   Some Things Old, Some Things New</TE>
<TE>   A fascinating exhibition at Acme Gallery juxtaposes Chinese
antiquities from the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties (which date
from 960 to 1911) with contemporary art from L.A. and New York.
Organized by antiquities dealer Chip Tom, "Strolling Through an
Ancient Shrine and Garden" is a treasure trove of gorgeously
proportioned furniture, vigorously chiseled sculptures and a handsome
selection of decorative objects.</TE>
<TE>   It includes a scholar's rock, a fishbowl and an incense burner
that fills the gallery with its sweet scent. Functional pieces are
predominant, with lacquered doors, stone walls, a round window frame
and a stylized beam-support. The pristine showroom is transformed
into a domestically scaled space that excites all the senses.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient artifacts outnumber the contemporary works, most of
which function as modest yet highly refined accents. For example,
small works on paper, panel and canvas by Ruth Root, Katie Grinnan
and Laura Owens play off the weighty solidity and weathered splendor
of the antiquities by adding just the right touch of delicacy. Kevin
Young and Michael Norton do something similar with color. Their
abstract paintings provide a shot of high-keyed brightness to the
muted organic palette of the Chinese pieces.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the contemporary works depict vaguely Asian subjects. But
they pale in comparison to the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   The most felicitous juxtapositions are between pieces that seem to
have nothing in common. Monique Prieto's wall-size painting and a
500-year-old sculpture of a reclining lion are a match made in
heaven. Likewise, Uta Barth's blurry photograph and a lacquered wine
table look as if they were made for each other. In both pairs,
simplicity and sophistication commingle, delighting the eye and
thrilling the mind.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary art, this exhibition demonstrates, is much better at
providing decorative pleasures than teaching history lessons. The
show also makes you wonder if the contemporary works will have the
longevity of the ancient ones, which casts a bittersweet shadow over
the show's enticing display of exceptional things.</TE>

<HD>As a Parody of Teen Films, 'New Guy' Is Old Hat</HD>
<DH>The ramshackle tale, about a geek who learns cool from a
convict, cribs from the Farrelly brothers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey, kids! We know it's close to finals and it's, like, the height of
sadism to spring a pop quiz just before a May weekend. Bear with us.
It's just one measly multiple-choice question.</LD>
<LD>   "The New Guy" is:</LD>
<LD>   (a) An argument for the abolition of high school.</LD>
<TE>   (b) An argument for the abolition of high school movies.</TE>
<TE>   (c) An apologia for high school losers.</TE>
<TE>   (d) A backhanded insult to self-respecting geeks in all walks of
life.</TE>
<TE>   (e) All of the above.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between (d) and (e), one could probably insert: "An
unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five
years." Which can be the only rational explanation for making such a
mess all over the screen.</TE>
<TE>   As is customary with such endeavors, "The New Guy" starts out with
a promising set-up. A Texas high schooler named Dizzy Gillespie
Harris (DJ Qualls) is first, or last, among misfits at Rocky Creek
High School.</TE>
<TE>   Dad (Lyle Lovett), who's a bit of a geek himself, thinks Diz needs
both intervention and medication, the latter of which leads to
temporary incarceration with a convict named Luther (Eddie Griffin),
who schools Diz in the finer arts of intimidation and restraint that
can make life easier in the prison or school yards.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with this knowledge, Diz changes his name, his manner and
his polyesters for some Brad-Pitt-from-"Fight Club" hair tinge and
dark wardrobe to attend East Highland High School as the enigmatic
(and hence super cool) Gil Harris. Sure enough, within days of his
arrival, the thugs and jocks are giving him a wide berth and the
cheerleaders are clamoring for his attention. Moreover, Gil's swagger
is proving powerful enough to reverse the fortunes of the mediocre
football team and all but obliterate the brutal social caste system
separating brains from brawn, nerds from jocks, cool kids from
mutants.</TE>
<TE>   No, I didn't buy it either. But we're not supposed to. What we are
expected to do is make our way through some hand-me-down
grotesqueries bleached and sanded as if they were photocopied from
Farrelly brothers movies. The inevitable cheerleader cheesecake shots
are trundled forth with such brazen winking that it affects the way
one sees the goofy sludge surrounding them.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the people behind the movie know how ugly and ramshackle it
looks, and expect us to laugh not at what's on the screen so much as
at those who think what's on the screen is so hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for sexual content, language, crude humor and
mild drug references. Times guidelines: Nothing kids don't see and
hear all the time at school, but that doesn't mean you condone it.</TE>

<LD>With six Oscar winners and five other nominees, "Spike and Mike's
Best of the Fest 25th Anniversary Show" offers some of the best
animated shorts of recent years. These interesting and often
hilarious films introduced audiences to several artists who have
become successful directors of longer works.</LD>
<LD>   John Lasseter won his first Oscar for "Tin Toy" (USA), and the
metal musician who flees a monstrous baby is clearly the ancestor of
Buzz, Woody and the rest of the gang from Andy's room in the "Toy
Story" films from Pixar. The uproarious lisping jaguar in "Creature
Comforts" (Britain) brought Nick Park widespread attention before
"Chicken Run" and the "Wallace &amp; Gromit" films. The cranky old rabbit
in Chris Wedge's "Bunny" (USA) prefigures the Scrat character who
tries unsuccessfully to bury an acorn in "Ice Age." "Bob's Birthday"
(Canada), in which a middle-aged dentist picks a wildly inappropriate
moment to undergo a midlife crisis, was expanded into the "Bob and
Margaret" cable series by Allison Snowden and David Fine.</LD>
<TE>   Several of the less familiar films showcase different styles of
puppet animation. In "Screenplay" (Britain), Barry J.C. Purvis
presents an exquisite blend of stop-motion and drawn elements to
evoke Japanese theater traditions. Had he ended this love story
happily, rather than with a Kabuki-style tragedy, Purvis probably
would have won the Oscar the film merits. "Balance" (Germany) by
Christoph and Wolfgang Lauenstein remains an eerie evocation of the
futility of greed, while Mike Johnson's upbeat "The Devil Went Down
to Georgia" (USA) offers some stylishly animated dance movements by
the young violinist who outplays the devil.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the films in the program have aged gracefully. Will
Vinton's "The Great Cognito" (USA), in which a comedian transforms as
he does impressions, remains a lame stand-up routine with elaborate
visuals. The infinitely subtler clay animation in "Creature Comforts"
makes "Cognito" look downright amateurish. "Your Face" (USA) seemed
novel when it first screened in 1987, but Bill Plympton subsequently
used the same very limited animation of scribbly drawings in shorts,
MTV bumpers, commercials and two features, and the style wore out its
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these caveats, the 16 shorts in "Best of the Fest"
represent some of the finest independent animation of recent decades.
Many of these films are unavailable or difficult to find on video,
and it's a pleasure to see them again on a big screen.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indefinable truths remain hidden between the lines of "Just for
Nothing" ("Pour un oui ou pour un non"), currently receiving its U.S.
premiere at the Tamarind Theatre. Nathalie Sarraute's taut 1982
duologue between estranged childhood friends typifies her nouveau
roman aesthetic.</LD>
<LD>   Rejecting conventional narrative and character, Sarraute's tropism
deploys specific choices of word and gesture to glean unspoken
information, moving emotional prototypes into behavioral dynamics
with the formal precision of a sonata. So goes "Just for Nothing," a
phenomenon in France, where it was filmed for television in 1990 by
director Jacques Doillon, featuring Jean-Louis Trintignant and Andre
Dussollier.</LD>
<LD>   The metaphoric setting is a boxing ring, here rendered with clean
verisimilitude by set designer Oliver Noinan, around which the
affluent M1 (Stefan Cattan) and isolated M2 (Charles Fathy, who also
directs) spar over their dissolved friendship. This colloquy, whose
conundrum remains unsolved despite invocation of audience perspective
in a wry coup de theatre at midpoint, is the existential raison
d'etre.</LD>
<TE>   Fathy's acerbic intensity and Cattan's early-period Jean Marais
quality are keenly attuned, both scrupulously observing Sarraute's
exacting cadences.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, hesitant articulation of Kaye Mortley's English
translation blurs the pace and nuances, ironic given the central
theme. That liability aside, this is a fascinating cerebral exercise,
with Sunday performances in French affording the opportunity for
stylistic comparison studies.</TE>

<TE>   'Pilgrims' Tells Tales of Small-Town Life</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, theater directors resort to plenty of bells, whistles
and trumped-up folderol to disguise the essential flimsiness of their
production.</TE>
<TE>   That's the case with Eberhard Kohler's staging of "Pilgrims,"
presented by Cal Rep at the Edison Theatre. Based on a short story
collection by Elizabeth Gilbert, "Pilgrims" has been adapted for the
stage by Shira Piven and Cal Rep Artistic Producing Director Howard
Burman. The four playlets--one short, three attenuated--deal
primarily with the rhythms and comical characters of small-town
American life. As thumbnail character sketches, they hold marginal
interest, but as far as cohesive drama is concerned, they are
insubstantial, meandering and strikingly innocuous. Whether that's
the fault of Gilbert or her adaptors is unclear. What is clear is
that Kohler leaves no gimmick unexploited in his attempt to enliven
the general mish-mash.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening piece, "The Many Things That Denny Brown Did Not
Know (Age Fifteen)," a simple birthday party scene is reiterated four
times, for some oblique stylistic purpose supposedly understood by
Kohler, if no one else. Lots of neck-craning is required to keep
track of the prancing performers, who are frequently required to
freeze in long, unmotivated pauses that may have been intended for
comic effect, but instead seem weirdly interruptive.</TE>
<TE>   At one juncture, the audience is hurried out of the theater and
ushered onto a nearby school bus for "The Finest Wife," a tall tale
about a former femme fatale, now an elderly school bus driver, who
finds her route suddenly populated with the deceased admirers from
her distant past. Whimsical and mystical, "Wife" is the most
effective offering--until it devolves into a one-note joke. The last
piece, "Tall Folks," features a topless stripper doing a pole
dance--a strikingly gratuitous sequence, even in context of this
gratuitous staging. It's a shame, because the actors are obviously
seasoned professionals who dash away on their fool's errand with
energy and undiminished dignity.</TE>

<TE>   Mythology, Banal Reality Mix in a Bueno 'Wilfredo'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy I understand so little--I wish I understood less,"
declares an amiable cuckold in Wesley Walker's "Wilfredo" from Padua
Playwrights Productions.</TE>
<TE>   He's come to the right place.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional expectations of theatrical meaning and content are a
liability in writer/director Walker's surreal collision of banal
Southern California existence with the fluid boundaries of ancient
mythology and the dream world.</TE>
<TE>   Set in a highly stylized Tijuana saloon, Wesley's fertile
imagination weaves a hauntingly beautiful and at the same time
ominous series of elliptical encounters between people who act out of
unfiltered impulses rather than socially dictated norms.</TE>
<TE>   The barkeep Wilfredo (John Horn), sets the tone with his obsessive
insistence on not being addressed by anything other than his proper
name. With perfect dry timing, he catalogs his unacceptable nicknames
and the reasons why--as if reality can only be defined by what it is
not.</TE>
<TE>   What matters most to Wilfredo is his "bueno"--his life force,
embodied in a pair of coins he's stolen from the clueless cuckold
Nester (Barry Del Sherman), the antithesis of his all-wise Homeric
predecessor, Nestor.</TE>
<TE>   While at bottom this is a simple boy-meets-bueno, boy-loses-bueno,
boy-recovers-bueno story, forsaking the mundane world of cause and
effect for the unconscious leaves an expansive canvas to play with.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a frustrating one to try to parse for literal sense. The
best way to appreciate this work is to let it wash over you, and let
its message emerge from the often poetic repetition of phrases and
themes.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is rewarded, thanks to exceptional performances that
wring intriguing characters out of Walker's opaque slates. As a pair
of American visitors who oscillate between control and helplessness,
George Gerdes and Jack Kehler dissect shallow L.A. values as they
lurch about in the throes of conflicts that harken uneasily back to
Oedipus. Both are attracted like moths to the pretty barmaid Roberta
(Christine Marie Burke), an enigmatic, absent-minded muse with
overtones of Medea. O-Lan Jones is an earthy presence as Nester's
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Walker's evocative staging makes brilliant use of music by Robert
Oriol--some of the images linger like dream fragments long after
we've returned to more familiar landscapes.</TE>

<HD>Attack of the Critics: Mixed Reviews for New 'Star Wars'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest installment of the "Star Wars" saga got a split decision
in reviews from Hollywood's two daily trade papers Thursday. Daily
Variety raved, while the Hollywood Reporter mixed lukewarm praise
with some blistering criticism.</LD>
<LD>   "George Lucas has reached deep into the trove of his
self-generated mythological world to produce a grand entertainment
that offers a satisfying balance among the series' epic narrative,
technological and emotional qualities," Todd McCarthy wrote in Daily
Variety of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones."</LD>
<LD>   McCarthy found that "virtually everything that went wrong" in the
previous episode, "The Phantom Menace," has been fixed or at least
improved upon in the new film, with exciting action scenes, better
story exposition and a restored sense of "overall imaginative
purpose."</LD>
<TE>   Kirk Honeycutt thought differently. Though "Attack of the Clones"
"feels more adult than 'The Phantom Menace,'" he wrote in the
Hollywood Reporter, Lucas "still struggles to replicate the spirit of
fun and adventure of the original 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes
Back.'"</TE>
<TE>   Honeycutt was particularly harsh in his assessment of the film's
acting ("wooden"), art direction ("dreary") and digital enhancements
("too much of a good thing").</TE>
<TE>   In another early review of the film posted Wednesday at Fox
news.com, Roger Friedman was also mixed, writing that he "liked a
lot" of "Clones" but also thought it contained "hideous dialogue, bad
plotting and infomercial-grade acting."</TE>
<TE>   None of the three reviewers thought the movie would be anything
but a box-office hit.</TE>

<HD>Takemitsu, Still Transcendent</HD>
<DH>At a tribute performance, several works show off the
composer's inspiring cross-cultural range.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years after his death, Toru Takemitsu, a man who stood less than
5 feet tall, is seen as a giant in 20th century music, the first
composer to significantly bridge East and West. Yet what is most
wonderful about Takemitsu is not the bridges he built, important as
they are, but something even finer. He didn't so much cross cultures
as transcend them.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, in the Los Angeles Philharmonic's tribute to
Takemitsu on Wednesday night at Royce Hall, in a concert sponsored by
UCLA, there was little of his work that sounded specifically Japanese
and much that sounded on the surface like Debussy, Ravel and
Messiaen. But at no time would a listener have mistaken Takemitsu's
music for anything other than Japanese. Takemitsu was, in fact, the
inspiring artist who could have a powerful, unmistakable cultural
identity and yet move beyond it.</LD>
<LD>   The Philharmonic roster was appropriately international. The
conductor, Esa-Pekka Salonen, is Finnish. The soloist, Paul Crossley,
is a British pianist with a flair for French Impressionism. Both were
friends of Takemitsu and have long been champions of his music.</LD>
<TE>   The program was international as well in its attempts to show
Takemitsu's range. It included two late works: "riverrun," a short
piano concerto that was commissioned by the Philharmonic in 1984, and
"Twill by Twilight," a piece written in memory of Morton Feldman (who
died in 1987) that demonstrates Takemitsu's connection with the New
York School of American experimental composers. There were also
pieces by Oliver Knussen, the British composer and Takemitsu
champion, and Messiaen.</TE>
<TE>   And there were examples of Takemitsu's film scores. He was a fan
who claimed to attend more movies--around 300 a year--than anyone
else in Japan. As a sidelight to his career as a composer of concert
music, he somehow found time to compose the music for 93 films, some
of them (including "Woman in the Dunes" and "Ran") among the classics
of Japanese cinema.</TE>
<TE>   As one example of Takemitsu's astonishing range of interests, I
recall a late night at Tanglewood when the composer, flushed by a few
beers, described in halting English how he liked to begin his
composing day by badly banging through Bach's entire "St. Matthew
Passion" on the piano. He then went on to discuss in detail aspects
of LaMonte Young's arcane five-hour Minimalist masterpiece, "The
Well-Tuned Piano," followed by equally detailed plot descriptions of
a couple of the most obscure "Godzilla" movies.</TE>
<TE>   The topics might just as easily have been Zen rock gardens, James
Joyce ("riverrun" begins the first sentence of "Finnegans Wake"),
French Surrealism, Messiaen or the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   The lush, enveloping sound world of the two late, riveting
Takemitsu works--"riverrun" and "Twill by Twilight"--is French. But
chords and textures derived from, say, Debussy, take on a life of
their own. They become like waves in the ocean, with a sense of ever
becoming, a potential that begins over and over again but is never
predictable. This music seems to hold in it the ever-encouraging
sense of possibility while still acknowledging the grim realities of
life.</TE>
<TE>   Crossley's playing in "riverrun" was immaculate, although the
orchestra's performance in it and in "Twill by Twilight" was not as
truly oceanic as it might have been. Salonen, however, conducted a
brilliant reading of Knussen's complexly celebratory, sonically
bursting "Flourish With Fireworks." And he led as close to a perfect
performance of Messiaen's "Une Sourire"--with its softly clinging
harmonic passages interrupted by the cheer of birdsong--as could be
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   The ideal addition to the program would have been John Adams'
"Eros Piano," for piano and orchestra, which was written for
Crossley. It is both a gloss on "riverrun" and a memorial to Feldman.
But there was the compensation of Crossley's gleaming performances of
two short Takemitsu works for solo piano, "Rain Tree Sketch II" and
"Les Yeux Clos I."And an interesting experiment was attempted with
"Three Film Scores," a suite Takemitsu made from his music to "Jose
Torres" (Hiroshi Teshigahara's gritty New York documentary on the
boxer), "Black Rain" (Shohei Imamura's devastating story of the
aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima) and "The Face of Another"
(Teshigahara's weird look at changed identities). Clips from the
films were shown along with the music, but they were not synchronized
because Takemitsu made changes in the original cues for the suite. It
worked surprisingly well, even when an off-kilter waltz tune meant
for a seedy nightclub in "Face of Another" was transferred to a scene
in the which the protagonist privately examines his new face in the
mirror.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe that is not so surprising after all. Whatever its
stylistic face, whatever it mirrors, whatever culture it finds itself
in, Takemitsu's music has something essential to say.</TE>

<DH>'Lagaan' masterfully integrates song and drama into a
sophisticated but lengthy tale of injustice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ashutosh Gowariker's glorious "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India" is
to the Bollywood musical epic what Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon" was to the period martial arts action adventure: an
affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of
an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme
and a sophisticated style and point of view.</LD>
<LD>   Most crucially, its songs and dances are not mere interludes
inserted in the action, bringing it to a halt--a Bollywood
trademark--but are fully integrated into the plot and marked by
expressive, dynamic singing and dancing that infuse a historical
drama with energy and immediacy.</LD>
<LD>   But there is a hitch: At a whopping 225 minutes, "Lagaan," an
Oscar nominee for best foreign film and the most expensive Indian
film ever, won't attract nearly as wide an audience as "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</LD>
<TE>   "Lagaan's" running time, however, is not unusual in the Hindi
cinema, as mainstream Indian audiences are eager to get their money's
worth from their escapist entertainments. What's more, Gowariker does
sustain the daunting length of his film, although it sags a bit at
the halfway point before moving into its compelling, increasingly
suspenseful second half. Such midway lulls are common in even very
good ultra-long films and not ultimately harmful.</TE>
<TE>   The film's title refers to the exorbitant land tax the British Raj
exacted of the Indian peasantry. The year is 1893, the height of
British imperial glory, and the setting is the village of Champaner,
which has endured such a long drought that it is late in paying last
year's lagaan.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearby British cantonment, the arrogant commandant, Capt.
Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), an unabashed white supremacist,
takes the villagers' plight as an opportunity to humiliate the local
rajah (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). He tries to force him to violate his
religion by requiring him to eat meat if the lagaan is to be waived.
When the rajah finds he cannot, the captain says he will demand a
double lagaan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the villagers, who know they will barely survive the
year only with the lagaan lifted, petition the sympathetic but
powerless rajah.</TE>
<TE>   The young farmer Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) leads a protest, which
Russell offers to resolve with a deal: He tells the villagers they
will be free of the lagaan for three years if they succeed in
defeating the British officers at a cricket match to be held in three
months. If the villagers lose, they must pay a triple lagaan.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that to pay any amount of lagaan in the usual form of
wheat, rice and maize crops is to court starvation, Bhuvan accepts
the challenge, even though he and his friends have no experience
playing cricket. The captain's pretty visiting sister, Elizabeth
(Rachel Shelley), sympathizes with them.</TE>
<TE>   This is just the beginning. Back in Champaner, the beautiful Gauri
(Gracy Singh) is trying to get Bhuvan to notice her as he and his
friends begin their attempt to become champion cricket players.</TE>
<TE>   Imaginative musical numbers emerge at the most appropriate
moments, deepening the drama's emotions and moods. The pace quickens
in the second half as the arduous three-day match gets underway and
any traces of "Lagaan's" quaint folk-tale quality fade away, laying
bare the brutal outrage of colonialism.</TE>
<TE>   Gowariker does a terrific job of making the match suspenseful,
leavening it with a bit of humor but even greater pathos. "Lagaan"
may be an epic entertainment extravaganza, but it also is as harsh an
indictment of British imperialism as any filmed.</TE>
<TE>   Bhuvan and Gauri are archetypal movie star roles, but both are
demanding parts; Khan and Singh are more than up to them.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Elizabeth proves to be a more complex woman than she at
first seems, but Shelley radiantly illuminates all aspects of the
young woman's admirable character and her increasing emotional
anguish.</TE>
<TE>   With his dandy's fancy sideburns and mustache, and a permanent
sneer affixed to his face, Blackthorne's Russell is a classic
man-you-love-to-hate. The film's large supporting cast is similarly
effective in presenting the characters as easily recognizable types
and then gradually revealing them to be three-dimensional
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Javed Akhtar's lyrics (rendered well in the film's excellent
English subtitles) and A.R. Rahman's music are enchanting, as are the
production design and the costumes. Cinematographer Anil Mehta bathes
the entire film in warm earth tones. It is well worth submitting to
"Lagaan's" long haul--and the answer to the most crucial question
pertaining to the film is, yes, there will be an intermission.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for language and some violence. Times guidelines:
Suitable for family audiences but too grueling for the very young.</TE>

<HD>Is It a Toxic World for Kids After All?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The promise of "better living through chemistry" is one side of a
double-edged sword. Tonight's "Now With Bill Moyers" focuses on the
other side: a growing body of research that points to toxins in the
environment as a cause of childhood illness.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong report, "Kids and Chemicals" (8 p.m. KVCR, 9 p.m.
KCET), examines what children eat, breathe, drink and play with, and
establishes an apparent link to a range of problems, from asthma to
cancer to behavioral and learning disorders. Along the way, the show
also explores institutional resistance to eliminating known hazards
such as lead. A case in point: the small town of Herculaneum, Mo.,
where the nation's largest lead smelter finally agreed in March to
offer buyouts to 160 homeowners because of contamination.</LD>
<LD>   Most disturbing of all, though, is how much scientists don't know.
Dr. Phil Landrigan of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York
City says that of the 3,000 high-production-volume chemicals in use
in the U.S., only 43% have been "minimally tested; only 10% have been
thoroughly tested to examine their potential effects on children's
health and development."</LD>
<TE>   These and other statistics cited in the program add up to a big
mystery, one that the experts interviewed for the report say they are
only beginning to solve. Moyers and his team profile several
projects, ranging from the investigation of a cluster of child cancer
cases in Fallon, Nev., to research into the chemicals that expectant
mothers encounter in their daily lives in New York. In nearly each
case, the data are just coming in and it's too soon to draw
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   After a while, this lack of resolution is a bit frustrating. In
addition, you might yearn for some concrete tips on how to protect
the children in your life. But the sad fact is that there are few
clear answers. Rather than wrap things up in a tidy package, "Now
With Bill Moyers" is smart enough to admit this.</TE>

<HD>Spike and Mike's Influential Fest</HD>
<DH>Movies* The compilation marks 25 years of displaying
cutting-edge animated shorts by artists who have often gone on to
high-profile careers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They might not be household words to the public, but for a quarter of
a century the names Spike and Mike, the trademarked monikers of Craig
"Spike" Decker and the late Mike Gribble, have promised the kind of
animation that can't be found on TV (even cable) or at the local
Blockbuster--at least not yet--and certainly not in most movie
theaters.</LD>
<LD>   In an industry ruled by tentacled conglomerates, Spike and Mike
are the ultimate indie, still selling door to door. And while other
touring animation festivals have come and gone, Spike and Mike's
Classic Festival of Animation--the 25th anniversary edition of which
opens today in L.A. and Pasadena--and Spike and Mike's Sick and
Twisted Festival of Animation, now in its 12th year, have established
the pair as the Ben and Jerry of animation.</LD>
<LD>   "They have definitely got a niche that they can lay full claim to,
and they've got a very dedicated following," says Chris Wedge,
director of "Ice Age." His Oscar-winning 1999 short "Bunny" is
included in this year's "Best of the Fest" anniversary program, a
feature-length collection of 16 shorts--many of them Oscar winners or
nominees--from seven countries. The shorts were featured at previous
festivals.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly every hit-breeding animator in the business was either
launched or given early exposure through Spike and Mike. Tim Burton,
John Lasseter, Will Vinton, "Monsters, Inc." directors Andrew Stanton
and Pete Docter and "Chicken Run" directors Nick Park and Peter Lord
all had their early work exhibited in one festival or another, as did
edgier artists like Bill Plympton, Marv Newland, Danny Antonucci and
Don Hertzfeldt. "Beavis &amp; Butt-head," "South Park," "Wallace and
Gromit," "Bob and Margaret" and seminal versions of "Rugrats" and
"The Powerpuff Girls" all made their theatrical debuts through Spike
and Mike.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely a big deal to me at the time because I had seen
the festival when I was in college," says Mike Judge, creator of
"Beavis &amp; Butt-head" and TV's "King of the Hill," who got in after
sending the duo blind submissions of his first cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Decker is inundated with tapes from students and other
hopefuls. Other things, however, have not changed. Only six prints
are struck of each festival, as opposed to the 3,000 or more for a
wide studio release, and Decker tours them a city at a time for about
nine months. Decker boasts that a recent showing at a Santa Cruz
nine-plex earned more at the theater than any film that week except
for "The Scorpion King."</TE>
<TE>   "When you put those numbers up, it's like a football team with two
guys," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's only one guy now. Mike Gribble died of cancer in
1994. But everyone connected with the festival still refers to them
as a working team. "Like Laurel and Hardy, you can't replace that,"
Decker says.</TE>
<TE>   Having met in the early 1970s, Spike and Mike joined forces to
promote a Riverside band and later organized screenings of 1930s
cartoons. The popularity of those screenings encouraged them to seek
out and exhibit new animation--what there was of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were desperate days [for the animation industry] when
nothing was happening in Hollywood," says animation historian Jerry
Beck, who is writing a book about Spike and Mike for Abrams. "The
best animation you could see was in these festivals."</TE>
<TE>   The two scoured schools, film societies and international
festivals for any kind of short animation in any technique: cel,
clay, stop-motion and more recently digital. With a $1,000 loan from
a friend, they launched their first Spike and Mike screening in 1977
at Riverside City College. The pattern evolved by which Mike would
travel to festivals all over the world, while Spike handled the
business deals. Within a few years, they were not only exhibiting
animated shorts from around the world but were also providing
financing to complete a film or to transfer it from 8-millimeter or
16-millimeter to 35-millimeter film.</TE>
<TE>   Decker says the first years were spent getting audiences to accept
animated shorts as examples of a versatile film medium, not simply
funny cartoons in the Bugs Bunny mode. But to fans, a Spike and Mike
show was always more about its shorts. "It's like a rock concert for
animated films," Beck says.</TE>
<TE>   Appearances by filmmakers are common. "When you go for a weekend
to be at a Spike and Mike festival, it's just crazy," says John
Lasseter, whose 1989 Oscar winner "Tin Toy" is also in the "Best of
the Fest."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the craziness, however, is a purpose. Spike and Mike "is
really the only chance for audiences to see the great art form of the
animated short film," Lasseter says. "They've been giving out an
Academy Award for best animated short film for decades, but there's
absolutely no chance for audiences to see these films. That alone
makes what they do so great for audiences and for the filmmakers."</TE>
<TE>   A two-week sellout run in one city might bring in close to
$100,000, but that is a far cry from the big studio or network
paydays that many of the festival's grads have come to enjoy. Because
of that, Decker these days is willing to think about sponsorship.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at the point in my life where I am willing to sit down and
discuss that with the powers and the players that could help us,
because it bugs me when people say, 'How come this isn't in Atlanta?
How come you couldn't play this in London?'" says Decker, whose
festivals have rarely strayed beyond the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "With the right sponsor, somebody that really respects what we do
and gives us the freedom, it would be interesting to take this thing
to broader levels and much more cities throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spike and Mike's "Best of the Fest" runs today through Thursday at
the Laemmle Fairfax 3 in Los Angeles and the Laemmle Playhouse 7 in
Pasadena. For information about the festival, call Spike and Mike at

<HD>Andersen Lawyer Alleges Witness Intimidation</HD>
<DH>Courts: Counsel for firm says federal investigators have
reclassified at least three as 'subjects' of probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Arthur Andersen on Thursday accused federal prosecutors
of intimidating potential witnesses who could provide testimony
favorable to the accounting giant as it fights an obstruction of
justice charge arising from its shredding of Enron Corp. documents.</LD>
<LD>   Rusty Hardin, a former Texas prosecutor now defending the
89-year-old accounting firm, said federal investigators notified a
number of potential witnesses that they had been reclassified as
"subjects" of the probe.</LD>
<LD>   Hardin said investigators informed lawyers for at least three
witnesses that their legal status had changed after they voluntarily
submitted to Justice Department interviews.</LD>
<TE>   Hardin said he intended to send a letter to the department
Thursday to ask Michael Chertoff, the assistant attorney general
overseeing the Enron investigation, to examine the prosecutors'
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin first took aim at the prosecution team in court, just
before one planned witness for the defense, Kate Agnew, an Andersen
executive on the team handling Enron's audit, stepped to the judge's
bench and invoked her right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin declined to detail what Agnew might have said on the
witness stand, but he said she would have been a "wonderful" witness
for Andersen. Hardin said prosecutors intimidated her and brought her
to court to scare other potential Andersen witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Weissmann, one of three prosecutors representing the
government in court, denied that the department intimidated any
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It was her decision," he said of Agnew's refusal to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Agnew's attorney could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute erupted as prosecutors continued trying to show that
senior Andersen executives knew early last year that Enron's
financial condition had become increasingly fragile and later
orchestrated a campaign to shred documents possibly relevant to an
anticipated Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of obstruction, Andersen could be prohibited from
auditing public companies--a likely death blow to the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from prosecutors Thursday, an Andersen
accounting specialist testified that he destroyed a substantial
portion of his Enron-related e-mail after his boss forwarded him a
copy of Andersen's document retention policy in October.</TE>
<TE>   But Benjamin Neuhausen, a 17-year veteran of Andersen's
Professional Standards Group, said he had no inkling at the time that
regulators might demand the records in their investigation of the
Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Neuhausen, called to testify by federal prosecutors, told jurors
the e-mail he received containing the document policy made no mention
of Enron but also said he deleted only the Enron-related e-mail in
his files. Prosecutors didn't ask him why.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I was doing normal cleanup," Neuhausen testified. "I
was not trying to hide the documents" from regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have called Neuhausen and other witnesses in a effort
to portray Enron as a corporate behemoth that prodded its auditor to
stretch accounting rules in order to bolster its financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers questioned Neuhausen and another Andersen
specialist, Carl Bass, to illustrate disputes that erupted within
Andersen between technical experts and the partners overseeing the
Enron audit.</TE>
<TE>   Neuhausen said David B. Duncan, the lead Andersen partner dealing
with Enron, "pushed to excess on aggressive interpretations" of
accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   Bass and Neuhausen said they clashed with partners working on the
Enron account about the propriety of Enron's proposed restructuring
of four Enron-financed investment vehicles known as the Raptors,
which Enron used to conceal debt.</TE>

<HD>Poultry Firms Accused of Labor Violations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Department of Labor announced Thursday actions against two major
poultry processors for allegedly violating wage and hour laws within
their largely immigrant low-wage work forces.</LD>
<LD>   Perdue Farms agreed to pay about $10 million to more than 25,000
current and former employees and to change its practices under a
consent judgment filed by the department in U.S. District Court in
Tennessee. At the same time, the department filed suit against Tyson
Foods Inc. on behalf of workers at the company's Blountsville, Ala.,
processing facility.</LD>
<LD>   Both cases grew out of allegations that employees were not paid
for time spent "donning and doffing" special clothing and equipment
required for their work. Workers and advocates, including union
organizers and human rights groups, claim those extra minutes should
be compensated because they are a required part of the job. Some
employers, however, equate the practice with putting on a business
suit or donning a hard hat, and say they should not be required to
pay for the time.</LD>
<TE>   The question has been litigated in recent years for various
classes of workers, including those in meatpacking and in grocery
stores, with mixed results. Similar lawsuits were filed by workers at
Perdue and Tyson in 1999, with the help of religious groups and the
United Food and Commercial Workers, and were pending as of Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Perdue Farms Chairman Jim Perdue said he was
"pleased that as a result of the discussions that we initiated almost
three years ago, we have been able to conclude the question as to how
associates are compensated for donning and doffing." Parties to the
settlement agreed to compensate workers for eight minutes per shift
going back two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Labor also had been in discussions with Tyson,
but could not reach a settlement, both sides said. In a statement,
Tyson chief counsel Les R. Baledge lashed out at the department and
plaintiffs' lawyers, and said the company has consistently followed
state and federal laws. He said work preparation at Tyson "is nothing
more than putting on clothing, which in our plants typically includes
a hairnet, earplugs and a white lab coat."</TE>

<HD>Markets Drop as Investors Cash In Run-Up's Gains</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Prior session's rally fizzles amid disappointing
retail news, Mideast worries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped Thursday, pushing the technology-loaded Nasdaq down
almost 3% after an explosive rally a day earlier ran out of steam.</LD>
<LD>   The decline eroded about one-third of the prior session's gains,
which had been sparked by better-than-expected earnings from
high-tech bellwether Cisco Systems.</LD>
<LD>   "It was logical that we would give up some ground. There is
nothing to justify going higher in the short term," said Peter
Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co. "We might have
gotten ahead of ourselves. We need to see more things like Cisco to
start to form a pattern and to reaffirm that things are picking up."</LD>
<TE>   Stocks fell after Israel gave the green light for military
reprisals following a Palestinian suicide bombing Tuesday.
Disappointing sales in April from leading retailer Wal-Mart Stores
helped add to concern that Wednesday's rally may have been overblown.</TE>
<TE>   Selling accelerated late in the session and indexes closed at the
lows of the day. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average sagged
104.41 points, or 1.0%, to 10,037.42. On Wednesday, it surged 3.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 15.84 points, or 1.5%,
at 1,073.01, after climbing 3.8% the day before. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 45.80 points, or 2.7%, to 1,650.49, after raking in a 7.8%
gain a day earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by about 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange. Trading was moderate, well below Wednesday's
heavy volume.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks also were pressured after the Federal Reserve said it found
anthrax traces in some of its mail, but the markets regained lost
ground after an official said the test may show a "false positive" or
cross-contamination from earlier incidents. Last year, five people
died from anthrax spread through the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields fell and gold shares gained as investors returned
to safe havens. Some analysts shrugged off the market's declines
after such a tremendous rally, but few expected smooth sailing up
ahead. Investors, battered by weeks of sell-offs in the market,
remain skittish about corporate accounting issues, Wall Street
scandals and the dicey outlook for corporate profits.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect more volatility in the market," said John Hendricks,
vice president, trading and strategy group, at State Street Global
Markets. "We see a tug-of-war between the short-term traders and the
longer-term investors that may have perceived the lows on Monday and
Tuesday as a temporary bottom or an opportunity to put cash to work."</TE>
<TE>   Cisco dropped 52 cents to $15.75 after racing 24% higher on
Wednesday on earnings that more than tripled and a cautiously
optimistic outlook. Other technology shares lost ground after their
hefty rally on Wednesday. Microsoft fell $2.85 to $52.12, Intel lost
74 cents to $28.24 and software maker Oracle declined 67 cents to
$8.48.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart weighed on the Dow, losing $1.40 to $54.99. Sales at
stores open at least a year grew 3.3% in April, the world's largest
retailer said. But analysts had expected Wal-Mart to report a
same-store sales gain of 3.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Some apparel stocks bucked the downward trend. Federated
Department Stores jumped $1.80 to $41.39 and AnnTaylor Stores gained
$2.02 to $48.17 after the retailers boosted earnings outlooks.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * A new share offering received a warm welcome on Wall Street.
Shares of the largest movie theater chain, Regal Entertainment,
jumped $2.75, or 14%, to $21.75 in their first day of trading. The
Colorado-based company, controlled by billionaire Philip Anschutz,
raised $342 million in the first initial public offering by a movie
theater chain in five years.</TE>
<TE>   * After the close of trading today, American Standard, the maker
of plumbing fixtures and Trane air-conditioning systems, will replace
Internet consultant Sapient in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sapient, whose
shares have dropped 85% in the last year, is being removed from the
index for "lack of representation," S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   In another change, Irvine-based Intersil, a maker of chips for
wireless networks and personal computers, will replace DSP Group in
the S&amp;P MidCap 400 index.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of companies that are added to Standard &amp; Poor's indexes
often rise because managers of funds that track those indexes need to
acquire them for their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks fell after UBS Warburg analyst Diane Glossman
lowered estimates and price targets for Lehman Bros., Merrill Lynch
and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She cited continued weakness in
mergers, trading and underwriting securities.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill lost $1.04 to $42.91, Lehman slipped 65 cents to $63.85,
J.P. Morgan Chase dropped $1.14 to $35.77, and Bear Stearns fell 48
cents to $62.15. Morgan Stanley added 1 cent to $48.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold stocks rose as investors sought defensive shares and the
metal's price climbed $1.30 to $309.80 an ounce in New York, near a
two-year high. Barrick Gold rose 51 cents to $21.30. Newmont Mining,
the biggest producer, advanced 65 cents to $29.55. Newmont is the
third-best performer in the S&amp;P 500 this year, up 54%.</TE>

<HD>States Cancel Courtroom Demo of Modular Windows in
Microsoft Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>States seeking stiff antitrust penalties against Microsoft Corp.
abruptly canceled plans Thursday for a courtroom demonstration next
week of how Windows can be easily modified--a claim that Microsoft
has disputed.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise move, requested by the states' lead trial lawyer,
Brendan Sullivan, came at the end of Thursday's proceedings, meaning
that testimony in the two-month-long antitrust trial is likely to
wrap up today.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly is expected to issue
her final ruling on the landmark case this summer.</LD>
<TE>   The demonstration of a modular version of Windows, in which
software applications can be substituted easily, was viewed by some
observers as an opportunity for the states to discredit a key claim
of Microsoft and company Chairman Bill Gates.</TE>
<TE>   Gates testified in court last month that it would be impossible to
comply with the states' demand that his company offer a version of
Windows that consumers and PC makers can customize by replacing the
Internet Explorer Web browser, Microsoft's Windows Media Player and
other key software with rival products.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the states, who argued that a modular version of
Windows would help make the market for PC operating systems more
competitive, said they decided not to put on rebuttal witnesses after
Kollar-Kotelly scolded them for dumping 67 CDs containing rebuttal
documents on Microsoft lawyers at the eleventh hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tell you I am happy about the way this has been done,"
Kollar-Kotelly told the states' lawyers in court.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Houck, a New York antitrust lawyer hired by the District of
Columbia, California and eight other states suing Microsoft for
antitrust violations, said, "In light of the judge's comments, we
felt we would let the case rest.... We decided our case was strong
enough" without a rebuttal.</TE>

<HD>Loan Rates Slide; Savers Still Suffer</HD>
<DH>Finances: Consumers have another chance as slowing economic
recovery has brought down costs of credit. Low yields continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve opted this week to hold steady on interest rates,
but rates on some consumer loans--reacting more to the sluggish
economic recovery than to the Fed--have been sliding recently. That
may provide consumers with another chance to lock in attractive loan
rates.</LD>
<LD>   But there's little help for savers, who continue to suffer with
low returns on their invested cash.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nowhere for savers to go but crazy," said Keith
Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates in Butler, N.J. "But if you
missed the chance to refinance your mortgage last year, the window of
opportunity is open again."</LD>
<TE>   Historically low interest rates fueled a refinancing frenzy last
fall. But when positive economic data started to come out in
November, the refinancing boom came to a screeching halt. The
bellwether 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate rose from a 35-year low
of 6.44% to 7.23% within a month.</TE>
<TE>   But lately, the pace of economic recovery has proved so slow that
mortgage rates are starting to edge down again. The average 30-year
fixed mortgage is going for 6.81%, according to HSH.</TE>
<TE>   Someone with a $200,000 home loan at 7.5% would save about $93 a
month by refinancing the loan at that going rate.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who have sufficient equity may find the better deal is
to refinance other types of loans--from car loans to credit
cards--with a home equity line of credit, said Greg McBride,
financial analyst with BankRate.com.</TE>
<TE>   Home equity lines of credit are variable-rate loans that tend to
move in lock-step with the prime rate.</TE>
<TE>   These loans often require no upfront costs, and at today's rates
they are going for 4.75% to 5% to people with good credit. Those who
are fairly certain they can pay down this debt within a few years can
enjoy the low rate, with minimal risks, he added.</TE>
<TE>   However, borrowers who don't think they can pay off the debt
before rates rise significantly may want to stick with home equity
loans.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between a home equity loan and a home equity line
of credit is twofold: A home equity loan is for a set amount of money
that you get at closing, and the loan rate is generally fixed for the
life of the loan. These loans are going for about 8% to 8.25%,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   A home equity line of credit gives the consumer the ability to
borrow up to a set amount that can be tapped or left alone, depending
on credit needs. These loans generally tie the loan rates to prime,
which is at 4.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers with exceptionally good credit can get home equity lines
at prime, while those with some credit blemishes may have to pay
prime, plus a margin of one or two percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Though credit card interest rates have been climbing
lately--largely as the result of rising delinquencies and increasing
concern about credit quality--there still are a handful of great
deals, said Robert McKinley, president of CardWeb.com.</TE>
<TE>   Several issuers are offering no-interest deals on transferred
balances for set periods ranging from three months to a year, he
said. But be wary of the fine print.</TE>
<TE>   Some issuers, such as Citibank and First USA, have interest-free
offers on transferred balances, but sometimes charge a 3% balance
transfer fee, he said. Meanwhile, the same company that gives the
low-rate deal will take it away--and often charge a punitively high
rate--if you're even a day late with a payment, he said. And fees for
all sorts of activities, such as paying late or exceeding your credit
limit, have been soaring lately, so it's costly to err.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have one of these great deals, send the payment as soon as
the bill comes," McKinley advised. "Don't give them any reason to
take that rate away from you."</TE>
<TE>   The news isn't nearly as bright for savers, however, who continue
to see low returns.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on taxable money market mutual funds still are hovering
around historic lows of 1.38%, while one-year certificates of deposit
are, on average, paying a paltry 2.3% a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the Fed's decision not to act means there's going
to be a longer wait for the rebound in yields," McBride said. "The
only advice we have is don't invest too much for too long a period.
You are locking in very low rates in today's market, and there isn't
anywhere for rates to go but up."</TE>

<LD>Stanley Works, a 159-year-old toolmaker that once built an
advertising campaign around its small hometown, won shareholder
approval to move its headquarters from New Britain, Conn., to Bermuda
to slash its U.S. income taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Stanley Works expects to trim $30 million off its U.S. tax bill
next year by incorporating in the Atlantic Ocean archipelago, which

<LD>The average rate on 30-year mortgages rose this week after five
consecutive declines that had brought it to a five-month low,
according to Freddie Mac. Other rates also rose.</LD>
<LD>   Although demand for mortgages grew, indications of a slow economic
recovery confined the rate increase for 30-year mortgages. The
average rate rose to 6.79% this week from 6.78% a week earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-year mortgage, a popular refinancing option, rose to 6.27%
from 6.26%. The one-year adjustable rate rose to 4.80% from 4.75%.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Morris Cos. said an appeals court dismissed a lawsuit the
Marshall Islands government brought in an attempt to recoup expenses
resulting from smoking-related diseases.</LD>
<LD>   The republic's Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that
there was insufficient proof the country suffered economic losses
from cigarette makers' actions, Philip Morris said.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in the nation after a court in Hawaii dismissed
it, was modeled on lawsuits by U.S. states that led to a $246-billion
settlement.</LD>
<TE>   The Marshall Islands sought $4.6billion in damages, which a court
would have been able to triple.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares rose 21 cents to $55.27 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JetBlue Airways said it is accelerating plans to use its 21 remaining
slots at Long Beach Airport, a move likely to stir the controversy
over unused airline space at the facility.</LD>
<LD>   The young discount carrier expects to start using the slots by
October, rather than by next May as it originally planned. Its
decision comes as American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, is
pressuring Long Beach Airport officials to grant American more
permanent slots.</LD>
<LD>   The airport's 41 total available slots are either being used or
have been allocated to carriers, namely JetBlue, which has 27 total
slots. JetBlue is using five of its slots and plans to start using a
sixth June 8.</LD>
<TE>   American, a unit of AMR Corp., complained that it was being denied
more permanent spaces while JetBlue has so many unused slots at Long
Beach. But American also said it doesn't object to JetBlue being
allowed to use its slots as long as American is awarded the space it
wants as well.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue spokesman Gareth Edmondson-Jones said the carrier's
announcement wasn't related to American's protest, noting that
JetBlue has launched service in other markets ahead of schedule.</TE>

<BD>A Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tejon Ranch Co. said its first-quarter loss widened to $962,000 on
higher revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which owns about 270,000 acres of ranch and
commercial land in northern Los Angeles and southern Kern counties,
said the deeper loss was primarily the result of losses from
discontinued operations.</LD>
<LD>   Tejon Ranch Co. has been shifting from ranching and agricultural
operations to real estate development.</LD>
<TE>   The net loss was 7 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
loss of $798,000, or 6 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter sales from continuing operations rose nearly 20% to
$2.4 million as the firm experienced growth in its real estate and
leasing operations.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tejon Ranch Co. fell 55 cents to close at $33.20 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Marvel Enterprises Inc., publisher of Spider-Man comics, said Walt
Disney Co. is marketing Spider-Man cartoon videos with artwork that
infringes a copyrighted picture Sony Corp. is using to promote its
blockbuster new movie.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in New York, Marvel asked a U.S. district judge
to block Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment Inc. from using the
illustration to sell Spider-Man cartoons that were released on video
last week. Marvel doesn't object to the release of the videos, for
which Buena Vista has a license.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Green, a spokesman for Burbank-based Disney, said the company
hadn't seen the suit.</LD>

<HD>Moody's Slashes WorldCom Debt to Junk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service slashed $32 billion in WorldCom Inc. debt
to "junk" status Thursday, citing the long-distance telephone
company's deteriorating operating performance, enormous debt load and
expectations of further weakness.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of the downgrade, WorldCom executives sought to
reassure investors by saying the company was in talks with banks on
new financing and could cut an additional $1 billion in planned
investment and sell assets to shore up its balance sheet.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's cut Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom's senior unsecured debt
rating three notches to Ba2, its second-highest junk grade, from
Baa2, and its short-term debt rating two notches to Not-Prime from
Prime-2.</LD>
<TE>   It warned it may cut the long-term rating again.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares fell as much as 15% on Thursday, but recouped some
of their decline after WorldCom said it received a waiver through May
23 from lenders on its $2-billion accounts receivable securitization
program, and that the downgrade "has no impact" on the company's
liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it is in talks to replace the financing program
and replace a $2.65-billion bank credit line, which expires June 7.
Executives said on a conference call that WorldCom will likely cut
its capital expenditure budget by an additional $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The downgrade has no impact on the liquidity of our bonds or on
our bank credit facilities, period," said Chief Financial Officer
Scott Sullivan on the call to analysts and investors.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to conclude the bank situation in the next 30 days and
this will remove any questions of liquidity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares closed Thursday on Nasdaq at $2.01, down 14 cents,
or 6.5%, after falling as low as $1.82, on volume topping 127 million
shares, more than 21/2 times the average over the last month.</TE>
<TE>   They have fallen 89% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Housing Affordability Edges Down</HD>
<DH>Economy: Percentage of people who can buy a median-price
home in California fell to 29%, the lowest since 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing affordability in California fell in March to its lowest level
in nearly two years, a trend that continues to force many prospective
buyers to consider lower-priced homes or drop out of the market
altogether.</LD>
<LD>   The statewide housing affordability index--measuring the
percentage of people who can afford a median-price home in
California--dropped to 29% from 34% a year ago, the California Assn.
of Realtors said Thursday. It marked the first time since August 2000
that the figure slid under 30%.</LD>
<LD>   Though the figure remains well above historic lows of 14% in the
late 1980s, affordability could worsen if mortgage rates begin to
rise, as many analysts predict.</LD>
<TE>   Low mortgage rates have created an extraordinary number of
consumers willing to consider home purchases. But fewer people are
putting their homes up for sale, dropping the supply of unsold homes
to extremely low levels.</TE>
<TE>   The imbalance between supply and demand was a major factor in
pushing up California median prices in March to a record $305,940.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically low mortgage interest rates, which are once again
below 7%, aren't enough to offset the combination of excessive
demand, low inventory of homes for sale and rising prices throughout
most of California," said Robert Bailey, president of the Realtors
group.</TE>
<TE>   Most counties across the state posted lower rates of
affordability. Orange County remained stable from a year earlier at
29%. But Los Angeles County declined to 33% from 37% a year ago;
Ventura fell to 36% from 37%, and the Inland Empire slid to 47% from
49%, the Realtors group said.</TE>
<TE>   The heated market is excluding some buyers. After months of poring
over ads and driving through neighborhoods in South-Central Los
Angeles, Eric Wesson said he can't find anything in the
$175,000-to-$200,000 range that's in good condition or makes his
family feel secure.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's recent bid for a home was rejected because the sellers
stuck to an asking price of $172,000, leaving him too little money to
renovate. On another home, a competing buyer proposed $10,000 more
than Wesson's full-price offer.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't compete with that," said Wesson, 43, an operator of
heavy machinery.</TE>

<HD>Allergan Drug Suit Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc.'s suit to block rival Alcon Laboratories Inc. from
selling a generic version of its Alphagan glaucoma treatment was
dismissed by a federal judge.</LD>
<LD>   Allergan said it plans to file an expedited appeal. The suit
concerns patents relating to a brimonidine tartrate solution.</LD>
<LD>   Alphagan accounted for about 15% of Irvine-based Allergan's sales
in 2000 and 2001, according to filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The company reported $1.75 billion in sales last
year.</LD>
<TE>   "This order does not end the litigation," said Douglas S. Ingram,
Allergan's general counsel. "This ruling is, in Allergan's opinion,
inconsistent with applicable federal statutes."</TE>
<TE>   Alcon, a unit of Swiss food maker Nestle, earlier this week
persuaded U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana to dismiss
the 5-month-old suit.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan shares fell $2.96 to $61.05 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Clone Profit? Unlikely</HD>
<DH>The technology's commercial viability faces many hurdles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty Nobel laureates and patient-advocacy groups have lobbied
senators to allow human cloning for medical research.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Okarma, too, has met with senators to advocate cloning, but
not because he sees any business potential in it. As chief executive
of Geron Corp., a cell therapy company, he has no interest in using
cloned embryos to produce customized treatments for disease. The odds
favoring success "are vanishingly small," he said, and the costs are
daunting.</LD>
<LD>   Okarma said it would take "thousands of [human] eggs on an
assembly line" to produce a custom therapy for a single person. "The
process is a nonstarter, commercially," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The battle over a government ban on human cloning soon will reach
the Senate floor. Advocates of a limited ban argue cloning research
is needed to develop tailored stem cell treatments for Parkinson's,
diabetes and other debilitating diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the debate is the limited commercial promise of
therapeutic cloning. Few companies believe it will produce affordable
medications. The economic and regulatory hurdles are high, and the
likely fallout is even more controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do you source that many eggs? Sourcing human eggs is a
contentious issue in itself," said Alan Robins, chief scientific
officer of BresaGen Ltd., a cell therapy company in Australia and
Athens, Ga. "It is not something we want to get involved in."</TE>
<TE>   Cloning involves stripping DNA from an egg cell and replacing it
with genetic material from a patient's cell, such as a skin cell. The
result is an embryo with the same genetic profile as the patient.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, this embryo could be implanted in a woman's womb and
become a child. But some scientists want to use cloned embryos as a
source for stem cells. These stem cells could be grown into
replacement tissues, such as nerve cells and heart cells. Because
they would have the same genetic makeup as the patient, the cells
might be accepted by the patient's body and avoid problems with
immune rejection.</TE>
<TE>   But the method is controversial because it involves the creation
and destruction of embryos, or what some people consider the earliest
stage of human life.</TE>
<TE>   Geron and BresaGen study stem cells derived from embryos donated
by fertility clinics, which is also controversial. Executives at
those companies are not opposed to therapeutic cloning on ethical
grounds. They believe there are more-efficient ways to deal with
immune rejection, which is a drawback of embryonic stem cells, valued
by scientists because they can turn into any of the 300 cell types in
the body.</TE>
<TE>   One alternative is immunosuppressant drugs, which are now
administered to organ transplant recipients. Another possibility is a
two-step therapy under development at Geron that involves
pre-treating patients with stem cells to build their immune
tolerance. The technique would allow Geron, based in Menlo Park, to
treat large numbers of patients with its cells.</TE>
<TE>   Therapeutic cloning, on the other hand, is a form of
individualized medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think it makes sense as a business model, producing cell
therapies for a patient population of one," BresaGen's Robins said of
therapeutic cloning. "But we don't support a ban on it."</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group that represents
the industry, favors a partial cloning ban. The group supports a bill
by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)
that would permit human cloning to develop new medicines but would
outlaw reproductive cloning to produce children.</TE>
<TE>   The bill competes with one sponsored by Sens. Sam Brownback
(R-Kan.) and Mary Landrieu (D-La.) that would ban cloning for any
purpose. The House has passed a similar anti-cloning measure.</TE>
<TE>   Carl B. Feldman, president of the trade group, said in a statement
last week that therapeutic cloning was "key to ... responsible
development" of embryonic stem cell research. He said human cloning
could spur development of treatments for Alzheimer's, spinal cord
injuries and other degenerative diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The trade group represents academic institutions as well as about
1,000 biotechnology companies.</TE>
<TE>   The cloning furor picked up steam in November, when Advanced Cell
Technology Inc. claimed to have cloned seven embryos from donated
eggs. All died and none grew beyond six cells--too small to produce
stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   The Worcester, Mass., company advocates therapeutic cloning, which
is a critical part of its strategy for entering the pharmaceutical
business. Most of its operating revenue comes from cloning farm
animals. Advanced Cell's Web site urges visitors to lobby President
Bush, his Cabinet and members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lanza, vice president for medical and scientific research
at Advanced Cell, acknowledged that cloning is in the "experimental
stage."</TE>
<TE>   But he predicted that it would produce affordable therapies, at
least when compared with organ transplants. A heart transplant, for
example, costs upward of $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lanza said the company would not be in the business of procuring
eggs. Rather, he said, an egg cell would be donated by a relative of
the patient--the mother of a diabetic child, for example. The egg
would be stripped of its genetic material and merged with DNA
extracted from one of the child's cells. Stem cells from the
resulting embryo would then be transformed into insulin-producing
islet cells, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Cell is not close to offering such a treatment. But Lanza
said such therapies, now theoretical, could cost $10,000 or less,
becoming profitable to the company and sparing patients "a lifetime
of going blind and kidney failure."</TE>
<TE>   However, Advanced Cell would have to spend millions of dollars to
develop its cloning technology to the point at which it can be
marketed, competitors said. Geron's Okarma said that with today's
technology, it takes "100 eggs if you're lucky" to produce an embryo
large enough from which to extract stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   Okarma said the process of extracting stem cells also is
inefficient. One "very prominent researcher" in Britain went through
1,000 embryos before obtaining useful cells, he said. (The embryos
were donated by fertility clinics.)</TE>
<TE>   Any resulting stem cell therapy can't be compared with an organ
transplant in terms of price or effectiveness, said BresaGen's
Robins. Cells would be placed in the body to generate repair tissue,
such as patching damaged heart muscle, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not talking about growing new hearts here," Robins said.
"We are using cells for repair, and I don't think they will be able
to repair all damaged hearts, and therefore it is not an alternative
to an organ."</TE>
<TE>   Robins said cell therapies would be useful in "a small fraction of
organ failures."</TE>
<TE>   Quality control presents another hurdle, said Lutz Giebel, CEO of
CyThera, a cell therapy company in San Diego. The Food and Drug
Administration is set up to sample drugs produced in large commercial
lots, not individual cell therapies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not commercially viable," Giebel said. "Quality control is
difficult; the FDA can't regulate it, [and] no one can afford the
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Giebel called therapeutic cloning a "research tool only." A
complete ban on human cloning would have "a limited impact on
corporate product development," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning might make sense as a tool for developing ethnically
diverse stem cell lines, Robins said. Because most cell lines were
derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics, the cells have the
genetic characteristics of white middle-class Americans--the typical
clinic client, said Robins.</TE>
<TE>   Through cloning, Robins said, companies could create additional
stem cell lines that reflect a more diverse population. It would then
be possible to "match" cells to patients based on genetics--just as
donated organs and bone marrows are matched to patients. The process
would reduce problems with immune rejection.</TE>
<TE>   But such an undertaking would require many egg cells and probably
would reopen further controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done some theoretical calculations," Robins said. To
provide matches for the world's population, he said, "it would take
500 to 600 cell lines." That is 10 times the number of existing cell
lines approved for government research.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bills That Reconcile California and Federal Tax
Rules</HD>
<DH>Finances: Action brings the state in line with enhanced
retirement savings options approved by Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed sweeping tax conformity bills Wednesday night,
making it possible for Californians to finally take full advantage of
the enhanced savings options approved by Congress last summer.</LD>
<LD>   The bills, which are retroactive to the beginning of 2002, allow
individuals to save more for education and in a variety of
tax-favored retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and individual
retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Another recently signed conformity law makes public employee
retirement plans more flexible.</LD>
<TE>   Before the bills' passage, many companies feared that their
retirement programs would be disqualified if they allowed
Californians to boost their contribution levels to the new, more
generous amounts allowed by federal law, so they blocked their
employees from saving more in tax-favored plans.</TE>
<TE>   The state's residents also could not contribute as much to
education IRAs as residents in other states--$500 a year versus
$2,000 a year elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Government employees also complained that problems that had been
fixed in public employee pension plans in the rest of the country
continued to dog public employees here because the state hadn't
adopted the federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real win for California taxpayers," said Assemblywoman
Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro), who sponsored the measure. "They can
put more money away for retirement and education, and they no longer
need to be confused by the differences between state and federal
law."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly members said they had received thousands of phone calls
over the last few months from constituents who were confused or
angered because they couldn't take full advantage of a variety of tax
changes that had been enacted last summer in federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's signature of dual bills--Corbett's and an identical
bill sponsored by state Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena)--will put
residents of the Golden State on an equal footing with people in
other states where the federal law is already in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators initially estimated that tax conformity would cost
$44million, but they were able to make changes--including collecting
tax money sooner--to mitigate the lost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a summary of the changes in federal law that now are
matched by California's tax code:</TE>
<TE>   Retirement provisions:</TE>
<TE>   * The limit on yearly contributions to 401(k) and 403(b) plans is
raised to $11,000 in 2002 from the previous limit of $10,500.</TE>
<TE>   * Contribution limits to 457 plans--a public employee defined
contribution plan that's similar to a 401(k)--are hiked to $11,000 a
year from $8,500.</TE>
<TE>   * Annual contribution limits on IRAs are raised to $3,000 from
$2,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to so-called SIMPLE retirement plans now
can jump to $7,000 in 2002 from $6,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Catch-up payments are allowed for those 50 or older. The
catch-up provision allows those contributing to an IRA or SIMPLE
account to put in an extra $500 this year, for a total allowable
contribution of $3,500 for IRAs and $7,500 for SIMPLE accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Those contributing to 401(k), 403(b) or 457 accounts can make
$1,000 in catch-up contributions this year, allowing them to save a
total of $12,000 annually in these accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Education:</TE>
<TE>   * Annual contributions to education IRAs are boosted to $2,000
from $500.</TE>
<TE>   * Tax-free distributions from 529 plans are allowed when the money
is used for education. The 529 plans are state-sponsored education
savings accounts that offer no upfront tax deductions, but allow
investment earnings to grow on a tax-deferred basis.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, if the money ultimately is used to finance education,
withdrawals will be exempt from federal and state income and capital
gains taxes. Investment earnings were previously taxable when the
money was withdrawn from the accounts.</TE>
<TE>   * Education IRA money can be used to finance private elementary
and secondary school expenses.</TE>
<TE>   * Individuals can contribute to an education IRA and a 529 plan in
the same tax year, which could not be done under previous tax law.</TE>
<TE>   Other provisions:</TE>
<TE>   * The bill also revised the child- and dependent-care tax credit
in conformity with changes in federal law, which make this credit
more generous.</TE>
<TE>   The credit, which is available to those who pay day-care costs so
both parents can work or attend school, now will be worth a maximum
of $907 in California versus the previous limit of $416.</TE>
<TE>   * Charitable contributions of appreciated property such as stock,
land and art will be exempt from the alternative minimum tax.</TE>
<TE>   There are many differences between state and federal tax law.
However, only a few--such as the fact that California does not
differentiate between ordinary income and capital gains--affect
individuals.</TE>

<HD>Subpoenas Issued Over Enron Notes</HD>
<DH>Energy: Authors of recently released memos detailing
pricing tactics are to appear before Senate subcommittee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators Thursday subpoenaed five current and
former lawyers for Enron to appear at a hearing next week on price
manipulation in California's energy markets, as state officials
stepped up their demands for regulatory reform.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Commerce Committee issued the subpoenas for the four
authors of memos released this week that detailed an array of Enron
price-manipulation strategies, and the lawyer who received the memos.
The attorneys were ordered to appear at a hearing Wednesday by the
subcommittee on consumer affairs.</LD>
<LD>   The memos were written as Enron and other companies operated in
California's deregulated energy markets. One of the memos, dated Dec.
6, 2000, said that one of Enron's trading ploys "may have
contributed" to California's declaration of a Stage 2 power emergency
Dec.5, and that other energy companies also were gaming the market.</LD>
<TE>   Amid growing pressure, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on
Wednesday ordered scores of utilities and power providers to turn
over their trading records.</TE>
<TE>   The new revelations have brought a return of the political
sparring--common during the height of the energy crisis in
2000-01--over whether the Bush administration has been responsive
enough to California's demands for refunds.</TE>
<TE>   With Gov. Gray Davis' handling of the crisis an issue in his
reelection campaign, his Democratic colleagues in Washington said the
Enron memos vindicate Californians who were scolded during the energy
crisis for creating the energy shortage by failing to build enough
power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to tell you, 'We told you so,'" said Rep. Sam Farr
(D-Carmel), who was joined at the news conference by Sen. Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif)., Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Atherton) and others.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling a meeting last year with Vice President Dick Cheney,
Boxer said, "You know what he told us when we complained? He said,
'You people use too much energy.' Well, he didn't know what he was
talking about."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said earlier this week that
the memos were obtained "as part of an ongoing investigation launched
by this administration" and expressed confidence that federal
regulators would vigorously investigate allegations of market
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, during a conference call with reporters, renewed his demand
to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to step in and repair
California's still-malfunctioning markets, to refund nearly $9billion
to the state and to help renegotiate long-term power contracts that
the state signed when prices were artificially high. Davis said he
might even increase the refund request in light of the latest
revelations.</TE>
<TE>   FERC was slow to act to help California, waiting until last June
to apply price caps to power markets throughout the West, Davis said.
Those caps and other mitigation measures are set to expire Sept. 30,
and Davis urged FERC to extend them and provide other market fixes.</TE>
<TE>   California needs tougher rules to combat manipulation that only
FERC can institute, Davis said. He noted that FERC recently denied a
request from the California Independent System Operator, which
oversees the flow of power in the state, for stricter trading
regulations like those used by Eastern independent system operators.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said FERC did reject the proposal
but told the agency to resubmit its request as part of a more
comprehensive market redesign.</TE>
<TE>   "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is on the spot. These
memos amount to a confession by Enron of its cynical efforts to
defraud Californians," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Electricity deregulation will not work in this country unless we
have a strong referee in charge," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) added: "The reality now that
we have seen these Enron memos makes it clear that California
consumers were robbed last year by the big energy companies.... It is
obvious to me that what we had was a premeditated, deliberate crisis,
and to add insult to injury the energy companies used their political
influence to keep the Bush administration and the congressional
Republicans from protecting California families."</TE>
<TE>   Power plant owners and electricity traders, such as Enron, have
repeatedly denied causing California's power woes, instead blaming a
shortage of generation and hydro-electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Two California Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce
Committee joined the call for the Justice Department to investigate
"any collusive activity that may have led to market manipulation and
contributed to soaring prices and blackouts during the state's energy
shortage."</TE>
<TE>   "Previous committee hearings have focused on unethical or
irregular financial practices by Enron," said Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm
Springs). "We now have reason to believe that illegal acts took
place."</TE>
<TE>   But Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for Rep. George Radanovich
(R-Mariposa), who also called for a Justice Department investigation,
said he is not convinced any laws were broken.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks that the Enron folks just kind of outmaneuvered,
outwitted and outfoxed and used a little bit more market savvy to
beat the California ISO, and that there was really nothing illegal
done here," Kennedy said. House Democrats from California, Oregon and
Washington pushed for an investigation by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for committee Chairman W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.), said no decision has been made on how to proceed.
"What are you going to accomplish?" he said. "Enron for all practical
purposes is dead. Unfortunately, for political reasons, some people
want to drag the bodies through the streets."</TE>

<HD>Credit Lyonnais Fraud Suit Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday threw out a lawsuit by California Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer accusing Credit Lyonnais and others of fraud in the
French bank's 1993 acquisition of the assets of failed Executive Life
Insurance Co.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed almost a year ago, claimed Credit Lyonnais
circumvented a state law barring foreign ownership of insurance
companies by hiding behind phony business fronts to purchase the
insurance company's junk bond portfolio for $3.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Credit Lyonnais and its partners sold some of those bonds and made
a profit of at least $2 billion, authorities have said, while
policyholders lost an estimated $4 billion. Lockyer sought $6 billion
in damages for violations of the state's false claims and unfair
competition law, as well as the federal anti-racketeering act.</LD>
<TE>   In dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz ruled
that the state insurance commissioner, who also has a lawsuit
pending, has exclusive standing to pursue the case under state law.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Lockyer was considering his next
move, which could include an appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals. "We will be reviewing the court's ruling to determine what
the next appropriate steps would be, and we'll be looking at what
legal avenues there are to pursue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The litigation stems from then-Insurance Commissioner John
Garamendi's 1991 seizure of Los Angeles-based Executive Life in what
was characterized at the time as the nation's largest insurance
company insolvency. A consortium of French investors won the bidding
to acquire the company and its high-risk junk bonds, which had a face
value of $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Policyholders sued to stop the sale, arguing that the value of the
bonds was higher than the $3.2-billion price Garamendi had agreed to.
But a judge overseeing the sale allowed it to go forward in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, a whistle-blower alleged that Credit Lyonnais
was the true purchaser and had conspired to conceal its role. That
disclosure triggered a wave of lawsuits charging fraud against the
bank and its partners, including one by then-Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush, two by policyholders and Lockyer's.</TE>
<TE>   Matz already had thrown out the two policyholder suits on the
grounds that the state insurance commissioner had exclusive standing
to press the case. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
dismissal of one of the suits last month and has yet to rule on the
other.</TE>
<TE>   The policyholders and Lockyer--but not the insurance
commissioner--accused deal broker Apollo Advisors and several of its
principals of participating in the conspiracy. Policyholders allege
Apollo earned $500 million on the deal that should be returned to
them. If Matz's dismissals stand, the Apollo defendants are off the
hook because they obtained the insurance commissioner's release from
liability last year in exchange for testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Apollo lawyer Michael Weiner had criticized the Lockyer suit as
baseless. He could not be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Schaefer, the San Diego lawyer representing policyholders,
said money Apollo earned on the deal should go to policyholders if it
is determined the sale was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if [Apollo President Leon] Black and Apollo didn't know
about the fraud, the commissioner should pursue the profits," he
said. "They got something they didn't deserve because of a phony
deal. They shouldn't get to keep it."</TE>

<LD>An onslaught of new cars and trucks from Ford Motor Co. should keep
the world's second-largest auto maker on schedule to return to
profitability and regain market share lost in last year's stunning
reversals, company executives told shareholders at Ford's annual
meeting Thursday in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman and Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr. reiterated the
company's earlier forecast by saying Ford Motor is on track to "break
even or better" by year's end with a profitable second half.</LD>
<LD>   The company lost $5.45 billion last year, largely on the costs of
its massive recall of tires from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., and
posted an $800-million loss for the first quarter this year on costs
of a new restructuring plan.</LD>
<TE>   That plan calls for Ford Motor this year alone to trim 5,000 jobs
from its worldwide payroll and cut production costs by $375 million.
The full five-year goal calls for elimination of 35,000 jobs, five
plants and four slow-selling models from its Ford and Mercury brands.</TE>
<TE>   In his first meeting with shareholders as chief executive since
ousting Jacques Nasser from that post last year, Ford said the
company already is more than halfway to achieving this year's
restructuring goals.</TE>
<TE>   Recapturing market position might take a little longer, but Chief
Operating Officer Nicholas V. Scheele said the firm believes it can
boost sales and share through its plan to introduce nearly four dozen
new or redesigned vehicles worldwide during the next five years, 20
in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Tough new competition from General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler,
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. has hurt Ford Motor in the
sport utility vehicle and full-size pickup segments it once ruled.</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to corporate reform in the wake of the Enron Corp. and
Arthur Andersen scandals, CEO Ford told shareholders that the
company's 14-member board intends to revise rules this week to
replace director John L. Thornton, president of investment banker
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., on the audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that every member of that committee is an
independent director by anyone's definition of the word," Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one shareholder of the nearly 400 present, corporate critic
Evelyn Y. Davis, complained of the $4.9 million that Nasser received
when he retired under pressure last year. But Ford said it was not
severance pay but salary, bonus and incentive money Nasser had earned
in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   The annual meeting, the company's first in California, was held at
the new Lincoln Mercury world headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor shares lost 6 cents to close at $15.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Gap Controls Costs, Posts 1st-Quarter Profit</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc., the biggest U.S. clothing retailer, had an unexpected
first-quarter profit of 2 cents to 3 cents a share after sales fell
less than forecast and the company controlled costs. Gap's stock rose
to a four-month high.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had anticipated a loss of 4 cents in the period ended
Saturday, according to the average estimate of those surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call. Sales fell 9% to about $2.9 billion
from $3.2 billion a year earlier, Gap said.</LD>
<LD>   Gap held down expenses and kept inventory below levels of a year
ago, helping the retailer avoid a third straight quarterly loss.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Millard Drexler is returning the company to
selling more basic clothing such as khakis and jeans after trendy
fashions flopped. A less-than-expected sales decline in April
suggests that Drexler's strategy may soon begin to pay off, investors
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have faith in Drexler," said Gary Furukawa, chief investment
officer for Seattle-based Freestone Capital Management, which manages
$800 million in assets and owns 690,000 Gap shares.</TE>
<TE>   "You go through hot and cold streaks. He went through a cold
streak," Furukawa said.</TE>
<TE>   Ending two consecutive losses probably alleviated some investors'
concerns about the San Francisco-based company, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gap rose $1.08, or 7.3%, to $15.79 on the New York Stock
Exchange, their biggest percentage gain since Jan. 10. The stock has
risen 13% this year.</TE>

<HD>Lennar to Acquire Pacific Century</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The deal would make the company one of the
biggest home builders in the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Industry giant Lennar Corp. has reached a tentative agreement to
acquire privately held Pacific Century Homes of Temecula in a deal
that would create one of the Southland's biggest home builders.</LD>
<LD>   The move would allow Lennar to expand its Southern California
base, largely in San Diego and Orange counties, and become a dominant
player in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, analysts said.
Pacific Century Homes is the largest homebuilder in the Inland
Empire, where buyers are flocking for lower-cost housing.</LD>
<LD>   The combined companies, which closed 2,880 homes last year, would
become the third-largest homebuilder in Southern California behind
D.R. Horton Inc. at 3,260 units and KB Home at 2,986, according to
the Meyers Group, a real estate research firm.</LD>
<TE>   "For the Southland's Big Three, the key issue is land position,
and Lennar would be positioning itself for the next two years to take
advantage of one of the best markets in the nation," said Jeff
Meyers, who heads Irvine-based Meyers Group.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-based Lennar's plans were disclosed in a document filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although few details were
outlined, a source close to the company said Lennar's executives are
reviewing Pacific Century operations and expect to complete a deal in
30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Jaffe, who heads Lennar's offices in California, confirmed
that he described his company's intentions in a meeting earlier this
week with nearly 300 Pacific Century employees. "We explained to them
that we would be moving forward," Jaffe said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But he declined to disclose details of Lennar's plans. Pacific
Century executives did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   An acquisition would complete a stunning rise for Pacific Century
and its co-founders, William Lo and Neil Gascon, who launched the
company in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Pacific Century used stylish designs and made shrewd
land deals in areas that became popular with consumers. The company
focused early on first-time buyers, offering homes with 10-foot
ceilings for $120,000 and attracting seniors with single-story homes
and bedroom suites.</TE>
<TE>   Its strategy, described in a profile in Builder magazine, was
mining "small veins in California's economy with strong home designs
that appeal to demographic niches."</TE>
<TE>   But large builders such as Lennar have been swiftly acquiring
smaller builders in recent years. One study by the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen predicted that within the next decade, three of four
new U.S. homes will be built by the nation's top 20 builders. That's
a significant change from a couple of years ago, when the biggest
companies accounted for less than half of all new homes.</TE>

<HD>Northrop to Relocate Division to El Segundo</HD>
<DH>Defense: Headquarters of military aircraft unit will leave
Dallas to be closer to major projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp., the nation's third-largest defense
contractor, said Thursday that it would relocate the headquarters of
its military aircraft business from Dallas to El Segundo, moving
senior executives closer to the company's largest aircraft
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Although only about 40 people will be relocated to El
Segundo--mostly top executives and their administrative staff--the
move was seen as a psychological boost to Southern California's
aerospace industry, which has had a stream of companies take their
staffs elsewhere amid a general industry downturn in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The main office for the military aircraft business was once based
in Hawthorne before it was combined with the commercial aircraft
operations to form the Integrated Systems unit and then relocated to
Dallas in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, Century City-based Northrop sold the commercial
aero-structures business, which made the fuselage for Boeing Co.'s
747 commercial jetliner, and has seen its Dallas headquarters staff
dwindle to about 230.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, its Southern California operations have been
regaining prominence, garnering major programs such as building the
center fuselage for the Joint Strike Fighter and developing the
Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of the military aircraft unit's 12,000 employees work
in the region, most of them concentrated in sprawling facilities near
Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "From unmanned systems to our role on the Joint Strike Fighter,
Southern California is home to several of our most dynamic and
promising programs," said Scott Seymour, president of the unit.
"Therefore, it makes sense to align our headquarters with our growing
businesses."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the move, which is expected to be completed by the end
of the year, 55 people in all will be moved to El Segundo and
elsewhere, and 100 employees will lose their jobs. Seventy-five
employees who work at the unit's financial service center will remain
in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, General Dynamics Corp. said it was challenging the
Pentagon's awarding of a $2.9-billion contract to Northrop to develop
the next generation of destroyers for the Navy, on the grounds that
Northrop and its lead partner, Raytheon Co., were given an unfair
advantage by a flawed competition.</TE>
<TE>   The defense contractor, whose Bath Iron Works shipbuilding unit
lost the competition, said it had filed a protest with the General
Accounting Office, hoping to overturn the Pentagon decision last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "After careful review of the facts provided during the Navy's
debriefing, it is obvious to us that the selection process was not
consistent with established evaluation criteria and thereby gave an
unfair advantage to the 'Gold team' led by Northrop," Bath Iron Works
President Allan Cameron said.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy official defended the competition, saying the contract was
handled "in accordance with appropriate federal acquisition
regulation procedures and was competitively awarded based on best
value."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to discuss specific points of the protest.</TE>

<HD>Retailers Report Weak April Sales</HD>
<DH>Economy: Early Easter, bad weather are cited. Even
discounters miss expectations, worrying some economists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bad weather in much of the country and an early Easter resulted in
poor sales in April for many retailers, further clouding the debate
over whether consumers can sustain strong spending that has fueled
the fledgling economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Lower or disappointing retail sales reported Thursday--especially
from strong discount retailers such as Target Corp.--contributed to
some economists' views that the recovery will be weaker than
expected.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, some analysts said, March and April sales
numbers are notoriously unreliable, in part because Easter buying
shifts from one month to the other and skews year-over-year
comparisons. Easter this year landed in March.</LD>
<TE>   So although April sales at retail chain stores open at least a
year rose only 1.6% compared with a year ago, sales for both March
and April were up an average of 4%, according to a Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi tally.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a worry, it's a worry that the pace of sales kind of
slipped toward the end of the month," said Michael Niemira, an
economist and retail analyst with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New
York. "People are now asking if this is more than just a weather
story, now that we're seeing more pessimistic economic news in
general."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, proved to be even more important during
the last 18 months, as consistently strong spending kept the
recession from worsening.</TE>
<TE>   With various indicators showing the recovery weakening after a
strong first quarter, economists and investors are closely watching
for any sign of a retreat in consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Among the April surprises was a relative weakening in sales at
discount stores.</TE>
<TE>   Long the industry's leaders, off-price merchants in April posted a
3.1% year-over-year sales gain in stores open at least a year, below
estimates of a 4% gain, according to a Goldman Sachs retail sales
tally. Goldman Sachs pegged the overall April sales gain at 0.8%,
well off estimates of 2.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Leading discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 3.3% sales
gain, in the mid-range of estimates of a rise between 2% and 4%.
Costco Wholesale Corp., with a 6% April gain, fell short of what some
analysts had estimated would be an 8% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Target's discount stores reported a 0.8% increase for April, off
from what many analysts anticipated would be a rise of between 4% and
6%. Target executives, however, maintained that sales met the
company's estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some retail leaders barreled ahead in April. Discounter
Kohl's Corp. reported a 5.3% sales increase despite its strong
presence in the Midwest, where other retailers complained of
unseasonably cold weather biting into sales.</TE>
<TE>   Among department stores, a group greatly affected by the Easter
shift, even sales losses looked good to many on Wall Street. That's
because those decreases were not as bad as feared or were reported
along with projections for profit gains.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's, Bloomingdale's
and other chains, posted a 5.9% decline in sales in April and a
decline of 2.9% for the first quarter. But it said lean inventory and
strict cost controls contributed to better-than-expected profit
margins.</TE>
<TE>   The company said first-quarter earnings would rise to between 40
cents and 43 cents a share, up from earlier estimates of between 25
cents and 30 cents.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney Co.'s department stores posted a 5.5% gain, mostly as
a result of special promotions during April. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
fell 2.8% and May Department Stores gained 3.9%, also a result of a
shift in sales events.</TE>
<TE>   "The value guys, while they are doing well, are not beating the
numbers to the same degree that they were previously and in many
cases are missing or hitting the low end of estimates," said Todd
Slater, a retail analyst with Lazard Freres &amp; Co. in New York. "There
is more relative improvement in the [same-store sales] for the
specialty and department stores."</TE>
<TE>   Many investors seized on those numbers, sending shares of Wal-Mart
and Target down while bidding up Federated and May. Wal-Mart fell
$1.40 to close at $54.99, while Target dropped $2.29 at $42.03, both
on the New York Stock Exchange. May rose 30 cents to $35.53, and
Federated added $1.80 to $41.39, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Sempra Expects Profit to Climb 12% in 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy, owner of California electric and gas utilities, said
2003 profit probably will rise 12% from projected earnings this year,
boosted by energy trading, power generation and pipeline business.</LD>
<LD>   Profit next year will increase to about $615 million, or $2.90 a
share, from estimated earnings of $550 million, or $2.65, this year,
Chief Executive Stephen Baum said at a conference with analysts and
investors.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego company was expected to earn $2.61 a share this year
and $2.84 in 2003, the average estimates of analysts polled by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Since the deregulation of California's power market in 1998,
Sempra has been expanding in energy trading and power plants outside
the U.S. Sempra's San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, California's No.3
investor-owned electric utility, largely escaped the problems that
drove the state's two largest utilities to insolvency last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a positive, given the weak conditions in the energy industry
year-to-date," that the company is reaffirming its forecasts, said
Argus Research analyst Jeffrey Gildersleeve, who rates Sempra "hold"
and doesn't own the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Increases in profit will come from a natural-gas pipeline and
power plants in northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest and "robust"
trading operations, Baum said. "We think this is a strong basis for
meeting our goal of 8% to 10% growth for 2002 and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   By 2004, about 50% of Sempra's earnings will be from businesses
that aren't regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission,
Baum said.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra shares were down 19 cents to $24.93 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have dropped 12% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Xerox Reportedly Close to $3.5-Billion Loan Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. is close to an agreement on a $3.5-billion three-year
loan, people familiar with the talks said. The money may cost the
largest copier maker $9.5 million a month more in interest than what
it now pays.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox has agreed with its lead bank, Bank One Corp., on the loan
and is awaiting approval from 56 other banks, the sources said. The
banks may charge the company 3.75 to 4 percentage points above
benchmark lending rates, compared with the 0.5 percentage point it
now pays, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The Stamford, Conn.-based company took out a $7-billion loan in
2000 and has said it expects to arrange refinancing by the end of
June, four months before the loan is due. Moody's Investors Service
Inc. cut Xerox's "junk" credit rating three levels last week on
concern that falling sales may make it difficult to repay debt. Xerox
has said it may go out of business if loan terms aren't reworked.</LD>
<TE>   "What the banks end up getting is going to suggest the fate of
Xerox," said Andrew Reid of AV Reid Investments in New Orleans, which
owns $2 million of Xerox debt. "The more money the banks require, it
says they believe Xerox has less of a chance to pay the loan back."</TE>
<TE>   Xerox has $1.27 billion in debt due this year and $1.3 billion in
debt maturing in 2003, according to Bloomberg data.</TE>
<TE>   The company had a cash balance of $4.7 billion as of March, helped
largely by financing from GE Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.
GE Capital has agreed to take over Xerox's equipment financing unit,
and Xerox has received about $2.3 billion in financing from GE
Capital since November.</TE>
<TE>   To get the new loan, Xerox has offered to pay back as much as
$3.5billion of the credit maturing in October, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox shares rose 45 cents to $8.15 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain</DL>
<LD>MANAMA, Bahrain -- Women candidates failed to win seats Thursday in
Bahrain's landmark municipal elections, which were hailed by
officials and the opposition as another step toward democratic
reforms in this small Gulf Arab state.</LD>
<LD>   Bahrain last held municipal elections 32 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The revival of the polls, in which women were candidates for the
first time, was part of the kingdom's efforts to end decades of
simmering sectarian tension.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Minister Sheik Abdullah ibn Khalid Khalifa, announcing the
results at a news conference early today, said male candidates won 30
of the 50 contested seats. The remainder will be decided after a
second round of balloting next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The government will still appoint the heads of the five municipal
councils, each with 10 elected members.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 candidates, including 30 women, took part in Thursday's
election.</TE>
<TE>   "Women had the same chance as everyone else," Abdullah said. "The
results reflect the will of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Women in Bahrain were given the right to vote in the 1920s. But it
was only this year that the reformist ruler, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa
Khalifa, decided to allow them to stand in elections as well.</TE>

<HD>Deal Ends Standoff in Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: 13 Palestinians heading into exile are the first
to pass through a metal detector outside the church. Europe was key
in resolving the 5-week impasse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A siege at the Church of the Nativity that commanded world attention
for five weeks ended early this morning as more than 120 Palestinians
began trudging out, one by one, tired and hungry, some waving and
signaling victory, others kneeling to pray.</LD>
<LD>   .</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, church bells pealed as the 13 Palestinians considered by
Israel to be the most dangerous of the group started leaving the 4th
century compound, passing through a metal detector on their way to
waiting buses. They were scheduled to be flown to Cyprus and then to
various other European countries.</LD>
<TE>   "As long as they are out of the country, we're happy," said Capt.
Sharon Feingold, an Israeli military spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of those being exiled called their names, waved and
shouted, "Goodbye, my love!" and "God is great!" from a rooftop
several hundred yards away as the men were guided onto the buses.</TE>
<TE>   The first person to leave the church was Abdallah Daud Kader, the
head of the Palestinian intelligence service in Bethlehem. Sporting a
heavy beard and a black-and-white checked kaffiyeh, he had to pass
several times through the metal detector, take off his jacket and
then his belt before he was allowed to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Daud, 41, is accused by Israel of smuggling weapons and supplying
militants with explosives for attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Abeiyat, the Bethlehem commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia affiliated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement
that has carried out numerous deadly attacks on Israelis, was among
the next to emerge. A notorious chain-smoker, he puffed on a
cigarette as he crossed Manger Square.</TE>
<TE>   The last of the 13 Palestinians, who had been shot in the leg
earlier in the siege, was carried out on a stretcher and was to be
taken to an Israeli hospital before being deported with the rest,
Feingold said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said it would leave Bethlehem soon, a move
that should end the citywide curfew that has been in place since
April 2 when the Palestinians took shelter in the church as the
Israeli military advanced.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say it was a great success," Israeli Brig. Gen.
Eival Gilady said of the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we had never had to be here," he said, but added that
security considerations made it necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement releasing the men mirrored earlier proposals
announced over the last several weeks. The problem has been the
details of the implementation, as mediators tried at each succeeding
round to make the agreement more specific. .</TE>
<TE>   After the 13 most wanted men left the compound, the remainder of
the Palestinians and others who had been stuck inside were to be
taken to the Gush Etzion military base in the West Bank for
processing under U.S. and European supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six of those Palestinians, whom Israel views as more
moderate threats, were to go by bus to the Palestinian-controlled
Gaza Strip. About 80 civilians and Palestinian security force members
were to be released after questioning.</TE>
<TE>   It is likely that 10 members of the nongovernmental group
International Solidarity Movement, who spent a week in the compound,
would be deported, Feingold said. They had crossed barriers
surrounding the complex and entered the church last week carrying
food to the besieged Palestinians. The activists were accompanied by
Times photographer Carolyn Cole.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four hours after the evacuation began, Cole left the
church, but the activists remained inside.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 48 hours, negotiators say, Europeans played a major
role in bringing the distrustful parties back to the table and
finding ways around nettlesome problems, backed by U.S. promises of
help to make sure terms of the agreement are met.</TE>
<TE>   A major key to the success this time was finding countries willing
to take the 13 men considered by Israel to be the most dangerous. The
job was made more complicated by Tuesday's suicide bombing near Tel
Aviv that killed 15 Israelis, as potential host countries worried
that they were inviting political and security trouble by taking in
the militants.</TE>
<TE>   A plan to leave the 13 men in the church until arrangements could
be finalized also proved a deal-breaker after the Israelis refused to
allow a European observer to stay with the men until a place could be
found for them.</TE>
<TE>   "That would leave them under the protection of the church," which
would have no practical ability to ensure their safety, said Anton
Salman, a Catholic lawyer representing the Church of the Nativity in
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   There were also apparent communication missteps. Canada issued a
statement saying that it had not been consulted and was not willing
to take the men, even though Ottawa's willingness had been widely
reported. Members of the Italian government also balked early on,
despite strong Vatican pressure to accept some or all of the 13 men,
and reports naming it the most likely landing spot.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the world welcomed the news of the end to this
particularly Mideast crisis, the final days of the standoff
underscored anew how quickly a deal just inches from delivery can
unravel in this part of the world--and how difficult it can be to put
the pieces back together.</TE>
<TE>   Early Thursday, just 24 hours before the men started emerging from
the church, the same buses had lined up, those inside the church were
all packed and ready to go and had bid their final farewells.</TE>
<TE>   Signs were similarly positive on the outside. Food was waiting for
the hungry siege victims, halogen lights illuminated Manger Square,
and the global media had been called to record the historic moment
from a nearby roof.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, word spread of a minor hitch. Just a wrinkle or two, a
few lingering questions about how Americans would guarantee security
for the exile-bound Palestinians and whether a European observer
could remain in the church with the 13 exiled men until a host
country could be found.</TE>
<TE>   Hitches in this part of the world, however, are rarely minor.</TE>
<TE>   With progress at the negotiating table evaporating, it was only a
matter of minutes before external signs of cooperation were erased,
lest they be misconstrued as weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles lined up to evacuate those inside the church were quickly
driven away. Israeli military weaponry was trained back on the
church. The lines of journalists were pulled back, and sniper weapons
were trained back on this small bit of sacred real estate that has
riveted international attention.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday afternoon, even the blimp that Israel maintained over
the church to spy on its inhabitants was flying again, a sort of
unofficial emblem of the standoff. And the weapon-laden crane used by
the Israelis to kill Palestinians in the church by remote control was
back in the square.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, the impasse had involved a few hundred people holed up
in an old building. But in fact, Bethlehem's sacred character and the
beliefs of its various inhabitants guaranteed that the siege would
quickly morph into a series of far larger power games involving a
host of American, European, Israeli, Palestinian and religious
players maneuvering in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson in Jerusalem contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>CIA Missile Targets Afghan Warlord</HD>
<DH>Asia: Strike misses the militant but signals apparent
expansion of agency's role in the war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The CIA fired a missile this week at an Afghan warlord
accused of plotting attacks on his nation's interim government and
American troops, a U.S. official said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The strike apparently marks the first time in the Afghanistan war
that the United States has set out to kill an enemy not officially
part of the Al Qaeda terrorist network or the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   The missile, fired Monday from an unmanned Predator plane, missed
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the head of a militant Islamic party that
opposes the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. But the
strike--near Kabul, the Afghan capital--killed several of Hekmatyar's
associates, said the U.S. official, who was familiar with the attack.
He requested anonymity because of the clandestine nature of the
operation.</LD>
<TE>   The strike seems to signal an expansion of the CIA's mission in
Afghanistan to include hunting enemies not directly linked to the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   It raised eyebrows in intelligence circles in Washington. Some
questioned whether its primary aim was to protect interim Afghan
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, thereby putting the CIA in the position
of eliminating enemies of an unelected foreign leader.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were doing that because the guy was a threat to Karzai, we
are really going down a new path, and one we absolutely should not go
down," said a former CIA official who also asked not to be
identified. Such a role, he said, would be tantamount to enlisting
the CIA as "the enforcing arm of this new emir."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA declined to comment on the strike. But two officials
familiar with the operation stressed that it was prompted by evidence
that Hekmatyar posed an ongoing threat to both Karzai and U.S.
troops.</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar "was involved in planning terrorist attacks against U.S.
forces in Afghanistan and had also offered rewards to people who were
willing to kill Americans," said one of the officials. "He's a nasty
character who is involved in terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to questions about the strike, President Bush said, "I
can assure you when we go after individuals in the theater of war,
it's because they intend to do some harm to America."</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar, 52, is the leader of Hezb-i-Islami, a primarily ethnic
Pushtun political party. Members of the party recently were accused
by the Afghan interim government of plotting to set off a bomb to
kill Karzai or overthrow his regime. Scores of suspects were arrested
last month in connection with the alleged scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said the Predator fired a Hellfire missile
on a gathering near Kabul believed to include Hekmatyar and his
followers. But many details surrounding the strike remain unclear,
including how Hekmatyar managed to escape, apparently without serious
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar has a colorful history. He emerged in the 1980s as one
of the leading players in the CIA-financed war to oust the Soviet
military from Afghanistan. But even then, he was an avowed opponent
of the United States. When he and six other moujahedeen leaders
visited the United Nations in the mid-1980s, Hekmatyar was the only
one to refuse President Reagan's invitation to visit the White House.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan in 1989, Hekmatyar
served as prime minister in a contentious coalition government. He
launched a bloody campaign against other moujahedeen leaders and
controlled forces that destroyed much of Kabul. When the Taliban,
capitalizing on the chaos caused by civil war, seized control of the
country in 1996, Hekmatyar fled to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Afghanistan in February.</TE>

<HD>A New Day for Il Duce</HD>
<DH>Half a century after his death, Benito Mussolini is
fascinating many Italians again. Some say his reputation was due for
a reevaluation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PREDAPPIO, Italy</DL>
<LD>It began quietly, without warning. One morning, three young skinheads
on a secret mission entered the crypt, donned black capes and took
turns standing at grim attention by their hero's tomb.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, another stone-faced trio took up the 11-hour watch,
and before many people noticed, the stealth vigil had become a daily
routine. Today, nearly a year later, the ritual is an established
fact: Benito Mussolini, the long-disgraced fascist dictator, has a
posthumous honor guard.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Ivo Marcelli, a former Communist, is outraged. Having such
an infamous native son is awkward enough, he complains, but the honor
guard has this little town under a kind of paramilitary siege. Over
the mayor's protests, the silent men in capes keep coming from all
over Italy and now number about 400.</LD>
<TE>   Mussolini is enjoying a revival, and its strength is evident far
beyond his grave. Fifty-seven years after he was shot dead by Italian
partisans while trying to flee the country and strung upside-down in
a piazza in Milan, Italy's shame about its vanquished World War II
ruler is yielding to the curiosity and fascination of generations
born since.</TE>
<TE>   As a political force in Italy, fascism may be as dead as Mussolini
himself. But with mainstream nationalists holding power in Rome and
gaining strength across Europe, historians are reassessing his
legacy, and restraints on the country's long-hidden fascist
subculture are loosening.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a law that bans public glorification of fascism, shops and
flea markets all over Italy sell everything from T-shirts to bottles
of wine bearing the boulder-jawed image of Il Duce. For those who
love kitsch, there's a Snoopy dog with a menacing glare on his face
and a black truncheon in his paw.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibits of fascist-era art and schoolbooks draw crowds.
Newsstands offer a 15-video set of Mussolini's speeches, and a
televised interview with his daughter drew 3.5 million viewers last
fall--a huge audience here for such programming.</TE>
<TE>   The dictator's homes are being restored and opened to the paying
public. A dedicated traveler can now trace Mussolini's life from the
farmhouse where he was born here in 1883; to Villa Torlonia, his Rome
residence when he ruled Italy from 1922 to 1943; to Villa
Feltrinelli, now a five-star hotel on picturesque Lake Garda, where
he led a tiny rump republic under German army protection until his
capture and execution in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   And if Guido Costa, the mayor of Tremestieri Etneo, gets his way,
nostalgia tourists will be able to add his Sicilian town to the
itinerary and stroll down the proposed "Via Benito
Mussolini--Statesman." Italy's resurgent interest in its most
notorious 20th century figure defies the politically correct
portrayal of his one-party regime as an unmitigated disaster. That
Cold War perspective was shaped by the Communists who led the
anti-fascist partisan struggle and the Socialists and Christian
Democrats who dominated the country's postwar politics.</TE>
<TE>   In that view, fascism was an unbroken plague of mass marches,
Pharaonic public works, press censorship, secret police, imperial
conquest and anti-Semitic laws, capped by a disastrous alliance with
Nazi Germany that provoked an Allied invasion and left Italy in
ruins. Mussolini's party was banned after the war, and a 1952 law
prohibited any public call for its revival.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, since corruption scandals brought down
Italy's center-left establishment and opened the way for right-wing
parties to vie for power, a more complex view of fascism, emphasizing
its benefits as well as its flaws, has gained ground.</TE>
<TE>   Volumes by Renzo De Felice and other Italian historians have
emphasized that Mussolini was beloved during most of his heyday for
modernizing the country, defending family values, suppressing the
Mafia and making the trains run on time. That popularity broke down
only with the devastation of the war, they point out.</TE>
<TE>   The election of a center-right government under media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi last May has further eroded the anti-fascist
taboos.</TE>
<TE>   But it has also kept Mussolini's emboldened but tiny band of
loyalists out on the fringe.</TE>
<TE>   Gianfranco Fini, whose National Alliance is the reformed heir to
the Fascist Party, has embraced the political mainstream to become
Berlusconi's deputy prime minister. Seeking respectability as Italy's
delegate to a European Union panel, Fini in January retracted his
1994 characterization of Mussolini as the century's greatest
statesman.</TE>
<TE>   Many Italians welcome all these changes as evidence that fascist
political power is irretrievable and that a more balanced look at its
historical and cultural imprint is now possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Paradoxically, as fascism recedes over the historical horizon, it
is becoming more of a folkloric phenomenon," said Franco Pavoncello,
a political science professor at Rome's John Cabot University.
"Before, it was unacceptable, hidden. Now you see people trying to
establish a connection with the past."</TE>
<TE>   To others, however, the fascination with Mussolini borders on a
rehabilitation that would be impossible in Germany for Adolf Hitler,
his Nazi protege and wartime ally.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the heat cannot suppress the shiver provoked by the open
respect given to Italy's biggest war criminal," James Walston, a
British-born political scientist who is active in Italian politics,
remarked after visiting Mussolini's tomb last summer. "The reason for
this revival, this acceptability, is that younger people do not know
what fascism was really like."</TE>
<TE>   'Fascism Was Never</TE>
<TE>   Fully Defeated'</TE>
<TE>   That's because Italy, which finished the war in the Allied camp,
failed to come to terms with its own war crimes, as the Germans did,
or prosecute its worst offenders, Walston said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fascism was never fully defeated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no place in Italy stirs such debate more easily than
Predappio, a farming village that in 1925 was transformed by its
native son into a model of town planning and that feels the
conflicting impulses of a nation reappraising his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Fascism was an important world event. It made Italy an
international player and cannot be erased," said a 75-year-old
retired Predappio bricklayer who identified himself only as Sergio.
"But we cannot go back. No, no, no! Democracy is just fine. No one
imposes anything."</TE>
<TE>   Set in rolling vineyard country near Bologna, Predappio has 6,000
inhabitants and a single piazza, surrounded by the monumental Church
of St. Anthony, a hospital, a police station, the old party
headquarters and the Town Hall--five institutions that helped
maintain fascist control.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything you see here, Mussolini created," Pierluigi Pompignoli
told a visitor during a drive through the square.</TE>
<TE>   The 65-year-old merchant pointed proudly to an engraving of the
fasci--the bundles of rods borne by magistrates in ancient Rome and
adopted by the fascists as their party emblem--on the church facade.
Right after the war, "the Communists wanted to get up there and erase
it," he said, "but the brothers formed a cordon and saved it."</TE>
<TE>   Predappio has been a battleground since. The main street, Via
Roma, was renamed in honor of Giacomo Matteotti, a Socialist slain by
a fascist gang in 1924. Like much of Italy after the war, the
townspeople elected leftists and tried to obliterate all signs of the
dictator.</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, however, the town's leaders reluctantly allowed the
dictator's rotting corpse, which had been exhumed by supporters from
a grave near Milan, to be moved to the Mussolini family crypt here.
The remains were placed in a large granite tomb topped with a marble
bust of Il Duce and a box containing part of his brain.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Predappio has been a magnet for old comrades and
young fascists in black shirts--the uniform of his party--who gather
each year to sing party hymns and raise stiff-armed salutes on the
anniversaries of Mussolini's birth, death and rise to power. A guest
register in the crypt bulges with comments anticipating Mussolini's
return--some expressing the sentiment that next time, there will be
no mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide ban on such pro-fascist expression was never
lifted, but strict enforcement is not the Italian way. As the trickle
of pilgrims became a flood, town officials abandoned efforts to keep
out tour buses and fascist memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "You can call this a rehabilitation" of the dictator, declared
Pompignoli, who quit the poultry business 12 years ago to cash in on
the revival. His Predappio Tricolore, one of the town's three
purveyors of fascist kitsch, features the Mussolini 2002 calendar; Il
Duce graces the cover, a strong man in a pith helmet astride a white
horse.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Marcelli has a different take on the growing crowds.
According to his surveys, 30,000 people visited Predappio in 1990,
and 29,000 of them were Mussolini admirers. Today, more than 70,000
visitors come each year; most are still fascists, but a growing
proportion--at least 20,000-- are "merely curious about our history,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to invert that ratio against the black-shirted pilgrims,
Marcelli has announced plans to reinvent Predappio as a laboratory
for examining Mussolini's two-decade grip on Italy.</TE>
<TE>   He made a modest start in 1999 by opening the dictator's
birthplace to the public--not as a shrine but as an instructive
museum featuring exhibits on the regime's use of postcards, art,
architecture and sports as propaganda. Now he's asking Parliament for
funding to create a research center.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to become a venue for analysis and debate on the risks
and dangers of fascism," the 51-year-old mayor said. Could fascism
revive? "No, I don't believe Italy is ripe for another old-style
dictator. But we could succumb to anti-liberalism, an era of extreme
intolerance."</TE>
<TE>   One sign of that threat, he warns, is that politicians on the left
and right are blocking his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The left is afraid that the right will exploit our project as an
apology for fascism, and the right wants to wait until it gets
control of Town Hall," he said. A more telling sign was the
deliberate omission from an art exhibit in Predappio last spring of
any reference to Mussolini's persecution of Jews or alliance with
Hitler. Organizers said they wanted to avoid inflaming passions
during the national election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the edgy political mood that greeted Mussolini's honor
guard in June, a few weeks after Berlusconi's landslide at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The all-male guard began with a core of young skinheads from
social clubs tied to Fini's National Alliance and the tiny Forza
Nuova party, then grew by word of mouth. The participants chose capes
to evade Italy's rigid rules about who may wear uniforms and black
"to show respect" for a dead hero, said Arinaldo Grazziani, the
guard's 41-year-old vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi's government has denied supporting the guard but
ignored the mayor's call to ban it. Under the constitution, the mayor
argues, the state has exclusive domain over honor guards and has
authorized just two in Rome--one for the unknown soldier, one for a
pair of 19th century kings entombed in the Pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   To Mussolini's heirs, the guards are volunteers on private
property.</TE>
<TE>   "What harm are they?" asked Guido Mussolini, the dictator's
65-year-old grandson, who received 3,497 votes last year as Forza
Nuova's candidate for mayor of Rome. "They are not armed. They stand
in that crypt for hours and hours and hours. They meditate. They come
out changed, completely for the better. They don't hate anyone
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "who is greater? Those kings, or Mussolini?"</TE>
<TE>   Among outsiders, the guards are nearly as silent off duty as on.
One, a 48-year-old businessman, said they are sworn to secrecy about
their politics, the better to "keep this act of love for Benito
Mussolini unspoiled" by any appearance of partisanship. A wide range
of Italians, he said, admire Il Duce as a stronger, more honest ruler
than any Italy has had since.</TE>
<TE>   Anything said about the guards can be provocative. In response to
the mayor's protests, Guido Mussolini once made the claim that the
silent skinheads foster a mood of reverence in the dictator's crypt
and discourage vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous vandal rose to the challenge, slipping into the crypt
on a cold February morning and stealing the guest register.</TE>
<TE>   Aha! cried the mayor. Unguarded, the tomb had been trouble-free
since a 1971 bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the book has been taken from right in front of their eyes,"
he said. "This is ultimate proof that this so-called honor guard is
nothing but a folkloric stunt."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Residents stock up on food as Israeli troop
deployment heightens fears of a reprisal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks and troops moved close to the Gaza Strip on Thursday,
and state-run media said an attack was imminent in retaliation for a
suicide bombing Tuesday that killed 15 Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Gazans sent their children to school and went to work, but also
laid in stores of food, fearing the sort of siege on their towns,
villages and refugee camps that the Israeli army imposed in the West
Bank during the invasion launched March 29. The army issued call-ups
to an unknown number of reserve soldiers, normally a sign that a
large-scale operation is in the offing.</LD>
<LD>   After nightfall, street traffic in Gaza City was light, but
restaurants were open. At a popular beach hotel, groups of men
gathered to smoke water pipes and argue politics on a balcony
overlooking the sea.</LD>
<TE>   "What are we supposed to do, head for the bunkers?" said Ziad abu
Amer, a Gazan representative to the Palestinian legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security sources believe that the man who blew himself up
Tuesday night at a snooker club in the Israeli town of Rishon Le Zion
was a member of the militant movement Hamas and came from Gaza. But a
spokesman for the Islamic organization said he did not know who
carried out the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who did it, but we expect that angry Palestinians
will do more such attacks," Ismail abu Shanab said in an interview
with The Times. Hamas issued no formal claim of responsibility for
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Shanab mildly criticized the bombing, which he called "this
act of resistance," noting that "maybe this is a critical time and
maybe it is better not to do it at this time." Hamas has carried out
more suicide attacks on Israelis than any other Palestinian group
since fighting erupted in September 2000. There has been a total of
about 60 attacks, many of them in the heart of Israeli cities.</TE>
<TE>   The organization says it wants to destroy the 1993 Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians and to eliminate the
Jewish state. But it does not want to be blamed for triggering
Israel's knockout blow to the already weakened Palestinian Authority
or the expulsion of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The army swept into six of the West Bank's eight major cities in
the operation, occupying some for several weeks, but stayed out of
Palestinian-controlled areas of Gaza. The strip is the stronghold of
Islamic militant organizations that have carried out suicide
bombings, but Palestinian attackers sent from here rarely penetrate
the heavily patrolled fence that separates Gaza from Israel. Last
month, security officials argued that Gaza was relatively contained
and that the army would pay too high a price in casualties if it
mounted a massive ground operation.</TE>
<TE>   But those constraints appear to have been swept away by the Rishon
bombing, the deadliest attack by Palestinians since the army's West
Bank operation.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the coming operation
would be "functional, not territorial," a pinpointed targeting of
militant groups rather than an occupation of territory.</TE>
<TE>   But a worried Palestinian Authority, desperate to stave off
another crippling blow to its infrastructure, arrested 16 Hamas
members in Gaza after Arafat condemned the Rishon bombing in a
televised Arabic statement as a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Shanab said all those arrested are low-level supporters. He
denied that any were gunmen. "Now is not the time" for the
Palestinian Authority to crack down on the organization, Abu Shanab
said. "We have to be united, not fighting among ourselves, and
preparing for resistance."</TE>
<TE>   Although he acknowledged Israel's vast military superiority, Abu
Shanab warned that Israeli troops would face determined resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be prisoners in the Palestinian territories, they will
not be able to leave their tanks," he said. "People will find ways to
resist."</TE>
<TE>   Some Israeli commentators and politicians said they feared a
large-scale assault would result in heavy casualties among troops and
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1million mostly impoverished Palestinians, many of them
refugees, are crowded into squalid camps and cities in the Gaza
Strip, along with nearly 7,000 Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Militants have had ample time to booby-trap the camps, as they did
in a refugee camp in the West Bank city of Jenin, where 23 Israeli
soldiers and at least 50 Palestinians were killed in fighting last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Military analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the newspaper Yediot
Aharonot that the army "will rip Gaza to shreds ... but is it really
necessary?"</TE>
<TE>   Israel had not yet definitively determined that the Rishon bomber
came from Gaza, Fishman said, and even if Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon decided to smash the infrastructure of militant groups
in the strip and was proved correct, it might yet be too costly an
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing parliamentary opposition in
the Israeli parliament, said a large-scale operation in Gaza would be
a "mistake that Israel will regret." Terror must be fought, he said,
"but not on the backs of the civilian population."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon received carte blanche from his security Cabinet early
Thursday to act in the wake of the bombing. He is likely to enjoy the
backing of a majority of Israelis in a nation shaken to the core by
the government's inability to stop suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   By midday Thursday, Israel Radio was reporting the pending
invasion as a foregone conclusion.</TE>

<HD>Hungary Unnerves Its Neighbors--but Legally</HD>
<DH>Europe: Countries see a threat in Budapest's offer of
social services to ethnic brethren.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KISKUNHALAS, Hungary</DL>
<LD>KISKUNHALAS, Hungary -- A monument in this town's central square
displays two maps, today's Hungary and the much larger Hungary of the
past. Its implicit message, said a taxi driver standing nearby: "We
are so small now, and we will be so big again."</LD>
<LD>   Hungary lost nearly two-thirds of its territory in the post-World
War I breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the desire to
regain land helped draw it to the side of Nazi Germany in World War
II. Now, for the first time in more than five decades, this country
is again trying to do something about its dismemberment.</LD>
<LD>   A law that took effect Jan. 1 aims to keep alive a sense of
greater nationhood among nearly 3 million ethnic Hungarians in six
neighboring countries. Those who apply for special identification
cards can receive educational, medical and employment benefits while
visiting Hungary--including three-month work permits once a year--and
subsidies for Hungarian-language education at home.</LD>
<TE>   The measure seems innocuous to its supporters. But by seeking to
preserve a Hungarian identity for people living in other nations, the
so-called Status Law has triggered protests in Slovakia and Romania,
which fear Hungarian expansionism.</TE>
<TE>   "This law is very sensitive for Slovaks because it opens again the
idea of so-called Greater Hungary," Robert Fico, head of the populist
SMER party in Slovakia, said in an interview in Bratislava, his
nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   The fears have deep roots. Most of Slovakia was ruled as part of
the multiethnic Kingdom of Hungary for more than 900 years.
Transylvania, also part of the kingdom for centuries and now in
Romania, contributed much to Hungarian culture and history.</TE>
<TE>   The new law aims to help people such as Monika Moravecz, 26, and
her husband, Ladislav, 30. The ethnic Hungarians live in the southern
Slovakian town of Dunajska Streda. They plan to send their daughter
to Hungarian-language elementary school close to home, then to high
school and university across the border in Hungary. The law will make
this easier, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the money we care about," Monika Moravecz explained.
"It's just that we can show we feel Hungarian."</TE>
<TE>   That confirmation of Hungarian identity--in a passport-like
document with the crown of St.Stephen, Hungary's first king, on its
cover--is for many elderly people the most important aspect of the
law.</TE>
<TE>   "People will put it in a glass case to show off with other nice
things," said Peter Kovacs, 65, a resident of Dunajska Streda.</TE>
<TE>   A Fight Over Assimilation</TE>
<TE>   Although some ethnic Hungarians dream that the borders might
someday be changed, few seriously believe that can happen any time
soon. So the controversy over the law is most of all a fight over
assimilation and counter-assimilation.</TE>
<TE>   Many citizens of Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia are descended
from Hungarians who did not move from their own country but rather
saw borders redrawn around them. Should these people give up their
ethnic identity in favor of their country of citizenship? Or should
they remain, generation after generation, Hungarians in a foreign
land?</TE>
<TE>   For Kinga Valent, 28, an ethnic Hungarian living in the southern
Slovakian town of Samorin, the answer is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't come here," she said. "If you go to America, you know
you are immigrating. If you immigrate somewhere, it's your decision.
But my grandfather was born here, and my father was born here, and
all my family was born here. It's not my decision. It is a decision
pushed on me. It hurts if you are in Bratislava and people say, 'Shut
up, you stupid Hungarian! Speak Slovak!'"</TE>
<TE>   Valent said that she expects her baby boy to grow up as a
Hungarian but that it all depends on language.</TE>
<TE>   "If he has the opportunity to study in his mother tongue, he'll
feel Hungarian," she said. "If he doesn't, he won't."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she has no desire to see the border revised.</TE>
<TE>   "I think no one who is mentally OK would think of changing the
border, because it would mean war, something like [what] happened in
Yugoslavia," she said. "It is unthinkable. I haven't heard of anybody
who thinks this is a solution."</TE>
<TE>   The government in Budapest, Hungary's capital, insists that it
also has no interest in changing borders. But building a stronger
Hungarian cultural area in Central Europe is seen as a different
matter.</TE>
<TE>   During discussion of the law on a radio program, Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban said "a Hungarian-speaking region ... is now
forming, which will gather economic strength."</TE>
<TE>   Such comments galvanize fearful critics, with the backlash most
intense in Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   "This law has no place in a civilized Europe and belongs to the
Middle Ages," Anna Malikova, leader of the right-wing Slovak National
Party, declared in her nation's parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Medgyessy, poised to become Hungary's next prime minister
after leading a center-left coalition to victory in recent
parliamentary elections, said the incoming Socialist-led government
will back the new law.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to promote the development of Hungarian cultural life,
the operation of Hungarian universities and libraries, the operation
of Hungarian-language television and newspapers and the protection of
Hungarian traditions" in neighboring countries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The law drew sharp criticism at first in Romania. But the
government there reached agreement with Hungary in December to allow
all Romanians, regardless of ethnicity, to be eligible for the
three-month Hungarian work permits. That agreement in turn triggered
some opposition to the law within Hungary, because of fears that
Romanian workers might take jobs from locals.</TE>
<TE>   Some Governments Are Indifferent</TE>
<TE>   The law has not become a significant issue in other countries it
covers. The Hungarian minority is small in Croatia and Slovenia, and
the governments in Ukraine and Yugoslavia are preoccupied with more
serious problems. The measure exempts Hungary's seventh neighbor,
Austria, where ethnic Hungarians are wealthier and less numerous.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Hungarians in countries that do not border Hungary are not
covered.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental problem is that many people in the region "are
national minorities not by their free will but by peace treaties,"
said Zsolt Nemeth, state secretary for the Hungarian Foreign
Ministry. "In Central Europe, the borders of nations and borders of
states don't coincide."</TE>
<TE>   The 1920 Trianon Treaty, which set post-World War I borders,
reflected "bad decisions" that cut off more Hungarians from their
homeland than necessary, Nemeth added. The new law will help to
maintain "cultural and linguistic identity," he said. "Freedom of
choice of identity is at the heart of this legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of a Hungarian identity helps keep the border
issue alive.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, history is always moving and always changes," said
Istvan Csurka, head of the nationalist and populist Hungarian Justice
and Life Party. "Of course the borders can be adjusted. There are no
unchangeable borders.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean it for this period," he added. "I'm talking about
the historical possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream politicians say that Csurka's talk of changing borders
provides ammunition for anti-Hungarian nationalists in neighboring
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "You have loose cannons in every European country," said Nemeth,
stressing that Csurka's views on borders are "against Hungarian
foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   "Extreme nationalist parties are always allies. They hate each
other, but they help each other," said Zoltan Szabo, a member of
parliament and an official in the Hungarian Socialist Party.</TE>
<TE>   The law has prompted unreasonable fears within Hungary as well as
among its neighbors, Szabo said, adding that as countries of the
region join the European Union--a major goal of both Slovakia and
Hungary--borders will become insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Kovacs, the Dunajska Streda resident, hopes that the
countries' entry into the EU might someday put his hometown back in
Hungary, where it was before World War I and during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was born, I was a Czechoslovak citizen," explained Kovacs,
whose life story reflects the history of the 90% ethnic Hungarian
town. "Then, in two years' time, I was a Hungarian citizen. In 1945,
I was a Czechoslovak citizen again, and in 1993 I became a Slovak
citizen. But I always lived here."</TE>
<TE>   Because most younger Hungarians do not share his dream of a
greater Hungary, even the desire for an expanded Hungary will
disappear as years go by, predicted Tamas Fricz, director of the
Budapest-based 21st Century Institute for Political Science.</TE>
<TE>   "This generation of youngsters thinks about McDonald's and
basketball and watching American movies," he said. "They don't think
about revising borders."</TE>

<HD>Thousands in Netherlands Mourn Slain Maverick Politician</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Dutch citizens, many in tears, filed past the open
coffin of slain anti-immigrant politician Pim Fortuyn on Thursday in
a display of raw emotion rarely seen in this usually restrained
country.</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony in a Rotterdam cathedral, requested by Fortuyn's
family, was atypical. The last time a body lay in state was in 1962,
when Queen Beatrix's grandmother, Queen Wilhelmina, died.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old maverick, whose party had been expected to win
about 17% in Dutch elections next week, was shot outside a radio
station near Amsterdam on Monday. Animal rights campaigner Volkert
van der Graaf, 32, has been charged with his murder.</LD>
<TE>   Fortuyn's body was displayed in an open white coffin, dressed in a
dark suit, yellow tie and white shirt. The gunshot wounds to his
head, neck and back were not visible.</TE>
<TE>   "Pim, we're proud of you," read a card from Fortuyn's family, atop
a wreath of red roses near the coffin.</TE>
<TE>   Mourners carrying banners and huge photos of Fortuyn piled floral
tributes in the cathedral. Some crossed themselves as they approached
the body in a silent stream.</TE>
<TE>   Many women and a few men left the cathedral sobbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I am crying because of the injustice to Pim Fortuyn and his
ideals that have been so distorted by the media and politicians,"
said Angelika Lopez, 50, a receptionist.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure he did not die in vain," she said. "Something has to
change, otherwise the far right will step in and this whole country
will go down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   People from all walks of life stood in line from the early hours,
waiting for the cathedral to open. Most were white, but some were
from the Netherlands' large immigrant population, many of whom hail
from former Dutch colonies.</TE>
<TE>   By early evening, police estimated that about 20,000 people were
waiting to view the body. The cathedral was to close overnight before
Fortuyn's funeral is held there today.</TE>
<TE>   Openly gay, Fortuyn appealed to many Dutch voters with his plain
speaking and criticism of the complacency of a cozy ruling elite, but
he upset the left and many immigrants with demands to close the
country's borders and by calling Islam "backward."</TE>
<TE>   That did not stop 31-year-old Fauwsja, a Dutch Muslim from
Rotterdam, from wanting to pay her respects.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really very sad what happened," she said as she waited
outside the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we are Muslims, we agreed with some of the ideas he
stood for."</TE>

<HD>Show Afghanistan the Money, German Leader Urges World
Donors</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- After touring the rubble of this
once-resplendent city on the fabled Silk Road, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday urged the international community to
speed up $4.5 billion in reconstruction aid so that Afghans see the
fruits of peace before holding a congress to choose new leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Noting that some donors have taken a wait-and-see approach ahead
of next month's loya jirga, a conference of tribal elders that will
select the next government here, Schroeder said such hesitation could
disillusion Afghans about the outside world's commitment.</LD>
<LD>   "I have heard that financial institutions very much want to wait"
until after the gathering to release significant amounts of the aid
pledged at a January conference in Tokyo, Schroeder said. "It would
be better if at least the beginning of the changes in the country
were visible by the time the loya jirga convenes."</LD>
<TE>   The German leader also said his nation, which has contributed more
than 1,000 troops to a peacekeeping force here, was unlikely to add
more soldiers to the effort, despite a plea from his Afghan hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has played a leading role in the global effort to bring
peace and security to Afghanistan after more than two decades of
bloodshed. Schroeder's government was host to United Nations-brokered
talks near Bonn late last year that led to the appointment of an
interim Afghan government led by Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin is also bankrolling the loya jirga, which convenes June 10.
About 1,500 delegates from throughout Afghanistan will choose a
provisional head of state and parliament. Those institutions will run
the country until national elections can be organized about 18 months
later.</TE>
<TE>   Wary of the continuing power of some regional warlords and their
occasional efforts to undermine Karzai, donor countries have been
slow in sending money, except for the most urgent food and medical
needs.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, who met reporters together with Schroeder, cited the
programs for disarming factional forces, which are now stalled, as an
example of a further step toward stability that could be taken with
the arrival of more money.</TE>
<TE>   "The chancellor is very right in saying it is better for the
international community and international institutions to bring help
to Afghanistan right now and not wait for the loya jirga process,"
Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has promised more than $280million in aid over the next
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, who is enjoying widespread popularity and respect among
fellow Afghans as the chaos of the past fades, apparently made a
pitch to Schroeder for broader German participation in the
International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, which keeps the
peace in Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai has urged deployment of the peacekeepers in other sensitive
areas of Afghanistan to strengthen what remains a tenuous stability,
especially in northern and southeastern regions where warlords are
still fighting one another.</TE>
<TE>   But Schroeder made clear that his government feels it has gone as
far as it can by providing about one-fourth of the 4,500-member
peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   "With the presence we have mustered here in Kabul, we feel we have
reached the limit of our capabilities, and therefore we do not see
ourselves in a position to expand our area of operations beyond
Kabul," Schroeder said. He reiterated, however, that countries
contributing to the 18-nation force agree that the mandate should be
extended beyond its June expiration.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how long Afghans will need foreign forces to protect them,
Karzai said that depended on how quickly an Afghan national army
could be readied. The first 600 members of a planned force of 100,000
have received their initial training from international peacekeepers,
but Karzai predicted that it would take years to provide effective
defense and security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai had been lobbying Germany to take up command of ISAF after
the British complete their term at the helm next month. But Schroeder
turned down the Afghan leader during a March visit to Berlin, and
Turkey is now preparing, with U.S. economic assistance, to take over
the peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Bagram air base, where Afghan missions in the
U.S.-led coalition fight against global terrorism are being directed,
a senior British officer said Royal Marines scouring a mountainous
region of Paktika province had discovered four caves filled with
ammunition believed to belong to Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The search-and-destroy mission in eastern Afghanistan, called
Operation Snipe, seeks to roll up any support for the Islamic
militants who have engaged coalition forces in fierce battles in Tora
Bora in December and in the Shahi Kot valley in March. The Royal
Marines reportedly did not encounter enemy forces, but Brig. Roger
Lane said the operation has been successful in showing that "we can
deny them access to a safe haven for subsequent terrorist
operations."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the caves discovered by the 1,000-strong force involved in
Operation Snipe had been sealed with padlocked metal doors. Troops
will be exploring the caves once explosives experts check the
obstructions for booby traps, Lane told reporters at Bagram.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Increases Aid for Israel, Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House is moving to back up its words of support for Israel with
hard cash, as a key committee approved an additional $200 million in
aid to the Jewish state Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The bipartisan proposal would raise to nearly $3 billion the
amount of U.S. aid that Israel receives this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration was initially resistant but agreed to the
new spending after persuading lawmakers to package it with $50
million in additional humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   On a voice vote, the Appropriations Committee added the combined
aid package to a $29.1-billion anti-terrorism spending bill.</TE>
<TE>   That bill, which was nearing committee approval late Thursday,
also generated debate on the U.S. role in Colombia and congressional
oversight of military affairs and homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   But the action on the Middle East drew the most scrutiny, coming
just a week after both houses of Congress overwhelmingly approved
resolutions expressing solidarity with Israel and condemning
Palestinian suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Secretary of State Colin L. Powell agreed to the aid
package in a telephone conversation with Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.),
chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid,
it was clear that the impetus for the action came from Congress, not
from the administration.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush did not ask for more aid for either Israel or the
Palestinians when he sent Congress a $27.1-billion emergency spending
request in March. And his budget director recently urged lawmakers to
keep Middle East aid proposals out of the spending bill.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers contended that Israel urgently needs more money to
combat a campaign of terror against its citizens. Many compared the
Jewish state's situation with what the U.S. confronted after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah or whatever ... it's the
same war," said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who sponsored the Israel
aid amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Kolbe said Powell told him that the proposed aid to Israel would
be "much more useful" if balanced with humanitarian aid for
Palestinians. Kolbe's plan, which the committee adopted, would
appropriate the $200 million to help Israel with "activities relating
to combating international terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The money for the Palestinians would be for "humanitarian and
refugee assistance." But Kolbe said that it would be channeled
through international organizations and that no funds would go
directly to the Palestinian Authority. Some lawmakers supported the
aid reluctantly; a few opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the
committee, said he would back the proposal but was concerned that
Congress was undercutting Bush's leadership at a sensitive moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a special obligation not just to the state of Israel, but
to the president of the United States not to put him in a box," Obey
said. "It does a disservice to this country for us to pressure the
president in any way to provide aid to any of the parties in this
dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Sonny Callahan (R-Ala.), who opposed the proposal, said it
was politically motivated--a conclusion he claimed most lawmakers
privately shared. "I wish we could have a secret ballot" on the
amendment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting the proposed $200 million, the U.S. will provide
$2.76 billion in aid to Israel in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
No money is allocated for the Palestinian Authority, but an aide to
Kolbe said that Palestinians indirectly receive $75 million in U.S.
relief aid.</TE>
<TE>   With the additional Middle East money, the total cost of the
anti-terrorism bill would rise to $29.4 billion, most of which would
fund military operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere; domestic law
enforcement; disaster relief in New York; and homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, lawmakers also debated aid to Colombia. Rep. Jose E.
Serrano (D-N.Y.) criticized a provision that would allow U.S.
military aid to be spent not only on a Colombian campaign against
drug traffickers--as Congress recently agreed to--but also on certain
counter-terrorism activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Colombia will become a Spanish-speaking Vietnam for us if we
continue to go down this route," Serrano said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also defeated, on a party-line vote, a nonbinding
proposal to urge the homeland security chief, Thomas J. Ridge, to
testify before Congress. The administration has refused to allow
Ridge to give formal testimony on anti-terrorism plans, angering many
lawmakers.</TE>

<HD>Blast Kills 35 at Russian Holiday Parade</HD>
<DH>Europe: Authorities say the explosion at a Victory Day
celebration in southern city was a terrorist attack. The dead include
12 children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Russia's most emotional holiday--traditionally known as the
day celebrated through tears--was spoiled Thursday when a bomb blast
in the southern city of Kaspiysk killed 35 people, including 12
children, and left 130 wounded, many fighting for their lives.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion, which authorities immediately labeled a terrorist
attack, shocked the nation on Victory Day, when patriotism and joy
over the defeat of the Nazis in World War II mingle with sorrow over
the war dead.</LD>
<LD>   There was outrage as well as sorrow over the explosion on Lenin
Street, where soldiers, children and a military band were setting out
on a parade march and many veterans were gathered.</LD>
<TE>   The remote-controlled mine, planted near the roadside, was
directed to cause maximum casualties. Shrapnel sprayed at street
level in an arc as people marched by.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's NTV television aired film of the immediate aftermath:
scattered bodies of soldiers and children, and a man carrying an
unconscious boy, whose head was covered in blood, to an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Lyudmila Davydova, 50, a teacher who lives on Lenin Street near
where the mine exploded, saw the aftermath from her balcony.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most horrific picture in my life," she said in a phone
interview. "People were lying all over the street in a bloody pile of
bodies--soldiers, children, old people.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people were lying still. Some were trying to get up and
found that they didn't have one or two legs, so they fell back again.
Everyone was crying and screaming," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davydova said a student from her college, obliged to attend the
parade, had his leg torn off.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Rasulov, a journalist from the Novoye Delo newspaper in the
nearby city of Makhachkala, arrived an hour after the blast and saw
children's running shoes and musical instruments lying around, a tree
ripped out of the ground and streams of blood. He counted 17 shrapnel
holes in one person's boot.</TE>
<TE>   There was no claim of responsibility, but Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin blamed "bandits"--the term Russian authorities use
for Chechen separatists. Regional prosecutors also blamed Islamic
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Kaspiysk is in the republic of Dagestan, east of Chechnya, where
separatist rebels are resisting Russian forces. There have been many
fatal blasts in southern cities in recent years linked to the Chechen
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The attack's timing, on a military holiday, and target, a military
parade, also seemed to suggest a Chechen link. It came two weeks
after the news that Russian forces had assassinated Khattab, an
Arab-born Chechen warlord who was one of a few top rebel figures. The
slaying was a big setback for the separatist cause; Khattab was
considered the main intermediary for Arab funds flowing to Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's explosion came at 9:55 a.m. as Putin and top military
officials had assembled in Moscow's Red Square for a Victory Day
parade at 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Coming on the holiday when Russians celebrate what they see as the
Soviet Union's defeat of the Nazis, Thursday's blast was calculated
to cause maximum shock.</TE>
<TE>   "Even on a day when we are celebrating victory and commemorating
those killed in the war, even on this day, bandits kill peaceful
civilians, including children, coldbloodedly and purposefully," Putin
said in a tough speech at a Kremlin Victory Day function.</TE>
<TE>   As a garrison town, Kaspiysk has been targeted before: In 1996, a
bombing at an apartment building occupied by border guards and their
families killed 68.</TE>
<TE>   At the Kremlin reception, Putin called for a minute's silence to
commemorate the victims of Thursday's blast, and he said terrorism
was as dangerous, inhuman and bloody as Nazism.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's crime was perpetrated by scumbags who hold nothing
sacred. But we have the right to treat them just like Nazis, whose
sole purpose is to bring death, sow fear and kill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Putin called an emergency meeting of top security ministers and
ordered the head of the Federal Security Service, Nikolai Patrushev,
to oversee the investigation. Security in Moscow was tightened.</TE>
<TE>   Davydova's daughter Anastasia, 21, a student, was watching the
parade from her balcony when the blast occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Broken glass and smoke was all around me pouring into the room.
The balcony shook under me, and I thought for a moment that the house
was hit with a rocket or a bomb and was falling down," she said. "I
am so scared. I think I will have this fear forever now. I want to
run away from here and never come back."</TE>
<TE>   Valery Gergiyev, director of the Mariinsky State Academic Theater
who was in Moscow to perform for war veterans, voiced the feelings of
many Russians, saying nothing could justify terrorist acts such as
this.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no circumstance, in no time, under no regime, under the
banner of no religion can there be a justification for what has been
done," he said. "This is the dark, macabre side of reality that all
of mankind faces today."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei L. Loiko of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Latest Plot Twist for 'Star Wars': Attack of the Cloners</HD>
<DH>Internet: Bootlegged copies hit the Web before movie
debuts, in latest challenge to industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week before the movie's release, unauthorized copies of the next
"Star Wars" episode hit the Internet on Thursday, offering a stark
demonstration of Hollywood's growing problem with piracy in a digital
age.</LD>
<LD>   The early release of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"
is the latest example of how high-quality bootlegs of blockbuster
movies appear online long before they are available in video
stores--in some cases even before they hit the theaters.
"Spider-Man," for instance, appeared on the Internet a day before its
official premiere.</LD>
<LD>   Improved picture quality, combined with the proliferation of
high-speed Internet links and easy-to-use piracy tools, means that
illegally copied movies are rapidly reaching the mass market, not
just a cadre of Net-addicted geeks. Studio executives fear that
bootlegged movies will be as popular and as easy to get as pirated
music is today.</LD>
<TE>   And with the popularity of the "Star Wars" franchise, the pirated
versions of "Attack of the Clones" could attract an unprecedented
pre-release audience. "A million people will have seen 'Star Wars'
before it's opened," predicted Bruce Forest, an independent media
technology consultant and an expert on piracy. "That's never happened
before."</TE>
<TE>   Many industry observers do not expect the bootlegs of "Attack of
the Clones" to cut into box-office receipts, but some worry about the
effect on videotape and DVD revenue, which makes up a significant
portion of a studio's profit.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience in theaters is a thousand times more dynamic than
you would ever get on a computer screen at home, so what people will
be getting is just some sense of the plot line of the film, without
the full impact of the special effects," said Richard Jewell,
associate dean of the School of Cinema-Television at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Where it's a complete disaster is in the home video business,"
said Nancy Newhouse Porter, a Los Angeles entertainment attorney.
"Now they can make copies and ship digital files to places like
China, where we have a really hard time enforcing our copyright
laws."</TE>
<TE>   The pirating of "Attack of the Clones" lends fuel to the film
industry's efforts in Washington to crack down on piracy. While the
studios' trade association steps up its enforcement activities, their
lobbyists are pushing for laws that would require computers and
consumer electronics to be modified to deter unauthorized copying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extremely serious threat," said Jean Murrell Adams, head
of the litigation department at DreamWorks SKG. "I'm not surprised
that it's on the Internet. I talk to pirates because I want to find
out why they're doing this. And what I've been told is that they were
eagerly anticipating who would be first to do this. It's a challenge
for them."</TE>
<TE>   One bootleg version of "Attack of the Clones" appears to have been
made at a private showing of the film, using a tripod-mounted digital
camcorder pointed at the screen. Another evidently employed a more
sophisticated version of the same technique.</TE>
<TE>   Both were distributed first through Internet Relay Chat, an arcane
computer protocol that enables users to copy files at high speed from
other computers on far-flung networks.</TE>
<TE>   The previous "Star Wars" installment also was available online
before its official release in May 1999. But the number of people
downloading movies and music was comparatively small then because
high-speed Internet connections were uncommon and the tools for
sharing files, such as IRC, were difficult for casual users to
master.</TE>
<TE>   Today, tens of millions of people are on file-sharing networks
that make searching for and copying media as easy as finding a Web
site. And it takes only a few hours for a movie to leap from the
confines of IRC to the wide-open world of the file-sharing networks,
such as Morpheus and Kazaa.</TE>
<TE>   Studios have been taking great pains to protect their movies from
pirates. Columbia Pictures, for example, put markers on each print of
"Spider-Man" to track bootleg copies of the movie and placed extra
security guards in theaters to prevent illegal recordings during
screenings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a bootleg of the movie appeared on a single IRC channel the
day before the premiere and then migrated rapidly to hundreds, if not
thousands, of computers on file-sharing networks.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that people have taken a digital camera into a screening
isn't novel in itself," said analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a
technology research and consulting firm. "There's just more hype
around this one because it's 'Attack of the Clones.' There'll be a
huge traffic spike.... Absolutely, because it's a high-profile
movie."</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the "Star Wars" features, though, could make ticket
sales unusually resistant to the effects of piracy, some observers
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this will have any significant financial impact on
the box-office revenues," McNealy said. "It is a big-screen movie.
The people who are going to download it will think it's neat and talk
about it around the water cooler [but still buy tickets]. It just
adds to the hype of the movie because it's that much in demand."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Lucasfilm Ltd., the movie's producer, nor 20th Century Fox
Film Corp., its distributor, commented Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Piracy is a front-burner issue for the top Hollywood studios,
which already have been stung by high-profile piracy abuses. Bootleg
copies of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" appeared in China
within days of the movie's release last year. Rampant piracy of
Hollywood movies continues in China, where the government pledged to
strengthen and enforce its copyright law.</TE>
<TE>   The studios' international trade group, the Motion Picture Assn.,
is fighting piracy by trying to knock the sources of bootlegged
movies off the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Hemanshu Nigam, vice president and director of worldwide Internet
enforcement for the MPA, said his group uses technology that searches
many online sources continuously for about 1,400 Hollywood titles. If
a pirated movie is found, the MPA quickly contacts the source's
Internet service provider and recommends "appropriate action" or, in
the case of repeat offenders, requests a more aggressive effort.</TE>
<TE>   The MPA sent 54,000 letters last year and more than 18,000 in the
first quarter of 2002, Nigam said. And the letters seem to be having
an effect, he said, adding that the number of bootlegs has dropped
dramatically on Internet newsgroups and on some file-sharing
services.</TE>
<TE>   Nigam said that as a rule of thumb, a movie that premieres on a
Friday will appear on the Internet by Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The pirate community is getting better trained in how to get
those movies online," he said, adding: "There's more people that are
capable of putting it up."</TE>
<TE>   High-profile roundups by law enforcement agencies are the most
effective deterrent, Nigam said. After the arrests in December of
individuals charged with bootlegging software, games, music and
movies, he said, the MPA saw a 45% drop in piracy online--although
"it only lasted a few weeks."</TE>

<HD>City to Appeal Judgment in Police-Custody Death</HD>
<DH>Court: Children of a man who fell while handcuffed and
later died share $1 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city will appeal a $1-million judgment in favor of the children
of a disabled Army veteran who died after police handcuffed him on a
South Los Angeles street, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Eady, 52, died three days after he fell, hands cuffed
behind his back, hit his head and suffered brain damage while in
police custody on suspicion of drug possession, on Aug. 26, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   No drugs were found, but tests showed Eady was heavily
intoxicated.</LD>
<TE>   His son, Amar Eady, 28, was awarded $669,100, and his daughter,
Rashidah Thomas-Eady, 24, $350,000, for economic damages and pain and
suffering Wednesday in the Compton courtroom of Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Marlene Kristovich.</TE>
<TE>   The police officer, Jeffrey Wilson, had stopped Eady while he was
standing on the street, handcuffed him when he refused to identify
himself and then may have shoved him in the back, causing the fall,
said Randy McMurray, lawyer for the children.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Richard M. Arias countered that a blood test
showed Eady had a blood alcohol content of 0.448 at the time he fell,
more than five times the drunk-driving limit, which may have been the
cause of the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Arias said Wilson, who is now on an unrelated disability leave
from the LAPD, had reason to believe Eady was involved in a drug
transaction, although no drugs were found.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very difficult case to try," Arias said Thursday. "We
had two innocent plaintiffs, and their father was dead."</TE>
<TE>   Eady was African American, as is Wilson. The jury was made up of
three Latinos, four blacks and five whites.</TE>
<TE>   McMurray and Arias agreed that the testimony of the county
coroner's office, represented by Dr. Louis Pena, was important, but
they interpreted it differently.</TE>
<TE>   McMurray said that Pena testified to finding signs of deep tissue
bleeding in the lower middle of Eady's back, which had to have been
caused by a substantial blow. The back injury occurred about the same
time as his head injury in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Arias said Pena also testified that there was no evidence that the
veteran had been hit by a nightstick or kicked. He also found no
evidence that Eady's hands and wrists, handcuffed behind his back at
the time, were bruised.</TE>
<TE>   McMurray said the city had offered a $100,000 to settle the case,
but McMurray demanded at least $750,000.</TE>

<HD>UCI Infectious-Disease Specialist Wins National Medal of

<DL></DL>
<LD>Francisco J. Ayala, a UC Irvine professor who pioneered the use of
molecular biology to study evolution, was among 15 U.S. scientists
and engineers named Thursday to receive the National Medal of
Science.</LD>
<LD>   Ayala's 40-year effort has led to a better understanding and
treatment of infectious diseases that affect millions and may one day
lead to new drugs and vaccines to combat malaria and Chagas disease,
a chronic wasting ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Ayala, a former Roman Catholic priest, also is a noted expert in
the philosophy of evolution. He testified in a landmark 1982 Arkansas
trial that required that creationism be given equal treatment with
evolution in public schools. A federal court struck down the law.</LD>
<TE>   "In every generation of scientists, there are always a few people
whose work reaches the top," said Susan Bryant, dean of UCI's School
of Biological Sciences. "He's just one of a handful of evolutionary
biologists who, consistently over four decades, has been there with
incisive answers to life's most difficult questions."</TE>
<TE>   Ayala, 68, is among five researchers from the University of
California system to receive this year's award, the nation's highest
scientific accolade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an honor," said Ayala, reached Thursday in Beijing
where he was giving a lecture.</TE>
<TE>   By breaking down the DNA of parasites, Ayala showed how various
strains of Chagas disease are genetically related through cloning. It
affects as many as 18 million people in Central and South America.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala also discovered how three strains of malaria were
transmitted to humans, as well as how the parasites that cause
malignant malaria evolved more than 5,000 years ago from a single
strain in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of my work has consisted of finding the mechanism by which
evolution occurs," Ayala said. "It's like being a detective. It's
very painstaking work."</TE>
<TE>   By breaking down the "molecular clock" of various species,
scientists can track when those species diverged from a common
ancestor, and eventually attack their genetic similarities with
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been able to show evolution at the molecular level," Bryant
said. "He has made evolution more of a precise science and less a
descriptive science."</TE>
<TE>   Ayala, a native of Madrid, came to the United States in 1961. He
received a doctorate in genetics from Columbia University and worked
at universities in New York, Rhode Island and at UC Davis before
coming to UCI in 1987. At UC Irvine he is the Donald Bren Professor
of Biological Sciences, a philosophy professor and director of the
Bren Fellows Program.</TE>
<TE>   Four other UC researchers were awarded the National Medal of
Science: Marvin L. Cohen of UC Berkeley; Charles D. Keeling of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego; Gabor A.
Somorjai of UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;
and Harold E. Varmus of UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, 67, was honored for his work in semiconductor technology.</TE>
<TE>   Keeling, 74, was cited for his pioneering studies on global
climate change.</TE>
<TE>   Somorjai, 67, was honored in the field of chemistry as the leading
authority in the development of surface science.</TE>
<TE>   Varmus, 61, was cited for his work on the genetics of cancer.
Varmus, who is president of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
City, and UCSF Chancellor J. Michael Bishop shared the 1989 Nobel
Prize in medicine for their research.</TE>
<TE>   The recipients will receive their medals from President Bush at a
White House ceremony this month. The National Science Foundation
administers the awards for the White House.</TE>

<HD>Mother Seeks Sole Custody of Brain-Damaged Infant</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lawyer for a woman fighting to take her son off life support
asked a judge Thursday to award the mother sole custody of the
brain-damaged child.</LD>
<LD>   The request by the mother's attorney came at the conclusion of a
hearing at Family Court in Orange. If she is awarded custody, Tamara
Sepulveda has said she will ask doctors to turn off the machines
keeping her son alive.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want my son to go to heaven," Sepulveda said.</LD>
<TE>   Eight-month-old Christopher Ibarra of Cypress has been on
life-support machines for five months, his brain devastated in an
alleged assault by his father. Doctors have said Christopher will
probably remain in a vegetative state for life.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father, Moises Ibarra, has refused from jail to allow
the machines to be turned off. The case poses an interesting ethical
twist because if Christopher dies, Ibarra would face a homicide
charge. With the child alive, he faces no more than nine years in
prison if convicted of child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The father's lawyer argued that the mother should not be allowed
to make medical decisions for the child. He contended that she may
have inflicted the injuries and was a danger to the child.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Richard E. Behn said he will announce his decision Tuesday.
The judge has several options. He could award custody to either
parent or place the child in the court's custody, a move that could
leave the life-support decision in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   The mother's lawyer, Donna Chirco, suggested another option. She
asked Behn to consider appointing a medical guardian to make
decisions for the infant.</TE>

<HD>Big Sur Deal Will Save Nearly 10,000 Acres</HD>
<DH>Coast: Conservation groups arrange $38-million purchase of
wildlife corridor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of conservation groups on Thursday announced they had bought
nearly 10,000 acres in northern Big Sur to preserve the 10-mile
stretch of mountains, old-growth redwood forest, oak woodlands and
coastal terraces.</LD>
<LD>   The Nature Conservancy and the Big Sur Land Trust amassed enough
interim financing to buy the land from cellular telephone pioneer
Craig McCaw for about $38 million. The plan is to sell it to the
state and a regional park district, which will maintain it as
parkland and protected wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to buy this land and manage it for wildlife and for
people," said Mary Nichols, secretary of the California Resources
Agency. "It was the missing link to create a 70-mile-long wildlife
corridor from the Carmel River in the north to San Luis Obispo County
in the south," she added.</LD>
<TE>   The deal was announced Thursday at a news conference on the
northern tip of the property, attended by a group of state officials
including actor Clint Eastwood, a newly appointed state parks
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the northern gateway to Big Sur," said Bill Leahy,
director of the Nature Conservancy's Monterey project. "It's the
first thing you see when you drive down from Carmel. It continues for
another 10 miles."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the 9,898 acres rests high in the Santa Lucia Mountains
that drop into the Pacific Ocean, creating possibly the most dramatic
section of the state's signature coastline.</TE>
<TE>   This jigsaw-puzzle-shaped parcel, assembled one piece at time by
McCaw and named the Palo Corona Ranch, will link 13 wilderness areas
and parks including Point Lobos State Reserve, Garrapata State Park
and the Ventana Wilderness of the Los Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   As a conduit to existing parklands, conservationists said the
former ranch will preserve a valuable wildlife corridor for mountain
lions, bobcats and other animals.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw, who founded McCaw Cellular and is a primary shareholder of
Nextel Communications, has long been involved in conservation
efforts. He has bought timber concessions and retired them to protect
forests from logging. In 1998, he and his ex-wife, Wendy, paid to fly
Keiko the killer whale to Iceland to prepare the star of the movie
"Free Willy" for release into the wild.</TE>
<TE>   When McCaw bought the first piece of the ranch in Big Sur in 1996
from the heirs of Stuyvesant Fish, he promised to safeguard the
stands of old-growth redwoods. The Fish Ranch has its own storied
history. It was the location for the movie adaptation of John
Steinbeck's "Flight," a story about a fugitive in Big Sur.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw subsequently bought seven other parcels to build his ranch,
with an idea that the land would eventually end up in public hands,
said his spokesman, Bob Ratliffe.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is more satisfying than to see majestic and important
pieces of our country like this one preserved for generations," McCaw
said through Ratliffe.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the property had been a working cattle ranch. It includes
a barn and tack shed that will be preserved. "It's in beautiful
shape," said Corey Brown, executive director of the Big Sur Land
Trust. "We find very few properties in this pristine condition."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday pledged $32 million toward the
purchase from Proposition 40, the bond measure approved by voters in
March. The Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District has committed $5
million to help buy the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The two nonprofit conservation groups said they will mount a
fund-raising campaign to make up any financial shortfall and will
establish an endowment to maintain the land.</TE>
<TE>   Money from the state must be approved by the Legislature as part
of the budget, and is subject to state-approved appraisals of the
land. The final disposition of the property has not been decided.
Nichols said the plan is to carve up the ranch and add parts of it to
adjacent state parks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the land is likely to end up in the hands of the Monterey
Peninsula park district.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols said the purchase will ensure that most of the Big Sur
coastline, which attracts millions of tourists a year, will never be
developed.</TE>

<HD>Blake's Daughter Awarded His Baby</HD>
<DH>Court: The child, Rose, was born to the actor and the woman
he is accused of killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's 35-year-old daughter won temporary guardianship
Thursday of her baby half sister Rose, the child born of the actor
and the woman he is accused of murdering.</LD>
<LD>   Delinah Blake pumped her fist and mouthed "Yes!" at the end of a
brief hearing in a downtown Los Angeles courthouse, at which Los
Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner H. Ronald Hauptman
pronounced Rose Lenore Sophia Blake hers, at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   A July 25 hearing is scheduled on Delinah's petition to be
declared permanent guardian of the child, who turns 2 next month.</LD>
<TE>   In a declaration, Delinah Blake stated that she and her father,
star of the the 1970s television series "Baretta," have jointly cared
for Rose since she was about 3 months old. "Over the past year and a
half, I have functioned in all respects as Rose's mother and we have
bonded together as mother and child," wrote Blake, who is working
toward a doctorate in clinical psychology.</TE>
<TE>   The judge denied a request by a lawyer for the family of Robert
Blake's dead wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, to restrict the actor to
hourlong visitations under the supervision of an armed bodyguard if
he is freed. Blake, 68, is being held without bail on charges of
shooting Bakley outside a Studio City restaurant on May 4 last year.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Delinah Blake's lawyer, Terry McNiff,
criticized the Bakley family for trying "to insinuate themselves into
this baby's life." Delinah Blake declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cary W. Goldstein, the Bakleys' attorney, said he made the request
because the family is concerned that Robert Blake, whom he described
as "morose and depressed," will try to harm Rose. "We don't know what
goes on in the mind of a person like that," Goldstein told reporters.
"He very well could take Rosie down with himself."</TE>
<TE>   The family has said that it would not seek custody of Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have alleged that Blake had discussed killing Bakley
in late 1999, when she was pregnant with Rose. Blake's defense
lawyer, Harland Braun, said after the guardianship hearing that his
client "loves the baby and he would die for the baby."</TE>
<TE>   Braun said his client has not seen his daughter since his April 18
arrest. "Rosie's old enough not to want to see her father behind
glass," Braun said. "I think it'd be too shocking for her."</TE>

<LD>Police on Thursday released a composite drawing of a man whose
charred remains were found Sept. 29 in a vacant home destroyed by
arson.</LD>
<LD>   After firefighters put out the blaze at 329 E. Louise St., they
found the body of a man believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s,
said Long Beach Police Officer Jana Blair.</LD>
<LD>   "The coroner has determined that the victim suffered blunt force
trauma to his head prior to the residence being set on fire," Blair
said. It's possible the man was killed elsewhere and his body was
dumped at the house, she said.</LD>

<LD>Former President Clinton joined a host of religious luminaries,
elected officials and celebrities Thursday night in a tribute to
Bishop Hamel Hartford Brookins, the son of Mississippi sharecroppers
who rose to become a Los Angeles and international champion of black
political empowerment.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton praised Brookins, 76, for his civil rights legacy and
reminisced about the days when the clergyman ministered in a country
church in Arkansas when Clinton was governor.</LD>
<LD>   "I still can't quite get used to the fact that you're wearing
purple," he said at the Beverly Hilton event, referring to Brookins'
status as a bishop. "And I got to be president," he added.</LD>
<TE>   "I learned a lot by your side, had a lot of good times. But my
heart will always be with you, because in sunshine and in rain, you
were always with me," the former president said. "You helped me make
the country a more free, better and united place."</TE>
<TE>   Brookins, a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal church for
30 years, is best known here as the former leader of First AME
Church, which he served 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   His activism began in the 1950s when, as a clergyman in Topeka,
Kan., he helped implement a desegregation plan ordered by the U.S.
Supreme Court in the groundbreaking Brown vs. Board of Education
case. In 1965 he worked to quell the Watts riots. He was an architect
of Tom Bradley's campaigns for mayor and, while working in Africa,
was ousted from Rhodesia because of his work on behalf of the
Zimbabwe liberation movement. In 1981 Zimbabwe invited him back for
its first presidential inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   A founding member of Jesse Jackson's economic activist
organization, Operation PUSH, Brookins also worked in Jackson's
presidential campaigns. He developed a friendship with Clinton while
assigned to his denomination's Oklahoma-Arkansas district in the
'80s, when Clinton was governor.</TE>
<TE>   Brookins is credited with laying the foundation for First AME's
political power and community influence.</TE>

<HD>Priest, 80, Accused of Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jesuit is charged in a case involving a mentally
retarded kitchen worker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors in Santa Clara County on Thursday charged an 80-year-old
Jesuit priest with sexually abusing a mentally retarded man.</LD>
<LD>   Father Edward Thomas Burke was arrested and booked on $50,000
bail. He had been under investigation by the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department for allegedly abusing the 51-year-old kitchen
worker during the 1990s while both lived at Sacred Heart Jesuit
Center in Los Gatos, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Burke is the second elderly Jesuit at Sacred Heart to be charged
with a felony sex crime. Brother Charles Leonard Connor, also 80,
served six months of home detention last year after being convicted
of committing a lewd act on a disabled adult.</LD>
<TE>   Burke and Connor are among four Jesuits named in a civil lawsuit
alleging that between 1996 and 2000, they repeatedly sodomized and
molested two mentally retarded men at Sacred Heart, a retreat in the
foothills overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the two victims and the California Province of the
Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, are continuing to
negotiate a financial settlement. A hearing is scheduled for May 23
to set a trial date for the civil lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Burke's attorney said the suspect was aware that authorities were
contemplating filing a criminal complaint. Burke faces a maximum of
three years in prison if convicted of the felony charge of lewd
conduct against a dependent adult.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hendrickson said he was hopeful that prosecutors would
take into consideration Burke's age and health. "He is in his 80s. He
has a pacemaker. I am concerned about his health," Hendrickson said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's sister, Debra Sullivan, said Thursday she was
relieved that authorities had decided to file a criminal complaint
against Burke.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I've been wanting for quite some time," said
Sullivan, who learned of the alleged abuse more than a year ago. "I'm
glad it's done."</TE>
<TE>   The claims involving Burke came to the attention of law
enforcement on March 24, when a story in The Times disclosed the
allegations against the four Jesuits in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The story also reported that three other Jesuits were registered
sex offenders in Northern California, after convictions in separate
cases involving minors. Documents showed that some Jesuit leaders
declined to notify authorities when they learned of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   According to a police report filed with the complaint against
Burke, the abuses took place in the victim's second-story room.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen worker was interviewed twice by Sgt. Dianne L.
Camarda, a detective with the Santa Clara County sheriff's sex crimes
unit.</TE>
<TE>   The man "said he didn't think Burke would keep doing the bad
things to him, and he only invited him into the room because he
wanted someone to watch train tapes with him," Camarda wrote in her
report. "[He] said Burke told him not to tell anybody so he
didn't.... [He] said he was just too nervous or scared to say
anything to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Jesuit superiors quickly removed Burke from Sacred Heart in April
2000 after he admitted he had engaged in sexual misconduct with the
retarded man, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Burke was reassigned to the Jesuit residence on the campus of
Bellarmine College Preparatory, a prestigious all-boys high school in
San Jose. He now lives at a nursing home in San Jose.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Chief Seeks LAPD Job</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Art Lopez has 27 years of experience on
the Los Angeles police force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vowing to lead the battered Los Angeles police back to national
prominence, Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez on Thursday announced his
candidacy for the department's top job.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, 52, spent 27 years with the LAPD, leaving four years ago as
a deputy chief. If selected by the Los Angeles Police Commission and
Mayor James K. Hahn, he would be the city's first Latino chief,
according to the Los Angeles Police Historical Society.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Lopez said he would attempt to boost plummeting
morale in a department still stained by the Rampart corruption
scandal. He also promised to breathe life into the department's
efforts to bring officers closer to the neighborhoods they serve.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to be part of improving the quality of life in my
community,'' said Lopez, who still maintains a home in the San
Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch neighborhood. "I can help drive that
through community policing.''</TE>
<TE>   Directing Oxnard's 325-member force for the last four years, Lopez
has instituted the kind of community policing programs that former
LAPD Chief Bernard Parks was severely criticized for dismantling.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lopez's tenure in Oxnard has had its share of troubles,
with the city experiencing a string of deadly police shootings and
officers being accused of racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, five people--three of them mentally ill--were fatally
shot by Oxnard officers. Relatives of one, Robert Lee Jones, have
sued the department, contending that the killing was unjustified and
prompted by racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County district attorney's office concluded that
officers acted properly in four of the deaths. A report on the Jones
shooting is to be issued this month.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez acknowledged that the shootings may fuel opposition to his
appointment but said his response to them strengthened the Oxnard
department.</TE>
<TE>   "We've changed our policies on dealing with the mentally ill,'' he
said. "We've implemented a crisis intervention team and changed our
method of responding to calls by having less lethal capabilities.''</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard officers have been better trained in confronting
emotionally distraught suspects and in using nonlethal weapons such
as Tasers and beanbag guns. The instruction has paid off, defusing
volatile situations in which officers otherwise might have used their
guns, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Lopez said, charges of profiling against his department
prompted him to start educational programs involving high school
students, religious leaders and community groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of burying the criticism, we built upon it,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some local activists agree.</TE>
<TE>   "He's responded whenever we've come forward with complaints,''
said Hank Lacayo, president of El Concilio del Condado de Ventura,
the county's biggest Latino advocacy group. "I see a difference in
the demeanor of the Oxnard P.D. There are more attempts to reach out.
They're recognizing you can't just apply the law by billy club and
gun.''</TE>
<TE>   Lopez says he would be "a chief for everyone,'' but his Latino
roots could be a plus for Hahn, said L.A.-based political consultant
Joe Cerrell.</TE>
<TE>   Observing that a number of contenders are highly qualified,
Cerrell said appointing a Latino chief would be "a smart move'' for
Hahn. The mayor was criticized by black leaders for dumping Parks,
one of the city's most visible African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "From a strictly political view, it would also be smart to appoint
a woman or an African American,'' Cerrell said. "They just have to
find the best person.''</TE>
<TE>   If the LAPD's top job eludes him, Lopez said, he will stay on in
Oxnard, which seemed to suit city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly has a home here,'' said Manuel Lopez, Oxnard's
mayor. "He's been very, very effective. He's fully committed to
community-based policing and it has worked well here.''</TE>
<TE>   Starting as an LAPD patrol officer in 1971, Art Lopez eventually
supervised a staff of more than 2,300 as deputy chief in charge of
operations at the department's central bureau. He was rebuffed twice
in his bid for the chief's post, choosing the top position in Oxnard
when passed over in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have expressed interest in the LAPD chief's job include
Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and Margaret York, Cmdr. Jim McDonnell,
and Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker. The Los Angeles Police
Commission plans to conduct a nationwide search for candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The field will be narrowed to three by the commission. Hahn will
nominate one of the three, who will require confirmation by the City
Council.</TE>

<HD>2 Cities Can't Get the Hang of Chimp's Situation</HD>
<DH>Animals: Moe, a skilled performer, was all set to move when
it became clear one municipality didn't know what the other was
doing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it the tale of two cities and one chimp.</LD>
<LD>   In West Covina and Baldwin Park on Thursday, city councils held
emergency meetings to decide what to do about Moe, a 36-year-old
chimpanzee exiled from one city and apparently headed for the other.</LD>
<LD>   Moe, who was once named an honorary citizen of West Covina, has
been living at the Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest
since late 1999, when he was removed from his home for biting a
woman's finger and, a year earlier, seriously injuring the hand of a
police officer who had chased Moe when he escaped.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since, Moe's fate has been a contentious issue in West
Covina, even propelling Moe's owner, St. James Davis, into a failed
bid for political office.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his wife, Ladonna, sued the city, and in a settlement
finally announced this week, the couple agreed to move Moe to an
industrial part of Baldwin Park, across from a county animal shelter.
West Covina would buy the site and lease it to them for $1, under the
settlement terms.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a hitch: Apparently no one told Baldwin Park
officials about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no warning from our city attorney, and none of our staff
knew," said Baldwin Park City Councilwoman Linda Gair. "We were hit
upside the head with it. Needless to say, we are not happy campers."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin Park's attorney is Arnold Glasman. He also is West
Covina's city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Glasman called a meeting of the Baldwin Park City Council on
Thursday night to explain his actions regarding Moe on behalf of West
Covina.</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier, however, the West Covina City Council had met in
emergency session and decided to take back its offer to the Davises,
with a letter of apology to its neighbor. West Covina's mayor, city
manager and a city council member delivered the letter personally.</TE>
<TE>   The Davises, who relied on Moe's television and film work as a
substantial part of their income, said the city overreacted three
years ago when officials removed him from their home the day after he
bit a visitor's finger.</TE>
<TE>   They hired attorney Gloria Allred and collected nearly 60,000
signatures on a petition demanding Moe's return.</TE>
<TE>   "They took away the breadwinner of my family," St. James Davis, a
former NASCAR driver, said Thursday. "He got taken away for something
he didn't even do. Sure, he bit a police officer a long time ago, but
... the person who claims she lost her finger has all of her
fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement in the Davises' 3-year-old civil rights
lawsuit, West Covina agreed to pay them $100,000. Davis said that the
city also agreed to buy an air-conditioned building, in the 4200
block of North Elton Street, for Moe. That sounded like the perfect
solution to Davis. He intended to build a habitat, a place that
others could visit and learn about the chimp whom Davis rescued in
Tanzania in the late 1960s after Moe's mother was killed by poachers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to put in a waterfall, a trampoline and a TV," he said.
"He has no TV where he is at, he can't wear his clothes where he is
at, and he can't make any money where he is at."</TE>
<TE>   According to Susan Clawson, one of the partners in the property,
no one from the city of West Covina has contacted the owners of the
building. But, she said, "It would be perfect for Moe."</TE>
<TE>   The Davises' attorney, Heber S. Meeks, said he had thought that
Baldwin Park officials were aware of the pending settlement, which
came two days before a trial was to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "We surprised people here," he said. "I certainly didn't intend
that." It appears, he said, "we have to go elsewhere to find a
friendlier place."</TE>
<TE>   West Covina City Manager Andrew Pasmant said the city still
intends to live up to the terms of the settlement, with this
exception: The Davises must find suitable housing for Moe, and West
Covina will pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who visits Moe at least once a week at the Wildlife
Waystation, said he's concerned that the chimpanzee he raised, who
can write his own name and is potty-trained, is now living in a cage.</TE>
<TE>   "Moe is used to getting hugged and kissed all day ... but now all
of his schooling and education has stopped. They only let us stay 10
or 15 minutes at most."</TE>
<TE>   In the Baldwin Park council meeting Thursday, Davis wore a blue
ribbon Moe had received after riding in the 1972 Baldwin Park
anniversary parade. Davis had hoped the evening would turn out
differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of thought maybe it was a kind of homecoming. He'd be an
asset to any community."</TE>

<HD>Car Jumps Curb, Kills 3-Year-Old</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A car jumped a curb at a busy intersection in downtown Santa Ana on
Thursday morning, killing a 3-year-old girl and seriously injuring
her 11-month-old brother, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred in a busy area of Santa Ana that has been
plagued with pedestrian fatalities in the past few years.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the driver of a Mercedes ran a red light at North
Main Street and Santa Ana Boulevard, hitting another car before
swerving onto a sidewalk, where a family was waiting to cross the
street. Police are investigating but haven't filed any charges.</LD>
<TE>   "He hit my girl," said Maria Martinez, who had watched helplessly
as her children were struck by the car. "He took my girl."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after her children had been taken away in separate
ambulances, the crying mother picked up her baby's blanket and
teddy-bear backpack from the mangled stroller on the sidewalk.The
daughter, identified as Jennifer Martinez, died instantly. Her
brother, Brando, was rushed to UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange and
was listed in stable condition, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar
De La Riva.</TE>
<TE>   The drivers of the two cars in the accident also were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana--with a large immigrant population, many of whom walk
instead of drive--has one of the highest pedestrian accident rates in
the state. The city has adopted a variety of programs in recent years
to reduce accidents, from a crackdown on jaywalkers to installing
traffic medians and crosswalks. There have been three fatal accidents
involving pedestrians so far this year, compared with two for the
same period in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, UC Irvine studies found that Santa Ana had the
highest pedestrian fatality rate in California. In 2000, the city
recorded six fatalities and about 100 pedestrian injuries. "Any time
you have an area where a large percentage of the people walk from one
place to the other, you'll find more accidents involving
pedestrians," De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   While it is common for pedestrians to be injured jaywalking or
after ignoring crossing signals, this accident differed in that the
victims were waiting on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "We have witnesses that indicate that [the Mercedes driver] may
have ran the light," De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the intersection is not prone to accidents. But the
Rev. Lance E.A. Allen, who heard the crash from his office at the
nearby Presbyterian church, said accidents occur regularly at the
crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Nora Griego, who was driving by the intersection when the accident
occurred, accompanied the distraught mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so fast," Martinez said dazedly. They were joined by
Martinez's cousin, who held her and tried to console her before
taking her to the hospitals to identify her dead daughter and visit
her injured son.</TE>
<TE>   "He ... took my daughter," Martinez said, sobbing. "I'm going to
kill myself."</TE>
<TE>   "No, no!" Griego said. "Your baby needs you."</TE>

<HD>6 Local Deaths Lead to Plasma Warning</HD>
<DH>Health: The liver transplant patients had received
transfusions of a new blood product.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deaths of six liver transplant patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, all associated with transfusions of a highly touted new form
of blood plasma, have led to a warning against use of the product in
such surgeries or when patients have severe liver disease.</LD>
<LD>   Six of 31 or 32 liver transplant patients at Cedars-Sinai died
after receiving the new form of plasma between April and December
1999. But the company that manufactures the product did not issue the
"black box" warning--the most severe kind--to doctors and health-care
providers until two months ago, more than three years after the Los
Angeles deaths.</LD>
<LD>   The Massachusetts-based manufacturer, V.I. Technologies Inc., or
Vitex, had first advised doctors in October 2000 of a possible
connection between the cluster of deaths and the form of plasma
called Plas+SD or SD Plasma, which was distributed by the American
Red Cross.</LD>
<TE>   The "important prescribing information alert" was distributed
through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's national
safety-reporting clearinghouse, MedWatch, almost a year after federal
officials began investigating the Cedars-Sinai deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai officials in 1999 had alerted both the FDA and the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the deaths, which
involved unusual clotting or excessive bleeding. They also suspended
use of the plasma.</TE>
<TE>   But the hospital did not tell the families of patients about the
possible problems with the plasma until this week, when the
Cedars-Sinai deaths were reported in Newsday, a Cedars-Sinai
spokeswoman acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Newsday based its findings primarily on FDA records. The newspaper
reported that the patients ranged from a 64-year-old woman to a
pregnant 17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   The Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman, Grace Cheng, noted that a CDC report
in April 2001 on the deaths found "no direct cause and effect"
relationship between the plasma and the deaths, but concluded that
there may have been a correlation.</TE>
<TE>   "We always want to have as much information, and as much
definitive information, as we can," Cheng said.</TE>
<TE>   When the CDC found that it could not demonstrate a direct link
between the plasma and the deaths, "that brings up the question,
then: Given that these cases were so complex and so high-risk, was
there something to say at that point?"</TE>
<TE>   The hospital decided to tell the families after the Newsday
articles were published because "we don't want there to be any
misunderstanding," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's March warning came after four more deaths associated
with the plasma were reported to MedWatch. Those deaths occurred
between August 2000 and March 2001, according to FDA officials.</TE>
<TE>   The four additional deaths, unlike those in Los Angeles, were not
clustered in a single location, said federal officials, who would not
specify where they occurred. Those deaths included both transplant
recipients and patients with severe liver disease who did not undergo
transplants.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its recommendations against using the plasma in the
cases of patients with liver disease, the March warning advised that
any patient being given large amounts of SD Plasma should be
monitored closely for excessive bleeding and complications</TE>
<TE>   The six deaths among Cedars-Sinai liver transplant patients amount
to a mortality rate of about 20% (Cedars-Sinai says there were 31
patients altogether; the FDA says there were 32). That rate is
somewhat higher than usual for liver transplants.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cheng said the six who died were "very, very seriously
ill patients with a lot of complications." Given that, she said, what
was unusual was not the number who died, but the way they died, with
far more clotting problems than usual.</TE>
<TE>   No unusual deaths were noted among more than 100 other, non-liver
patients who received the plasma at Cedars-Sinai, Cheng said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the sixth death, hospital officials decided that "it
would be prudent to discontinue the use of SD Plasma for all patients
at the Medical Center," according to a report the hospital submitted
to the FDA, which was obtained by Newsday</TE>
<TE>   "They started using [SD Plasma] at a particular time, they noticed
deaths were occurring, they stopped using it and the deaths stopped,"
said Dr. Mark Weinstein, FDA's director of the Division of
Hematology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</TE>
<TE>   SD Plasma, developed as a way to enhance the safety of blood
plasma transfusions, combines donated plasma from as many as 2,500
people and then scrubs it of many--but not all--viruses by using a
detergent. SD stands for solvent detergent.</TE>
<TE>   The product was touted by the American Red Cross in a 1999 news
release as the newest way to "help safeguard the blood supply." The
reason for that, the organization said, is that it destroys a wide
range of viruses with fatty coatings, including HIV and hepatitis B
and C.</TE>
<TE>   The organization at that time said that it was accelerating plans
to distribute the product to 2,000 hospitals and would offer
"favorable pricing initiatives" to make it available to more
patients.</TE>
<TE>   At $125 a unit, it is more than twice as costly as the
alternative, fresh frozen plasma, said Dr. Gary Zeger, medical
director of the USC Blood Center. He said the American Red Cross
invested heavily in the product and "very, very aggressively"
promoted its use.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of research and development and resources went into this
product, and I think they depended on [its] success," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the American Red Cross said late Thursday that
no one was available to comment about the nonprofit organization's
distribution of the product.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for V.I. Technologies declined comment, saying that
the company had divested the unit that made the plasma and no longer
manufactured it.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Moose, president and CEO of the company that bought the unit,
Precision Pharma of Melville, N.Y., said his company had never made
the plasma. He said manufacturing was discontinued before V.I.
Technologies divested the unit last August.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the deaths at Cedars-Sinai, federal officials said,
only one other hospital was known to have used SD Plasma in liver
transplant surgeries. FDA officials would not name that hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospitals have used the plasma and continue to do so, for
other surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials Thursday defended the length of time it took
from the first reports of deaths and the decision to warn doctors and
health-care providers about a possible link between severe reactions
and use of SD Plasma.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein, one of the leaders of the FDA's investigation, said
Thursday that the Cedars-Sinai deaths immediately raised
investigators' concerns because of their "very unusual" nature.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, attempts to find a direct link between the product's
use and the deaths proved difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We conducted an epidemiological survey, and asked: Is this
occurring in only one hospital? Is it lot-specific? Is it a result of
using many lots? Was there something unusual about how it was
manufactured or how it was being used?" Weinstein said. "And this is
where it really gets very complicated: We don't have a true absolute
cause and effect relationship between use of this product and the
particular event."</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said that although they found no direct link between
the deaths and SD Plasma, there were "working theories" about why
small clots formed in the patients who died, cutting off their blood
vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said SD Plasma contains lower levels of certain proteins
that could have helped prevent clotting than fresh frozen plasma.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, higher volumes of the product are needed in liver
transplant cases than in most procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Red Cross touted the safety of the new plasma product
and many European countries have used it for years, concerns about
pooling plasma donations have arisen among some health-care
professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Although the detergent kills a broad array of viruses, there are
some that survive.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said that those risks are "a major concern" because the
new product pools plasma from so many donors. He noted that the
product remains licensed for use.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a matter of physicians' having to weigh the pluses and
minuses," he said.</TE>

<HD>Watch Out for Sneak Play in Massive Redevelopment Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me begin with the football stadium, which keeps popping up in
connection with a $2.4-billion makeover for downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Not even with a gun to our heads should we fork over one dime of
public money to plan, clear the way for or build a football stadium
in downtown Los Angeles, just so a coterie of billionaires can have
an NFL franchise to play with.</LD>
<LD>   We shouldn't put up one box of nails or a single bag of cement.
Even if you happen to believe for some reason that L.A. needs an NFL
team, building a stadium near Staples Center makes no sense,
particularly as part of a downtown revitalization effort.</LD>
<TE>   A gargantuan concrete bowl would gobble up several dozen acres and
sit vacant roughly 340 days out of the year.</TE>
<TE>   No one is going to open a restaurant across the street from this
moon crater to cash in on eight Sundays worth of business.</TE>
<TE>   I'm well aware the L.A. City Council claims that a football
stadium ain't part of the plan it breathlessly rubber-stamped
Wednesday by a vote of 12 to 3. But the same council couldn't bring
itself to approve a ban on the use of redevelopment money for a
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   So if you smell something, you're not alone. Some council members
admitted that the new redevelopment plan could conceivably facilitate
a stadium project.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the sad sack San Diego Chargers moved their training
facility to a Carson site owned by Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, the guy behind Staples Center, Anschutz and his pals were
in New York to chat up a local franchise with NFL bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Connect the dots, comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz's crew has said it would build the stadium with private
money, but stadiums seldom get built without taxpayers getting their
pockets picked.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally the public pays for about one-third of the cost, or
around $75 million, in land acquisition and infrastructure," says
Neil deMause, author of a book called "Field of Schemes, How the
Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money Into Private Profit."</TE>
<TE>   As sports complexes go, a football stadium is the worst kind of
welfare for billionaires, deMause says, because there simply aren't
enough games to promise a return on the investment. A baseball
stadium makes more sense, but even then, do we want to help pay for a
rich man's playpen?</TE>
<TE>   So you might have a terrific helmet-smashing ballgame out there
some day, with $10-million quarterbacks and slinky cheerleaders and
$7.50 beers and billionaire owners grinning like thieves over the TV
deals alone. But in every neighborhood of the city, Johnny's school
might be short on books while class size balloons to 50 because
there's a drain on public funds.</TE>
<TE>   So if these guys want a stadium, the first thing to do is put it
on the outskirts of downtown or somewhere else altogether. And if the
owners don't think it makes financial sense to pay for it themselves,
that should tell you everything you need to know.</TE>
<TE>   Now let me get to the rest of the redevelopment plan.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I'd love to see a vital, vibrant downtown, and with such a
huge stock of spectacular vacant buildings, the potential
transformation is greater in L.A. than in any other city I know of.</TE>
<TE>   But it's precisely because there's so much at stake that I have a
problem with what looks like a rush job on a mammoth plan, with
largely unspecific goals other than to create thousands of
residential units, jobs and social services.</TE>
<TE>   Special redevelopment districts are risky propositions, says UCLA
researcher David Runsten, who was appalled by the mixed results and
lack of accountability in the last major downtown revitalization
project.</TE>
<TE>   These things tend to be planned by a tiny group of public
officials, Runsten said, with little critical analysis of whether
planners are pitching "what the community wants, or what's being
proposed to them by developers."</TE>
<TE>   Look, maybe this plan is a work of genius. But how would we know?</TE>
<TE>   Why did the City Council order the plan to be done in half the
typical 18 months, particularly when there were so many questions
about who benefited from the last major so-called redevelopment
downtown?</TE>
<TE>   What are the guarantees? What are the risks to citywide services
if tax dollars ordinarily shared by everyone are plowed back into the
downtown project?</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is the lack of public participation in the process,"
says Councilman Jack Weiss, one of the three who voted no. "The
Community Redevelopment Agency says there was substantial opportunity
for public comment, and I believe them. But there's an extra level of
analysis I would have benefited from."</TE>
<TE>   Absent that, Weiss was left with nothing but questions. And we
know he couldn't have gotten much help from Mayor Slim Jim Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still studying it," Hahn told the Daily News in a comment
that included half-hearted support of downtown redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   Still studying it?</TE>
<TE>   What else is on his docket, fine-tuning that bold idea for more
left-turn lanes?</TE>
<TE>   This is the biggest downtown redevelopment plan in history, it's
already out the door and the mayor is still studying it?</TE>
<TE>   What he's really doing, in another chapter of profiles in courage,
is refusing to take a leadership role downtown because he fears it'll
cost him in the secession-minded Valley.</TE>
<TE>   So let me fill in for him.</TE>
<TE>   If the redevelopment goal of creating 13,000 new residential units
works out, and that's a huge if, it would be a good start.</TE>
<TE>   You can't remake downtown Los Angeles or any other big-city
downtown without tens of thousands of people living there.</TE>
<TE>   If all you've got is a bunch of sports hooligans gassing in to
spend three hours at Staples Center and then having dinner at Hooters
in the planned sports-entertainment complex, you don't have a real
city.</TE>
<TE>   You've got another Universal CityWalk, and don't get me started on
that.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Give OK for Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Job action would affect 8,000 workers at the
University of California's six hospitals. Contract negotiations
resume next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at the University of California's six hospitals
have voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against the
prestigious medical system if contract negotiations don't produce a
breakthrough soon, officials at the California Nurses Assn. said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   About 95% of voting nurses supported a strike in balloting Tuesday
and Wednesday, the union said. It refused to say, though, how many of
the system's nearly 8,000 nurses voted.</LD>
<LD>   Union officials have said that they will give 10 days notice
before walking off the job. Such notice had not been given Thursday
and probably will not be for several days, union officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "I have never seen this level of frustration," said Rose Ann
DeMoro, the union's executive director. "The nurses are angry, and
they're angry because they're not being listened to."</TE>
<TE>   If the nurses strike, it would be the largest job action in years
for the nurses union, which represents 44,000 workers statewide. The
union's last major job action came in 1997 and 1998, when it launched
six short strikes against Kaiser facilities in Northern California.
The union has never gone on strike against UC.</TE>
<TE>   UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said the strike authorization vote is
the union's attempt to "exert maximum influence over negotiations,"
which are set to resume Monday. "People need to keep their heads
about them. Until they give us some clear indication that they are
heading for a strike, we're going to focus on bargaining."</TE>
<TE>   If a strike notice is given, Schwartz said, the hospital system
may begin closing certain services, such as trauma care, to prepare
for a reduction in staff.</TE>
<TE>   Such actions "could seriously impact health care throughout the
state," he added, because UC hospitals play a key role in trauma and
specialty care.</TE>
<TE>   The system's hospitals are located in Westwood, Santa Monica,
Irvine, San Diego, San Francisco and Davis. The union also represents
about 100 student health center nurses on four UC campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators remain divided on several key issues as they try to
replace a contract that expired April 30.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the nurses union wants UC to abandon its merit pay
plan and adopt a system of raises based solely upon years of service.
Union officials argue that the plan is subjective and that some newly
hired nurses are unfairly earning more than veterans.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses also want the hospital to prohibit mandatory overtime
and immediately implement minimum ratios of nurses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials say the merit system appropriately rewards
high-quality care. In its latest offer, UC proposed average pay
increases of 13.5% over two years, mostly through merit raises. The
only ones excluded would be those with unsatisfactory performance
ratings, which has been about 1% of nurses, Schwartz said</TE>
<TE>   The union disputes those figures.</TE>
<TE>   The labor environment is far different today than it was in the
early and mid-1990s, when nursing unions had little clout and were
often forced to accept contracts they didn't like. In 1994, for
instance, the UC system imposed a contract on the nurses eliminating
the automatic system of raises based upon seniority.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a prolonged and critical nursing shortage, unions have
scored key organizing and contracting victories at hospitals. In 2001
alone, the California Nurses Assn. won 11 organizing elections for
4,500 registered nurses. The union has doubled its membership in five
years.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is much more total despair and frustration"
among nurses, said author Suzanne Gordon, who wrote a book about the
importance of bedside nursing. "Thanks to efforts by unions like the
CNA, the public is increasingly understanding that nurses deserve
better and that there's a connection between how the nurses are
treated and how they'll be cared for."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital industry officials say the union has become far more
aggressive of late.</TE>
<TE>   "The nursing shortage has definitely added fuel to this whole
fire," said Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California Healthcare
Assn. "They probably have gained some level of power because of it."</TE>
<TE>   But Emerson said a strike won't resolve the underlying problems
with nurse recruitment or retention.</TE>
<TE>   "Striking isn't going to make more nurses magically appear," she
said. "They keep talking about how they're really concerned about
patient care and quality of care, but their actions aren't
demonstrating that. This is purely labor union tactics that very well
may put patient care at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials say they will soon meet with health officials in
all of the affected counties to help develop contingency plans for
emergency and trauma services. And nurses will be authorized to cross
picket lines if a patient is experiencing a life-or-death emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz questioned whether the union's strike authorization vote
represents the views of all UC nurses. Some 40% to 50% of nurses
don't pay union dues and thus can't vote, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As with much else in this dispute, the union disagrees with UC's
data.</TE>
<TE>   "If the nurses weren't serious about this, we wouldn't be taking
this course of action," said Joe Lindsay, the union's chief
negotiator. "The numbers will speak if necessary when there's a
strike."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police shot and wounded a man after a pursuit Thursday night in South
Los Angeles after he tried to draw a weapon, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man was shot near 57th Street and Wilton Place
after a car chase that ended when the driver allegedly crashed the
vehicle on the front lawn of a home, said Los Angeles Police Capt.
Ken Hillman.</LD>
<LD>   As the man climbed out of the car, he went for a handgun in his
waistband, police said. They said a weapon was recovered at the
scene.</LD>
<TE>   Police did not say why they tried to pull the man over just before
7:30 p.m. But when the man sped off, police chased him. The suspect's
car stopped at one point and a passenger got out and fled on foot,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver started to get out of the car as well, but then got
back in and drove off again, police said. The passenger was arrested
a short time later.</TE>

<LD>Did you see where one of the companies being sued by our former
Raiders is Arthur Andersen? Yes, the football team that cultivates an
outlaw image going up against the indictees from the accounting
world. A dream match for fans of shady operators! Sort of hard to
figure out whom to root for, though.</LD>
<LD>   Correcting Caltrans: In Thursday's paper, The Times' Hugo Martin
wrote about an artist who added directions to a downtown freeway sign
he found confusing.</LD>
<LD>   It got me to thinking about how many times readers have alerted
Caltrans about its boo-boos via this column. Here are some miscues
that appeared in this space and were later corrected by the agency
(see photos):</LD>
<TE>   * A dueling notice about carpool lanes (snapped by Jamie Frankel).</TE>
<TE>   * An inadvertent merger of Bakersfield and Sacramento (Jack
Wormsley).</TE>
<TE>   * And a Port of L.A. sign that was initially sunk out of view from
freeway drivers (Steve Morris of Torrance).</TE>
<TE>   My favorite is still in place down in San Diego, though: the
warning to oceangoing vessels cruising down I-5 (Kevin Buck).</TE>
<TE>   Effects of a sugar high? Columnist Dan Bernstein of the Riverside
Press-Enterprise spotted this item in the log of a local medical
center: "Fire hydrant was knocked clean off by police officer in
unmarked cop car. Appears he lost his grip on milkshake. Lost control
and hit hydrant." Bernstein's reaction: "Lessons learned: Stick to
doughnuts."</TE>
<TE>   Just a couple of sentimental slobs: Jeff Bliss passed along an
article from the Malibu Times that revealed that Pamela Anderson and
her fiance, Kid Rock, recently threw an engagement party at which
guests were "asked to bring an adult toy as an offering." The Malibu
paper said "their bedroom booty apparently included leather bras,
silver cuffs, silk sheets" ... Well, you get the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Special deliveries: In a piece on offbeat Mother's Day gifts, KNX
news radio mentioned the book "I'll Never Have Sex With You Again:
Tales from the Delivery Room." Authors Irene Zutell and Larry
Bleidner feature such characters as:</TE>

Service wrote a piece about real-life spiders, pointing out that
there are just two known species harmful to humans in Southern
California: the black widow and the violin spider. The black widow
lives in secluded areas, a curator at the county Natural History
Museum said, while the violin spider has been found only in small
areas of Pasadena. I guess violin spiders want to take advantage of
Pasadena's cultural opportunities.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Spending Parks Funds Where Least Needed</HD>
<DH>Report: Those areas most in need of open space get smallest
slice of Prop. K money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too much of the more than $25million that Los Angeles spends every
year to increase and enhance parks goes to areas that need it least,
according to a study released Thursday by researchers at USC.</LD>
<LD>   The report, "Parks and Park Funding in Los Angeles," tracked
spending patterns for money earmarked to address the "inadequacies
and decay of the city's youth infrastructure."</LD>
<LD>   Generated by Proposition K, a 1996 bond measure, the money is
often awarded to areas that already enjoy the greatest access to
parks, perpetuating some of the very inequalities it is supposed to
remedy, the report found.</LD>
<TE>   "The disparities we found were dramatic," said Jennifer Wolch, a
professor of geography at USC and author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   Census tracts where less than a fifth of the population was
younger than 18 received twice as many Prop. K dollars on a per-youth
basis as those areas where a third to half of the population was
under 18, according to the report, which examined spending from 1998
through 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is exacerbated by differences rooted in history,
according to the report. The city's 1904 zoning code protected the
mostly Anglo Westside from industrial uses and high-density housing
that were allowed in the city's minority-dominated eastern and
southern areas.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern has persisted, Wolch said, so that from Santa Monica
to Griffith Park, white-dominated areas tend to be clustered around
large open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "In areas that are more than 75% white, there are about 17 acres
of parkland for every 1,000 residents," Wolch said. "In areas that
are more than 75% black, that number is about 1.6 acres and, for
Latinos, it's less than one acre."</TE>
<TE>   Wolch said the report demonstrates that more money should be spent
creating parkland in those areas with less open space and fewer
parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look at what kind of small spaces can be rescued from
concrete and re-greened," she said, by narrowing streets and creating
"pocket parks" on vacant parcels of land and in place of paved-over
alleys.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Eric Garcetti of the 13th District said the report
underscores the need for an urban land trust, an idea being studied
by a committee he oversees.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to democratize the park process," he said. "If we could
build between five and 10 small parks a year, we'd create 50 to 100
new parks by the time some of us newer [City Council] members leave
office."</TE>

<HD>Slain Journalist's Father Gives Prize to Foundation</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The father of slain journalist Daniel Pearl donated a prize awarded
to him Thursday by the London School of Economics to a foundation
established in memory of his son.</LD>
<LD>   Judea Pearl of Encino received 10,000 pounds--about $15,000--with
the Lakatos Award, a prize given for outstanding work in the
philosophy of science.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA, was honored for
his book "Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference," an analysis of
statistics, artificial intelligence and probability theory.</LD>
<TE>   His 38-year-old son disappeared Jan. 23 in Pakistan while working
on a story for the Wall Street Journal about Islamic radicals there.
A videotape showing Daniel Pearl's slaying was obtained by the U.S.
Consulate in Karachi a month later.</TE>
<TE>   According to a statement prepared by the Daniel Pearl Foundation,
Judea Pearl told a London audience: "My family and I have gone
through the worst of times in the past few months. My son Daniel was
abducted and murdered in Pakistan earlier this year, and until two
weeks ago, I was not sure whether I could muster the strength to come
accept this honor."</TE>
<TE>   The statement also said that the chief defendant in the kidnapping
and killing of Daniel Pearl, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, was a graduate
of the London School of Economics.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny would have encouraged me to go ahead with the lecture as
planned, in symbolic defiance of his murderers' attempt to spread
fear and despair across the globe," Pearl said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Daniel Pearl Foundation, according to its Web site,
www.danielpearl.org, was established to promote "cross-cultural
understanding through responsible journalism and innovative
communication."</TE>

<HD>Top O.C. Defender Backs Judge in Burning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's public defender wrote the state's top jurist Thursday
to say he believes a judge has been unfairly criticized for reducing
charges against a father who burned his son's hand in a gas flame.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald M. George, chief justice of California, called for a review
of Judge James O. Perez after the judge was criticized for reducing
the case against an Anaheim father to a misdemeanor. The father
admitted burning his son for stealing a pack of gum.</LD>
<LD>   Public Defender Carl Holmes, whose office represented the father,
said the judge took several factors into consideration. The father,
Wellington Soto, realized his actions were wrong and had attended
counseling to improve his parenting skills, Holmes said.</LD>
<TE>   "Judge Perez has served with distinction on the bench for over 30
years, and he does not deserve the characterization made of him in
the newspapers," Holmes wrote.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing last month, Perez said the injured 5-year-old boy
"learned a lesson" when his father held his hand over the kitchen
stove and turned on the flame. He also said "customs and habits"
played a role in his decision. Soto said a parent had burned his hand
as a child in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   After reducing the case to a misdemeanor--over the objections of a
prosecutor--Perez fined the father $100 and placed him on probation.
Holmes said it is unfair to criticize the judge for the sentence,
which was negotiated by the prosecution and defense.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, 76, the first Spanish-speaking judge in Orange County,
retired from the bench in 1987. He is one of hundreds of retired
judges the chief justice hires part time to help with the state court
caseload.</TE>
<TE>   The presiding judge in Orange County is preparing a review of
Perez for the chief justice to review.</TE>

<HD>Full Speed Ahead for Tiny Port</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Officials at Hueneme harbor celebrate its 65th
anniversary and predict a steady growth in business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jess Herrera has spent much of his adult life working at the Port of
Hueneme and has watched it grow from a sleepy lagoon to an economic
powerhouse that generates an estimated $450 million each year for
Ventura County's economy.</LD>
<LD>   As a harbor commissioner who also works as a unionized marine
clerk, Herrera said the only deep-water shipping center between Los
Angeles and San Francisco has shed its boom-or-bust past and is on
track for steady growth in the future.</LD>
<LD>   "Trade is the No. 1 business in the world, and we're doing it
right here in Ventura County," said Herrera, 54, the commission's
vice president who has been at the harbor for 35 years. "We take a
lot of pride in our port."</LD>
<TE>   As the tiny port celebrates its 65th anniversary this week, it
continues working to bolster trade overseas, find ways to expand
limited facilities and increase efficiency. In fact, port officials
have been busy laying the groundwork for growth--supporting several
big contracts with importers, strengthening ties with China and
arranging an extensive dredging project that will accommodate larger
ships for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The secret of the port's success, according to port executive
director William J. Buenger, is its close relationship with the
tenants and shipping lines that use the two-wharf, five-berth
facility.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very strong cadre of world-class customers that I believe
are going to be here for a long time to come," he said. "They've
invested a lot of money in private facilities, and that's better than
any contract you could write."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike much larger ports in Los Angeles County, the Port of
Hueneme specializes in items such as automobiles, fresh fruit and
produce that aren't transported in shipping containers--the 40-foot
boxes that attach directly to trucks.</TE>
<TE>   This strategy has been profitable. The number of vehicles shipped
through the port more than doubled in the last decade, and the import
of bananas and export of citrus during that time jumped nearly 242%.
Harbor district revenue from operations climbed from $3.7 million in
fiscal year 1990-1991 to $8.3 million last year, while net income
during that time grew more than five times to $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   But to maintain such momentum the port must find room to grow
beyond its 135 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the port began a licensing agreement with the Navy
to allow the port to use a Navy-owned wharf adjacent to the port's
north terminal. After Sept. 11, commercial use of that wharf was
curtailed, but Buenger said the port hopes to resume use of the dock
space and expand the deal to include more storage area. Herrera said
he is confident an enhanced alliance can be worked out with Navy
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the port is making steady gains elsewhere. It spent
$3.9 million to buy 12 acres at its northeast corner that once held
an old Sunkist shed that will be converted into additional automobile
storage.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Vehicle Processors--which gets Jaguars, Land Rovers,
Mitsubishis, Suzukis and Volvos ready for market--recently announced
a contract with Volkswagen-Audi that will nearly double the size of
its operation. The company will handle imports of 100,000 extra cars
next year, which will eventually result in the hiring of 250
additional workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The port is going to have to develop more land in order for us to
bring in more business," said James J. Kilpatrick, the company's vice
president of marketing and development.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Vehicle's off-site location, along Hueneme Road east of
the port, will also grow from its current 65 acres to 130 acres,
including 38 acres it's buying at the end of Saviers Road and other
property it leases from Southern California Edison and the port.</TE>
<TE>   To further prepare for its expansion, the port is counting on a
$6.1-million extension of Rice Avenue to connect it to Hueneme Road,
which could begin construction by spring 2003. There is also a
planned $6.8-million widening of Hueneme Road to accommodate more
traffic and a dredging project to make the port's single channel 5
feet deeper.</TE>
<TE>   But today, harbor officials are taking a breather to celebrate
where the port has come from since it became a legal entity in May
1937. The Hueneme Lagoon was dug out to form the commercial port over
a period of several years.</TE>
<TE>   Linked to National Maritime Month, about 750 schoolchildren are
set to take tours this morning, and there will be a public open house
from 4 to 7:30 p.m. featuring a barbecue, an automobile display and
viewing of the Lane Victory, a World War II cargo vessel.</TE>
<TE>   The ship, restored and staffed by a crew of retired merchant
marine seamen in their 70s and 80s, was built in Wilmington and made
its first cruise up the coast to the Port of Hueneme to pick up a
load of munitions and supplies destined for the Pacific in the last
months of the war.</TE>

port contributes $450 million to the local economy each year.</CP>

<HD>Suit Likely Over Downtown Plan, Supervisor Says</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Zev Yaroslavsky says L.A.'s $2.4-billion
project, which may include NFL stadium, would deny funding to other
entities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA, PATRICK McGREEVY and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Thursday that he expects the
county to sue the city of Los Angeles for adopting a $2.4-billion
downtown redevelopment plan.</LD>
<LD>   Yaroslavsky argues that the plan, touted by city officials as a
way to revitalize downtown and possibly lure professional football
back to Los Angeles, would unjustly redirect property tax dollars
away from the county.</LD>
<LD>   Yaroslavsky's threat came as proponents of a football stadium in
the redevelopment zone met with National Football League officials,
seeking their support.</LD>
<TE>   The so-called City Center plan, its proponents say, would create
homes and jobs and might help pay for a sorely needed hotel near the
Convention Center. But county officials counter that the plan would
illegally deprive them of $278 million over 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking money out of the mouths of poor people,"
Yaroslavsky said. "I don't think the county will have any choice but
to sue, to take legal action, because this redevelopment project
flies in the face of the law. It defies common sense."</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment plan, whose area includes the South Park,
Historic Downtown and City Markets neighborhoods, would redirect how
taxes are divided among the county and other government entities.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Community Redevelopment Agency would receive 60% of
future tax revenue from the district, and 20% would go into a housing
trust fund. The remaining 20% would be given to the normal taxing
entities--the city, county, Los Angeles Unified School District and
community college district.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment area would cover 879 acres--or 180 city blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment districts are used to revitalize blighted areas, and
county officials have argued that some land included in an earlier
district--about 30 acres near Staples Center--shouldn't be included
in the new district.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not blighted," Yaroslavsky said. "It's just a way to
fatten the redevelopment plan and make it more economically
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   He said the county would have to wait on the City Council's final
procedural vote Wednesday before filing suit.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the project, meanwhile, repeatedly said Thursday
that their aim was to invigorate the downtown economy, not to pave
the way for billionaire Philip Anschutz's proposed football stadium
in South Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made no contact with them. They have made no contact with
us," said Donald Spivack, deputy administrator of the redevelopment
agency.</TE>
<TE>   However, stadium proponents lobbied city officials to adopt the
redevelopment plan and have had informal discussions about the
stadium with several council members and Mayor James K. Hahn. It
appears that more "briefings," as those involved call them, will
occur in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But a few council members were unconvinced that the redevelopment
plan moved forward so quickly without the stadium proposal being a
key factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly think there is a master plot," said Councilman Dennis
Zine, one of three council members who voted against the plan. "The
billionaire developers have a plan. I don't know what the plan is,
but I know they want a hotel. I know they want a football stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district would include portions of
the redevelopment area, said speculation that the stadium was the
driving force behind the plan is "erroneous."</TE>
<TE>   Comments such as Zine's are what caused Perry to briefly consider
amending the redevelopment plan Wednesday to prohibit the use of
redevelopment agency funding for a football stadium, but she decided
against the provision after input from council colleagues and the
mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz, who owns Staples Center and all or part of 18 sports
franchises, is heading a high-powered coalition that wants to build a
stadium near Staples Center. The group includes supermarket
billionaire Ron Burkle, real estate magnate Ed Roski and Casey
Wasserman, owner of the Los Angeles Avengers, an arena football team.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz officials are in New York this week, meeting with NFL
officials. "We met with them, and we continue to pursue this with
vigor," Wasserman said. "But it's a long way from happening, and
there are a lot of issues to be resolved on all fronts."</TE>
<TE>   Outside observers say the Anschutz group is the only organization
in recent memory to have so many factors line up in its favor for
bringing football back to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers are rumored to be the most likely tenant of
a Los Angeles stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Though the deal would face many hurdles, "they have the means, the
motive and the opportunity," said David Carter, a USC sports business
professor and part of the Sports Business Group, a Los Angeles
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This group has the means, financially and with respect to their
[political] connections. They have the motivation to do it because of
the Anschutz sport empire and the motivation of Casey Wasserman and
others to really make this team happen. And clearly, the San Diego
Chargers provide the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   However, other officials are skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge that the South Park project has is to prove itself
to be superior to a proposal that could be advanced by the Coliseum,"
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas also said he heard that the NFL is floating the idea
of building a stadium that could be used both by the Dodgers baseball
team and a football team. The NFL had made similar proposals years
ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the idea is worthy of considering," Ridley-Thomas said.
"It is a question of whether or not it can be accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Hahn and Anschutz said they had not heard of
the proposal, and a Dodgers representative did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the Anschutz group said the organization once
considered turning Chavez Ravine into a site for an NFL venue and
building a baseball stadium downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The source added that the scenario gathered no momentum in part
because it would not be greeted favorably by the NFL, which is
looking to build modern stadiums that are part of entertainment
districts.</TE>

<HD>Harbor Area Bid to Secede Faces Revenue Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts to save the harbor area's faltering secession bid went down
to the wire Thursday as officials for a state commission struggled to
draft a budget that would allow the proposed city to survive apart
from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The cityhood application for San Pedro and Wilmington will rise or
fall on a financial viability report expected to be released today by
the Local Agency Formation Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "We're looking under bedcovers; we're looking behind the chairs"
for revenue that would sustain a harbor area city, said Larry
Calemine, the commission's executive director. By law, a secession
election cannot be held if LAFCO determines that the breakaway region
would not be fiscally healthy.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm hearing that it's very close," said Andrew Mardesich,
co-chairof the harbor secession campaign. "If things don't work out,
I'm not overjoyed, but I did the best I could to help the community."</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area is one of three Los Angeles regions--the others
are the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood -- whose residents signed
petitions authorizing the commission to consider holding secession
elections. LAFCO will decide during the next several weeks whether to
place the proposals on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the harbor application is important to the Valley and
Hollywood drives, because each secession measure would require the
approval of a majority of voters--both within the breakaway area and
citywide. Secessionists believe that a simultaneous vote on all three
areas would make it more likely that each would win.</TE>
<TE>   But the harbor and Hollywood proposals have been dealt blows
recently. State Controller Kathleen Connell has said that her office
found that neither area would survive financially as a new city.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO is not bound by the controller's findings. The commission's
initial review determined that Hollywood, with its significant retail
and commercial sector, would be in good fiscal shape with careful
budgeting. Calemine said he will review the controller's concerns
about Hollywood and make recommendations next month.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor proposal remains "problematic," Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   A LAFCO analysis earlier this year concluded that the harbor area
would have difficulty balancing its budget as an independent city.
But it also said the area could be viable if some city services were
cut or taxes raised.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the State Lands Commission has weighed in, saying that
it would not allow a harbor city to include the Port of Los Angeles
within its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   That weakened the region's prospects of making ends meet, Calemine
said, because it removed rich sources of tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists submitted a new budget last week that they said
reduced the proposed city's expenses enough to keep it afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of contracting with Los Angeles for key services, as the
commission's consultants had suggested, the harbor could save
millions by turning to Los Angeles County for police and fire
protection, cityhood proponents said.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine was intrigued by the revised figures, and delayed the
release of his report so he could evaluate them. But by late
Thursday, it was still not clear that the numbers would pencil out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're wrestling with trying to find ways that it could be made
viable," Calemine said. He noted that LAFCO is required to try to
make cityhood proposals work and get them on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding tired, the usually indefatigable Mardesich said L.A.
officials have put more effort into defeating secession than
addressing the concerns that spurred the harbor movement in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who say they represent us ... haven't listened," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, spokeswoman for Mayor James K. Hahn, said that isn't
true: "The mayor lives in San Pedro and understands the concerns of
the people who live there."</TE>

<HD>Tustin, School District Settle Base Dispute</HD>
<DH>Land use: Santa Ana Unified gets 22 acres of the former
Marine air station and $38 million. Deal clears way for city to sell
site to developers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District and the city of Tustin settled
a nasty land fight Thursday that had spurred accusations of racism
and threatened to thwart redevelopment of the former Tustin Marine
base.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, the Santa Ana district will get 22 acres for a
combined elementary and middle school--a fraction of the 100 acres
the district wanted--plus $38 million toward the purchase of land for
a new high school elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   If the 22 acres prove too contaminated from years of military use
to build a school there, or if for any reason the school district
opts not to take it, the city will pay the district $22 million for
the land. The state's Department of Toxic Substance Control will
decide how contaminated the land is and what measures must be taken
before it is suitable for a school to be built.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't believe we are about to cross the finish line on this,"
Santa Ana board President John Palacio said after a special meeting
Thursday at which trustees unanimously approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin City Council is expected to approve the settlement at a
special meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas and Councilwoman Tracy Wills Worley
visited the Santa Ana board shortly after its meeting to greet school
officials in a show of solidarity after years of acrimony.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all of the mind-set of 'enough already,'" Worley said.
"Nobody got exactly what they wanted, but life is about compromises."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders want the deal inked before Tuesday, when Navy
officials arrive from Washington to officially deed most of the
1,600-acre base to Tustin. The city will sell most of the land to
private developers for homes, commercial space and a golf course; the
Navy will sell 234 acres for housing.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement ends eight years of fighting over the former
helicopter base, which closed in July 1999 with its sister base at El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified and the Rancho Santiago Community College
District, based in Santa Ana, were among five school districts
originally approved in 1994 to get land on the Tustin base. But
Tustin submitted a new plan later that gave 100 acres to the South
Orange County Community College District, with schools for districts
in Tustin and Irvine--and nothing for Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The land fight escalated in the past 18 months, with the districts
filing a federal civil-rights lawsuit against the city last year,
arguing that its plan was racially biased against the Santa Ana
districts, where most students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the state passed a law that barred development of the
base by Tustin unless the city gave 100 acres for Santa Ana schools
or the parties reached an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The city responded with its own lawsuit, arguing that the state's
intervention violated federal law.</TE>
<TE>   In April, officials at Rancho Santiago agreed to a separate deal
with Tustin to get 15 acres. That property, along with the land for
Santa Ana Unified, is within the area that had been designated for
the South County college district.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) said Thursday that his bill did
exactly what it was supposed to do: compel both parties to reach an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The city had argued that it could not give 100 acres to Santa Ana
Unified without jeopardizing its redevelopment plan. The city needed
to sell the land within the Santa Ana district boundaries to
commercial developers to help pay for improvements such as streets,
sewers and utilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative, the city offered 22 acres and $38 million to
Santa Ana Unified. But the district complained that the land hadn't
been tested for contamination.</TE>
<TE>   In recent negotiations, Tustin sweetened its deal by offering
additional cash if the 22 acres weren't suitable for a school. And if
Santa Ana Unified agreed to accept the property, the $38 million
would be paid in 18 months rather than four years.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the parties opted for a settlement rather than taking
their chances in court. The Santa Ana district needs land to build
schools to ease overcrowding, and the clock was ticking for Tustin as
it tried to move forward with its development plans for the former
base.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's deal puts Santa Ana Unified much closer to its goal of
building 11 elementary schools and two high schools since it passed a
school bond measure two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With state matching funds, the district hopes to double the $38
million from Tustin and use most of it to buy the 36-acre Armstrong
Ranch in south Santa Ana to build a high school.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Santa Ana said a court hearing last month on a related
matter was a turning point in nudging the final settlement deal by
Tustin. A judge refused to overturn the state's right to intervene in
the land fight, denying the city's request to go ahead with plans to
relocate the Orange County Rescue Mission at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin City Manager William A. Huston denied Thursday that the
judge's decision had made a difference, saying the city was prepared
to appeal. "Each side can always pound their chest and say we won a
round in court," he said. "Both parties recognized that litigation is
not the answer."</TE>

<HD>SOAR's Measure Qualifies for Vote</HD>
<DH>Development: The ballot item would block growth into
canyons north of Simi Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slow-growth activists in Simi Valley have gathered enough signatures
to place on the November ballot a plan to block expansion into canyon
areas north of the city, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members are expected to decide next month whether to
place a competing measure on the ballot. That measure would maintain
the current boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   The measure by the slow-growth group Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources would rein in an initial set of growth
boundaries adopted by voters in 1998. City officials said SOAR had
collected more than the 6,185 signatures--10% of registered
voters--needed to put the plan to a vote.</LD>
<TE>   The measure calls for cutting Alamos and Brea canyons and Marr and
Runkle ranches from expansion plans while limiting growth to the
existing city limits. Should developers eventually want to expand
into those areas, the council could not grant approval without
voters' consent.</TE>
<TE>   That could jeopardize developer Unocal's plans for The Canyons, a
major business park and 1,600-home project northwest of the city.
Local leaders have viewed The Canyons as the primary source of job
creation in the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It was much easier to collect these signatures than we'd
imagined," said Kevin Conville, an activist heading the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bill Davis and other officials are furious about SOAR's
latest plan. They backed SOAR's 1998 effort after supporters agreed
to include the canyon areas in the acceptable growth boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way they told us it would be and now they're coming
back and changing their mind," Councilwoman Barbra Williamson said.
"People are afraid of this turning into the San Fernando Valley. But
just saying 'No building at all' is not smart planning."</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the council has said it supports placing a competing
proposal on the November ballot--one with the same or nearly
identical SOAR boundaries as those approved four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think we need to give the citizens a choice to maintain what
they have or go with the other one," Councilman Paul Miller said. "If
we just have the one issue on the ballot, it may not tell the whole
story."</TE>

<HD>Appreciation Surprises Substitute Teachers</HD>
<DH>Recognition: State's effort to honor last-minute
instructors gets minimal notice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By 8 a.m. Thursday, Darlene Morrison sat in front of the whiteboard
in Room 307, preparing to cover a third-grade class at El Segundo's
Richmond Street Elementary. Shortly before the bell rang, two school
staffers delivered a paper plate with a croissant and a few pieces of
fruit on it.</LD>
<LD>   The breakfast--leftovers from an event to honor the school's
regular teachers--represented a rare acknowledgment of Thursday as
California's first ever Substitute Teacher Day. Morrison, a
61-year-old who has subbed for the last seven years, managed just a
bite of fruit before the class was filled by 20 energetic
third-graders, demanding to know if they could make their computer
presentations as scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   "Mrs. Trachtenberg isn't here," said Morrison of the regular
teacher, who was out for jury duty. "And she wants to see your
presentations for herself." That elicited a few groans, which did not
stop Morrison from plowing into other lessons.</LD>
<TE>   As a debut occasion to honor a group of instructors who often get
no respect, Substitute Teacher Day -- formally proclaimed by Gov.
Gray Davis--received precious little of its own. On Thursday,
substitutes shared, in relative anonymity, state honors with family
child-care providers, wildfire fighters, arthritis and osteoporosis
sufferers and nurses. Plus, substitutes were left to bask in the
afterglow of Wednesday's widely acknowledged California Day of the
Teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Most subs, including Morrison, had been unaware of the special
day. In El Segundo, the talk has been of the district's Week of
Teacher Recognition, during which parents decorate faculty lounges,
host a luncheon and wash teachers' cars. A high school substitute in
Fresno reported receiving a mug of candy--left over from a Teacher
Appreciation ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   At Field Elementary School in Pasadena, Principal Cheryl Portillo
said she acknowledged her two substitute teachers--after a call from
a district spokesman, who learned of the day from a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a secret," said Brandi Bakewell, a 28-year-old
substitute who took over a first-grade class at Field last week for
the rest of the semester. Students, antsy after completing
standardized tests, took no note of the special occasion. They
criticized her choice of a book for reading ("Mrs. Parsons already
read it"), claimed boredom with journal writing and complained of
stomach pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The job can be overwhelming," said Bakewell, a third-year
substitute who is a master's candidate in education at USC. "But it's
steady work, and I feel the need to give back, to serve a large
number of African American and Latino students."</TE>
<TE>   Little noticed as it was, Substitute Teacher Day represented a
milestone for a small but growing nationwide movement. Four other
states--Michigan, Florida, Oregon and Wisconsin--have established
similar days after lobbying by the National Substitute Teachers
Alliance. That 2-year-old group also has worked with unions in
organizing substitutes across the country. In recent years,
bargaining units for substitutes were formed in San Bernardino and
the Pajaro Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Kirsten, the alliance president and also director of
substitute teacher organizing for the American Federation of
Teachers, said she hoped the day would boost legislation to improve
conditions and training. A bill being considered in Sacramento would
establish a pilot program to give new substitutes three days of
training. Most school districts require no special training.</TE>
<TE>   "California is probably the hotbed of substitute teacher
organizing," said Kirsten, who lives in Fresno. "We're hoping the day
provides recognition and publicity for what we've been up to."</TE>
<TE>   The state government keeps no official statistics on substitutes,
but the Substitute Teacher Institute at Utah State University
estimates there are 50,000 substitutes working on any given day in
California. Geoffrey Smith, the institute's executive director, says
school districts in California typically pay well above the national
daily average, which is less than $70, and that Los Angeles Unified
stands out: $152 per day, with pay upgrades for long assignments and
health benefits to those who work 100 days a year.</TE>
<TE>   In El Segundo, Morrison, who became a sub after retiring from
full-time teaching in 1995, says she could work five days a week if
she wanted to. She tries to limit it to three days.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, she was greeted warmly by third-grader
Allison Rigdon, who complimented her dress. But the rest of her
audience was tougher. "We're a talkative class," announced one boy
from the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Adhering closely to the absent teacher's lesson plan, Morrison
quickly gained control with a spelling quiz and songs that recite the
times tables. During a math exercise, a couple of boys briefly hid
under a table in back. ("We're going to have some work from you if
you sit under there," she said.) To keep the class on track, Morrison
broke out a series of word puzzles she always brings along in case
the day drags.</TE>
<TE>   "Going a little crazy," she said. "But I'm the substitute. And at
least they brought me a few goodies for breakfast."</TE>

<HD>County Gets Warm Reception, No Funds</HD>
<DH>Health care: Officials wrap up Washington trip, say they
got only encouragement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Despite a health-care budget deficit that could reach
$688 million in three years, the Los Angeles County officials who
came to Washington this week did not, for the first time in years,
ask the federal government for a bailout.</LD>
<LD>   They knew they wouldn't get one.</LD>
<LD>   Even their attempts to persuade Congress and Bush administration
officials to delay or reduce certain funding cuts ran into the
reality that "there is no money" in the federal budget, said David E.
Janssen, the county's chief administrative officer.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the county contingent wrapped up three days of
meetings Thursday with its members saying they were pleasantly
surprised by federal officials' openness to their efforts to reform
public health-care financing.</TE>
<TE>   "These are smart people," said Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the
Board of Supervisors. "They realize our system cannot be allowed to
fail."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said county officials will begin work on detailed
proposals to present to federal budget and Medicaid officials. "There
is a window of receptivity here," a sense that everyone wants to work
together to solve the county's health-care problems, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The county's health-care system, twice bailed out by the Clinton
administration, is on the brink of "disaster," officials
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, with 3 million uninsured residents, has an
uninsured rate of 30%, the highest in the country. Similar problems
can be found in most large urban areas, where Medicaid funding
formulas that reward in-patient care over out-patient services have
encouraged the over-building of hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the Bush administration plans to cut or curtail
financing programs that funnel federal and state dollars to hospitals
that treat large numbers of the poor and uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   The looming budget shortfall of more than half a billion dollars
has forced county officials to consider converting two of six public
hospitals into clinics and laying off thousands of workers. Thomas
Garthwaite, the county's new director of health services, is
scheduled to submit a preliminary reorganization plan to the board
next month. Final approval is due in October.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be ugly," said Supervisor Don Knabe.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors said their discussions with Office of Management and
Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., Medicaid and Medicare chief
Thomas Scully and the heads of key congressional committees were
short on details. But they were encouraged by the administration's
concern, flexibility and openness to new ideas, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In general, county officials encouraged the federal government to
revamp the Medicaid payment system to encourage outpatient services,
preventive care and disease and medication maintenance. "Dollars
should follow patients" into whatever kind of care is most
appropriate for them, they told federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said that although the size of Los Angeles County's
deficits will probably require some cuts in health-care services, he
believes many of the changes will both save money and improve patient
care.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors also discussed other issues -- including bioterrorism
spending, welfare-to-work efforts and the jailing of criminal illegal
immigrants--with lawmakers, including many members of California's
congressional delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said county officials would probably
return to Washington in August for further discussions.</TE>

<HD>Terrorists Received Drug Money, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Probe: DEA chief says proceeds from meth ring have been
funneled to Hezbollah, perhaps other organizations. Lawyers for
accused traffickers dismiss idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal investigators have uncovered significant evidence that
proceeds from a nationwide narcotics trafficking ring have been
funneled to terrorist organizations in the Middle East, the head of
the Drug Enforcement Administration said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson said in an interview that
investigators believe a portion of the millions of dollars collected
by suppliers of a methamphetamine ring went to the Iranian-backed
terrorist group Hezbollah.</LD>
<LD>   Some money also has been traced to defendants' families in
Lebanon, Yemen and other Mideast countries, Hutchinson added, raising
the possibility that illicit proceeds have been forwarded to other
terrorist groups.</LD>
<TE>   "Let me make it clear," Hutchinson said. "I am satisfied that
portions of the drug sales have moved back to the Middle East and
portions of that are going to support terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this is the first time we have seen with drug
transactions in the United States where proceeds are actually going
back to fund terrorism" in the Mideast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the information is known to the FBI and federal prosecutors,
Hutchinson said, he could not discuss the possibility of additional
charges being filed because of the ongoing nature of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The probe, dubbed Operation Mountain Express, was launched in 1999
and so far has resulted in the arrests of more than 300 people for
allegedly producing methamphetamine using vast quantities of the
over-the-counter cold medicine ingredient, pseudoephedrine. Arrests
have been made in a dozen major cities, from Los Angeles to Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing several of the Los Angeles defendants
dismissed the notion Thursday that proceeds from the drug ring went
to fund terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a shred of evidence that there is any
connection" between this case and funding terrorism, said attorney
David A. Katz, a former assistant U.S. attorney representing Khalil
Mohammed, who faces numerous counts, including allegedly conspiring
to help manufacture methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Added defense attorney Mark Werksman, also a former federal
prosecutor: "I haven't seen any evidence suggesting a connection to
terrorism, and this sounds like an inflammatory suggestion designed
to prejudice the public against our clients." Werksman represents
Adnan Isa, a Chicago resident accused of conspiring to supply
pseudoephedrine to California clients.</TE>
<TE>   The comments by the DEA's Hutchinson, a former Republican
congressman from Arkansas, come several months after authorities
announced the latest round of arrests in the long-running drug probe.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Mountain Express, which involves other law enforcement
agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, first targeted
U.S. individuals and companies that were illegally supplying
methamphetamine producers with pseudoephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial round of arrests and drug seizures dried up
domestic sources of the chemical, law enforcement officials said,
narcotics traffickers turned to suppliers in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   That phase of the investigation, according to one January federal
grand jury indictment in Los Angeles, uncovered a vast smuggling
operation with huge shipments of the chemical transported from Canada
to Chicago and Detroit and then on to methamphetamine producers in
California.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles alone, a federal indictment charged 36 people with
drug trafficking in Riverside and San Bernardino counties--an area
long considered the methamphetamine capital of the world. In all,
more than 100 people were arrested in 12 U.S. cities where,
authorities say, they also seized enough pseudoephedrine to produce
nine tons of methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, authorities said, Operation Mountain Express already
had resulted in the seizure of more than 30 tons of pseudoephedrine
and $16 million in U.S. currency.</TE>
<TE>   While a number of those arrested were of Middle Eastern descent,
Hutchinson and other federal authorities said in January that their
investigation had turned up no evidence that the drug proceeds were
sent to terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Hutchinson said Thursday, investigators have found
significant links between the drug ring and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "In January, I made the statement that there was no evidence we
had to show money went for terrorism purposes," Hutchinson said. "I
will say that has changed based on our ongoing investigation."</TE>
<TE>   While emphasizing that investigators had not linked the drug
proceeds to any specific act of terrorism, Hutchinson said, they have
found proof that money is making its way to extremists. He declined
to offer details of the proof.</TE>
<TE>   Pinpointing who has received the money has been difficult,
Hutchinson said, in part because the transfers from defendants here
to the Middle East have gone out in "bulk form cash which is
difficult to trace."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Katz, whose client is a Jordanian American, was
skeptical that authorities will find any specific links between the
alleged drug ring and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't apply to my client. He didn't send ... a dime to
anyone," Katz said. "But it may be some of the other defendants did
send money home. That is the immigrant experience: to come to America
and send back some of the money you have made."</TE>
<TE>   If some money has been stolen by a criminal or terrorism group,
Katz added, there is a "big difference between sending money home and
having it taken in an involuntary tithing ... and sending it to
Hezbollah."</TE>

<HD>From Tragedy Comes Goal to Fight Crime as a Prosecutor</HD>
<DH>Veronica Lemus- Alvarez hopes to emulate deputy D.A. who
put her sister's killer in prison. She is well on her way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day in court used to be difficult for Veronica Lemus. It meant
remembering the shooting death of her sister, comforting her mother
whenever she cried and watching as her sister's killer sat in the San
Fernando courthouse with a smirk on his face.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen years ago, the courthouse was her weakness, but it later
became her strength. Lemus, who is now married and uses the name
Lemus-Alvarez, works as a civil attorney in Burbank and hopes one day
to become a prosecutor like the one she watched during those
emotional days in the courtroom, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie L.
Samuels.</LD>
<LD>   "I wondered how such a petite woman could command such presence
and authority," said Lemus-Alvarez, 32. "I knew then that's who I
wanted to be and that's what I wanted to do."</LD>
<TE>   Lemus-Alvarez was a senior at Kennedy High School in San Fernando
during the 1987 trial of Carlos Montez Zepeda, who shot her
21-year-old sister, Patricia Lemus, in a San Fernando parking lot.
She will never forget the despair on the faces of her mother, Maria,
her two other sisters and three of her four brothers as they sat in
the San Fernando courtroom, which felt as cold and sterile as the
Holy Cross Hospital emergency room where Patricia died.</TE>
<TE>   After Zepeda received a life sentence in March 1988 for killing
Patricia, Lemus-Alvarez focused her energy on becoming a lawyer. She
was sworn in to the California State Bar Assn. in June after
graduating from the UCLA School of Law in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Now specializing in construction defect cases for a Burbank law
firm, she dreams of one day working for the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office "to fight for the rights of victims of
violent crimes," she said. She has inquired about working for the
department, but it is currently in the middle of a hiring freeze,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemus-Alvarez, who was just 17 when they met, has grown into an
"amazing woman," Samuels said. "She managed to turn this tragedy into
a life-changing experience. Her family is so proud of her."</TE>
<TE>   Samuels and the Lemus family met again last month in San Fernando
Superior Court, where Zepeda's 39-year-old brother, Omar, was tried
for his role in Patricia's murder. He fled to Mexico after the
slaying but had since returned to Los Angeles, where he was arrested
two years ago. A jury convicted him May 1 of first-degree murder. He
will be sentenced June 7.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, complete justice," Lemus-Alvarez said after the verdict
was read.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Sunday night, three days after Christmas 1986, and San
Fernando youth were abuzz with anticipation of the New Year's
celebration. Laurel Canyon Boulevard was packed with excited young
people cruising up and down the busy street.</TE>
<TE>   Many knew each other from school, but fights were still common on
the boulevard, police said. Despite the holiday spirit, this day
would be no different.</TE>
<TE>   It started with a few bottles thrown at 24-year-old Omar Montez
Zepeda as he rode his motorcycle through traffic. Fearing he would be
outnumbered, he went home to get his brother Carlos. The brothers
returned to the parking lot, Carlos with a .38-caliber revolver
tucked in his waistband, said Det. Bob Vanina of the LAPD's Foothill
Division.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Lemus had been driving home with her 11/2-year-old
daughter, Vanessa, her 23-year-old brother, Ricky, and his
19-year-old girlfriend, Esther, when she pulled into a shopping
center parking lot on Rinaldi Street to wait for traffic to die down.
The adults got out of the car to talk with some friends, while
Vanessa rested inside.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Zepeda brothers, who were looking for those who
tossed the bottles, rode in their direction on Omar's motorcycle.
Carlos was wielding the gun as Omar circled around several cars "like
Indians circling the wagons," Vanina said. They were looking for the
man who provoked the earlier fight. But he was hiding behind the
cars, including the one where Patricia's baby rested.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people in the parking lot ducked when they saw the
gun, but Patricia ran to her child. "Don't shoot, don't shoot! My
baby is in the car!" she shouted.</TE>
<TE>   She climbed into the car to hide, but Carlos "just wanted to kill
somebody," Deputy Dist. Atty. Samuels said in court.</TE>
<TE>   He shot Patricia point blank in the face as she peered out of the
driver's side window. She died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Samuels met the Lemus family on the first day of Carlos Zepeda's
trial in early 1987. Everyone was there except Lemus-Alvarez's
brother Danny, who was on military duty in Japan. They took an
elevator up to the third floor, Samuels and Veronica's mother, Maria,
who had assumed custody of Vanessa, talking the entire way.</TE>
<TE>   The family immediately liked Samuels, especially when she spoke
before the jury during opening statements.</TE>
<TE>   "She has this presence about her," Lemus-Alvarez said. "And when
she talks, everyone listens."</TE>
<TE>   Samuels was just beginning her career with the district attorney's
office, working in the hard-core gang unit. This was just her second
murder trial. She has since won numerous awards, including the

<TE>   In the fall of 1988, Lemus-Alvarez enrolled at UCLA and continued
into its law school. Whenever she was asked why she wanted to be a

<HD>Waste Hauler Claims 2 Cities Sought Payoffs</HD>
<DH>Trash: Attorney says firm lost contracts in Compton, South
Gate after refusing. Two men deny the allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A waste-hauling firm said it was asked to pay $4 million to a friend
of Compton's mayor and to contribute tens of thousands of dollars to
campaigns run by South Gate's city treasurer while the company was
seeking to renew its trash hauling contracts in the two cities.</LD>
<LD>   The firm, a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc., did not pay and
lost multimillion-dollar contracts in both cities, said John Newell,
an attorney for the company.</LD>
<LD>   South Gate City Treasurer Albert Robles told Waste Management last
year he would make sure it lost its city contract after the company
declined to make the campaign contributions he wanted, Newell said.</LD>
<TE>   Robles at the time reminded a company official that the firm had
raised only $7,000 in 2001 for the candidates he was backing and
reneged on a promise to pay $15,000 for a political mailer, Newell
said. Robles then told the official, said Newell, "'You're out of
town.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Compton, Michael Aloyan, a close friend of then-Mayor Omar
Bradley, asked Waste Management in 2000 to pay him $4 million to
secure the city's garbage-hauling business, Newell said. Aloyan now
runs the city's garbage collecting business himself, employing
Bradley's brother and cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan and Robles denied Waste Management's allegations. Robles
acknowledged that he solicited campaign donations but denied linking
the request to contracts. Aloyan said through his attorney that he
never asked the firm for money.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said Waste Management's claims sounded like "sour grapes."
He said he had no knowledge of any approach for funds.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan has an exclusive 15-year contract with Compton that is
expected to bring him $100 million in gross receipts. The 10-year
South Gate contract, which expired in 2001, was worth about $40
million.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal laws make it a crime for public officials to
offer to sell their influence and for firms to seek to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged solicitations are the second and third reported by
Waste Management. Newell told The Times last month that Carson Mayor
Daryl Sweeney urged the company to hire his personal lawyer during
contract talks in 2001. The lawyer, Robert Pryce, asked for nearly $1
million in fees to help Waste Management renew its municipal
trash-hauling contract. Waste Management refused.</TE>
<TE>   A commercial refuse-collection contract expected to bring in $35
million in revenues over 10 years was awarded to a rival firm that
hired Pryce.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Pryce nor Sweeney would comment.</TE>
<TE>   In Compton, Waste Management said it was solicited by Aloyan
shortly after the City Council had decided to let the firm's contract
expire and operate its own waste-hauling operation.</TE>
<TE>   A City Council majority, led by Bradley, selected Aloyan as a
consultant to set up and run a city sanitation department.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan had long experience in the trash business and in Compton
politics. He had worked for Murcole Inc., which held a Compton
waste-hauling contract in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He
testified under a grant of immunity in federal court in 1995 that he
served as a go-between for Murcole's secret payoffs to a local
politician, Walter R. Tucker III, a former Compton mayor and member
of Congress. Tucker was convicted of a separate extortion charge in
the same case.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Compton chose Aloyan as its garbage-collection
consultant in early 2000, Newell said, Aloyan asked to meet a Waste
Management executive. In May, Newell said, Aloyan told the executive
he would sell his company for $4 million. The company's only apparent
asset was Aloyan's $300,000 per-year consultant's fee.</TE>
<TE>   The Waste Management executive asked why the firm should pay so
much, Newell said. Aloyan answered that his company would soon have
the city's multimillion-dollar trash hauling contract, according to
Newell.</TE>
<TE>   "'I'll have the city,'" the executive recalled Aloyan as having
said.</TE>
<TE>   The executive reported that comment right away, Newell said,
because he was suspicious about Aloyan trying to sell a contract he
didn't have. Newell refused to name the executive, citing a company
privacy policy.</TE>
<TE>   Compton officials were planning at the time to form a city
sanitation department, which Aloyan would manage. The city sanitation
department was scheduled to begin operation in the fall. The city
issued $6 million in tax-exempt municipal bonds in June, and bought
garbage trucks, bins and other trash-hauling equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan had another idea. He opened negotiations with the city as
early as May or June to let him use the equipment to pick up the
trash himself, his lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan declined to be interviewed and referred questions to his
lawyer, Richard Haft. Haft denied Aloyan had made any offer to sell
his company to Waste Management.</TE>
<TE>   Haft said Aloyan had told Bradley about his idea of taking over
the trash operation. "I think [Bradley] realized the city was biting
off more than it could chew," Haft said. "The mayor ... said if you
can get this through the city attorney, [convince] the bond counsel
[that] you can assume the bond, and come up with an upfront franchise
fee, then I will get behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Haft said negotiations began in late spring or summer 2000 and the
arrangement was approved by the City Council in February 2001, with a
contract that prohibited Aloyan from selling his firm. "This is not
some deal that was concocted over a drink at the mayor's house," Haft
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan's franchise allowed him to use the city's newly purchased
garbage trucks and bins. He paid Compton a $2-million franchise fee
and agreed to repay principal and interest on the bonds. No other
firms were invited to bid.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Wolcott, a municipal bond lawyer at the Orange County law
firm of Rutan &amp; Tucker, which was not involved in the Compton deal,
said it is legal to allow a private company to use equipment
purchased with low-interest municipal bonds. He said such
arrangements allow a longtime private hauler to get expensive new
equipment, while keeping fees low.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan hired two Bradley relatives to work at his new garbage
collection firm, Hub City Solid Waste.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor said, 'My brother's had a tough life,'" Haft said. "'If
you can give him an opportunity, I'd appreciate it.'"</TE>
<TE>   He said Bradley's brother, Henry, is in charge of safety. A second
Bradley relative, the daughter of Bradley's aunt, City Councilwoman
Delores Zurita, works as Hub City's government liaison with Compton,
Haft said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said that he was offended by the allegation that Aloyan
tried to sell Waste Management the city contract and that he had no
knowledge of any such offer. "How can I comment on a conversation
that at this point remains--how shall I say it--imaginary?" he said.
"I doubt that Mr. Aloyan will tell the same story."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said Waste Management could have gotten the franchise if
it had beaten Aloyan's $2-million franchise fee.</TE>
<TE>   Newell said Waste Management had offered the city $1 million as a
franchise fee in early 2000, before the consultant deal with Aloyan
was made. He said city officials immediately rejected it and, later,
never asked the firm to bid against Aloyan.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management said it faced a different solicitation in South
Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Elected City Treasurer Albert Robles repeatedly asked the firm for
campaign contributions, beginning in the 1990s, and expressed
disappointment when it did not give at all, or did not give enough,
Newell said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles is considered the most influential politician in the city,
which is northeast of Compton. When three Robles-backed council
members took control of the City Council in December 2000, council
salaries tripled, longtime employees were fired, and Robles' allies
and business associates won city contracts. Waste Management
officials said they first irked Robles nearly four years ago when he
asked them for campaign contributions and they declined.</TE>
<TE>   George Troxcil, a former South Gate police chief, recalled that a
Waste Management employee told him at the time that Robles asked the
firm to make a $25,000 political contribution. Robles reportedly said
because it did not make the contribution, it would be finished doing
business in the city. Troxcil said he reported the conversation to
the FBI. "What they did with it I have no idea," Troxcil said.</TE>
<TE>   A Robles political adversary, longtime Councilman Henry Gonzalez,
said the same Waste Management employee told him the same story at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Robles said he did not recall asking for money four years ago. As
for Troxcil and Gonzalez, he said, "You're talking to me about
statements made by my harshest political critic ... and a former
chief of police I was critical of."</TE>
<TE>   Early last year, as Waste Management's seven-year hauling contract
with the city neared expiration, Robles asked Waste Management for
campaign contributions again, Newell said.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Waste Management held a fund-raiser that raised "about
$7,000" for candidates Robles was backing, Newell said. Robles,
Newell added, "said it wasn't enough."</TE>
<TE>   Later, in March 2001, Newell said, Robles asked Waste Management
to give him another $15,000 to $20,000 to pay for a last-minute
political mailer for allies.</TE>
<TE>   Newell said a Waste Management employee initially agreed, but was
told by the company's government affairs office that it would be
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "We informed [Robles] of that," said Newell. "Initially, he didn't
really have a response. But several weeks later, he told one of our
employees: 'I came to you four years ago and you said no. I asked you
for your help again and you didn't deliver. You're out of town."'</TE>
<TE>   Robles said Waste Management should leave town or he would make
trouble for the company in other cities, the Waste Management
attorney added. Newell said the employee, whom he would not name,
reported the conversation to him soon after it happened.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, who faces felony charges of threatening other public
officials, denied making the remarks alleged by Waste Management and
said the company was being unfair. "In America, you're able to face
your accuser. So I would say, 'Waste Management, don't make
accusations into the dark. Bring out the accuser.'"</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Tom Brown, said Robles "had in the past sought
contributions from Waste Management and a variety of other waste
haulers but never made any threats to them or any promises to them."</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management lost its bid to renew its contract last year.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council eventually awarded the $4-million-a-year contract
to the Vernon firm of Klistoff and Sons, the highest bidder of the
three finalists. Waste Management was the second highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the committee that evaluated the bids said he saw no
evidence of Robles' involvement. Senior South Gate engineer Abdulla
Ahmed said the committee voted 4 to 1 against Waste Management,
citing poor service, a long list of lawsuits and an audit that showed
a corporate predecessor's subsidiary had not paid the city more than
$1 million in franchise fees.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' lawyer Brown said it was Robles who discovered the owed
fees and "got them to agree to pay it back."</TE>
<TE>   An audit report said it was "the hauler [Waste Management] that
discovered the error and brought this to the attention of the city
staff."</TE>
<TE>   Robles said if he were as powerful and corrupt as critics claim,
he would have asked the council to skip the complicated bid process
and simply name his favorite company.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Richard Marosi and Joe Mathews contributed to
this report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Paula man whose standoff with police closed Highway 101 for
four hours Wednesday night was being evaluated at a mental health
hospital Thursday for allegedly threatening suicide and stabbing
himself several times during the incident.</LD>
<LD>   At the hospital, Patrick Tovar, 46, also was being held on
suspicion of rape, child molestation and making criminal threats,
police said. He will be booked into Ventura County Jail this weekend,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Tovar was airlifted to Ventura County Medical Center about 10:30
p.m. Wednesday after leading Santa Paula police and California
Highway Patrol officers on a chase that ended near La Conchita, north
of Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   After a spike strip disabled his truck, Tovar moved to the highway
shoulder and negotiated with authorities by cell phone before SWAT
officers fired several rounds of nonlethal ammunition into the cab
and pulled him out.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Police Chief Robert Gonzales said the department had
been investigating Tovar since Tuesday, following a tip from a
resident. More charges may be filed as the investigation continues,
Gonzales said.</TE>

<HD>City Council Approves 7.8% Raise for Itself</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a formula linked to the raises given the past two years to
managers, unionized employees and police officers, Simi Valley City
Council members this week agreed to hike their own pay.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.8% increase, which does not take effect until after the
November election, will raise council salaries from $890 a month to
$959.42, or to $11,513.04 annually. The council's last pay hike came
in November 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Council members in April raised their monthly expense allowance by
the same percentage, from $375 to $404.25. Mayor Bill Davis, whose
post requires more ceremonial duties, now receives $512.05 monthly,
up from $475.</LD>
<TE>   Davis and council members Glen T. Becerra and Paul Miller are up
for reelection in November.</TE>
<TE>   When added to a benefits package--covering life, medical and
dental insurance, along with retirement contributions--council
members in the fall will receive annual salary and benefits of up to
$34,115.04, while the mayor's compensation could reach $35,408.64.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Appoints a Panel to Study Valley Landfill Issue</HD>
<DH>Trash: The group, created to mollify secession backers,
will look into alternatives to dumping at Sunshine Canyon, Bradley
sites.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Thursday appointed a 10-member
advisory committee to look for ways to send less trash--or none at
all--to the Sunshine Canyon and Bradley landfills in an effort to
placate secession supporters in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The committee will study alternative disposal methods, such as
shipping trash to desert landfills, converting garbage to energy and
boosting the city's recycling program.</LD>
<LD>   Many local residents support seceding from Los Angeles because
they resent having tons of garbage from all over the city dumped near
their homes.</LD>
<TE>   A proposal by Browning-Ferris Industries to expand Sunshine Canyon
Landfill into Granada Hills looms as a top issue in the campaign to
decide whether the Valley will form its own city.</TE>
<TE>   Wayde Hunter, president of the anti-landfill North Valley
Coalition and a member of Hahn's new panel, said the mayor's action
Thursday is a sign that Valley complaints are being heard.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition has not taken a position on secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Things seem to be moving in the right direction, and he is
involving the community," Hunter said. "How it will come out in the
end, we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council last month ordered investigators to determine
whether radioactive waste was dumped at Bradley Landfill in Sun
Valley and whether it presents a health hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn pledged in his mayoral campaign that he would seek to close
the Sunshine Canyon and Bradley landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn spokeswoman Hilda Delgado said Thursday that he stands by
that promise.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor has said over and over that everything he's doing is to
keep the city together," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgado said studying alternatives will take six months to a year.
The Valley secession proposal, however, could be on the ballot as
early as November.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hunter, citizen members of the committee are Ellen Mackey
of the East Valley Coalition, Mary Edwards of Landfill Alternatives
Save Environmental Resources and UCLA professor Rick Greenwood.</TE>
<TE>   Other members are Deputy Mayor Brian Williams; Greig Smith, an
aide to Councilman Hal Bernson; Mark Dierking, an aide to Councilman
Alex Padilla; Wayne Tsuda, a city environmental official; Barry
Breggan of the city Sanitation Department; and Dee Carey of the
city's administrative office.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of Browning-Ferris Industries, operator of
Sunshine Canyon Landfill, could not be reached for comment on the
mayor's action.</TE>
<TE>   But spokesman Arnie Berghoff has previously said that any disposal
alternative the city might choose would be "tremendously expensive."</TE>

<HD>$250-Million Deal OKd to Treat Basin's Water</HD>
<DH>Health: Firms agree to build and run plants to remove
pollution in the San Gabriel Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 20 years after contamination was found in the vast San
Gabriel Valley ground-water basin, a judge Thursday approved an
accord to provide $250 million to restore water quality.</LD>
<LD>   The San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, an agency established by the
courts to resolve the problem, said Aerojet GenCorp., Azusa Land
Reclamation Co. Inc., Fairchild Holding Corp., Hartwell Corp., Huffy
Corp., Oil and Solvent Processing Co., Reichhold Inc. and Wynn Oil
Co. have agreed to provide funding to build and operate six
water-treatment facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Carol Williams, the agency's executive officer, said the main
contaminants are perchlorate, a component of rocket fuels produced by
Aerojet during and after World War II, and volatile organic compounds
such as industrial solvents and petroleum waste.</LD>
<TE>   The basin provides about 85% of the drinking water in the San
Gabriel Valley. The basin stretches from San Dimas and La Verne on
the east to Alhambra and Monterey Park on the west, and from the
foothills of the San Gabriel Valley on the north to the Puente Hills
and Whittier Narrows area on the south. The principal area of
contamination affected by the settlement stretches about five miles
along the subterranean course of the San Gabriel River.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement was approved by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Marvin Lager after more than five years of negotiations.</TE>

<HD>CDC Recommends Yearly AIDS Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Hoping to head off a surge of infections, the government recommended
for the first time Thursday that sexually active gay and bisexual men
get tested at least once a year for the AIDS virus.</LD>
<LD>   Previous guidelines from federal health officials had been less
specific, urging doctors to recommend HIV tests for patients whose
behavior might put them at risk for infection.</LD>
<LD>   But studies conducted in the last few years have shown gay and
bisexual men, possibly lulled into complacency by medical
breakthroughs that have allowed AIDS patients to live longer, are
having more unprotected sex.</LD>
<TE>   Rates of syphilis and gonorrhea are up among gay and bisexual men
in many U.S. cities, and health officials worry those diseases signal
a coming spike in HIV and AIDS rates.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines, released by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, recommend annual screening for HIV, chlamydia,
syphilis and gonorrhea for gay and bisexual men--plus vaccination
against hepatitis A and B.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said some men in high-risk groups may need to be screened
more often.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an increase in awareness of the level of risk
behavior of men who have sex with men," said the CDC's Dr. Stuart
Berman.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines also urge doctors to ask their male patients about
the gender of their sex partners, a question CDC experts say doctors
are sometimes hesitant to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for them to provide educational messages about
what's important in terms of safe-sex behavior," said lead author Dr.
Kimberly Workowski. "A lot of times providers have reticence in
asking their patients these questions."</TE>
<TE>   The CDC updates its guidelines on sexually transmitted diseases
about every four years. They were first published in 1982, and the
last set was issued in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Among other changes in the new guidelines:</TE>
<TE>   * The CDC recommended expanded screening among women for
chlamydia, the most commonly reported STD. Women with chlamydia
infections should be tested again three to four months after they
finish treatment.</TE>
<TE>   * The agency said doctors in California should not use a class of
antibiotics called fluoroquinolones to treat gonorrhea. Strains of
gonorrhea resistant to that class of drugs have become common on the
West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Gonorrhea infections already have developed widespread resistance
to treatment with penicillin and tetracycline.</TE>
<TE>   * The CDC said nonoxynol-9, a spermicide, should not be used as a
way to prevent STDs</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Transportation Security Administration will allow smaller
airports to use private security guards rather than local police as
temporary replacements for National Guard troops, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, the security agency will deploy its own police force
at airport checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   A security directive has been sent to small airports telling them
they can use state-certified, armed private law enforcement officers,
Transportation Department spokesman Leonardo Alcivar said.</LD>
<TE>   The directive applies only to the smallest airports, and only
those where there are not enough local police available to patrol
security checkpoints, Alcivar said.</TE>
<TE>   National Guard troops, who have been stationed at the nation's 429
commercial airports since shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, will be gone by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The Guard is supposed to be temporarily replaced at airport
checkpoints by uniformed law enforcement officers.</TE>

<HD>AMA Rejects Loan for Doctors Union</HD>
<DH>Funding: The president of the group, Physicians for
Responsible Negotiation, says its money probably will run out this
summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>CHICAGO --The American Medical Assn. board has rejected a
$1.6-million loan request from its pioneering doctors union, touching
off a battle for its survival.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Mark Fox, president of the union, Physicians for Responsible
Negotiation, said Thursday that the board's move was unexpected and
"has really cut the legs off the organization."</LD>
<LD>   "Since the AMA has been our sole source of funding, at this point
it puts us in a bind," Fox said. He said the union's money probably
will run out this summer.</LD>
<TE>   Medical societies in several states have drafted resolutions
seeking to overturn the board's decision. The union's fate could be
determined at the AMA's annual meeting next month.</TE>
<TE>   The board vote came April 18 with no explanation, said Fox, who
speculated that it stems from the AMA's own financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. J. Edward Hill, the AMA board of trustees' chairman-elect,
said the rejection was based on PRN's uncertain future, suggesting
that the board doubted the union's ability to repay a loan. He
described the AMA's own finances as stable.</TE>
<TE>   "As a separate independent organization, PRN has the option of
pursuing other sources of outside funding," AMA board chairman Dr.
Timothy Flaherty said.</TE>
<TE>   The AMA formed PRN in 1999 to help give doctors more leverage
against managed care; the union is against strikes, however.</TE>
<TE>   It has more than 200 individual members and about a dozen group
members.</TE>
<TE>   Its success has been mixed, however, and two key organizing
efforts involving residents at a suburban Chicago hospital and a
group of New Jersey doctors have stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Employers in both cases are disputing the groups' right to
organize, and decisions are pending with the National Labor Relations
Board, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The union has received a little more than $2 million in loans from
the AMA since its inception. Fox said its loan request last month was
designed to keep the group afloat through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The original understanding that PRN had with the board was that
it would probably take us about five years to do enough business to
sustain us," he said.</TE>

<HD>Study Maps Varied Anthrax Samples</HD>
<DH>Science: Researchers find DNA differences, which may help
trace the source of past and future attacks. 'We've got the
know-how,' one says.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detailed DNA analysis can distinguish even very closely related
samples of anthrax, scientists were to report today, a finding that
could aid investigators seeking to trace the source of last year's
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The analysis, to be published online today by the journal Science,
compared the anthrax strain isolated from one of the Florida anthrax
victims with samples obtained from other sources. The study confirmed
that the Florida sample was derived from the so-called Ames strain
(originally obtained from a Texas cow in 1981), as has previously
been reported.</LD>
<LD>   But it also revealed that the Florida sample is not genetically
identical to all samples of Ames, narrowing the possible sources of
the microbe even further.</LD>
<TE>   The study, which scanned the entire anthrax genome for tiny
differences, could be used to create a fine-detail "anthrax
encyclopedia" that would catalog DNA variations for all known anthrax
samples, the scientists said. This could be very helpful should any
future attacks occur, allowing investigators to quickly focus on
possible sources of the spores.</TE>
<TE>   Such approaches should be aggressively pursued to catalog not only
anthrax but also other bacteria that could be used as bioweapons,
said bioterrorism expert Scott Layne, associate professor of
epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the technology to do this; we've got the know-how," Layne
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by researchers at The Institute for Genome
Research (TIGR) in Rockville, Md., and the laboratory of Paul Keim of
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Keim, a world expert on DNA
typing of anthrax, is helping the FBI with its criminal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Keim and colleagues already had developed DNA fingerprinting
methods that could distinguish many more distantly related anthrax
samples from one another. Such methods were used to confirm that the
anthrax used in the attacks was from the Ames strain.</TE>
<TE>   The current study, by analyzing the entire anthrax genome, went
further. The scientists compared a sample of the Ames strain obtained
from Porton Down in England (under study at TIGR well before last
year's attacks) with the Florida sample.</TE>
<TE>   The two genomes, although virtually identical, were found to
differ in a few places. Those differences must have accrued during
the two decades since the strain was first isolated.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists then examined five more samples of Ames, four
obtained from labs and one from a goat in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   They found, again, that some of the Ames strains were distinct
from one another. Others were identical.</TE>
<TE>   The group now plans to sequence 14 different anthrax strains and
closely related bacteria to detect similarities and differences, said
Timothy Read, assistant investigator at TIGR and lead author of the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he said, DNA differences in hundreds of anthrax samples will
be determined to build up a comprehensive anthrax catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the differences might offer clues to the microbe's
biology, such as why some strains of anthrax are especially virulent,
he said. They might teach scientists much about the historical spread
of Bacillus anthracis through the world.</TE>
<TE>   Such a catalog will have limits when it comes to fighting
bioterrorism, said Raymond Zilinskas, senior scientist at the
Monterey Institute of International Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely typing a sample of anthrax does narrow the possible
source, he said. But it does not lead directly to a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Not all anthrax differs, and it is unclear how many people have
samples of any particular strain of the bacterium.</TE>
<TE>   "DNA is not the answer to everything," Keim said. "Forensics and
eventually convictions still require good police work and supporting
evidence."</TE>

<LD>   Actress Julia Roberts, choking back tears as she described the
death of a 10-year-old girl with Rett syndrome, appealed to Congress
for $15.5 million to research the neurological disorder that mainly
afflicts young girls.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very impressive and nerve-racking," Roberts said as she
took her seat in a crowded room for a hearing of the House
Appropriations subcommittee responsible for public health spending.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually ramble, but this is important, so I'll read," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The disease, which affects about 200,000 girls and women
worldwide, leaves them unable to communicate and control body
movements and functions. Most develop severe disabilities by age 3.</TE>

<HD>Md. Governor Calls Halt to Executions</HD>
<DH>Justice: Glendening wants to study whether racial bias
affected sentencing. Second such moratorium in U.S. may last a year,
he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening on Thursday declared a moratorium on
executions in the state, pending completion and review of a study on
whether there has been racial bias in how the death penalty has been
applied there.</LD>
<LD>   Glendening, a Democrat, said he expects the moratorium to last for
about a year.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland is now the second of the 38 states with capital
punishment laws to impose a moratorium, following the lead of
Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who halted executions in 2000, after 13
death row inmates had been exonerated there, including one who had
ordered his last meal.</LD>
<TE>   Legislation to impose a death penalty moratorium is now pending in
nine other states. In addition, 72 cities, from San Francisco to
Nashville, have passed resolutions supporting execution moratoriums.</TE>
<TE>   Glendening ordered the moratorium as he granted a stay of
execution to a man who was scheduled to be killed by injection next
week for murdering a woman at a Catonsville shopping mall in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said he was granting Wesley E. Baker a stay because
the state-funded study by the University of Maryland is expected to
be completed in September and there's a "critical need to be
absolutely sure the process is fair and just."</TE>
<TE>   Glendening added that he would "stay all other cases that come
before me until the completion of the study--an examination of 6,000
criminal cases where prosecutors could have sought the death
penalty--and its reviews by the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   Glendening reiterated his general support for the death penalty,
saying that "there are certain crimes so brutal and so vile that they
call for society to impose the ultimate punishment."</TE>
<TE>   However, the governor emphasized, "reasonable questions have been
raised in Maryland and across the country about the application of
the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% of the men on Maryland's death row had white
victims, "despite the fact that 80% of Maryland homicide victims are
African American," said Glendening, who is barred from seeking
reelection because of term limits. Nine of the 13 men on death row
are African American and the other four are white. Blacks make up 28%
of Maryland's population.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Glendening noted that nine of the 13 come from just one
county, Baltimore, while only 5% of Maryland homicides occur in that
county, according to state crime figures. (Baltimore County does not
include Maryland's largest city, Baltimore.)</TE>
<TE>   That geographic disparity is a key reason why Maryland should be
examining whether it is applying the death penalty evenhandedly, said
Jane Henderson of the Quixote Center, a Maryland organization that
has advocated a moratorium in Maryland and other states.</TE>
<TE>   While Maryland has had just four executions since reinstating the
death penalty in 1978, Baltimore County had the second-highest death
sentencing rate of any county in the U.S. with 600 or more homicides,
according to a Columbia University study.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, as Baker's execution was drawing near, advocacy
groups--including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the Maryland Catholic
Conference and Amnesty International--have held demonstrations and
placed newspaper ads in a campaign to persuade Glendening to declare
a moratorium and stay Baker's execution.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a
Democrat who is seeking to succeed Glendening, said she favors a
moratorium. On the other hand, Robert L. Ehrlich, a Republican
congressman who is expected to be his party's gubernatorial nominee
in the November election, said he opposes a moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Among those praising the governor's decision Thursday was Kirk
Bloodsworth, who was released in 1993 after spending nearly nine
years in Maryland prisons, including 21/2 years on death row for a
rape and murder, before being cleared by DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel that as long as an innocent person could possibly be
put to death, we should not have the death penalty, period,"
Bloodsworth said.</TE>
<TE>   But some conservative organizations, including the
Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, blasted the move,
saying it could lead to "the needless deaths of innocent people."</TE>
<TE>   During his two terms as governor, Glendening has permitted two
executions and granted clemency once.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not have "absolute certainty" of Eugene Colvin-El's
guilt when he commuted the convicted murderer's death sentence to
life without parole in June 2000. "It is not appropriate to proceed
with an execution when there is any level of uncertainty, as the
death penalty is final and irreversible."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Glendening emphasized that Baker's stay was not based
on the specifics of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a difficult decision. My heart goes out to the families
of the victims of these horrible crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "I must, however, honor the responsibility I have to be absolutely
certain of both the guilt of the criminal and the fairness and
impartiality of the process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Brobst, assistant state's attorney in Baltimore County, said
there was no doubt that Baker murdered Jane Tyson a decade ago, as
her two grandchildren, a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl,
watched.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is black and Tyson was white. But "this case has nothing to
do with race," Brobst said. "Mrs. Tyson was targeted [for robbery]
because she was vulnerable.... Baker was caught within minutes with
her blood on his pants, and his fingerprints were on the driver's
side window of her car."</TE>
<TE>   Baker's attorneys acknowledge that Baker participated in robbing
Tyson. However, they contend that there is a doubt about whether
Baker or his co-defendant fired the shot that killed Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Baker's co-defendant was tried separately, and prosecutors,
believing that he was not the principal perpetrator, obtained a
sentence of life without parole in that case.</TE>

<HD>House Approves Big Defense Bill, Setting Up Showdown</HD>
<DH>Politics: The massive increase in military spending
includes funding of the Crusader cannon, which the Pentagon didn't
seek.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House approved a massive boost in military spending early this
morning, setting up a showdown with the Bush administration by
providing funds for the Crusader mobile cannon over the Pentagon's
objections.</LD>
<LD>   The spending bill, approved 359 to 58, calls for $383.4 billion
for the Pentagon in 2003, about $4 billion more than President Bush
sought in his February budget plan. Bush's proposed $48-billion
increase over the current year's military allocation marked the
biggest one-year jump in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1966.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the House's willingness to outspend a defense-minded
president, members invited conflict with the administration over
their inclusion of funds for the $11-billion Crusader program.</LD>
<TE>   The Army, backed by influential lawmakers, favors continued
development of the self-propelled howitzer, but Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said Wednesday that he intends to cancel it,
calling the weapon outmoded for future warfare.</TE>
<TE>   The largely internal Pentagon battle erupted into a feud between
Congress and the Bush administration Thursday, when the White House
Budget Office promised to recommend a veto if the defense
authorization bill required funding for the Crusader.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill provides $475 million for the Crusader for 2003,
and a nonbinding endorsement of the weapon system. But the bill
skirts the likelihood of a veto by including no language that would
prohibit the system's cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also includes major policy changes that would exempt the
Pentagon from environmental laws, raise military salaries by at least
4% and fund research into nuclear-tipped missiles, which could
penetrate mountain redoubts like those that have sheltered Al Qaeda
fighters in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Strict rules barred most amendments, leaving Democratic opponents
to vent their anger through a series of time-consuming procedural
votes that postponed final passage until almost 2 a.m. EDT today. Yet
the Crusader clause holds the greatest potential for a battle between
the Bush administration and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The administration wants to jettison weapons designed for Cold War
threats to free up funding for Space Age weapons such as unmanned
bombers, while Congress supports the howitzer, long sought by the
Army.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader's fate is seen from the Pentagon to the White House
to Capitol Hill as a litmus test for Rumsfeld's plan to transform the
military.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes there is a tendency in the Congress to fund military
programs that the military is not asking for," Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer said. "And this will be an important test case to see
whether Congress spends the money in any case, or whether they agree
with the experts and follow the recommendation of the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader, first proposed in 1994, is a heavy, self-propelled,
rapid-fire cannon that was to have entered service by 2008. The Army
argued that it was badly needed to replace its 40-year-old
predecessor, but critics say it is too heavy for a military seeking
to respond more nimbly and quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader has powerful supporters. It would be built by United
Defense, owned by the Carlyle Group, headed by former Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly plant is in Elgin, Okla., a state that is home to
some of the project's strongest advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma GOP Sens. James M. Inhofe and Don Nickles are expected to
press for the Crusader in the Senate, as Rep. J.C. Watts Jr.
(R-Okla.) has in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Inhofe has vowed to save the program he calls the "crown jewel" of
Army weapons, but will face strong opposition from Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Armed Services Committee, refining its version of the
bill behind closed doors for a second day, postponed its decision on
whether to require Crusader funding until next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over the Crusader has already split Army brass and
their Pentagon superiors. Defense analysts say it has further
imperiled Army Secretary Thomas E. White, a retired general already
under fire for his ties to Enron Corp. and for his use of Pentagon
planes while on personal business. Rumsfeld this week said White, who
has been a vocal supporter of the Crusader, retains his confidence.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon inspector general's report is expected to blame
mid-level Army staff, rather than White, for trying to save the
system over Rumsfeld's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   As they pressed for the Crusader, House members planned to act
later on an additional $10-billion fund to pay for costs related to
the war on terrorism. They also added other funding the Bush
administration didn't ask for.</TE>
<TE>   That included an extra $17.4 billion to replace aging aircraft and
other weapons and equipment--$3.2 billion more than President Bush
requested.</TE>
<TE>   Among the congressional add-ons were 12 new H-60 helicopters for
the Army National Guard, 10 JPATS training aircraft for the Navy, six
TH-67 "Creek" training helicopters, $96 million for engine upgrades
to F-15 and F-16 aircraft and more than $1 billion in Navy
shipbuilding increases.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also boosted National Guard and Reserve funding by
$450 million, or 17%, beyond the Bush team's budget request.</TE>
<TE>   House members approved an amendment by Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.)
allowing research and development of nuclear-tipped "bunker buster"
missiles. It was assailed by critics such as Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), who sought to bar funding for the missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "What the House has done is move the most destructive weapons ever
invented back into the mainstream of American security policy," said
John Isaacs of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington-based
arms control organization.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents argued that the missiles serve as a deterrent. "Nuclear
weapons are useful precisely because they are unusable," said Rep.
Heather Wilson (R-N.M.).</TE>
<TE>   The House voted to give the Pentagon exemptions to two major
environmental laws--the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act--without debating the issue or voting on it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would free the military from permits and record-keeping
requirements of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act when birds are killed
or harmed during exercises.</TE>
<TE>   It would also exclude military bases that already have management
plans to protect endangered plants and animals from having their
territory designated as critical habitat for these species by the
Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear if the Senate version included the exemption from
environmental laws.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Wayne County prosecutor said Thursday that his office is opening
investigations of 16 priests suspected of sexual misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   The Archdiocese of Detroit last week gave prosecutor Mike Duggan's
office files containing allegations by 50 people against 37 priests.</LD>
<LD>   Duggan said the statute of limitations is expected to be an
obstacle in most of the cases. The cases go as far back as 1943, and
all but two involved incidents from at least 10 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   At least 15 Roman Catholic priests in Michigan, including six in
the Detroit archdiocese, have been removed, suspended or have left
their duties since Jan. 1 amid sexual abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 37 priests identified in archdiocese files,
three other priests have been named by people who directly called the
prosecutor's office to make accusations.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said the archdiocese is cooperating with
investigators.</TE>

<HD>Material Found in Va. Studied for 9/11 Links</HD>
<DH>Crime: Flight manual, photo of men at trade center are
among items in visa scheme inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI is trying to determine whether a batch of suspicious material
found at the home of a fraud suspect in northern Virginia--including
a federal flight manual, a drawing of the World Trade Center and a
date book with Sept. 11 marked--could be linked to last year's
terrorist attacks, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The material surfaced as part of a federal investigation that this
week led to the arrests of 58 foreign students who were allegedly
involved in a scheme to generate fraudulent English-proficiency exams
in order to secure student visas.</LD>
<LD>   As part of that investigation, authorities seized a batch of
suspicious items from the home of one of the suspects in northern
Virginia, apparently in December. That material, as first reported by
the Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va., and confirmed Thursday by an FBI
official, included a Federal Aviation Administration flight manual, a
hand-drawn sketch of a plane hitting one of the twin towers, and a
date book that contained just a single entry--for Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   The entry, in poor spelling, said: "Trackd the World Trade Center
or the Pentagon trackd for the plaen."</TE>
<TE>   The items have piqued the interest of investigators for obvious
reasons, but the FBI official cautioned that investigators believe at
least some of the material was collected after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   However, another item seized as part of the investigation was a
photograph of men posing inside and outside the World Trade Center,
"and obviously that was taken before 9/11," the official said.
Officials did not identify any of the men in the photo.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what any of this means by itself," the official
said. "We're trying to figure that out, but it's certainly enough to
attract some interest and for us to pursue. It's just too early to
draw any conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also suspects that one of the individuals implicated in
this week's student visa arrests may have had connections to someone
who helped several of the hijackers rent an apartment at an
undisclosed location, a law enforcement source said. But the source
cautioned that this connection appears somewhat tenuous and the
suspicious material seized in the searches may turn out to be
relatively insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have linked only one individual in the United
States--French Moroccan Zacarias Moussaoui, now awaiting trial on
conspiracy charges in Alexandria, Va.--to the planning of the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators say the 19 hijackers were a remarkably
well-insulated group, minimizing their contacts with outsiders and
even among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   However, authorities have not ruled out the possibility that there
remain others in the United States with links to Osama bin Laden and
his Al Qaeda terrorist network who may have knowingly assisted in the
plot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continuing to look at that possibility, and whether any of
these guys may still be out there and what threat they pose," the FBI
official said.</TE>

<HD>White House Hopes Plan of Succession Stays Unused</HD>
<DH>Government: The Bush administration's new contingency
measures in case of a catastrophe carry added urgency after the Sept.
11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Uncle Sam's latest doomsday scenario is out. And it's nothing short
of a bureaucratic pecking order that may be unlike any in the history
of the republic.</LD>
<LD>   To ensure the continuity of government in the post-Sept. 11 era,
the White House detailed the line of succession Thursday for numerous
federal departments and agencies, reaching down in the ranks well
below top management.</LD>
<LD>   For example, if all the senior executives at the National Archives
and Records Administration were to suddenly die or become
incapacitated--including the five assistant archivists and the heads
of the Federal Register and the National Personnel Records
Center--the director of the Jimmy Carter Library in Atlanta would
take over as the agency's head.</LD>
<TE>   The lists were required by the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.
But the task took on new urgency after the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush White House disseminated succession lists late last year
for a handful of federal agencies and departments.</TE>
<TE>   But in releasing new or updated lists for a dozen government
bureaucracies on Thursday, it called fresh attention to the
contingency plans to keep the government running--presumably after
some catastrophic attack on Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an ongoing effort," said White House spokeswoman Claire
Buchan. "There will probably be more to come."</TE>
<TE>   To a degree, the heads of each department or agency have some
discretion in determining the precise line of succession, Buchan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Their decisions no doubt will provide much fodder for discussion
and speculation within their agencies.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, at the Treasury Department, if Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill and his deputy "died, resigned or otherwise become unable to
perform," the next in line are the fiscal assistant secretary, the
chief of staff, the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and
the commissioner of the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   At Justice, those in line to succeed Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft,
Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson and Associate Atty. Gen. Jay B.
Stephens are the U.S. attorneys for the southern district of New
York, the eastern district of Virginia, Utah, and the western
district of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   No explanations accompanied the listing.</TE>
<TE>   There is no uncertainty or discretion, of course, when it comes to
presidential succession, which is spelled out in the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   After the vice president comes the speaker of the House and the
president pro tem of the Senate, which is a largely ceremonial office
held by the oldest senator in the party that controls the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The House speaker is Republican J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois; the
Senate's president pro tem is Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, President Bush has taken a number of precautions
to ensure government continuity--including occasionally dispatching
Vice President Dick Cheney to undisclosed locations to minimize the
time that both men are at the White House at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Without fanfare, Bush also has created what amounts to a "shadow"
government, staffed by a rotating group of officials representing key
departments and agencies who work at an undisclosed location away
from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A similar precaution, which pre-dates Sept. 11, is taken during a
president's State of the Union address to a joint session of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, virtually every top federal government official,
including members of the Supreme Court, attends the speech.</TE>
<TE>   But one member of the president's Cabinet is kept away from the
Capitol.</TE>

<CX>   Federal succession-A story in the A section Friday on the expanded
succession plans at federal agencies misstated that process. A full tier
of senior managers in each agency must be exhausted before the newly
added officials would take over. At the Treasury Department, for
instance, the secretary and deputy secretary would be succeeded by three
deputy undersecretaries (in the order of their swearing-in), the general
counsel and the 10 assistant secretaries. The newly added successors
would follow this group.</CX>

<HD>Judge Seals File of Missing Florida Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: Media request for access is denied for fear of
hurting the inquiry into her case. Her state agent didn't know for 15
months that she was gone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A judge refused to immediately open the state child-welfare agency's
file on a missing 5-year-old girl Thursday but promised to make it
public upon completion of a police investigation into her
disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-Dade County detectives had argued that the investigation
would be seriously compromised if the file from the Department of
Children &amp; Families were released, as at least six news organizations
had requested.</LD>
<LD>   The top priority should be finding Rilya Wilson, then going after
whoever took the girl, Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman said.</LD>
<TE>   "We all hope and pray that she is safe and she is alive," Lederman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Kearney, head of Florida's Department of Children &amp;
Families, also refused this week to immediately release case records
on the girl to Gov. Jeb Bush's blue-ribbon panel, appointed to
determine how Rilya could vanish from state custody and be missing
for 15 months before officials noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Before reading Rilya's file, the panel will have to sign a
confidentiality agreement and promise to keep the contents of the
file secret, Kearney said. Bush wants an interim report from the
panel by May 20.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never, ever be perfect. Ever," said Kearney, who took
over the department in 1999. "I accept full responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Kearney's department reported Rilya missing April 25, long after
losing contact with the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Rilya was an infant in 1996 when the state placed her in the care
of Pamela Kendrick, whom the child's mother had met while dating
Kendrick's nephew.</TE>
<TE>   "I was with her for the first three years of her life," Kendrick
said in an interview Thursday with Associated Press. "I made it
possible that she could have a normal life, because I cared for her
as my own."</TE>
<TE>   Rilya was removed from Kendrick's home on April 17, 2000. State
officials investigated allegations of abuse there in 1998 involving
other children, but the inquiry was dropped, records show.</TE>
<TE>   After being taken from Kendrick, Rilya lived with Geralyn Graham,
who has identified herself as the girl's grandmother. Graham said she
last saw Rilya in January 2001 when someone claiming to be a
caseworker took her.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are treating Rilya's case as a possible homicide.</TE>
<TE>   A DNA test is being conducted to determine if a girl found
beheaded in Kansas City, Mo., in April 2001 is Rilya, but Kendrick
said Thursday that she doesn't believe it is the same child. Rilya's
ears were pierced when she was 8 months old, she said. Kansas City
Police Sgt. Dave Bernard said Thursday that the child found there did
not have pierced ears.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking the files in court Thursday were lawyers for the Orlando
Sentinel, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, the Tampa Tribune, CNN,
"Dateline NBC" and WTVJ-TV, NBC's affiliate in South Florida.</TE>

<HD>U.S. History Barely Passed</HD>
<DH>Education: High school seniors can't say what happened
when. Earlier grades fare a little better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's high school seniors are all but clueless when it comes
to understanding essential truths about America's past, according to
test results released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   To many of them, the Boston Tea Party, the Civil War and World War
II are dimly understood events from a foggy past.</LD>
<LD>   And that is particularly worrisome in a post-Sept. 11 climate as
Americans are being forced to defend their values and country,
educators said.</LD>
<TE>   A 2001 U.S. history test that's part of what's known informally as
the "Nation's Report Card" found that fewer than 15% of fourth-,
eighth- and 12th-graders were "proficient" in history, which
officials say should be the goal for all students. The data also
showed that American students are weaker in history than in math,
reading or science, the other subjects tested.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of fourth-graders and a slightly smaller
percentage of eighth-graders possess at least a "basic" knowledge of
history, which is a slight improvement from 1994, when the national
history test was last conducted. But only 43% of American high school
seniors could demonstrate even a "basic" knowledge level, according
to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.</TE>
<TE>   Shown a depiction of the Boston Tea Party, only 35% of
fourth-graders knew that it led to the American Revolution and only
51% of fourth-graders were aware that differing views about slavery
in the South and the North was a cause of the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation of the nation's founders in adding the Bill of
Rights to the Constitution (fear that the new government would deny
civil liberties) was correctly identified by only 54% of
eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   Less than half of high school seniors (48%) knew that the Soviet
Union was a U.S. ally in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to defend--intelligently and thoughtfully--what we as
a nation hold dear depends on our knowledge and understanding of what
we hold dear," said Diane Ravitch, a prominent historian and a member
of the NAEP advisory board. "That can only be achieved through
learning the history we share, and clearly far too many high school
seniors have not learned even a modest part of it."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige said the questions that
"stumped so many students involve the most fundamental concepts of
our democracy, our growth as a nation and our role in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The test was given to a nationally representative sample of 29,000
students in the three grades.</TE>
<TE>   Educators blamed many factors for the weak showing. Some said the
nation's focus on raising test scores in reading and math has led
many elementary school teachers to give short shrift to history.
Others said that many teachers' own knowledge of history is weak and
that few resources are devoted to professional development. According
to the National Center for Education Statistics, 54% of high school
history teachers neither majored nor minored in history in college.
That's the highest percentage of teachers teaching beyond their
expertise of any subject except physics.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Zepeda, a Van Nuys teacher who won a $1-million federal
grant to improve history instruction in Los Angeles, said the poor
test scores reflect the "low priority" it gets from policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   Since freshmen show up without a foundation in history, high
school teachers have to start from scratch. "School districts,
administrators and education reformers have placed such a great
emphasis on English language arts and math it seems that's the only
thing they care about," Zepeda said. The history test was designed to
measure students' understanding of the broad themes that have shaped
the nation rather than specific names or dates. The fact that many
students graduate from high school unable to do either is obvious to
college professors saddled with teaching beginning courses.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA history professor Gary B. Nash questioned the validity of
the NAEP test. He noted that biographies of such Revolutionary War
figures as John and Abigail Adams are bestsellers, the History
Channel is popular and 700,000 middle- and high-school students a
year complete in-depth research projects for National History Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are absorbing an awful lot more, the textbooks are better
and they're teaching at a higher level than when I was in high school
50 years ago," Nash said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "I'm not sure we should even expect 18-year-olds
to remember dates and facts and names and places if there's no
practical use for that knowledge."</TE>

<HD>47-Mile-Long Iceberg Breaks Off Antarctica's Ross Shelf</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An iceberg 47 miles long and 4.6 miles across has broken off the Ross
Ice Shelf in the Antarctic, the National Ice Center reported
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The giant sheet of glacial ice and snow was named C-18, meaning
that it's the 18th iceberg to be tracked in that section of
Antarctica since 1976, when record keeping began.</LD>
<LD>   The iceberg, floating close to the ice shelf, is not considered a
hazard to navigation. It was spotted on satellite images.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery comes just less than a month after a much larger
iceberg--40 miles by 53 miles--broke away from another part of
Antarctica. Also in March, a large floating ice shelf in Antarctica
collapsed. The 1,250-square-mile section of the Larsen Ice Shelf
collapsed during a five-week period that ended March 7.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, however, new measurements indicate the ice in parts of
Antarctica is thickening, reversing earlier estimates that the sheet
was melting.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Step Up Oversight of Student Visa Program</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The federal crackdown on foreigners will
require schools to monitor their activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, chastened by how easily some of the Sept. 11
hijackers used student visas to wander the country, has worked out a
plan to keep foreign students on a tighter leash and require schools
to monitor their activities from the day they arrive, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is set to announce today,
would require U.S. colleges, universities and vocational schools to
overhaul their monitoring of foreign students by January or else stop
accepting them altogether, administration sources said. That is an
earlier deadline than many college administrators had expected.</LD>
<LD>   The foreign market is a major one for U.S. schools, with about 1
million overseas students now in the country, and many educational
institutions have been reluctant to take on an expanded role in
tracking their students' activities.</LD>
<TE>   But major academic groups have grudgingly dropped their opposition
to the concept in the fallout over the Sept. 11 hijackings, helping
to break a political logjam that has blocked efforts to reform the
student visa system since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the student monitoring system is happening, whether
we like it or not--and some of our members like it more than others,"
said Victor Johnson, public policy director of NAFSA, an association
of international educators based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules would take effect after a 30-day public comment
period. The bulk of the plan requires no congressional action.</TE>
<TE>   The student visa overhaul comes just days after the White House
announced plans to screen as many as 2,000 visa applications a year
from foreign students who wish to study areas of technology
considered sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   Some civil rights advocates accuse the Bush administration of
pushing increasingly xenophobic policies toward foreign students, but
law enforcement officials said Thursday that the reforms are a
necessary element of eliminating vulnerabilities in U.S. security.</TE>
<TE>   "The interests of the schools were taken into account here, and
they are supportive of our approach," said a senior Justice
Department official who asked not to be identified. "Everybody is on
the same page here with respect to the desire to maintain the rule of
law on student visas, and the schools are going to have to do their
part."</TE>
<TE>   The plan to be announced by Ashcroft and Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar would create a
massive Internet-based tracking system to replace an "antiquated,
paper-driven system," according to administration sources who asked
not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   It would also expand the body of information that schools would
have to collect and give to the federal government through the new
automated system, requiring schools to tell the INS if students
change addresses, face disciplinary or criminal problems or drop out
of school, among other data, officials said. Some of this information
is already kept by schools on paper, but it is turned over to the INS
only rarely and "upon request," the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Flight training schools, attended by several of the 19 terrorists
in the months before Sept. 11, are among those educational
institutions that would be affected by the new monitoring rules.</TE>
<TE>   The flaws in the current system became a major embarrassment to
the INS in March, six months after the hijackings, when the agency
notified a Florida flight school that it had approved student visas
for terrorist pilots Mohamed Atta of Egypt and Marwan Al-Shehhi of
the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet-based monitoring is aimed at ensuring that foreigners
in the United States on student visas actually show up at school.
Under the current system, said an administration official who asked
not to be identified, "they can simply disappear, and we may never
know what happened to them."</TE>
<TE>   While the new system will not be foolproof, "this will greatly
enhance the system to make sure that people who enter on student
visas are here legally and remain here legally," the senior Justice
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We currently do not have a system of centralizing the information
that schools collect, and that's how Mohamed Atta and Al-Shehhi,
utilizing the student visas, were able to exploit the system," the
official said. A third hijacker, Hani Hanjour, was also in the
country on a student visa for a Bay Area English-language school but
never showed up for classes.</TE>
<TE>   Schools will have to begin reporting information on new students
to the INS by Jan. 30, 2003, with existing students phased in after
that, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department plan effectively ends a debate that has
raged for years over how closely U.S. schools should monitor foreign
students in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Following the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993,
members of Congress began calling for a more effective system to
track those who enter this country on student visas. Yet even after
Congress approved the measure in 1996, progress stalled as
universities raised various concerns, including worries about how to
administer the fees.</TE>
<TE>   But the political opposition to a modern tracking system collapsed
Sept. 11, setting the stage for an array of new controls over foreign
students in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The plan announced by the White House earlier in the week for
screening foreign scientists, for instance, is aimed at deterring
foreigners from collecting data at U.S. universities that could help
them build nuclear and other weapons.</TE>
<TE>   And last month, the INS said it would tighten the rules on student
visa applications, barring foreign scholars from enrolling in U.S.
schools unless they had already obtained their student visas, a
change known as the "Atta rule." Atta and Al-Shehhi entered the
United States as visitors and were then allowed under existing
regulations to enroll in the Florida flight school while their
student visas were pending--more than a year before their approval.</TE>
<TE>   The varied reforms "add up to a mixed picture," said Johnson, the
NAFSA official.</TE>
<TE>   Educators said Thursday that, while they support the goal of the
foreign student monitoring program, they are concerned they might not
be able to meet the January deadline for implementing it. Many said
they are eager to see details of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at some schools and universities thought they would
have until well into next year to finish the job and said they are
uncertain how much money it will take for schools to get up and
running by January.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different problem whether you have 200 foreign students or
you have 2,000 foreign students," Johnson said. "What a lot of
schools are nervous about is what is their deadline for compliance
going to be and are we going to be able to meet it."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Hartle, vice president of the American Council on Education
in Washington, said that implementing a new monitoring program "is
the single best thing the federal government can do to ensure better
tracking of foreign students, and we're eager to work with them in
that."</TE>
<TE>   Hartle, whose group represents the nation's top 1,800 colleges and
universities, said "our concern is that the INS will move at such a
pace that they implement a system that isn't really ready.... This is
being done on a crash basis."</TE>
<TE>   Leo Van Cleve, director of international programs for the
California State University system, which has 15,000 foreign students
on its 22 campuses, agreed that rushing wide-scale changes into
effect could detract from a key mission.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Rebecca Trounson and Stuart Silverstein in Los
Angeles contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>We Can Live Far Longer, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Science: Life expectancy keeps increasing steadily and
might not have a limit, researchers find. Skeptics question the
math--and the biology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humans are far from a limit on life expectancy, if one even exists,
according to a new statistical analysis of increases in longevity.</LD>
<LD>   The finding challenges the widespread assumption that life
expectancy, which increased rapidly in the United States and other
countries during the 20th century, will level off close to current
records, said James Vaupel, lead author and director of the Max
Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   "I think there must be a limit out there, somewhere, but we're
nowhere near it," added Jim Oeppen, a co-author of the study and a
demographer with the Cambridge Group for the History of Population
and Social Structure in England.</LD>
<TE>   The two researchers compared the countries that held the record
for longest life expectancies for women: New Zealand until 1950,
Norway until the 1980s and Japan until the present.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, they found, the life expectancy of women in the
country holding the record increased by three months per year. The
rate of increase has been steady for the last 160 years and shows no
sign of slowing, they found. For men, the increase was smaller--just
under three months--but just as steady. The research is published in
today's issue of Science.</TE>
<TE>   Vaupel said people have always assumed there is a limit to life
span.</TE>
<TE>   "You can trace it right back to the Bible, three score and 10
years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers have predicted that life expectancy would
continue to rise but at a decreasing rate. The new work, however,
indicates that life expectancy increases should remain steady into
the future.</TE>
<TE>   "The increase in record life expectancy has been so linear it's
likely to continue," Vaupel said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Lee, professor of demographics at UC Berkeley and an
advisor to the Social Security Administration, described the trend as
"striking."</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to force me to change how I look at things
somewhat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, disputed the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's regularity only within a very limited time frame," said Jay
Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University
of Chicago in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   "They have chosen the period of time in the past 130,000 years
during which life expectancy rose the fastest (i.e., the 20th
century), and simply extended that trend indefinitely into the
future," Olshansky said in an e-mail response to questions about the
study.</TE>
<TE>   From Roman times until 1850, life expectancy hovered around 40 to
45 years, he said. And as life expectancy increases it becomes more
difficult to increase it further.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a far different ballgame going from 80 to 83 than 50 to
53," Olshansky said.</TE>
<TE>   Vaupel's model does not take into account the various biochemical,
biomechanical and demographic forces that affect life expectancy,
Olshansky added.</TE>
<TE>   "They have used mathematics and statistics to look at a phenomenon
that is inherently biological," he said. "All they are looking at is
the mathematics of the phenomenon. They are completely ignoring the
biology."</TE>
<TE>   To calculate life expectancy, actuaries and demographers use
mathematical models of death rates at different ages to predict how
long people born in a specific year can be expected to live. For
average life expectancy to increase to 100, more than half the
population would have to live beyond that age.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists have proposed maximum limits on human life
expectancy in the last 80 years. Some populations usually exceeded
these caps on human life expectancy within five years of the limit's
announcement, Vaupel said.</TE>
<TE>   Vaupel and Oeppen said that what some researchers have observed as
a leveling of life expectancies is really a game of catch-up. Some
countries experience rapid increases as they approach the life
expectancy of the country in the lead and the leaders fall behind.</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of the 20th century, advances in the
treatment of infectious diseases increased the number of young people
who survived to old age, increasing life expectancy. But the
three-month increase continued in the latter half of the century as
well, with improvements in life expectancy for people older than 65.
This age group typically died of chronic diseases such as cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "The spectrum of diseases people died from shifted dramatically,
but nevertheless every year on average about three months is added to
life expectancy," Vaupel said. "The diseases have changed but the
general pace of progress has stayed the same."</TE>

<HD>Navy Chief Says Osprey Tests Resuming</HD>
<DH>Military: 'We've made dramatic progress' since the V-22 was
grounded, Secretary England says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>All technical and management problems with the V-22 Osprey aircraft
project have been corrected, and the hybrid helicopter-airplane is
ready to resume flight testing, Navy Secretary Gordon England said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We've made dramatic progress in the last six or nine months,"
England told reporters. "All of the problems with the program are
fixed."</LD>
<LD>   The V-22, which was grounded in December 2000 after two
catastrophic crashes, is often mentioned as being vulnerable to
cancellation as the Pentagon looks for long-term savings. England,
however, said the Marine Corps needs the V-22, and he expects it to
prove its worth in flight tests.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very comfortable with the program going forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the top civilian in the Department of the Navy, England
oversees both Navy and Marine Corps programs.</TE>
<TE>   Flight tests of the Osprey are scheduled to resume this month,
although no date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey has the unique ability to take off like a helicopter,
rotate its propellers 90 degrees and fly like an airplane. Each V-22
costs about $89.7 million, and the total cost of the program is $40
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps hopes to use the Ospreys to replace its aging
fleet of Vietnam-era helicopters, which are considerably slower and
louder. The Marines were in the midst of testing the V-22 to prove it
is suitable for the mission for which the aircraft was intended when
the crashes happened.</TE>
<TE>   Four Marines were killed in December 2000 when their Osprey
crashed and burned in woods near Jacksonville, N.C., on the way back
from a training flight. A crash in Arizona in April 2000 killed all
19 Marines aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The new tests will focus on combat maneuverability, low-speed
hovering and the ability to fly off ships. The tests also will focus
on "vortex ring state," a phenomenon that led to the aircraft's
descending too quickly. The Arizona crash was blamed on such a
condition.</TE>
<TE>   England said he has an open mind about the V-22's future.</TE>
<TE>   "If it does not demonstrate that it can do the mission for the
Marine Corps, then we will stop the program. It's that simple. If it
demonstrates, then we should continue because it is a significant
capability for the ... Marine Corps."</TE>

<HD>Crews Battle Fire on N.M. Reservation</HD>
<DH>Blazes: More than 650 acres are charred on Indian lands as
hot spots are doused in national forest blaze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PECOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters put out hot spots left by an 800-acre wildfire in Santa
Fe National Forest as crews in western New Mexico battled an
out-of-control blaze on a Navajo reservation.</LD>
<LD>   The fire east of Santa Fe had forced 300 people to evacuate and
engulfed hundreds of acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
Firefighters had it 70% contained Thursday, and residents were being
allowed back into their homes, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "The winds were really gusting and eddying around the canyon, but
the lines withstood everything the winds threw at us," fire
information officer Jim Whittington said.</LD>
<TE>   No homes burned and no fire-related injuries were reported.
Investigators want to question two men seen jumping into a
sport-utility vehicle near where the fire started.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook was not as good Thursday for a fire in the Chuska
Mountains that had charred more than 650 acres on the Navajo
reservation about 30 miles south of Shiprock.</TE>
<TE>   Fire information officer Chadeen Palmer said the fire exploded
from 40 acres to 500 acres in two hours Tuesday, and shifting winds
helped it grow Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of spotting and flaring," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several families in Toadlena, on the Navajo reservation, evacuated
their homes because of the smoke. Seventeen families and 25 students
from a boarding school in the area had been evacuated Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the community was not immediately threatened,
firefighters feared that winds could drive flames through the area.
Firefighters also were trying to protect the tribe's fish hatchery
watershed.</TE>
<TE>   The fire flared from a campfire Monday, said fire information
officer Calvin Becenti. He said charges were pending against the
person who started the campfire.</TE>
<TE>   In southern New Mexico, a 15,400-acre forest fire in the
Sacramento Mountains was contained Thursday. The fire had been
accidentally started April 30 by a man who later committed suicide,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Another fire, which burned 200 acres near Conifer, Colo., and
chased about 2,400 people from their homes, was contained Wednesday
evening.</TE>
<TE>   Five boys and a 14-year-old girl have been charged in Colorado in
connection with three separate wildfires that forced thousands of
people to flee over the last two weeks.</TE>

<HD>Moxley's Diary Talks of Skakel Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A friend of Martha Moxley read entries from Moxley's diary Thursday
as prosecutors detailed the days before the teenager was beaten to
death with a golf club.</LD>
<LD>   In the entries, Moxley discussed pool-hopping, parties and
informal gatherings at the family home of Michael Skakel, the Kennedy
cousin accused of killing her on Oct. 30, 1975. At one such
gathering, Moxley wrote, Michael Skakel was "out of it" and behaving
like "an ass."</LD>
<LD>   "I really have to stop going over there," she wrote in one entry
read by Jacqueline Wetenhall O'Hara.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel--a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel--and Moxley
were 15 when she was killed near the Greenwich homes.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley also wrote that Skakel's older brother, Thomas, had flirted
with her several times. Prosecutors have said both brothers were
romantically interested in Moxley.</TE>
<TE>   During defense lawyer Michael Sherman's cross-examination of
O'Hara, he suggested the prosecution was trying to establish a motive
for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you attach anything unusual to the behavior of the teens back
then?" Sherman asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," O'Hara replied.</TE>
<TE>   James Lunney, a Greenwich detective at the time of the killing,
testified that he had seen a golf club in the Skakel home that
appeared similar to the murder weapon.</TE>
<TE>   He said he returned to the Skakel home the day after the slaying
and obtained permission from Skakel's father to search the house. The
murder weapon was traced to a set of golf clubs owned by Skakel's
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony was expected later Thursday from Kenneth Littleton, a
live-in tutor to the Skakel children who had moved in the day Moxley
was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Littleton was once considered a suspect, and the defense has
claimed he made incriminating statements in the years after the
slaying. The judge has not yet decided whether Sherman can enter
those statements as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Sherman questioned forensic expert Henry Lee, who
said he found no direct evidence linking Skakel to the killing
through DNA taken from semen, blood or material found under Moxley's
fingernails. But he said there was indirect evidence of a link.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a retired Greenwich police chief testified that he
unsuccessfully sought an arrest warrant in 1976 for Thomas Skakel.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Keegan, who at the time of Moxley's murder was a captain in
charge of the investigation, said prosecutors rejected the request
because there was not enough evidence to establish probable cause.</TE>

<HD>Mothers of Sons Lived Shorter Lives, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"My son will be the death of me yet."</LD>
<LD>   That familiar lament by mothers everywhere may have a kernel of
scientific truth, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   A study of family church records in earlier centuries found that
having sons shortened the life span of Finnish mothers by about 34
weeks per son. Daughters nurtured to adulthood helped prolong
mothers' lives.</LD>
<TE>   Baby sons, researchers suggest in the journal Science, make a much
greater physical demand on the mother's body than do typically
smaller daughters, and this may actually lead to a shorter life for
the mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Boys are usually born much heavier than girls," said Samuli
Helle, a researcher at the University of Turku in Finland and the
study's co-author. "It seems that boys are much more demanding to
produce than girls."</TE>
<TE>   Helle said the study looked at a nomadic people called the Sami
during the period 1640 to 1870. He said the toll of having sons may
not apply today.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays we have better medical care," Helle said. "Resources are
not as likely to limit females' life span. There might be some
effect, but it will not be as huge as in the Sami people."</TE>
<TE>   Helle and his co-authors used the records because of their
accuracy and because they gave a measure of mortality before advanced
medical care.</TE>
<TE>   The study concentrated on women who produced children and then
went on to live past age 50.</TE>
<TE>   "You can actually cancel the negative effect [on life span] of one
boy by producing about three girls," said Helle. "The girls stayed in
their natal group for quite a long time. All the children had a great
influence on their parents' lives, but the girls had a more positive
effect than the boys."</TE>
<TE>   The Sami were a nomadic people who followed the migration of
reindeer. They led a hard life, but they were very successful, said
Helle. Infant mortality in the group was very low, so there was "no
need to ... replace those who died at an early age," he said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Sides Agree on 'Fast-Track' Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democratic and Republican negotiators announced Thursday that they
had cleared obstacles to Senate passage of a bill granting President
Bush greater authority to negotiate international trade agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Central to the agreement is a package of expanded benefits,
including a 70% federal health insurance subsidy, for qualified
workers who lose jobs in domestic industries hurt by foreign
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans also agreed to roughly double the number of workers
eligible for the program known as "trade adjustment assistance."
Overall, the worker aid provisions would cost $10 billion to $12
billion over 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   In exchange for those GOP concessions, Democratic negotiators
agreed to drop demands for a costly federal subsidy of retirement
benefits for steelworkers and certain restrictions on Mexican
trucking in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The accord was reached by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Charles E.
Grassley (R-Iowa), Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and John B. Breaux (D-La.),
and had the blessing of the Senate majority and minority leaders.
Senators also said the White House was pleased with the progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an agreement," Baucus told reporters. He called the
worker assistance provisions "a huge improvement over current law."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement means that the Senate is likely to move within a
week on a major priority for the Bush administration and the business
community: a bill granting the president "trade promotion authority."</TE>
<TE>   That authority, also known as "fast-track," would permit Bush to
negotiate trade deals subject to congressional approval on an
up-or-down vote with no amendments.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate will package the worker assistance deal with the trade
promotion bill and a third bill to promote open trade with Colombia,
Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   The trade debate in the Senate has been stalled since the House
narrowly approved its own version of trade promotion authority in
December. After Senate passage, which now seems almost certain, the
two chambers will have to reconcile their differences and vote one
more time before a bill can be sent to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Most labor unions and environmental groups oppose the trade
legislation, arguing that it fails to protect workers' rights and
weakens environmental protections worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans praised Thursday's breakthrough, which would give
Bush an authority held by every president since Gerald R. Ford in
1974. The authority lapsed in 1994, however, and then-President
Clinton tried to regain it.</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Lose 14th Consecutive Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Torre knows what the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are going through.</LD>
<LD>   "It's no fun," the Yankee manager said after Orlando Hernandez
gave up only one hit and pitched into the eighth inning, and New York
sent the reeling Devil Rays to their 14th consecutive loss with a 3-1
victory Thursday night at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "You go to sleep at night as a manager trying to figure out what
you can do to relax your team. Obviously you can't tell them, 'Don't
pay attention to what's happening.' Tonight, I thought they played
well and had a well-pitched game. But they ran into Duque, and that
was the problem."</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez, who gave up one run in 72/3 innings, improved to 8-1
lifetime against the Devil Rays. Mariano Rivera worked out of a jam
in the eighth, then finished the three-hitter for his 225th career
save, breaking a tie with Dave Righetti for the franchise record. It
was Rivera's 10th save of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's losing streak matches the longest in the major leagues
since 1988. The Baltimore Orioles began that season by dropping an
American League-record 21 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs also lost 14 in a row April 1-20, 1997. The Devil
Rays are the first AL team to lose 14 in a row since the Milwaukee
Brewers--now in the NL--did it in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays have scored three runs or fewer 11 times during
their losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, Oakland 1--Jose Offerman and Shea Hillenbrand homered to
lead the Red Sox to their ninth consecutive victory and a three-game
sweep of the Athletics at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Lowe (5-1) won his fourth consecutive decision, giving up
one run and six hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox (24-7), who have the best record in baseball, are off
to their best start since going 25-6 in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 8, Toronto 7--Mike Cameron drew a bases-loaded walk from
Corey Thurman in the 11th inning to give the first-place Mariners a
victory at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners scored three runs in the ninth to send the game into
extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Cleveland 3--Mike Sweeney homered twice and Joe
Randa hit a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning as the Royals
rallied to win at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals scored three runs in the eighth after the first two
batters were retired.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 4, Chicago 1--Fill-in starter Joaquin Benoit pitched six
innings for his first career victory and Hector Ortiz homered for the
first time in the victory at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Benoit (1-0), who replaced an injured Ismael Valdes, gave up one
run and four hits.</TE>

<HD>Angels Proving They Aren't History in West</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels' start this season was the worst in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   On April 23, they were 6-14 and many baseball observers wondered
if they had blown any chance to contend in the American League West
with the defending champion Seattle Mariners and the Oakland
Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   But after defeating the Detroit Tigers, 7-6, on Thursday night
before 15,003 at Edison Field, the Angels moved over .500 for the
first time in a month and into second place in the AL West, a
half-game ahead of the A's.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels, who trail the Mariners by 61/2 games, have won 11 of
13.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to be in first but it's definitely a good step from
where we were two weeks ago," Angel shortstop David Eckstein said.
"If we just keep building on that, we'll be happy where we're at."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won despite another less-than-stellar outing by Aaron
Sele, who spotted the Tigers a 4-0 lead after four innings.</TE>
<TE>   Sele (3-2) won his third consecutive decision despite giving up
nine hits for the third straight outing. Sele, coming off consecutive
wins over the Toronto Blue Jays, gave up four runs and hit two
batters in six innings against the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up runs on a sacrifice fly by Randall Simon and a single
by Shane Halter in the first inning, a double by Damian Jackson in
the second and single by Jacob Cruz in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaron battled," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He still
hasn't hit stride, what we're looking for, but we know he'll get
there."</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we win, who cares?" said Sele, who has a 5.75
earned-run average. "It's not the perfect blueprint but you just try
to make quality pitches in tough situations. Tonight, they hit what I
thought were really good pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus had a two-run double, Julio Ramirez had a two-run
triple and Darin Erstad, Bengie Molina and Garret Anderson also drove
in runs for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival pitched the ninth and earned his fifth save,
his second in as many nights.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth
inning Wednesday night, delivered a two-run double in the fifth
inning against Tiger starter Mark Redman (0-4) Thursday that gave the
Angels a one-run lead after trailing, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   He also started double plays in the fourth and fifth innings when
the Tigers had a chance to turn the game into a rout.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth, Wendell Magee led off with a single and moved to
third on Craig Paquette's double down the left-field line. Cruz
singled up the middle to put the Tigers ahead, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Inge, the Tigers' catcher and No. 9 hitter, then hit a
ground ball to Glaus' left. Glaus extended his left arm to field the
ball, then fired a bullet to second baseman Jose Nieves, who threw to
Scott Spiezio at first to complete a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Sele then got Jackson to pop out to Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels pulled to within 4-3 in the home half of the inning
when Molina drove in a run with a sacrifice fly to right and Ramirez
followed with his two-run triple off the right-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus kept the Angels within a run with another solid defensive
play in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Fick led off with a single and moved to second one out
later when Sele hit Simon with a pitch. Glaus thwarted a potential
big inning, however, when he fielded Halter's ground ball, stepped on
third and threw to Spiezio for an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   That set the stage for the Angel fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein started the rally with a one-out walk, and Erstad
advanced him to third with a single to right. Glaus, who had hit fly
balls to right field in his first two at-bats, hit a shot along the
third-base line that got past Paquette and scored both runners to put
the Angels ahead, 5-4. Glaus moved to third base when the throw to
the plate got past Inge, and he scored when Anderson followed with a
deep fly ball to center field.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added another run in the seventh when Nieves led off
with a single, moved to second on a wild pitch and advanced to third
on a bunt single by Eckstein before scoring on Erstad's sacrifice fly
to center field.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed the cushion when the Tigers scored twice in the
eighth.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>He Hasn't Lost Sight of What's Important</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One reason Kevin Appier is finding success in his first season with
the Angels is because he has yet to feel lost.</LD>
<LD>   At least, that's what the veteran right-hander said Thursday, the
day after another strong performance. Appier gave up two runs and six
hits and struck out four in seven innings, but did not figure in the
decision Wednesday night when the Angels defeated the Detroit Tigers,
3-2.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had to make some subtle adjustments but I haven't gone
through a major stretch where I'm totally lost out there, which can
happen," said Appier, who was acquired in a trade for Mo Vaughn in
December. "I just keep working on drills in the bullpen to keep that
consistency going."</LD>
<TE>   Appier, 34, is 3-1 with a 2.83 earned-run average. His
scoreless-innings streak ended at 172/3 when he surrendered a
run-scoring single to Robert Fick in the sixth. It was the longest
such streak by an Angel starter since Chuck Finley went 191/3 innings
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hitting spots, throwing a good slider and curveball,"
catcher Bengie Molina said. "He's been doing it all year."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Appier has given the Angels exactly
what they anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had one tough start; other than that he's been everything he
was billed as, plus," Scioscia said. "I think he's a great example of
a pitcher who has kind of gone through a metamorphosis. His stuff
isn't what it was 10 years ago but he's made adaptations that keep
him at peak production."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Donne Wall, on the disabled list since April 29 because
of tightness in his right arm, threw a light bullpen session and will
throw again Saturday before beginning a rehabilitation assignment,
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall is eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Utility man Benji Gil, out since April 6 because of a sprained
ankle, took ground balls, and Scioscia said he hopes Gil can begin a
rehabilitation assignment next week.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been out long enough that right now he's in a spring
training mode," Scioscia said. "We'll elevate his workload slowly to
get him to peak."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten, who tore ligaments in his right thumb
during spring training, will be examined today and is hoping to
receive medical clearance that will allow him to take batting
practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three people were hospitalized and 12 others were treated at
Edison Field after a stadium escalator malfunctioned and began moving
at three times its normal speed after Tuesday night's game against
Detroit, Angel spokesman Tim Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred on the Gate 4 terrace-level escalator, Mead
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three people taken to UC Irvine Medical Center suffered
a broken leg or ankle, Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   The escalator remained shut down Thursday while stadium personnel
investigated the cause of the incident, Mead said.</TE>

<LD>The Akron Beacon Journal reports that in a sports world cluttered
with Panthers, Tigers and Wildcats, it's nice to see a little
originality in high school sports nicknames.</LD>
<LD>   A sampling: "Hoopeston Area (Ill.) Cornjerkers--Nickname dates to
the 1920s when students would jerk corn from stalks before attending
class in the morning. And, yes, jerking is different than husking.</LD>
<LD>   * "West Plain (Mo.) Zizzers--There is no such word. When the
National Federation of High Schools inquired about the nickname, they
were told, 'It's just a word a teacher came up with a long time ago.'</LD>
<TE>   * "Glenville Tarblooders--The nickname honors the hard-working and
proud citizens of the Cleveland neighborhood who used to haul tar
from the tar pits to the railroad tracks."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which team holds the NBA record for turnovers in a
playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Trojan ace: Pete Aldrich in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "USC
baseball player Bill Peavey might want to try out for the Trojans'
golf team. In a recent victory at Washington State, Peavey homered
twice--with the second long ball bouncing onto a golf course near
Bailey-Brayton Field.</TE>
<TE>   "When a Washington State manager went to retrieve the ball,
golfers showed him that it landed in one of the cups on the putting
green."</TE>
<TE>   No they didn't: First baseman David Segui returned to the
Baltimore Oriole lineup recently, still unsure about the status of
his injured left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "If it blows out, it blows out. Somebody will be there to fix it.
They put Humpty Dumpty back together again, didn't they?"</TE>
<TE>   His standards: In Marty Ralbovsky's 1976 book, "The Namath
Effect," Joe Namath describes being recruited out of high school: "I
went to Notre Dame, and I nearly had a heart attack when I found out
they didn't have women [the first were admitted in 1972].</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'There's a girls' school across the lake.' I said,
'Man, I don't swim after my women.'"</TE>
<TE>   Wah, wah! The Maple Leafs' penchant for criticizing officials drew
criticism from the Toronto media.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Toronto Star hockey columnist Damien Cox: "Under the
guidance of Pat Quinn, the Leafs have gained the reputation as
hockey's most unrelenting whiners, a group that starts bellyaching as
soon as they get to the rink if their cafe lattes aren't warm
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, Atlanta knuckleballer Hoyt
Wilhelm became the first pitcher to appear in 1,000 major league
games.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Chicago Bulls, 36, in a game at Portland on
April 17, 1977.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban usually wears a
T-shirt and jeans to games to show he's "one of the people," says
Norman Chad in his column for America Online.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see--he bought a 24,000-square-foot home in Dallas for $15
million. He bought Gulf Stream 5, the fastest corporate jet in the
world, for $41 million on the Internet. And he bought the Mavericks
for $280 million. But, hey, I just might see him standing in line in
front of me at Target this weekend, with a coupon for the 42.2-oz.

<DH>Dodgers: Three-run shot against Ashby, his second home run
of series, is key to Braves' 6-2 victory, as they avoid a sweep.</DH>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Brian Jordan and Odalis Perez had their shining moments in two Dodger
victories here, so it seemed fitting that Gary Sheffield took center
stage in the final game for the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   The three main players in the clubs' off-season trade were under
the spotlight in a three-game series at Turner Field, punctuated
Thursday night by Sheffield's three-run home run that helped the
Braves salvage a 6-2 victory before 23,930 after a 41-minute rain
delay.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield capped a successful series for him, breaking a 2-2 tie
in the third with a 423-foot blast to left-center against Andy Ashby
(2-3) for his fifth homer and second of the clubs' first series this
season.</LD>
<TE>   Ashby rebounded after struggling early--having also given up Vinny
Castilla's two-run homer in the second after being staked to a 2-0
lead--but it was too late with the Dodger offense still not producing
much.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield again delivered the type of timely hit that prompted the
Braves to pay a steep price to acquire the six-time All-Star, and
they're confident their investment will continue providing big
returns.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting to the point where I feel like every time I'm up
there I can hit a home run," said Sheffield, batting .228 with 14
runs batted in and still slowed by a left wrist injury he suffered in
the Braves' first series of the season against the Philadelphia
Phillies. "When I feel like I don't have to swing at anything, I can
wait on my pitch. More times than not, I'm going to hit it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my approach from here on out. I'm going to stick with the
basics, you know, just swing at strikes. When I do that, I'm a good
hitter."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are familiar with the show.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball that [Ashby] threw to Sheff was a sinker that he was
trying to run in close to him," Manager Jim Tracy said. "The ball
ended up leaking back out over the plate just a little bit. It can't
leak out over the plate just a little bit to Gary Sheffield, be in
that thigh area and not get hit hard.</TE>
<TE>   "He mis-located a pitch, not by a lot, but when you're dealing
with Gary Sheffield you don't have to mis-locate a pitch by a whole
lot and he's going to hit it hard. I've seen him do it time and time
again, both in the uniform that he wears and out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby offered a similar assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The one to Sheff was supposed to be down and in, off the plate a
little bit, and it was more or less right down the middle," said the
right-hander, who gave up six hits--including two of the Braves'
three homers--and five runs in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make a mistake in that situation to Sheff. The guy is
swinging the bat good, and if you make a mistake he's going to take
advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones provided an insurance run in the eighth against Omar
Daal with his sixth homer, capping the scoring in rookie left-hander
Damian Moss' first major league victory.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (1-0) worked five innings, and relievers Albie Lopez, Darren
Holmes and John Smoltz combined to pitch four scoreless innings in
ending the Dodgers' road winning streak at five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We got beat with the home run ball tonight," Tracy said. "Three
of 'em, as a matter of fact, and that's all there is to it."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield's was the biggest.</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff batter Rafael Furcal got the Braves started in the third
with a bunt single. Keith Lockhart then singled through the hole at
short vacated when Cesar Izturis broke to cover second with Furcal
running.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Sheffield. He was the first of Ashby's seven strikeouts in
the first inning, but he won their second battle.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we just want to play well as a team," Sheffield said of
the focus on the trade during the series. "I'm not getting caught up
in what goes on around us; we just want to focus in on this team and
get ourselves healthy and playing well.</TE>
<TE>   "We know when we're healthy the damage is going to come. Once that
starts, we're going to have a little more fun."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Dodgers are eager to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make trades, you're very hopeful that the trade benefits
both sides," Tracy said. "We gave up a great hitter, so when you give
up a great hitter you don't expect peanuts in return. You expect
something back. We're very pleased with what we got back."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Braves Knew Perez Might Make It Big</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves were reluctant to include left-hander Odalis Perez
in the Gary Sheffield trade, but Sheffield is one of the game's top
run-producers so they agreed to the Dodgers' price.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves are not second-guessing themselves despite Perez's hot
start, saying the deal is working out well for both clubs. Of course,
Perez's performance has been an unexpected bonus for the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew he was going to be a good pitcher and a good starter,"
Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. "Odalis has a good fastball
and a great changeup, which gives you a chance to be a good starter
in the big leagues.</LD>
<TE>   "But when you've got a chance to get somebody like Sheffield,
you've got to give up somebody good. We gave up two good ones [Perez
and left fielder Brian Jordan]."</TE>
<TE>   Perez is 4-1 with a 1.66 earned-run average after shutting down
the Braves in Wednesday's 3-1 victory at Turner Field. He ranks among
the National League leaders in most categories, and has limited
opponents to a league-low .164 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   What's the key to Perez's success?</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a tough situation here, and the big thing for him now
is that he's starting on a regular basis," Mazzone said. "For a lot
of young pitchers, when you have the starting rotations that we've
had in the past, and the standards that you have to live up to, it
can be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he's starting on a regular basis now is going to
make all the difference in the world in how much more consistent he
becomes. I'm happy for Odalis. He's a good kid."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne suffered his only blown save in 12 chances
Tuesday when Sheffield hit a ninth-inning, two-out, solo homer to
force extra innings in a game the Dodgers won, 6-5, in 16 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success against Gagne, Sheffield believes the
right-hander will be a dominant closer for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the perfect mentality," Sheffield said. "He's got that
I-don't-care attitude. He just throws it up there and says, 'Here it
is, hit it,' and that's how most [successful] closers are. They're
not afraid to throw their fastballs and get strike one, and it
doesn't surprise me that he's doing what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he was a good pitcher [even] when he was struggling [as a
starter]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green was not in the lineup because his left hand was still
swollen after Tom Glavine hit him with a pitch in the sixth inning of
Tuesday's game. X-rays of Green's hand were negative and he is
expected to play today in the opener of a three-game series against
Florida.</TE>

<HD>Pros Get Uniform Standards on Drivers</HD>
<DH>Golf: Ruling organizations agree to limit clubs'
spring-like effect, but there are long-range concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golf's ruling organizations finally came to an agreement of
principles that would limit the spring-like effect of drivers, but
instead of ending the often acrimonious four-year-old debate about
modern equipment, there's a chance it's all going to blow up again.</LD>
<LD>   The United States Golf Association and the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf
Club announced a compromise Thursday on rules governing the
coefficient of restitution (COR), commonly known as the trampoline
effect. While commissioners of the PGA Tour and the European Tour as
well as leading clubmakers such as Callaway and TaylorMade hailed the
new equipment rules, it is not clear how at least one part of the
agreement will play out when it comes into effect in 2008.</LD>
<LD>   The coefficient of restitution is a measurement of the energy
retained when the club head strikes the ball.</LD>
<TE>   In essence, the statement of principles calls for rules changes in
three stages.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Jan. 1, 2003, there will be an 0.860 COR limit for
players worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Also beginning Jan. 1, 2003, professional players on the major
world tours will be limited to drivers with an 0.830 COR.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 1, 2008, all golfers will face the same 0.830 COR limit as
the pros.</TE>
<TE>   What this means is that amateurs who used legal drivers for years
would suddenly find them nonconforming and these players would be
held to the same standards as professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a driver soon to be outlawed doesn't make a lot of sense,
but that should not be considered surprising in what has been a
confusing, protracted battle between golf's ruling hierarchy and
equipment heavyweights.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA imposed an 0.830 COR in 1998, but the R&amp;A decided against
any restrictions, thus setting up two sets of rules for legal
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of uniform standards led to such unusual circumstances as
Callaway's ERC II forged titanium driver being a nonconforming club
in the U.S. on the PGA Tour, but perfectly acceptable for use at the
British Open.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a victory for golf," said Ron Drapeau, president and
chief executive at Callaway Golf.</TE>
<TE>   Mark King, president at TaylorMade, said the company will roll out
a new R500 driver at the 0.860 COR limit in August. The cost: $499.</TE>
<TE>   At PGA Tour headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., there was
general relief that the USGA and the R&amp;A took some action on the
equipment-technology issue, but Commissioner Tim Finchem suggested it
may not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tour is hopeful that [they] will be successful in capping
allowable golf ball distance at current levels," Finchem said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   According to the USGA and R&amp;A, it took 18 months to come up with
the agreement on drivers, so don't expect them to take the air out of
the golf ball anytime soon.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem's Ex-Owner Will Sue</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Reineman wants half of $1-million bonus
Kentucky Derby winner earned from Chicago track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell Reineman, who sold War Emblem about three weeks before he won
last Saturday's Kentucky Derby, said Thursday that he plans to sue
Sportsman's Park, the suburban Chicago track that is embroiled in a
dispute over a $1-million bonus.</LD>
<LD>   Reineman, 84, claims that he deserves $500,000 of the bonus
because he owned War Emblem when the colt won the Illinois Derby at
Sportsman's on April 6.</LD>
<LD>   The bonus went to any horse who won the Illinois Derby and one of
the Triple Crown races.</LD>
<TE>   Sportsman's, which will receive the $1 million within 30 days from
an insurance company that guaranteed the bonus, is hoping that
Reineman and Ahmed Salman, the Saudi Arabian prince who bought 90% of
War Emblem for $900,000, will reach a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "My lawyers think that I should get the whole thing," Reineman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Papiano, a Los Angeles attorney who represents Salman's
Thoroughbred Corp., said that Reineman has a weak case.</TE>
<TE>   "Without pre-judging this," Papiano said, "I can't see the merit
to his argument.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales contract, which I believe was drawn up by [Reineman],
is clear in assigning all rights, titles and interests in the horse
to my client. As for suing the track, I've looked at the bonus rules,
and nothing jumps out at me.</TE>
<TE>   "The horse wouldn't even have run in the Derby if he hadn't been
sold. [Reineman] was planning to run the horse in the Preakness."</TE>
<TE>   The Preakness is likely to have a full field of 14 horses at
Pimlico on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Besides War Emblem, other Derby holdovers are Proud Citizen
(second), Perfect Drift (third), Medaglia d'Oro (fourth), Request For
Parole (fifth) and Harlan's Holiday, the Derby favorite who finished
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   They will probably be joined by Booklet, Crimson Hero,
Easyfromthegitgo, Equality, Magic Weisner, Menacing Dennis, Sunday
Break and U S S Tinosa.</TE>
<TE>   There are also a few horses who might run if defections enable
them to move in off the earnings lists that determine the field.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the jockey change on Medaglia d'Oro--Jerry Bailey
replacing Laffit Pincay Jr.--another switch has Pat Day taking over
for Jorge Chavez on Booklet, whose last race was a second-place
finish behind Harlan's Holiday in the Blue Grass.</TE>
<TE>   Day, who has won the Preakness five times, one less than Eddie
Arcaro, rode four winners at Churchill Downs Wednesday, his first day
back after breaking his nose in an early race on Derby day.</TE>
<TE>   Day's mount, Dream Run, bobbled at the start of the Churchill
Downs Handicap, and in recovering slammed the jockey in the nose.</TE>
<TE>   Day rode the rest of the card, including an 11th-place finish
aboard Blue Burner in the Derby, and was aboard the winners of the
last two races on the card.</TE>

<LD>Less than three weeks into Hollywood Park's spring-summer meet,
trainer John Sadler is nearly halfway to matching his win total at
the corresponding season here in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   When Palmeiro, who is now a gelding, posted a rare victory in
Wednesday's seventh, it gave Sadler five victories from his first 13
starters, opposed to 12 wins from 88 starters for the meet last year.</LD>
<LD>   After missing with his only runner Thursday, Sadler will try to
improve upon his winning percentage when Hollywood Park returns to
its normal Friday 7 p.m. post when he sends out Standard Choice in
the first and Sombrio in the second.</LD>
<TE>   A gelded son of Chimes Band, Standard Choice will be making his
first start for the stable and does not have the healthiest of
patterns. Claimed for $40,000 out of a disappointing third as the
favorite March 31 at Santa Anita, Standard Choice returns against
$25,000 maidens tonight and he will be trying a distance of ground
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Clifford Pierce, the California-bred will break from the
rail in the 11/16-mile race and will be ridden by Victor Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza also has the mount on Sombrio, who will be making his
turf debut in the second when he takes on five other 3-year-olds in a
$62,500 claimer at 51/2 furlongs. The gelding has a win and a second
in two starts and will be running for the first time since Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   He will break from the outside and is obviously proven fresh.</TE>
<TE>   He broke his maiden at first asking on New Year's Eve, winning by
11/2 lengths at nearly 20-1.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Tradition Rocks, a fast-working son of 1997
Breeders' Cup Mile winner Spinning World, will make his debut for
trainer Bob Baffert and owners Pam and Marty Wygod in tonight's sixth
at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Paul Aguirre. The trainer had two winners on Wednesday
with Morning Wine and longshot firster Let's Face It.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Antonio Castanon and Jim Burns. The two riders began
the new week at Bay Meadows a combined one for 63.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Crowning Point and Pool
Music in the fifth, Tradition Rocks, Brief Message and Jive At Five
in the sixth, singling Top Honours in the seventh and using Mon
Petite, Craven Cottage and Lilac Storm in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/30. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $26.20/$163.60. Total money bet: $206.</TE>

<HD>They Need Kobe to Give Them a Shot</HD>

<LD>Kobe Bryant made the shot last year that all but finished the San
Antonio Spurs, the three-pointer near the end of Game 2 that appeared
to convince them their summer was near.</LD>
<LD>   In this postseason, however, Bryant has had to do without his jump
shot, one of the reasons the Spurs and Portland Trail Blazers have
been able to collapse so effectively on Shaquille O'Neal. In five
playoff games, Bryant has made 39.6% of his field-goal attempts and
30% of his three-pointers. He is better overall against the Spurs,
shooting 46.5%, but has missed each of his five three-point tries.</LD>
<LD>   No problem, Bryant has said. He's not a jump shooter. But, he
said, his jumper is coming.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, he gave me a holler today from down the street," Bryant
said, laughing. "I saw it today, around the corner. He said, 'I'm
here if you need me. I'll page you tomorrow.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laker bench, such as it is, was outscored by the Spurs'
reserves, 30-18, in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Malik Rose scored 10 points for the Spurs in Game 1 and Antonio
Daniels scored 14--in 20 minutes--in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not supposed to happen at home," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said. "You're not supposed to have fewer free throws at home, either.
That's one of the maxims of NBA basketball. When that happens, you
know you have to analyze a little of what happened with your bench."</TE>
<TE>   In the series, Robert Horry has averaged 7.5 points and 7.0
rebounds in 29.5 minutes. Devean George has not shot well in the
series, but Brian Shaw has made four of seven three-pointers. Jackson
has barely looked at Lindsey Hunter, Slava Medvedenko or Mark Madsen,
and Mitch Richmond hasn't played a minute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between fretting about the way his team has played for
the last few weeks and accepting that there's no real harm done yet,
Jackson recalled the words of past playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "A good player I once coached said the playoffs don't begin until
you lose the first game," Jackson said. "I think that's a pretty
honest evaluation. Until you lose a game. Until that time, you're
just out there playing. When the pressure gets on you, that's what
it's all about, the pressure of playing in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The player?</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher, on leaving the thoughts of a sweep behind: "It's
more of heavyweight fight this time that maybe is going to go the
distance."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher then called the three-peat "the hardest thing to do in
professional sports."</TE>
<TE>   "We accepted that challenge when this thing started," he said.
"Losing [Tuesday] doesn't change that. If it takes 26 games to do it,
that's how many games we're going to be physically ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won nine consecutive playoff games on the road, an
NBA record that includes two in San Antonio last year.... Along with
his stitched forefinger and arthritic toe, O'Neal apparently suffered
a very slight sprain of his left ankle. Team officials do not expect
it to be a hindrance tonight.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: As struggling Lakers try to figure out why
shots aren't falling, O'Neal takes shot at Jackson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Fox, basketball wise and world savvy, pondered for several
seconds a question that touched both arenas.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone could see the results of five playoff games, four that
the Lakers had played poorly and won, one that they had played poorly
and lost.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone could see that Shaquille O'Neal had exhibited moments of
dominance, that Kobe Bryant had enjoyed possessions of uncommon
grace, and that the rest, Fox among them, had helped sometimes.</LD>
<TE>   But now the Lakers were headed to San Antonio, with their most
critical game since Game 2 of the last NBA finals ahead of them, tied
1-1 in the Western Conference semifinals. Tim Duncan had just
observed that the media had declared the Lakers "immortal," which
probably was an overstatement, but that the Spurs had not.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs, too, that O'Neal is unhappy with Phil Jackson,
either for Jackson's midweek request for more activity from his
center, or because Jackson went public with that conversation, which
Jackson called "heated."</TE>
<TE>   On his way from the team's practice facility Thursday, O'Neal was
asked about his health, including a mildly sprained left ankle, a new
ailment. He told an Associated Press reporter, "Ask Phil. He knows
everything."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal often uses similar language when angry with Jackson, most
recently in November, when Jackson fined O'Neal for missing two
practices while attending the birth of his daughter. He then accused
Jackson of talking too much.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship has been fine since. Indeed, O'Neal often has
threatened to retire if Jackson were to leave the organization. The
coach's contract has two more seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the Spurs were gaining confidence and the Lakers' was
slipping, and David Robinson's back was getting stronger while O'Neal
was hurting, from his shooting forefinger to his jumping toe to his
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   So, Fox was asked, Why? Why now?</TE>
<TE>   He paused and looked to the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   "You're wondering whether or not San Antonio is responsible or we
are," he said. "Looking at ourselves, knowing what we do and what the
execution of our game plan is supposed to look like, we are
responsible in the sense we've dug ourselves a hole the last two
games in the first half due to a lack of following through with our
game plan. You have to give San Antonio credit for taking advantage
of that. Other teams haven't taken advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I know how it feels today. We haven't had a feeling like
this for a long time in the playoffs. It's not a sweet taste. We're
faced with a team now that will play two games at home, where it
plays well, where we have to go and compete."</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is tonight at the Alamodome. The Lakers practiced nearly up
to the moment their charter flight departed LAX on Thursday. They
lifted weights and paced through instructional drills for an hour on
the floor, then watched film, all as Jackson was dictating
instructions. And all along with the sense that anything short of a
split--Game 4 is set for Sunday--could foreshadow the end of their
season, well short of their third consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd much rather be up, 2-0," said Bryant, on a day most of the
players left practice without talking to reporters. "We could easily
be down, 0-2, right now. So, we just go up there and deal with the
situation at hand and do our best."</TE>
<TE>   They are pretty sure they haven't done anything close to their
best yet. After another regular season cloaked in complacency, the
Lakers have been uninspired in the playoffs. Their offense has almost
completely left them. Not even a gritty defense can make up for an
offense scoring 85.5 points a game against the Spurs, 16 points off
the regular-season average.</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * Bryant shot only two free throws in Game 2. The Lakers have had
five fewer free throws than the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   * Compared to the regular season, O'Neal's scoring is down nearly
five points. Bryant's shooting percentage, rebounds and assists all
are down.</TE>
<TE>   * The Lakers are committing more turnovers and dispensing fewer
assists--more than four a game--than in the regular season, and they
are allowing more offensive rebounds, even though opponents are
taking fewer shots. The Lakers also are taking eight fewer shots a
game.</TE>
<TE>   It is, by all accounts, a bad time for them to be playing their
worst basketball of the season. They got through Portland on a couple
of decent halves and one very large three-pointer by Robert Horry,
and have put two good quarters together against the Spurs only once,
the third and fourth on Tuesday, but only after trailing by 16. In
four first-half quarters against the Spurs, they have scored 13, 19,
21 and 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have no real answers, either, or simply aren't offering
them.</TE>
<TE>   "You people forget that it took an overtime for us a couple times
last year in the playoffs, one against Sacramento," Jackson said
earlier in the week. "You don't go through all these games blasting
opponents out of the water.... There are going to be struggles.
They're hotly contested games. We know we're not playing great
basketball. We're not saying we can't play better, but we're not
downgrading what San Antonio's doing. They're having a big part of
what's happening to us."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson added that he's not totally surprised by the laborious
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure on a team to succeed, to win three in a row, and the
whole countdown to the back-to-back-to-back activity we're involved
in has been a year-long watch for us," he said. "There's a good
reason we're amped up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "To be smacked around like we were Tuesday, we realize
it's time to accept the challenge. The challenge has been laid down."</TE>

<LD>It has been a long while since someone was better than Ricky
Carmichael over a full season of motocross riding.</LD>
<LD>   The talented 22-year-old from Havana, Fla., rolls into Glen Helen
Raceway this weekend, fresh from his second consecutive championship
in the AMA/EA Sports supercross series. He is also the two-time
defending champion in the AMA/Chevy Trucks U.S. motocross
championship series, whose title he begins defending Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Suzuki rider Travis Pastrana, Kawasaki's Ezra Lusk and Stephane
Roncada, Honda's Sebastien Tortelli, Nathan Ramsey and Mike La Rocco,
and Yamaha's David Vuillemin and Tim Ferry, who won the event last
year, will be looking to defeat Carmichael, who seems nearly
invincible these days.</LD>
<TE>   Suzuki rider Kevin Windham, who broke his leg during the
supercross season, is unlikely to ride.</TE>
<TE>   Lauded as the successor to Jeremy McGrath, who won seven
supercross titles, Carmichael has emerged strongly after two years of
struggle in supercross, the closed-arena version of motocross, when
he made the move into the 250cc class.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely feel I took it to the next level, and this year some
of the other riders stepped it up, too," Carmichael said of the
supercross season that ended Saturday in Las Vegas, where he won for
the 11th time in 16 events and finished with 356 points to
Vuillemin's 321. McGrath, with 250 points, was strongly challenged
for third place in the series by Lusk with 245 and Roncada with 232.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two seasons, Carmichael has won 25 of 32 supercross
events. Before winning the two 250cc motocross titles, Carmichael won
three consecutive titles in the 125cc class.</TE>
<TE>   "I generally feel more comfortable outdoors, so we'll see what
happens," Carmichael said. "I hope it goes as good as supercross
did."</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael, who has won seven AMA titles to tie Ricky Johnson and
Jeff Ward, won his championships a year ago on a Kawasaki but this
season is riding for Honda.</TE>
<TE>   Though he wasn't quite as dominant as he was a year ago in the
supercross series--he crashed in the season opener--he was happy with
his bike's performance.</TE>
<TE>   He also likes what he has seen this week in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The bike is really fast, horsepower isn't an issue," Carmichael
said. "It handles well too."</TE>
<TE>   In the 125cc class, James Stewart, the 16-year-old prodigy being
hailed as the next Carmichael, won last weekend's 15-lap East/West
Shootout at Las Vegas by 10 seconds over Australian Chad Reed, 19,
who won seven of eight races in the Eastern Regional series. More
amazing is that Stewart's fastest lap time on a 125cc Kawasaki was
only .06 of a second slower than Carmichael's fastest lap, which was
the fastest of the 250cc field.</TE>
<TE>   Though Stewart's propensity for crashing and coming back through
the field made for great theater in supercross, it cost him the
Western Regional title.</TE>
<TE>   However, Stewart finished the season with two clean rides and won
those races easily. He could be just as dominant Sunday. Of course,
Reed hopes to have something to say about that. Stewart has won 11
consecutive amateur titles, two more than Carmichael, all outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Speedway</TE>
<TE>   In their heyday, speedway motorcycles raced five nights a week in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   It was hardly a return to the past, but there was speedway racing
last week in Victorville on Sunday, at San Bernardino on Wednesday,
and at Costa Mesa on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   According to Brad Oxley, the promoter and a former rider at Costa
Mesa Speedway, it's the first time three tracks in Southern
California have raced in the same week since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   If Oxley, Charlie Venegas and Dukie Ermolenko have their way,
that's the future of the sport. Venegas and Ermolenko also are former
riders turned promoters.</TE>
<TE>   Venegas ran 17 events last season at National Orange Show's
Arrowhead Motor Speedway in San Bernardino. He is running 25
Wednesday night programs this year. He recently drew nearly 1,000
fans, about twice what Ermolenko attracted at his first event at
Wheel2Wheel Stadium at the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds in
Victorville. Racing begins in earnest there on June 9 with the first
of 10 events running every other Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from two years ago, when Oxley was announcing that
speedway could be in its final year in Orange County after more than
30 years because of a dispute with the fair board. That dispute was
settled and a sport that seemed near extinction in Southern
California is on the upswing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's super encouraging, but it's not enough to just open
a track," said Oxley, whose Costa Mesa facility is in its 34th season
and attracted 6,500 to its Spring Classic. "The proof is to keep it
going. It's a big nut to crack.</TE>
<TE>   "I think speedway's back, and if you talk to our riders, they'll
tell you speedway's back. But you don't really have a sport until you
have a couple of tracks in different markets. If it's just at Costa
Mesa, then it's just a curiosity. I think these [other promoters]
will give the whole sport legitimacy if they can hang in there."</TE>
<TE>   The new tracks are distinct. Orange Show is extremely wide, based
on the configuration of old Ascot Park, with several racing lines;
the Victorville track is a 220-yard banked oval.</TE>
<TE>   Venegas said San Bernardino will be the site of Round 1 of the AMA
U.S. National Speedway Championships on Aug. 14. By August, he
anticipates crowds of more than 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ermolenko, who teaches speedway riding though his Speedway
Academy, has some grand long-range plans, with seven-man team racing
at the local tracks, or a NASCAR-style touring series, "with an
18-wheeler that has 20 speedway bikes on it, and another 18-wheeler
with the memorabilia in it."</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing</TE>
<TE>   Raul Boesel has been named the replacement driver for Southern
California native PJ Jones, who suffered a fractured vertebra in a
crash Tuesday during practice for the Indianapolis 500. Jones, an
Indy 500 rookie, was driving for Team Menard because Alta Loma driver
Jaques Lazier had suffered a fractured vertebra in a crash last month
in Nazareth, Pa. Jones is expected to miss six weeks. Lazier may be
sidelined for six months.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR</TE>
<TE>   When Ricky Rudd starts the Coca-Cola 600 on May 26--his 656th
consecutive start--he will break Terry Labonte's record. In his last
year under contract driving a Robert Yates Ford, Rudd said this week
that he is considering retirement at the end of the season because of
the toll a 36-race schedule takes on his family, and the direction
NASCAR has taken with its lucrative television contract, in
particular, the series focusing on the series' younger drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with the youth movement, I really don't," Rudd
told the Associated Press. "But I've seen, with this TV deal, older
guys getting ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "I see some of the things that have changed with the TV deal, and
it makes me think NASCAR has sold its soul to the devil. They are
massaging this thing to target a certain crowd and before you know
it, they'll have us up there flexing and in bathing suits like we're
professional wrestlers."</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Late models, super trucks, grand American modifieds and MODIFIED
4s will race Saturday at Irwindale. In celebration of Mother's Day,
some of the proceeds will go to the Cecilia Gonzalez De La Hoya
Cancer Center at White Memorial Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway will have figure-8 races during its Saturday
show, along with street stocks, cruisers and champ trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia-based Team Walker Motorsports dissolved last month, but
its driver, Sean Woodside of Saugus, raced at Stockton last week on
his own dime and finished ninth, moving into second place overall in
the NASCAR Southwest Series.</TE>
<TE>   American Honda rider Nicky Hayden won twice last weekend at Sears
Point Raceway in the AMA Chevy Trucks U.S. Superbike Series.</TE>
<TE>   Kawasaki riders Chris MacClugage of Irvine and South African
Dustin Motzouris finished 1-2 after two rounds at Ventura in Pro

<HD>Duncan Wins Close MVP Race</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Antonio Spur forward Tim Duncan edged New Jersey Net guard Jason
Kidd for NBA most-valuable-player honors Thursday in the
fifth-closest finish since the media began voting in 1981.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan received 57 first-place votes and 954 points from a panel
of 126 sports writers and broadcasters, while Kidd drew 45
first-place votes and 897 points.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal was third with 696 points.</LD>
<TE>   The MVP award "was kind of a goal I had in mind," Duncan said. "It
puts a top on the season that we had."</TE>
<TE>   The 57-point gap was the smallest since Karl Malone beat Alonzo
Mourning by 54 after the 1998-99 season. The closest margin was in
1989-90, when Magic Johnson beat Charles Barkley by 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan set personal bests in scoring average (25.5 points) and
rebounding average (12.7) while leading the Spurs to the Midwest
Division title and a tie for the league's second-best record (58-24).</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, in his first year with the Nets, led them to the Atlantic
Division title with a 52-30 record, 26 games better than their finish
in 2000-01. He averaged 14.7 points, 9.9 assists, and 7.3 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, the MVP in 1999-2000, was second in the NBA in scoring
(27.2) and sixth in rebounding (11.3) while guiding the Lakers to a
58-24 record.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady (390 points) of the Orlando Magic was fourth in the
voting and Kobe Bryant (98) of the Lakers was fifth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire and his father,
Willie, face felony marijuana possession charges while a grand jury
considers whether to indict them.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no arrests but two "district attorney's
information" notices were filed in Clackamas County Circuit Court.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire and his father appeared in court briefly Thursday for
an arraignment, but Judge John Lowe rescheduled the hearing for
Tuesday to give defense attorneys and prosecutors time to review an
Oregon Court of Appeals ruling just handed down in a similar case. In
an unrelated case, the court ruled that a warrantless search of a
house with an open door was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Police were responding to a burglar alarm Feb. 23 when they found
about one pound of marijuana at the Lake Oswego home of Stoudamire.</TE>

<HD>Hornets Slow the Nets Down</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Kidd is limited after collision with Wesley
as Charlotte finally breaks through, 115-97.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>David Wesley had a big red knot on his forehead and a splitting
headache. He had ice packs on both knees and his right elbow while
his feet soaked in water.</LD>
<LD>   As long as the Charlotte Hornets won, it was all worth it.</LD>
<LD>   Wesley shook off a head-to-head collision with Jason Kidd, then
lifted Charlotte back into the Eastern Conference semifinals by
scoring 22 points and providing an emotional spark in the Hornets'
115-97 victory over the New Jersey Nets on Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got a headache and I'm feeling kind of numb," he said. "But
I knew I could continue to play, and with the season on the line,
there was no way I wouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis scored 26 points, Jamaal Magloire added 16 points and
six blocked shots, and George Lynch had 12 points and 12 rebounds for
the Hornets, who trail the Nets, 2-1, in the best-of-seven series.
Game 4 is Sunday at Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, who needed stitches to close a gash over his right eye
following the collision with Wesley late in the first half, scored
only 13 points. He played only five minutes and scored four points
after smacking his head.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's trainers said "they lost count" of how many stitches
Kidd needed and the guard did not answer questions after the game. He
was escorted out of the locker room and walked with his head down
straight to the bus.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason's injury did have an impact on the game and it was a
negative one," said the Nets' Kenyon Martin, who had 13 points. "When
your leader goes down, it's kind of hard to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd was dribbling the ball up court when Davis poked it away from
behind. As Kidd reached to his left to get it back, Wesley stepped in
front of him and the two hit heads.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, blood streaming down his face, walked to the locker room
with a towel covering his face. Wesley was on the court for several
minutes before being helped to his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson led the Nets with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   The game was played on the eve of the NBA owners' scheduled vote
on Charlotte's relocation request and it is an expected formality,
with approval of the Hornets' move to New Orleans all but guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   The pending departure of the 14-year-old franchise failed to
increase the crowd as just 11,363 turned out in one of the Hornets'
final games in Charlotte but they were loud and even rowdy.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, the San Diego Chargers announced Thursday they were
moving their football training camp to a sports complex being built
in Carson.</LD>
<LD>   The Chargers have signed a five-year agreement with the Anschutz
Entertainment Group, which in February broke ground on a $120-million
sports facility on the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills.</LD>
<LD>   UC San Diego has been the Chargers' summer home since 1976, but
second-year General Manager John Butler said he hoped to "build team
chemistry" by taking the team farther from "familiar surroundings and
personal distractions" for training camp.</LD>
<TE>   "It helps players focus on the task at hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Butler said the move should not be considered a precursor to the
Chargers moving permanently to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hired here to take care of the San Diego Chargers and get
this football team to a championship-caliber team," he said. "L.A.
was never mentioned to me, and it still hasn't. My whole thing is I
want a whole different site to train in. Now everything has come out
of that."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL vacated Los Angeles at the end of the 1994 season, when
the Raiders moved from the Coliseum back to Oakland and the Rams
moved from Anaheim to St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers played at the Coliseum in 1960 before moving to San
Diego the following year.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Is the Center of Attention Again</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dusty Baker thinks pitchers are deliberately throwing at Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes you wonder, like the old days, if there was a bounty,"
the San Francisco Giant manager said after Bonds homered Thursday
night during a 4-3 victory over the Mets at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Pedro Astacio's next pitch to the star slugger sailed over his
head.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the third or fourth ball that was thrown at his head
[this season]," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was at the center of controversy. He was called out on
strikes by plate umpire Dan Iassogna in the first inning, homered in
the fourth to start San Francisco's comeback from a 3-0 deficit,
walked on four pitches in the sixth, then was called out on strikes
in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Walking back to the dugout, he said something to Iassogna and was
ejected for the first time since Aug. 2, 1998, when he was hit by a
pitch from Philadelphia's Ricky Bottalico after going four for four,
then charged the mound.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, which completed a three-game sweep, has won seven
in row, its best streak since taking nine in a row last July 25 to
Aug. 3. At 22-11, the Giants are off to their best start since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 1, San Diego 0--Three Cuban defectors helped pitch a
five-hitter, including rookie Hansel Izquierdo, who went five innings
for his first career victory as the Marlins won at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Izquierdo (1-0) was followed to the mound by countryman Michael
Tejera, Braden Looper and Cuban Vladimir Nunez, who pitched the ninth
for his seventh save in eight chances.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 9, Chicago 4--Jose Hernandez hit a pair of two-run
homers at Chicago and the Brewers used a six-run sixth inning to end
a nine-game road losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 15th homer off Ben Sheets
(3-3). It was the 465th of his career to tie him with Dave Winfield
for 21st place all-time.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Colorado 5--Jose Vidro hit a run-scoring single off
Rick White (0-4) in the 12th inning at Montreal as the Expos ended
their season-high six-game losing streak before 3,183, the smallest
Olympic Stadium crowd of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Houston 1--Randy Wolf gave up two hits in seven
innings and pinch-hitter Tomas Perez hit a two-run double in the
seventh at Philadelphia to lead the Phillies to their sixth
consecutive victory. The Phillies swept Houston at home for the first
time since July 1985.</TE>

<HD>Anglers Don't Want to Miss This Boat</HD>

<LD>The sentiment of one angler was seemingly shared by all: "Man, what
an awesome boat."</LD>
<LD>   As for the fishing, it was slow but that didn't seem to matter to
the 66 anglers who were part of the New Del Mar's maiden voyage
Saturday morning.</LD>
<LD>   What mattered most was that they had a shiny new boat to break in.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, this is big news considering that landing operators, for
the most part, are reluctant to make such costly additions to their
fleets, which consist largely of antiquated tubs that have bounced
from port to port over the past several decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did I have this boat built? That's simple: to better serve
the public," said Rick Oefinger, owner of Marina del Rey
Sportfishing.</TE>
<TE>   That may sound corny, but Oefinger, 46, deserves recognition for
the upgrades he has made since taking over the landing five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   He has transformed one of the sorriest live-bait operations into
one of the most reliable. In 1995, before he took over, he built a
65-foot boat and named it the New Del Mar. To make room for the
latest version of the New Del Mar, he sold the 65-footer and its name
has been changed to the Spitfire. The Spitfire is still at the
landing.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Oefinger brought in the Thunderbird, giving the Marina
del Rey landing something it has always lacked: access to the islands
and offshore banks.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have all aspects covered," Oefinger said. "The Thunderbird
gives us overnight capability, the Spitfire is our three-quarter-day
boat and the New Del Mar is our state-of-the-art half-day boat."</TE>
<TE>   For nostalgia's sake, he has kept on the Betty O, which has been
running trips out of the landing since the late 1960s and will
"handle our youth fishing groups and make our daily rock cod runs."</TE>
<TE>   As for Oefinger's newest addition, it's an eye-catcher. While most
party boats are made of wood, this one is constructed--at a cost of
$900,000--of high-grade aluminum, which needs no paint to protect it
from the elements.</TE>
<TE>   It's 75 feet long and 25 feet wide, making it among the
Southland's most spacious and stable half-day boats. It can
accommodate 150 passengers, although it will rarely carry much more
than half that. It has an exceptionally large galley, a sprawling
sundeck, and a bait tank that holds eight tons of water.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, sportfishing is all about recreation and our thing is for
people to come and have an enjoyable time even on a slow day,"
Oefinger said. "If some guy comes on board and only catches two
sculpin and a Johnny bass, then says he had a good time anyway, you
know you've done your job."</TE>
<TE>   His passengers caught about 150 rockfish last Saturday. Since
then, fishing in Santa Monica Bay has picked up considerably as a
school of large and voracious barracuda have moved into the bay.</TE>
<TE>   It's just the christening Oefinger had been hoping for.</TE>
<TE>   Early Albacore</TE>
<TE>   If you want to be among the early birds during what promises to be
a good season, now's the time.</TE>
<TE>   The first catch of the season was logged Friday aboard Relentless
out of Fisherman's Landing, as 10 anglers put four albacore and 45
yellowtail on board in an area 115 miles southwest of the landing. On
Saturday, the Indian out of H &amp; M Landing had six albacore in the
same area; and on Sunday the Legend out of Seaforth Sportfishing had
eight at 135 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Queen and American Angler were in the area Thursday,
their skippers reporting ideal conditions but no takers as of about 3
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Catalina Croakers</TE>
<TE>   Asked to assess the local fishing picture, Don Ashley, owner of
Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach, said there is nothing worth
mentioning close to shore. "Unfortunately, all of our eggs are in one
basket and that basket is over at Catalina," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Catalina is the site of one of the best spring white
seabass runs in years. The big croakers are bunched up in spawning
mode along most of the back side of the island and along portions of
the front side, enabling opportunity even for those aboard
three-quarter-day boats.</TE>
<TE>   One-fish limits have been the rule and the fish are averaging 20
to 30, with many topping 40 and a few pushing 50.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled Waters</TE>
<TE>   These are tough times for many marine mammals and notably for
California sea lions, which are stranding themselves on Southland
beaches by the droves, and carpet the pens of care facilities from
Santa Barbara to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   They're suffering from the effects of domoic acid poisoning,
caused by a toxic bloom of algae ingested by schooling fish that the
mammals prey on. The biotoxin doesn't affect the fish but it leaves
the mammals disoriented and subject to violent seizures. In many
cases, it proves fatal.</TE>
<TE>   This is a natural event that should start tapering off soon, but
until it does people are asked not to harass the beached animals and
to report--to animal control agencies--only those that appear to be
ill.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Cordaro, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist, said
sea lions that have come ashore are placed under a 48-hour watch
before they're brought to care centers "to give those that are not in
such dire straits a chance to get back off the beaches on their own"
and to relieve overcrowding at the centers.</TE>
<TE>   The toxic blooms appear to have occurred well offshore and there
have been no advisories warning against the consumption of fish
caught in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Heartbreak in Himalayas</TE>
<TE>   The mountaineering season is underway and harsh weather has helped
turned the past few weeks into deadly ones.</TE>
<TE>   On April 24, Raymond David Coughron, 58, an energy consultant from
Berkeley, became separated from his group on Mount Makalu, at 27,766
feet the world's fifth-highest mountain. According to the San
Francisco Chronicle, Coughron froze to death in a hole he had dug for
shelter. His body was discovered two days later by members of a Swiss
expedition. They buried him at 23,330 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On April 30, a British climber was killed on Mount Everest, at
29,028 feet the world's tallest mountain. Peter Legate, 38, of
Lymington, Hampshire, fell more than 600 feet into a crevasse while
trying to descend from Base Camp III to Base Camp II.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, Jeff Mathy, 23, a Fullerton climber attempting to
become the youngest to conquer the Seven Summits, will begin a summit
attempt of Everest (giving him six of the seven). He and his team
have been busy acclimating with trips between base camps. The
expedition is being chronicled at www.liptont.com.</TE>
<TE>   No Tahitian Treats</TE>
<TE>   Few waves are as perfectly shaped or as dangerous as the wickedly
hollow tubes that pound the reef at Teahupoo in Tahiti. On really big
days they strike fear into the hearts of even the world's best
surfers.</TE>
<TE>   They were really big most of this week, during the opening rounds
of the 2002 Billabong Pro Teahupoo, part of the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals' World Championship Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The surfers had plenty to say about the atmosphere associated with
holding an event in such precarious conditions, but none said it
better than Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, who is in Tahiti rooting
on friend and six-time world champion Kelly Slater.</TE>
<TE>   "It actually is so big, and such a freak of nature it takes at
least a couple of days to figure it out," Vedder said. "Your brain
can't compute, or at least that's what I've found. And then all the
people out there, it's kind of like a circus built right next to an
earthquake that's going off."</TE>
<TE>   Water on the Brain</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Newport-In-Water Boat Show at Newport Dunes Resort and
Marina was offering a new boat to one of 10 finalists chosen to
participate in a "Survivor"-themed contest designed to see who could
stand in a fish-fighting position the longest.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, when the show ended, after 72 hours, four of the 10
remained, though on wobbly legs. The giveaway was ultimately decided
by a casting contest won by Kevin Hannon of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   It was the victory celebration, however, that provided the most
entertainment for show-goers. Hannon was mobbed by friends and
family, who tossed him into the water. A show spokesman said the
water was only a few feet deep and that Hannon, who landed head
first, emerged "covered with mud and with blood pouring from his
nose."</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Are you ready for the Urban Challenge? This city-style version of
the Eco-Challenge comes to Los Angeles on May 25. It will feature
teams of two racing around town--either on foot or via public
transportation--trying to decipher clues to 12 hidden checkpoints
that must be visited and photographed in proper order before teams
can cross the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is the second stop of a 21-city U.S. tour. The top teams will
win a trip to Las Vegas this fall to compete in the $50,000 national
championships. Details: (602) 308-4868 or at www.urbanchallenge.com.</TE>

<DH>Southern Section golf: San Marcos wins team title in tough
conditions by closer-than-expected two strokes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final margin of victory was a little closer than anyone might
have imagined and a lot closer than the San Marcos boys' golf team
would have liked, but the result was exactly what everyone expected.</LD>
<LD>   San Marcos, which has taken prep golf to new heights this season
with its barrage of mind-boggling scores, shot 10-over-par 370 over a
wind-blown La Purisima Golf Course in Lompoc on Thursday to win the
Southern Section team championship by two shots over Palm Desert.</LD>
<LD>   Murrieta Valley shot 375 and Westlake shot 376 to earn the final
two berths in the CIF-SCGA Championships on June 4 at the SCGA
Members Club in Murrieta.</LD>
<TE>   The winning score by San Marcos might not seem impressive, given
that the Royals had averaged 358.87 in their last eight matches and
won the Central Coast Divisional Monday with 354.</TE>
<TE>   But the score is the fifth-best in section championship history
and is 17 strokes better than the 387 San Marcos shot to win in 1999,
the last time the finals were at La Purisima. Not bad for a team that
had an off day in 25-mph winds on a course where only one player
broke par Thursday. Santa Margarita's Taylor Wood shot 68.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that we are the best team in California and maybe the
nation," San Marcos Coach Aaron Solis said. "But we knew that at this
course and in these conditions, that if someone could beat us, this
was the day to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids did a phenomenal job of staying focused and not letting
that happen."</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of performance that had opponents talking about
San Marcos' place in the annals of the Southern Section. This is the
10th section title and the fourth in the last six years for the
Royals, who shot a section finals-record 359 to win last year. Still,
many feel this year's team ranks among the best all-time.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine a high school team ever that was better than
them," said Westlake Coach Dave Costley, whose team won section
titles in 1986 and '87 and CIF-SCGA titles in 1987 and '96.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos raised the bar when it broke par in two of its first
three matches this season. The Royals went undefeated during the
regular season, winning by an average of 23 strokes. They have shot
under par in five of their last eight matches, including a 19-under
341 on the second day of the Channel League finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is clicking right now," said Tyler Ley, one of three
San Marcos players to shoot 74 Thursday. "I think right now we could
rival any team, anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   They won't get much of an argument from Palm Desert, which got 73s
from Kyle Forbes and Seann Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some pretty good teams at Palm Desert, but nothing like
the team they have this year," said Coach Tim Kabeary, whose Aztec
teams have won three section titles.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a very, very good team. Them winning is no fluke. Them
not playing all that well [Thursday] is a fluke."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Kevin Larsen, who shot 72 to lead San Marcos, hopes his
team can prove Kabeary correct.</TE>
<TE>   "If we play well, I don't think there are any limits on this
team," Larsen said. "We could shoot insanely under par."</TE>

<LD>Charlton Krautim of Cerritos High won the 200-yard individual medley
Thursday and led off the winning 200 medley relay to help the Dons
defend their Southern Section Division IV boys' swimming title at
Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Krautim won the individual medley in 1 minute 55.48 seconds and
Cerritos won the opening relay in 1:41.50 to accumulate 60 of the
team's 207 points. Cerritos entered the final event, the 400
freestyle relay, with a 19-point lead over Placentia Valencia and
finished second to hold off the Tigers (who won the relay in a meet
record 3:17.97) by a 207-194 margin. Valencia also set a record in
the two-year-old division in the 200 freestyle relay (1:30.13) and
Ryan McNeill of Valencia set meet records in the boys' 100 butterfly
(51.39) and 500 freestyle (4:36.18).</LD>
<LD>   In the butterfly, McNeill upset Hidenaga Murakami of L.A. Pilgrim
(51.50), who had lowered his division record in the Wednesday's
preliminaries. McNeill topped his day-old record in the 500 freestyle
by more than seven seconds. Murakami came back to break his division
record in the 100 backstroke for the second consecutive day, winning
in 53.35.</LD>
<TE>   Brea Olinda won the girls' title with 239.5 points and Hesperia
Sultana was second with 204.5. Melissa Wong of Whitney set division
records in the 200 freestyle (1:51.82) and 500 freestyle (4:59.31).
Emlynn Tursick of Carpinteria set a division record in the 100
backstroke (57.79) and Jennifer Cook of Valencia broke her division

<HD>Kings' Message Loud and Clear</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Sacramento takes command of series with
125-119 victory over the Mavericks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Oh yeah, the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Faves of yesteryear, all but forgotten in the hype surrounding the
new "greatest show on Earth," the Sacramento Kings blasted the Dallas
Mavericks back into underdog status Thursday night, outgunning them,
125-119, to take a 2-1 lead in the Western semifinals and regaining
home-court advantage.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a kick in the teeth," said Maverick Coach Don Nelson,
"there's no question about it....</LD>
<TE>   "I think they made some good adjustments, going inside with their
big players, making us defend. We expected them to do that but, of
course, there's only so much you can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the Mavericks' case, there wasn't much at all they could do
about it, aside from saying, "Nice shot."</TE>
<TE>   Virtuosos on offense, the Mavericks are toreadors at the other
end, best at getting out of the way. It's good they're such great
shooters because they not only have to make a lot of long shots, they
have to score more points than they give up--112 a game in this
series.</TE>
<TE>   This game was a Kings' layup line from the start. Chris Webber
scored 31 points, Mike Bibby had 29, Doug Christie 20 and Vlade Divac
19.</TE>
<TE>   Scot Pollard, who had played only four minutes in the series, got
11 minutes in this one, went to the basket every time he got the
ball, made all four of his shots and scored nine points.</TE>
<TE>   And there went another folk movement.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks came back to find the city whipped into a
cowbell-toting frenzy. Apparently offended by the thought of
Sacramento making a name for itself banging the farm implement that's
popular here, too, Maverick fans came bearing cowbells by the
thousands, dwarfing the puny efforts of a few King fans who sat
behind the Maverick bench in Arco Arena and moved Dallas owner Mark
Cuban to plan his revenge.</TE>
<TE>   There were signs ("Our Bells Are Bigger.")</TE>
<TE>   There were four guys in Chick-fil-A spotted cow costumes, standing
behind the Kings' bench, pounding on cowbells of their own.</TE>
<TE>   The din they made was formidable. Unfortunately for the Mavericks,
then they had to start the game.</TE>
<TE>   Unimpressed, the Kings got off to a great start, running up the
now-traditional double-figure lead (14 points this time) early in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the Mavericks rubbed this out in a hurry, tying it,
66-66, at halftime on Wang Zhizhi's 18-footer that dropped after the
buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with Peja Stojakovic out with a sprained ankle and Webber
resting, the Kings started the fourth quarter with an 18-8 run that
put them ahead to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mavericks' virtuosos struggled. Steve Nash,
brilliant in Game 2, shot five for 19 in this one. Dirk Nowitzki,
double-teamed now, went six for 15.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki, often compared to a young Larry Bird, is more like a
young Kevin McHale, a black hole in the offense, since the ball often
goes in to him but rarely comes out.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step, he has to add the pass to his beautiful game,"
said Nelson. "Bottom line, when there are two men on him, we need
ball movement and more assists....</TE>
<TE>   "They [Kings] are a very good team. By the way, I chuckle when I
hear people talking about us [playing] the Los Angeles Lakers. This
is the best team in basketball. They have a better team than the Los
Angeles Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won't be flattered but unless Nelson's team rallies,
they may have to wait 'til next season to show their displeasure.
Right now, the Lakers aren't Nelson's problem.</TE>

<LD>England Coach Sven Goran Eriksson on Thursday unveiled the team he
will be taking to the World Cup, but English fans appeared more
interested in who will be going to "Beckingham Palace" this weekend
than to Japan next week.</LD>
<LD>   Barely a month after breaking a bone in his left foot and putting
his World Cup place in doubt, midfielder David Beckham has recovered
sufficiently to be among the 23 players chosen by Eriksson and to
announce that he and his wife Victoria, formerly of the Spice Girls,
will host a lavish garden party Sunday at their Hertfordshire estate.</LD>
<LD>   More than 400 guests, including the entire England team, have been
invited to the charity event, which will be televised and will
feature an Asian theme, in keeping with Korea/Japan '02, the first
World Cup to be held in Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Elton John is among the dozens of celebrity guests expected to
attend.</TE>
<TE>   The event is intended to raise $730,000 for the National Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</TE>
<TE>   In naming a relatively young squad--half the players are 24 or
younger, including France '98 standout Michael Owen--Eriksson
produced few surprises.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good squad," he said. "But you can only pick 23
players. I have made my choice and that's it. If I did right or
wrong, I have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the FIFA president targeted in a lawsuit by
members of his own executive committee who are trying to root out
corruption within soccer's international ruling body, said Thursday
he is not bothered by the impending legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat of any charges leaves me unperturbed," Blatter said.
"I find the threat of legal action disappointing, but it does not
come as a surprise to me. This merely represents the logical
consequence of months of relentless and systematic attacks on the
FIFA president by my opponents in an attempt to destroy my personal
integrity."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fikret Unlu, Turkey's minister for sports, has proposed a
half-holiday on June 3 so fans can watch Turkey play four-time world
champion Brazil in the opening round of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The game, scheduled for early in the work day, will mark the
Turkish team's first appearance in the World Cup in 48 years.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Brazil match, we will put a suggestion to the prime
minister for a public holiday; it could be a holiday at least until
the afternoon," Unlu said.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least until Brazil scores.</TE>
<TE>   The Americas</TE>
<TE>   The AC Milan team that will play three games in the United States
in the next two weeks will bear little resemblance to the team that
annually challenges for the Serie A title in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   No fewer than eight "guest" players have been called in to fill in
for players unavailable because of the World Cup. The eight include
former FIFA world player of the year George Weah of Liberia.</TE>
<TE>   Milan will play Ecuador in New Haven, Conn., on Saturday; Major
League Soccer's New York/New Jersey MetroStars on May 16 in East
Rutherford, N.J.; and Mexico at the Coliseum on May 19. Weah will
play only against the MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Abstinence will not make the heart grow fonder, according to
Brazil's World Cup players, who were taken aback by Coach Luiz Felipe
Scolari's apparent ban on sex during the May 31-June 30 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari last week was quoted as saying he favored "sexual
abstention" by his players during the event, adding that "any
individual who cannot control this aspect of his life is not a human
being but an irrational animal."</TE>
<TE>   That remark did not set well with his players, and Scolari
Thursday clarified his statement, saying of Brazil's players: "In
their off-duty days, they are free to do whatever they want. I am
simply not interested in what they do in their own time."</TE>

<HD>No Obstacle Too High for Reseda's Hoffert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jake Hoffert remembers what his report card looked like after he
graduated from middle school.</LD>
<LD>   There was an A in physical education, a B in woodshop, Ds in
English and science and an F in algebra.</LD>
<LD>   He was an unmotivated 15-year-old with few goals.</LD>
<TE>   That summer, he saw a flier announcing that Reseda High was
starting a police academy magnet, where students would be prepared
for careers in law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like a lot of fun," he said. "I saw the obstacle
course and immediately I wanted to be the best."</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Hoffert was named "Toughest Cadet Alive" after
winning a district-wide competition last month among police academy
magnet students in physical fitness and essay writing.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he competed in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles
final at the Valley Mission League track championships, finishing
second in a career-best 42.6 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, [when] people would say, 'What do you want to do?' I had
no idea. Now I have ideas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffert's high-school experience has worked to perfection. It has
inspired him to experiment in ways he never thought possible. It has
challenged his mind and body and changed his outlook on life.</TE>
<TE>   He tried football, baseball and cross-country at Reseda. He
plunged ahead in academy training. He listened intently as speakers
from the LAPD, L.A. County Sheriff's Dept., FBI, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Customs
and Secret Service made presentations.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has talked to us except CIA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For three summers, he interned at the West Valley police station,
getting to know men and women who put their lives on the line daily.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd pull me aside and talk to me about life and how much they
love their job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffert is 6 feet 1, 150 pounds. He set a record for the Reseda
obstacle course, completing it in 46 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The course requires competitors to maneuver over a balance beam,
climb a rope, cargo net and six-foot wall, swing on rings, jump
hurdles, run through tires and roll under a three-foot structure.</TE>
<TE>   He's shooting for 39 seconds before he graduates. "I want my time
to be the record when I come back in five years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffert has run in only seven hurdle races in his life but keeps
improving. From 48 seconds several weeks ago, his 300 time has
dropped to 42.6, but his inexperience shows. He still takes stutter
steps before each hurdle instead of running through them. With more
practice, his time could drop considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Sports and the police academy have given him reasons to stay away
from drugs, gangs and other teenage distractions.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been offered before, but it's never been hard to turn down,"
he said. "I was experimenting with something besides drugs. I'm
trying to better myself, my time, my strength. It's helping me with
my discipline."</TE>
<TE>   When his parents went through a divorce, Hoffert was deeply
affected. But his teachers and fellow academy students helped him
through the tough times.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty much my family, like brothers and sisters, and
help me through everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his studies, Hoffert has learned about DNA,
fingerprinting, handwriting analysis, tire analysis and forensics
science.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be part of Reseda's first police academy graduating class of
27 students. More than 140 are enrolled in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lost, really lost," he said. "I couldn't see the big
picture. I didn't even know to look for it until the police academy.
I have a lot more goals now. I want to have a career I enjoy. I want
to do something where I can go home at night and feel I did something
good. I want to feel like a lot of police officers feel at the end of
the day, that they've helped someone."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffert doesn't know where he'll end up in law enforcement, but
criminals, beware. He's quick and ready to do whatever it takes to
capture a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hop the fences and get that guy who runs away," he said.</TE>

<KH>SPUR NOTES</KH>
<HD>They Have Their Doubts About O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Shaquille O'Neal is really hurting? The bad toe, the cut finger,
and now a sprained left ankle too.</LD>
<LD>   Well, the Spurs aren't exactly calling O'Neal a big fibber, but
they'd like to see more proof.</LD>
<LD>   Malik Rose has been guarding the Lakers' 7-foot-1 center, and he
was skeptical Thursday of how real the injuries are.</LD>
<TE>   "He still throws it through the rim hard, so I don't think his
hand is bothering him at all," said Rose, who has been sharing the
O'Neal patrol with Mark Bryant and Tim Duncan while Spur center David
Robinson recovers from an aggravated disk in his lower back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who has played only seven minutes of the postseason,
could also be in uniform for tonight's Game 3 at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said Robinson went through a full
practice Thursday, and that a decision on his game status will be
made today.</TE>
<TE>   "He banged and he hit, and it's just a matter of whether the nerve
in the back sustains as the day goes on," Popovich said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with a pain level. David has played with
pain for a lot of years in his career and he wants to be out there
badly. It's a nerve deal--if your nerve is not firing and you get
yourself in certain positions, you may do some real damage to
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs also are unsure how productive Robinson will be when or
if he returns. After playing only seven minutes in the past month, he
may have trouble finding his rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Popovich is bracing for a maximum effort from the Lakers tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to come with their full focus," Popovich said.
"They're going to play great and we'll have to play a heck of a game
to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   And no one does San Antonio expect more from than O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Shaq is going to get involved more," Spur rookie guard
Tony Parker said. "I think he's going to have the ball more, so we
have to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's presence would be the biggest plus for the Spurs. The
home crowd also figures in--San Antonio is 15-1 in the Alamodome
since late February.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs also expect to get a lift from Duncan being honored
tonight for his selection as the NBA's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal finished third in balloting, behind Duncan and New Jersey
Net guard Jason Kidd. Laker teammate Samaki Walker said that O'Neal
might try to make his case on the court Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure one person won't be happy--No. 34 [Shaq]," said Walker,
who played for San Antonio last season. "I expect a big game from
him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Both the Lakers and Spurs have played well in bursts, but neither
has shown the form that led them to identical 58-24 records during
the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "Both games have been somewhat ugly," said Spur guard Antonio
Daniels, who scored 14 points in Game 2. "Whichever team decides
they're going to play better for a longer stint, that'll be the team
that comes out victorious."</TE>

<LD>The road to the NCAA championships begins at home for several area
college tennis teams.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 4-seeded UCLA men's and No. 7-seeded women's teams will
play host to one of 16 four-team regionals for their respective NCAA
tournaments this weekend at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.</LD>
<LD>   The women begin at 1 p.m. today with a first-round match against
Southern University. The Bruin men open against UC Santa Barbara at
noon Saturday. Women's first-round winners will play at 3 p.m.
Saturday, the men's winners at noon Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (19-4), seeded behind defending champion and top-ranked
Georgia, No. 5-ranked Tennessee and No. 3-ranked Illinois, got a
tough draw despite its No. 2 national ranking. If the Bruins get past
this weekend, they probably will have to beat No. 13-seeded Florida,
No. 5-seeded Stanford and Georgia just to get to the final match May
21 at Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're one of seven or eight teams that all have a chance
to win," said UCLA men's Coach Billy Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-seeded Pepperdine men's and No. 10-seeded USC women's
teams also will play host to regionals, with the Waves playing
Richmond at 10 a.m. Saturday and the Trojans facing Oral Roberts at 1
p.m. Saturday. Regional winners advance to the round of 16 beginning
Thursday in Palo Alto for the women and May 18 in College Station,
Texas, for the men.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a team that really stands out," UCLA women's Coach
Stella Sampras said. "It's a great opportunity to be a contender."</TE>

<KH>TV-RADIO LARRY STEWART</KH>
<HD>Lantz Is Never Out of Insight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their names, Chick 'n' Stu, sound like a dish that warms the belly,
and L.A. has certainly developed a taste for Chick Hearn and Stu
Lantz, who are completing their 15th season together with the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn has gotten a lot of attention, with heart surgery ending his
consecutive-game streak at 3,338 and then hip surgery postponing his
comeback. And Paul Sunderland drew rave reviews for the job he did as
Hearn's replacement.</LD>
<LD>   But it is Lantz who is having a watershed year. He has always been
a good commentator, but he has shown this season that he is one of
the best anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   "He has the ability to analyze any situation quicker and better
than anyone I've ever heard," Hearn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, maybe using an imaginary measuring gauge, added, "I think
Stu really stepped forward last season, and he's 35% better than that
this year."</TE>
<TE>   Lantz also speaks highly of Hearn, but this is a partnership that
has had a few bumps along the way. Hearn can be like an eccentric
uncle who at times is cantankerous and stubborn, but you know he is
soft on the inside and so you love him anyway.</TE>
<TE>   When all is said and done, these two are almost like father and
son. Their little feuds never last long. It always works out in the
wash.</TE>
<TE>   "Just put in the detergent and wait for the rinse cycle," Lantz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn says there has never been a serious rift, and if it sounds
as if they are arguing on the air, they're really not.</TE>
<TE>   "We may disagree about some things, but most of the time we're
just presenting two points of view," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lantz has never been afraid to correct Hearn, but Hearn says he
never confronted Lantz off the air about being corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never do that, never," Hearn said. "I have too much
respect for him and his knowledge of the game. What both of us want
is to give the viewers and the listeners as accurate a call as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Since Hearn's return, the two have been clicking as well as, if
not better than they ever have. One reason for that is their
relationship has probably never been better.</TE>
<TE>   When Hearn was recuperating, Lantz called regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "No one called more," Hearn said. "And we still talk on the phone
all the time. If we're watching a playoff game on television and one
of us notices something, we'll call the other guy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very harmonious relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The Beginning</TE>
<TE>   It was Hearn who recommended that the Lakers hire Lantz to replace
Keith Erickson, who had been Hearn's broadcast partner before moving
on after the 1986-87 season.</TE>
<TE>   Lantz, a basketball star at Nebraska, played the final three
seasons of his nine-year NBA career with the Lakers. They were three
uneventful seasons--the last one was spent on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly wasn't hired as a broadcaster by the Lakers because
of my name," Lantz said.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring as a player in 1977, Lantz, who planned to become
an elementary school teacher, instead dabbled in broadcasting. At the
time, Hearn was doing some Nevada Las Vegas basketball when his
schedule permitted, and Lantz was hired by the packager, Dick
Manoogian, to work with Hearn on a few road games.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very impressed and told Stu we might call him if there was
ever an opening," Hearn said.</TE>
<TE>   When there was an opening, Hearn called. And Lantz got the job.</TE>
<TE>   He was immediately more outspoken than some of his predecessors,
doing more than simply saying, "That's right, Chick."</TE>
<TE>   Of Lantz, Fox Sports Net Laker producer Jerry Romano said, "He has
gotten better and better with each year, and he is the ultimate team
player who'll do anything asked of him."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn and Lantz work with two producers--Romano and Channel 9's
Susan Stratton.</TE>
<TE>   Romano, who first met Hearn when he was the stage manager for the
old "Bowling for Dollars" shows on Channel 5 in the early 1970s, has
been producing the Laker cable telecasts since 1985, when Prime
Ticket, the forerunner to Fox Sports Net, was launched.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick is like a father to me, and I am just as fond of Stu,"
Romano said.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton, who has been involved with Laker telecasts since 1977,
said, "Stu is just a wonderful, wonderful person who is kind to
everyone. And he is so resilient, he can handle any situation. He
never loses his temper or his cool."</TE>
<TE>   Lantz, who lives in San Diego, has been married to his college
sweetheart, Linda, for 36 years and is the father of three children,
Todd, 34, Kristin, 30, and Shane, 27. Linda just retired as
supervisor of attendance for San Diego's Madison High, but the
Lantzes plan to stay in San Diego, despite Stu's commute.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really not too bad," he said. "It takes me 1:45 to get from
my house to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to complain about. I have a great job, I work for
a great organization and I get to work with the very best
play-by-play announcer in the business, a true legend."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 of the Laker-San Antonio series tonight can be seen on
Channel 9, with Hearn and Lantz, and TNT, with Marv Albert, Mike
Fratello and Jeff Van Gundy. Game 4 Sunday will be on NBC and Game 5
at Staples Center Tuesday night will be on Fox Sports Net but blacked
out on TNT.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has done two Laker playoff games so far and ratings
are up 32% from a year ago. TNT/TBS ratings for the NBA playoffs are
up 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Albert and Fratello, who were injured early in the morning on
April 18 when the limousine they were riding in crashed into a
stalled Dunkin' Donuts truck on a New Jersey turnpike, were back
together for the first time Tuesday night when they worked Game 2 of
the Laker-San Antonio series for TNT.</TE>
<TE>   They talked about the accident before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Albert, who suffered a broken ankle and other injuries, was
knocked unconscious. Fratello said what he remembers is being
awakened by what sounded like a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "The stalled Dunkin' Donuts truck was right there in the No. 2
lane with its lights off," he said. "We had no chance."</TE>
<TE>   Fratello, walking on broken glass in his stocking feet, pulled
Albert from the car. The limo driver suffered major injuries,
including a shattered hip.</TE>
<TE>   Sportscaster Randy Kerdoon, who began working at Channel 11 as a
fill-in nine years ago while still at radio station KFWB (980) and
has been full-time at Channel 11 for seven years, will be leaving the
station at the end of the month. His contract is not being renewed.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing is happening with Todd Donoho at Fox Sports Net,
who'll be out this summer.... Lisa Guerrero was in line to replace
Kerdoon, but she is locked in with Fox Sports Net. A source said
possible replacements for Kerdoon are Tanya Memme, Lisa Dergan or
Jennifer Gould.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Grich, Mark Langston and Jim Abbott will make separate guest
appearances in the booth with Steve Physioc and Rex Hudler when the
Angels play the Chicago White Sox Saturday night on Fox Sports
Net.... Attention soccer fans: A new weekly radio show devoted solely
to soccer makes its debut on KXTA (1150) Saturday at 7 a.m. The
co-hosts are Britons Steven Cohen and Nicholas Gerber.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Don't know anyone who had the Kentucky Derby winner? UCLA football
commentator Matt Stevens, who attended the race, not only had the
winner but had a winning $5 exacta ticket worth $3,252.</TE>

<KH>OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>Spurs Hoping for '99 Redux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BUCK HARVEY</AU>
<BD>SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS-NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This isn't 1999. And yet it is.</LD>
<LD>   These Spurs aren't what they were then. And yet they are.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Elie and Jerome Kersey are gone. And yet they are back, one
relentless as he chases Kobe Bryant, the other subbing with the tough
muscle of the unaffected.</LD>
<TE>   The old days?</TE>
<TE>   Just the names, Bruce Bowen and Mark Bryant, are new.</TE>
<TE>   Little is the same from 1999, when the Spurs swept the Lakers, or
even 2001, when the Lakers swept the Spurs. Forget that this series
is even after two games. The absence of David Robinson alters any
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Still, these three series have story lines that both intersect and
are parallel. In 1999, for example, the Lakers relied on an ex-Spur
power forward (J.R. Reid). Now the Lakers lean on another (Samaki
Walker).</TE>
<TE>   Walker isn't Reid. The Spurs gladly let Reid drift away, whereas
they lost Walker last summer strictly because of salary-cap
complications.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Walker did his best J.R. on Tuesday night. He threw in the
game's first basket and never scored again. His defensive impact? He
stood next to Tim Duncan until other Lakers ran to help.</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason the Lakers were at their best last season. Then
Horace Grant took that role, and he smartly used his experience
against Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Grant often defended Duncan by himself, and the Spurs privately
say this now: Grant's absence is significant.</TE>
<TE>   As it was with Elie, Bowen irritates with proper professionalism.
Asked if he's a Kobe Stopper, Bowen shakes his head. If Portland's
Ruben Patterson wants the world to mock him for making that claim,
fine. Bowen figures Kobe is tough enough without a dare.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen also figures there's no such thing as a Kobe Stopper. Bowen
is simply what Elie was before. A Kobe Botherer. Whereas Elie used
the rules of 1999 to bump Kobe, Bowen now chases and darts.</TE>
<TE>   But that's just the story of one Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bryant is the strongest Spur, and there isn't even a close
second. Then he stands in at center, and the concept of size changes.
Bryant is to Shaquille O'Neal what Terry Porter is to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   But Kersey could play Shaq at times too, because he had the same
quality that Bryant has now. Both had been around too long to be
afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq got his fifth foul when he tossed an elbow into Bryant's
head. Bryant also flipped in a few jumpers when Shaq strayed. Maybe
this package is why Spur Coach Gregg Popovich, when asked about
Robinson's possible return, said:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it would be that big a deal. We've been without him
for a month, and we've gotten used to being without him."</TE>
<TE>   Used to being without Robinson?</TE>
<TE>   This isn't 1999, all right.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it is.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Mistake</HD>
<DH>The Laughter Stopped for Jayson Williams the Night a Driver
Was Killed at His Estate and He Allegedly Tried to Cover It Up</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Young, gifted and frantic....</LD>
<LD>   Jayson Williams played everything for laughs, from his NBA
adventures to the fortune he made and the mansion he built on 65
acres of New Jersey farmland, with a bronze plaque of himself on the
stone wall out front, in his No. 55 Net uniform, his palms up,
looking perplexed.</LD>
<LD>   Williams says one of his old friends named the place late one
night, or early one morning, on a typical weekend--seven couples
staying over--after they'd "hit the vineyard a little bit," finally
looking around and asking:</LD>
<TE>   "Who knew, Jay? Who knew?"</TE>
<TE>   After that, it was formally titled the Who Knew? Estates.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed a happy time. Williams was handsome, well-spoken and
outspoken, with a gift for comedy and storytelling that dwarfed even
his basketball ability, which was good enough to earn him a
$94-million contract before a broken leg ended his playing career. He
was generous and friendly as a puppy, to boot, so everyone laughed
with him as an NBC commentator and a regular on the
Letterman/Imus/Rosie/Regis and Kathie Lee circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Two magazines, GQ and Details, excerpted his NBA diary. Doubleday
gave him a fat advance to turn it into a book, which he titled,
"Loose Balls," subtitled "Easy Money, Hard Fouls, Cheap Laughs &amp; True
Love in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't only a clown, though. His charitable commitment was off
the charts, $2.1 million to St. John's University in the name of his
college coach, Lou Carnesecca, $20,000 to arena workers who'd been
laid off (from part-time jobs) during the 1999 NBA lockout.</TE>
<TE>   All a charity had to do was approach him and, a friend says, "The
tents would go up at his estate." Next thing you knew, there'd be
1,000 kids from Newark playing on the grounds, with Gov. Christine
Whitman or Michael J. Fox or Danny Aiello or Lauren Hutton or
Laurence Fishburne.</TE>
<TE>   Nor were these mere photo ops for the media, notes Carnesecca.
There were many more instances no one ever heard of, as if Williams
felt guilty about having so much--he said as much--and was trying to
give it away. Lots of nouveau riche NBA stars were high-stakes
gamblers; he was a high-stakes donor.</TE>
<TE>   His greatest gift, however, was people. He was the modern jaded
superstar upside down. When he met someone, anyone, his eyes
brightened as if he'd been introduced to the president of the United
States, or Cameron Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a caring person," Carnesecca says. "He goes out of his way
to help people, without people knowing about it.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I can only speak very, very highly of him. He was a
pleasure to coach. He gave me everything he had. I have nothing but
the greatest respect for him."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, friends, now hurting for Williams, also note he
lived the way he did everything else, all-out, pushing the envelope,
often on the fringe of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   And then the laughter stopped abruptly. In the early morning hours
of Feb. 14, another party, one attended by former Net teammates
Benoit Benjamin and Chris Morris, was interrupted by a shotgun blast
that killed limousine driver Costas "Gus" Christofi, an apparently
reformed ex-convict Williams had hired for the night.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was first charged with reckless manslaughter, but last
week a grand jury in Flemington, N.J., indicted him on nine counts,
among them the more serious charge of aggravated manslaughter, which
carries a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, plus charges of
hindering apprehension and tampering with evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police Williams had been holding the gun, taken
from a rack in his bedroom, when it accidentally discharged, killing
Christofi.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' adopted brother, Victor Santiago, then called 911 and
reported the shooting as a suicide. Two weeks ago, one of the guests,
Kent Culuko, testified in court that Williams had told him to wipe
the shotgun clean of fingerprints, which Culuko said he did, and to
instruct the other guests to tell a cover story.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, free on $270,000 bail, has made only a brief statement
since, expressing his regret to Christofi's family.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' lawyer, Joseph Hayden, says Williams will plead not
guilty, contending, "the death of Mr. Christofi was a tragic accident
but not a criminal event."</TE>
<TE>   Culuko had been a North Jersey high school basketball star, who
played at a small college and was cut by the Nets in training camp,
where he met Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In typical Williams style, they had remained friends since,
although now the story has taken a new twist.</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer heartwarming, or comedy, or a spirited farce, but
pure tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The Hard Way Up</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knew my troubles because I never told nobody nothin'. I was
the kind of guy who was always laughing, always the life of the
party. It was a way for me to hide myself. I wanted people to be
happy when they were around me. I wanted them to think I was happy.
But at the same time, I was daring Jesus to take my life. I became
the kind of person who walks into gunfights.</TE>
<TE>   --Williams to Sports Illustrated's John Ed Bradley, October 1996</TE>
<TE>   In the many volumes of Williams' quotes, there are dozens that
seem to foreshadow such a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   In "Loose Balls," he recounts an incident at his home with his
football-playing friends, Wayne Chrebet of the Jets and Jason Sehorn
of the Giants, in which Williams fired a round from a powerful
.50-caliber pistol. Had Chrebet not been bending down to pick up a
shell, the slug would have hit him in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Williams wrote, while he and others were tending to Chrebet,
Sehorn went into the house, later telling Williams he'd been afraid
Jayson would have him killed too, if Chrebet had died.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing my best to keep from laughing," Williams says. "And I
say with a straight face, 'Yeah, man, they sure would have. They
would have had to silence you. 'Cause I don't think you could have
held that secret.'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with Williams, life of the party, teller of tall tales,
it was always about the laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "He embellishes a lot and he's funny," Chrebet told the New York
Daily News last week. "Everybody loved it back then. Now his whole
life is under a microscope and they're questioning everything he's
ever done."</TE>
<TE>   For whatever it's worth, Williams' book is loaded with anecdotes
about guns--Jayson claiming to have threatened Philadelphia 76er
teammate Manute Bol's uncle with an unloaded pistol ... one of his
brothers shooting another brother with their father E.J.'s shotgun
... shooting a man who had hit Jayson in the buttocks with a pistol.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Williams was arrested in 1994 after someone had
fired a pistol he owned at an unoccupied car in the Nets' parking
lot. He denied doing the shooting and charges were dismissed after
he'd completed a pretrial program, taking out newspaper ads to warn
about the dangers of misusing firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' real life had been challenging enough.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a building contractor from South Carolina and an
Italian mother from New York, Williams says he was humiliated by
people on both sides of the family, the blacks in the South, the
whites in New York, called "half-breed" and "zebra."</TE>
<TE>   While he was in high school in New York, his older stepsisters,
Linda and Laura, contracted AIDS, which would eventually kill them.
Jayson helped raise their two children and, when he turned pro and
got his own money, adopted them.</TE>
<TE>   His college career had been promising and problematic. In his
sophomore year, he hit a fan with a chair during a game at Providence
and was jailed overnight before charges were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   As a fledgling pro, mourning his sisters, he was all over the lot,
and the league. Drafted No. 21 by the Suns in 1990, he was captured
by TV cameras, sitting in his parents' living room, yelling, "Oh, no,
I'm not going to Phoenix!"</TE>
<TE>   He went out for the news conference without his sneakers so he
couldn't work out, and crashed his rental car, on purpose, he
claimed. He was so disoriented, he said, he woke up the first
morning, looked out the window, saw the desert and thought he'd slept
through a nuclear attack.</TE>
<TE>   Duly impressed, the Suns traded him to the 76ers, who were, at
least, closer to home. Williams says he impressed 76er officials, who
wanted to check him out, by taking them to a nearby playground and
throwing down a number of powerhouse dunks. He says he neglected to
tell them it was a nine-foot basket.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, he began running around with Charles Barkley, which
required a great deal of running. Barkley said later that Williams
hadn't required a lot of leading astray. Williams wrote that Barkley
taught him a lot but, "Luckily for me, I've ignored some of his
lessons--otherwise my liver would be the size of two footballs."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did this turn out to be good for Williams' career. He rode the
end of the 76ers' bench for two seasons and the Nets' bench for three
more before Paul Silas, then an assistant under Chuck Daly, convinced
Jayson that he could make a contribution if he did one thing
well--rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Williams became a starter, an All-Star, the centerpiece of the
franchise and a media sensation, as the Knicks fell off and the
thousand media outlets of Manhattan began to appreciate his
silver-tongued genius.</TE>
<TE>   His basketball career came to an abrupt halt not long after he'd
signed his $94-million deal, terminated by a badly broken leg at the
end of the 1998-99 season, but his career as an entertainer never
faltered. The $94 million was guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   He was set for life, economically, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The Fast Way Down</TE>
<TE>   [Stephon Marbury] is saying, "Yo man, I'm twinking about your crib
and I want to come out and check out the little pheasants around
there and word is, you got a dope vehicle and its music be germing."
And I don't know what he's talking about.... So I look at Keith [Van
Horn].... Keith looks up from his computer for a second, says, "What
Stephon was trying to tell you, Jay, is that he's heard you have a
nice new house and he'd like to visit some time and meet some of the
pretty women he has heard you often invite over. And he's also heard
about your new car and its nice new sound system.' ... I say to
Keith, who's as white as Opie, "How do you understand that lingo?"
... And this time, Keith doesn't even look up. "Buy the CDs, baby,"
he says. "Buy the CDs."</TE>
<TE>   --Williams in "Loose Balls"</TE>
<TE>   He always knew better.</TE>
<TE>   That was one of his big things. He wasn't one of these
entourage-packing, out-of-touch megastars, he was grounded. He
actually had a union card and could drive heavy equipment, having
worked for his father growing up. He was always talking about how his
daddy was going to beat the living heck out of him if he got in
trouble, and when he did get in trouble, he was always saying he had
learned his lesson, promising to leave the crazy life behind as he
got older and more successful.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, however, he lived on the edge and kept falling off.
One of his former Net coaches remembers talking to him after an
incident outside a club. He was alleged to have pushed a cop.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'My daddy didn't grow me up to be like that,'" says the
former coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Jayson, what are you talking about? We all know, you get
a couple pops in you ... '</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'It's a misdemeanor.'</TE>
<TE>   "He's personable. You wouldn't fight him 'cause he's strong as an
ox. He can be argumentative with the drink. Then something goes on
and he'd be at your house the next morning, pulling your car out of
the snow."</TE>
<TE>   Williams had begun renting limos for nights out long before,
because he knew he might not be in any shape to drive, which was why
Gus Christofi was there that night.</TE>
<TE>   As little as Williams thought of the sight of other players,
followed around by entourages, he had his own huge circle, made up of
almost every friend he ever had. He loved having people around and he
loved performing for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like him," says the wife of a former Net official. "He
has a way of making you feel like you're special. When we heard what
happened, [my husband] and I both looked at each other and said, we
can see it happening.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he was so proud of that house. He would take anybody to
'Come see my house.' We could see him parading people around at 3
o'clock in the morning, showing off his house."</TE>
<TE>   Fun and tumult ran hand in hand. Williams had his wedding at Who
Knew? It was a huge, catered affair, with relatives, friends, Net
teammates, coaches and officials attending. Then, within months, the
marriage broke up.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, everything seemed to work out for him in the end. He
soon was married again, to Tanya, a former St. John's girlfriend
who'd become an entertainment lawyer. His life looked rosy, even if
he suffered the usual athlete's pangs at leaving the game he loved.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities came looking for him. When Barkley hit it big on
Turner's NBA studio show, NBC went looking for a loose cannon of its
own and came up with Williams, who was happy to shoot off his mouth
in any case, and especially on camera at those prices.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about perfect. Now he could tell San Antonio's David
Robinson, "Bring your heart," and sneer at him, "This isn't a knife
fight," get a laugh and make great money at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The mad whirl kept going, right up to the night of Feb. 13, when
he went to a Harlem Globetrotter game just over the state line in
Pennsylvania, to see his former teammates, Benjamin and Morris, who
were now Globies.</TE>
<TE>   They went out to dinner after the game and then were driven back
to Who Knew?, 11 of them in all.</TE>
<TE>   Christofi, their driver for the night, was invited in, standard
practice for Williams, friend to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   About 2:50 a.m., according to witnesses' accounts, Williams was
holding a shotgun when it accidentally discharged, the pellets
striking Christofi.</TE>
<TE>   Then, according to Culuko, Williams began trying to make it look
like a suicide, instructing Culuko to wipe the shotgun down and to
reposition it, changing out of his bloody clothes and giving them to
another friend to dispose of (they were later turned over to police).</TE>
<TE>   On April 25, Culuko, given immunity, pleaded guilty to tampering
with evidence and tampering with witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   From his testimony in court that day:</TE>
<TE>   Steven C. Lember, acting Hunterdon County prosecutor: Mr. Culuko,
with respect to the tampering with evidence charge, on Feb. 14 did
you know that there was an official proceeding or investigation into
the shooting death of Costas Christofi, which was pending or about to
be instituted?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And did you know that a shotgun, the shotgun that was used
in the shooting, was important to that investigation?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And did you alter that shotgun by wiping the shotgun clean
of fingerprints and moving it before investigators arrived at the
scene?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And did you do so upon the instruction by anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: By whose instruction?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Jayson Williams'.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And with respect to the tampering with witness charge,
again you said that you knew an official proceeding or investigation
into the shooting death was pending. Despite knowing that, did you
tell other witnesses there that they should all agree to say they
were downstairs when the shooting occurred?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And when you told the other witnesses that story, that
they should tell that story, did you know that you were telling those
witnesses to inform falsely?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And did someone instruct you or urge you to urge others to
tell that story to the police?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Lember: And who was that?</TE>
<TE>   Culuko: Jayson Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will have his day in court. His spokesman and attorney
maintain there was no criminal intent, that Christofi's death was
accidental and that when the case comes to trial, Williams will plead
not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   No trial date has been set, though, so as a legal story, it's
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   As a tragedy, it's ongoing.</TE>

<TE>   The Chronology</TE>
<TE>   Chronology in 2002 shooting death of limousine driver Costas
Christofi and legal action against former NBA player Jayson Williams:</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 14:  Christofi is killed by shotgun wound to chest at home of
Williams. Originally classified a suicide, the death still is
considered "suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 17: Williams' attorney, Joseph Hayden, denies reports his
client's recklessness caused Christofi's death.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 19:  Medical examiner rules Christofi died from internal
bleeding from gunshot wound to abdomen, Hunterdon County prosecutor
Steven C. Lember announces. Prosecutor says witnesses may have misled
investigators about circumstances surrounding death.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 20: Christofi's death ruled a homicide, which in New Jersey
law does not imply intent.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 25: Williams surrenders to police to be charged with reckless
manslaughter. The charge carries a sentence of five to 15 years in
prison if convicted. Williams released on $250,000 bail after
surrendering his collection of firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 26: Williams is dropped by NBC from position as a studio
analyst of NBA games while charges against him are pending.</TE>
<TE>   March 4: After his first court appearance in the Christofi
killing, Williams offers sympathy to family of limo driver he is
accused of shooting.</TE>
<TE>   March 11: Williams is charged with hindering apprehension,
evidence tampering, witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct law
in alleged cover-up after Christofi was shot. Prosecutors claim
Williams tried to wipe his fingerprints off the shotgun that killed
Christofi, to plant Christofi's fingerprints on the gun, and to
position the gun to make the wound appear self-inflicted. Williams
disposed of his bloody clothes, and instructed guests to lie about
the death. Kent Culuko (who met Williams at Net training camp) and
John Gordnick were hit with similar charges.</TE>
<TE>   April 25: Culuko agrees to testify against Williams and Gordnick
as part of a plea agreement. Culuko pleads guilty in Superior Court
in Flemington, N.J., to evidence tampering and witness tampering,
admitting that he wiped fingerprints off shotgun and instructed
others present in Williams' house to lie about where in the house
they were at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   May 1: Williams is indicted by a Hunterdon County, N.J., grand
jury on charges of aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter,
aggravated assault, evidence tampering, witness tampering, hindering
apprehension, and fabricating evidence.</TE>

<HD>Good Job, Then Bad Timing for Limo Driver</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Christofi had turned his life around and was a
popular figure. Then came his chance meeting with Jayson Williams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before turning his life around in middle age, Costas "Gus" Christofi
was a petty thief and drug abuser. He went to prison four times
during a 12-year period.</LD>
<LD>   During that span, no one would have been surprised if Christofi's
reckless behavior had led to his death.</LD>
<LD>   But he survived those turbulent years and came out a changed man,
only to lose his life while doing his job. After a night of driving a
group of men from a hotel to a restaurant, Christofi ended up at the
New Jersey estate of former NBA player Jayson Williams, who,
prosecutors allege, fired a shotgun blast that killed Christofi in
the early hours of Feb. 14.</LD>
<TE>   "I never could have imagined in my wildest nightmares that
something like that could have happened," said Sam Nenna, owner of
the limousine company where Christofi worked.</TE>
<TE>   It was only by a quirk of timing that Christofi and Williams met
at all.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of Feb. 13, Christofi, 55, was not working but
stopped by the limousine service to drop off paperwork and check his
schedule. Minutes later, a dispatcher got a call from Victor
Santiago, Williams' adopted brother, asking for a stretch limousine
to drive Williams and his party, which included several Harlem
Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   The dispatcher, knowing Christofi was a sports trivia buff,
offered him the job.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Sure, why not?'" recalled Nenna, who imagined he'd hear
Christofi whistling the Globetrotters' theme song, "Sweet Georgia
Brown," the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thought he would have a ball," Nenna said.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Christofi did. Several of the Globetrotters,
among them former Clipper Benoit Benjamin, later told an acquaintance
that Christofi had a good wit and had engaged in conversation with
the group for much of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an easygoing, funny type of guy," said Chris Adams,
Christofi's nephew. "He liked to make people laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Christofi picked up Williams and several other passengers at 10:30
p.m. at the Comfort Suites in Bethlehem, Pa., and drove them to the
Mountain View Chalet in Asbury, N.J., arriving at the restaurant
about 11:15. The van--a stretch limousine was not available--was so
crowded that one of the passengers rode up front next to Christofi,
chatting with him.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to know his clients was not unusual for Christofi. Nenna
said the driver received numerous requests and had completed 1,700
trips without drawing a single complaint in the 17 months he worked
for Seventy Eight Limousine in Pittstown, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "The people he drove really liked him, and he liked them," Nenna
said, adding that it wasn't unusual for Christofi to send get-well
cards to clients and help stranded motorists whose vehicles had
broken down.</TE>
<TE>   That type of compassionate behavior was in sharp contrast to the
choices Christofi had made earlier in his life. He had an extensive
criminal record that included multiple convictions for burglary and
receiving stolen property. He spent a total of eight years in prison
between January 1976 and December 1988, when he was paroled for the
last time, according to New Jersey Corrections Department records.</TE>
<TE>   Adams blamed his uncle's troubles on keeping bad company.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hanging around with the wrong crowd," Adams said. "There
was a lot of peer pressure. People said, 'Let's do this,' and he
followed."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving prison, Christofi entered a residential
drug-treatment center and later became a substance-abuse counselor.
At his funeral, among the mourners were parents who credited
Christofi with steering their children away from a life of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Nenna said Christofi had worked for four years as a
substance-abuse counselor before getting the itch to seek another
job. Nenna said Christofi talked openly about his past problems when
he applied for a driving position at Seventy Eight Limousine.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked each other in the eye, and I told him, 'I'll take a
shot on you, but don't let me down,'" Nenna said. "And he never did.
He's still very sorely missed here. Not a day goes by that someone
doesn't talk about him."</TE>
<TE>   Christofi, a bachelor who lived in a modest home in Washington,
N.J., was planning to drive Williams and his party back to the
Comfort Suites after they'd finished dinner. But Williams, wanting to
show off his 30,000-square-foot mansion that sits on 65 acres in
Alexandria Township, took the Globetrotters and the rest of his group
to his home, where they arrived about 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, that decision cost Christofi his life when he
was invited into the house and ended up in one of the eight bedroom
suites, where he was shot in the chest. Williams has been charged
with first-degree aggravated manslaughter, which carries a minimum
prison term of 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Adams, Christofi's sister, declined to be interviewed for
this story. But her son, Chris Adams, said his mother wants Williams
to serve "at least 25 years" for a crime that also carries charges of
an alleged cover-up attempt, fabricating evidence and tampering with
witnesses and evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also allegedly tried to convince investigators that
Christofi committed suicide, a theory that family and friends say is
preposterous.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see justice served," Chris Adams said. "We want
[Williams] to pay the price for all his crimes."</TE>

<HD>A 'New' Downtown Is Facing a Hurdle</HD>
<DH>Breaking one council district into three would stall grand
plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELI BROAD</AU>
<BD>Eli Broad is founder of the Broad Foundation and
chairman of Sun- America.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As someone who has been involved with downtown Los Angeles for 23
years, first as founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art
and more recently in working with former Mayor Richard Riordan in
raising funds to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall, I have found
that getting things done downtown can be difficult in the best of
circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, we deal with one City Council member (representing the
9th District), the Community Redevelopment Agency, L.A. County, the
state of California and, on occasion, other governmental agencies.</LD>
<LD>   If the 9th District is balkanized, with three council members
having their own agendas and separate visions, the resulting delays
and confusion could scuttle many projects that are central to
creating a civic and cultural heart for the entire metropolitan area.
Yet, this is what several City Council members are proposing.</LD>
<TE>   Among the innovative plans being developed is one to turn Grand
Avenue between the new cathedral and the Central Library into a truly
"grand avenue," rivaling the main boulevards of the world's greatest
cities. It would be a pedestrian-friendly street with reduced
vehicular traffic and featuring cinemas, restaurants, shops and
much-needed housing. But making this a reality will be nearly
impossible if one part of the street is in one district and another
part in a different district.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, it would be difficult for the 16 acres running from the
Department of Water and Power to our newly rededicated City Hall to
be the year-round public commons where people could enjoy special
activities such as free concerts and celebrations of Cinco de Mayo,
New Year's Eve and other holidays.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers won the NBA championship last year, 500,000 people
from all of our communities came downtown for the victory parade.
That is exactly the sort of civic activity that we should enjoy. The
proposal that splits up Grand Avenue would separate this area from
the rest of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   There also are exciting plans to dramatically expand the
convention, sports and entertainment district around Staples Center.
Splitting up this area into three council districts, as some propose,
would endanger this vision.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 300,000 people work downtown every day. I envision more
people living downtown. I envision people staying downtown after
work. I envision families on weekends visiting museums, shopping,
having brunch, lunch or dinner and then seeing a Lakers, Kings or
Clippers game.</TE>
<TE>   The redistricting commission, which recommends keeping almost all
of downtown under the 9th District, held numerous hearings, getting
input from thousands of citizens. For the City Council to now
consider not accepting the commission's well-thought-out
recommendation would be another example of political greed taking
precedence over the public good.</TE>
<TE>   The council member for the 9th District was elected by an
overwhelming majority of the residents of downtown and the other
parts of her district. To ignore both the recommendation of the
redistricting commission and the interests of the voters would send a
negative message to all our citizens.</TE>
<TE>   This is the time to streamline the planning processes, not make
them more cumbersome. In an era when we must compete with local and
regional neighbors to retain businesses, attract investment and
develop world-class amenities, the city shouldn't be making things
more complicated. We need continuity and focus of purpose as we
nurture the center of our region.</TE>
<TE>   I urge the City Council to not balkanize downtown.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Define Peace Terms</HD>
<DH>Next step is to set parameters for a settlement in the
Mideast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD P. DJEREJIAN and SHIBLEY TELHAMI</AU>
<BD>Edward P. Djerejian, director of the James A. Baker
III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, is a former U.S.
ambassador to Syria and Israel. Shibley Telhami is a professor of
government and politics at the University of Maryland and a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Events of the past few weeks have changed the diplomatic picture for
the United States and rendered incremental diplomacy in the Middle
East nearly impossible.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has made some important moves in defining
a clear American position on issues of final settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It has endorsed the concept of a viable
Palestinian state based on U.N. resolutions and has supported the
Mitchell commission report calling for an end to terrorism and
violence and a freeze on Israeli settlements. It has supported the
Saudi initiative calling for normal peaceful relations between Israel
and Arab states once Israel withdraws from the occupied territories.</LD>
<LD>   We must now take the next step: articulating the parameters or
framework for a final settlement.</LD>
<TE>   Such an approach can succeed only if the president makes the case
to the American people that Arab-Israeli peacemaking is central to
U.S. interests. As has been evident from the recent suicide bombings
and the death and destruction in the West Bank, the consequences of
further escalation include regional instability, tension among the
United States, Arab and Muslim countries and Europe, and serious
obstacles to the global war on terrorism and to Iraq policy. Nothing
short of bold diplomacy can turn the tide.</TE>
<TE>   This process could begin with securing the endorsement of the U.N.
Security Council for a proposed framework, which could be followed by
inviting Arab and Israeli leaders to an international conference to
determine the details of a plan within a mutually agreed-on time
frame. Many details still would have to be negotiated, but the
prospects of success would be significantly enhanced once the endgame
was known.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no guarantee that Israeli and Arab leaders would
come, they would face a unified international position if they did
not. More important, they would face their publics. Most Israelis and
Palestinians want a peaceful deal but still support violent means
because they don't see a peaceful solution on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the American public sees foreign policy as a priority issue
and is fully mobilized behind President Bush's campaign against
terrorism. Recent national opinion surveys indicate that a U.S.
majority believes that the Palestinian-Israeli issue has become more
important since Sept. 11, supports administration involvement in
Mideast peace efforts and supports the call for an international
conference. Given the bloodshed in the past few weeks, the
international community--particularly Arab governments and
Europeans--greatly fears the consequences of escalation and thus
would rally behind peacemaking efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli and the Palestinian leadership must accept the reality
that there will be no end to the conflict unless each side gives up
part of its national dream. For the Palestinians, this would mean
forgoing actual return of a significant number of refugees to
territories within Israel's 1967 borders. The Israelis would have to
let go of the vision of "Judea and Samaria" ("Greater Israel") and
give up Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The
Palestinian dream would destroy the Jewish nature of the Israeli
state, and the Israeli dream would prohibit the establishment of a
truly independent and geographically contiguous and viable
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The parameters of a comprehensive settlement have been delineated
since 1967 in U.N. resolutions and U.S. initiatives, through
Democratic and Republican administrations, and especially beginning
with the Madrid peace conference of 1991. The parties themselves made
significant progress in direct negotiations, including those at Taba,
Egypt, in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   By making the case to the American people and taking the lead in
articulating the framework of a final settlement toward which
Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese can aspire, the Bush
administration can do much to advance stability in the Middle East
and buttress the international campaign against terrorism.</TE>

<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor famous for taking the long
view of things, has offered a new forecast--not about the future of
Wall Street but about the fate of New York City. It's "virtually a
certainty," he said recently at a shareholders meeting, that
terrorists will inflict "a major nuclear event" on the United States
sometime soon. And the most likely target, he added, is New York or
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   What makes Buffett so pessimistic? Maybe he read the Capitol Hill
testimony of Undersecretary of State Charlotte Beers before the House
Appropriations Committee on April 23, in which she discussed the deep
hostility the entire Muslim world--not just Arab countries--feels
toward the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   It's tempting, perhaps, to dismiss all this discouraging news, but
in the era of suitcase nukes the threat from weapons of mass
destruction isn't so dismissible.</LD>
<TE>   So what to do? Beers outlined one approach; she asked Congress for
$595 million--a 5% increase over last year's budget--for "public
diplomacy," which is State Department-ese for public relations and
outreach. That's about 10 cents a person around the world, probably
not a bad investment. After all, the events of Sept. 11 inspired the
Bush administration to ask for a $48-billion increase in defense
spending, plus an additional $38billion for homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, all these new expenditures, on goodwill and good
defense, would seem in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's dictum: "Speak
softly and carry a big stick."</TE>
<TE>   But others in the government have a different idea. Some, such as
John R. Bolton, another undersecretary of State, seem to think the
goal is to speak loudly, rattle the saber even more loudly--and never
mind the consequences. On Monday, Bolton delivered a speech to the
conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, titled "Beyond the
Axis of Evil," in which he listed three more countries--Cuba, Libya
and Syria--that posed an imminent danger to the U.S. So now the "axis
of evil," which President Bush cited in his State of the Union
address as Iraq, Iran and North Korea, is up to six nations.</TE>
<TE>   But hold on a second. Cuba? To be sure, Fidel Castro is a
communist nogoodnik, but does his impoverished country of 11million
really pose a threat to the U.S.? Bolton did not offer reporters any
specific proof, saying only that the Caribbean country has a
"sophisticated biomedical industry."</TE>
<TE>   In this listing of Cuba, one might surmise that the administration
is playing politics with anti-Castro Cuban Americans in Florida more
than offering a serious assessment of the threat posed by the island
nation. But the rest of us could end up at risk because the Bush
administration's determination publicly to label potential foes as
actual foes could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, other great powers have been here before. Americans might
like to think of themselves as unique, but history suggests a pattern
of behavior into which superpowers can stumble. Here's what the late
economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about the Roman Republic, the
predecessor to the Roman Empire: "There was no corner of the known
world where some interest was not alleged to be in danger or under
actual attack. If the interests were not Roman, they were of Rome's
allies; and if Rome had no allies, the allies would be invented. When
it was utterly impossible to contrive such an interest, why then it
was national honor that had been insulted."</TE>
<TE>   At all times, Schumpeter noted, Roman leaders maintained "an aura
of legality"; that is, they declared themselves to be on the side of
truth and justice, dealing decisively with rogues. But the result was
a Rome constantly at war. Soon, as a matter of military necessity,
democracy was supplanted by dictatorship, and eventually the Romans
could no longer beat back all the enemies they had made.</TE>
<TE>   Schumpeter, no leftist, was nevertheless concerned about the logic
of militarism, which always turns reflexively toward war as the best
method of dispute resolution. The United States is not yet close to
that point. But, as Buffett says, we are getting closer to the
destruction of a major American city.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice, therefore, if we thought harder about making
friends, not naming enemies.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft's Gunslinger Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So now Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft thinks he gets to rewrite the
Constitution to reflect his personal opinions. His pronouncement this
week that the 2nd Amendment guarantees individuals the right to own
guns, despite six decades of federal policy and U.S. Supreme Court
decisions to the contrary, is another audacious move by a man who
mistakenly thinks his job is to make, not enforce, the law.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft's declaration came in footnotes in two briefs the Justice
Department filed in pending appeals. In them, he rejects the
long-held interpretation that the 2nd Amendment guarantees gun rights
only to militias, not individuals.</LD>
<LD>   He declares, "The current position of the United States ... is
that the 2nd Amendment more broadly protects the rights of
individuals ... who are not members of any militia ... to possess and
bear their own firearms, subject to reasonable restrictions designed
to prevent possession by unfit persons or to restrict the possession
of types of firearms that are particularly suited to criminal
misuse."</LD>
<TE>   Since the 1930s, the federal government and the courts, including
the Supreme Court, have spoken with one voice in declaring that
people have no constitutional right to own a gun and that government
can pass laws restricting gun possession.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's "reasonable restrictions" language is so narrow as to
turn 2nd Amendment law inside out by guaranteeing that individuals
are entitled to own guns unless they fit a few defined exceptions.
The attorney general is wrong in his characterization of federal law,
which has historically elevated government's right to regulate
weapons over individual rights. And as an appointed official, he's
way out of line in insisting that his own views prevail over those of
the elected representatives charged with writing laws and judges
whose job it is to interpret them.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft first expressed his views more than a year ago to the
National Rifle Assn. As an NRA member, he's entitled to his opinion.
But what about the people scared of being shot at the office by an
angry co-worker or of their child being harmed by a weapon carelessly
stored at a neighbor's house? Most Americans want tighter controls on
gun manufacturing and sales.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's tutorial on the 2nd Amendment is only his latest
attempt to bully the nation into adopting his personal beliefs no
matter what the law and court precedents say. In November, this
fervent opponent of assisted suicide directed federal drug agents to
go after Oregon doctors in assisted-suicide cases, even though the
practice is legal in that state. And since Sept. 11, the attorney
general has ordered mass detentions of those charged with immigration
violations, held suspects in secret and ordered deportation hearings
held behind closed doors--practices that federal courts are declaring
unconstitutional. In the same vein, the federal courts should take
note of Ashcroft's reckless and revisionist view of the 2nd
Amendment--and explicitly reject it.</TE>

<LD>Most Californians have some idea that 14,494-foot Mt. Whitney is the
highest point in the state. But how many people, in any state, know
that the 4,039-foot summit of Kansas is a flat spot near the Colorado
border called Mt. Sunflower, marked by a giant metal sculpture of a
sunflower?</LD>
<LD>   Or that you reach the 1,670-foot high point of Iowa by walking
through the barnyard to the livestock feed trough at Merrill and
Donna Sterler's farm in the northwest corner of the state? There, the
Sterlers maintain a cache of souvenir key chains in a bucket bearing
a notice: "Iowa's High Point, Elev 1670 ft, Merrill Sterler Farm."
Visitors are asked to leave a donation if they take more than one
chain.</LD>
<LD>   Or that you can drive to the 13,796-foot summit of Hawaii's Mauna
Kea, where it snows from time to time. Or that the lowest high point
in the nation is in Florida, 345-foot Britton Hill, at Lakewood Park
in the state's panhandle. Smile when you say "hill," because it's not
much of one.</LD>
<TE>   We learned all this by skimming through "Highpoint Adventures: The
Complete Guide to the 50 State Highpoints," by veteran hikers Charlie
and Diane Winger. We also learn that some people go on a quest to
visit all 50 state summits and that there is a Highpointers Club with
more than 2,500 members. Barely 100 have attained all 50 summits,
however.</TE>
<TE>   The high point of the nation, of course, is Alaska's Mt. McKinley,
at 20,320 feet above sea level, followed by the high points of
California, Colorado, Washington state and Wyoming. The lowest,
starting at the bottom, are Florida, Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   The highest 15 are all west of the Mississippi. No. 16 is North
Carolina, 6,684-foot Mt. Mitchell, named for scientist Elisha
Mitchell, who died in 1857 "in an attempt to prove this mountain
highest in eastern U.S.," according to the state historical marker.
"Grave is at the summit. 285 yds S."</TE>
<TE>   The guide tells us that 14 of the high points can be reached by
auto and 16 by hiking suitable for all the family. Seven require some
mountaineering skills, with McKinley leading the list. The guide has
thorough directions, with maps and lots of tips for those treks that
require strenuous hiking or climbing. Alas, the book does not explain
just how Mitchell died while trying to prove that his mountain was
the highest in the East.</TE>

<LD>So-called fair trade laws were nullified by the courts in the 1970s
because they were anything but fair. These measures allowed a
manufacturer to set retail prices so that, say, Cost Plus could not
offer the product cheaper than a department store. Fair trade laws
were special-interest legislation of the worst sort. The court
rulings were a blow for the consumer and free markets.</LD>
<LD>   But special interests and influential lobbyists pushed through a
new series of laws that brought back a form of trade restriction. One
gave distillers the power to designate an exclusive distributor,
which would be the only firm allowed to sell that brand of whiskey,
vodka or other spirit to retailers in the state. The goal: keep
prices high and limit or avoid competition.</LD>
<LD>   In 1985, a bid to extend this rule to wine and champagne whipped
through the Legislature--the skids greased with campaign
contributions to key lawmakers--but then-Gov. George Deukmejian
vetoed it, denouncing it for what it was, an affront to the consumer.</LD>
<TE>   But special interests never give up. The wine bill has been
reincarnated in the form of AB 1922, authored by Assembly Majority
Leader Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), apparently with the blessing
of Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). Amazingly, on April 22 this
anti-consumer bill zipped through the Assembly Government
Organization Committee on a vote of 18 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop is the Assembly Appropriations Committee, whose
members we hope will put a quick end to this potential rip-off.</TE>
<TE>   Firebaugh's bill is supported by the Wine Institute, a trade
association whose membership includes many of the state's big
wineries, and by a British-owned firm that owns several big
California wineries and is a major California importer of wines from
France and elsewhere. The sponsors say the law is needed to better
enforce state alcoholic beverage control laws, to prevent the
distribution of tainted wines and to create an "audit trail" for
enforcement and collection of taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Its real purpose is to keep small and specialty retailers,
restaurants and discount stores from importing wines directly from
France and offering them at lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   A statement from Robert M. Parker Jr., respected editor of the
Wine Advocate, says all lawmakers need to know about AB 1922: "This
is the latest chapter in the scandalous attempt by America's largest
wholesalers and importers to gain a monopoly over U.S. wine sales....
Now they're after California, perhaps the last free wine market in
America. Californians should be outraged."</TE>
<TE>   Footnote: A wine tasting and dinner will be held May 21 at Kunde
Estate Winery in Sonoma Valley. Checks in the amount of $5,000 for a
couple or $10,000 for a sponsor should be made out to the Friends of
Marco Antonio Firebaugh, says the invitation. The invitation also
notes that the committee is not bound by the new state law limiting
individual campaign contributions to legislators to $3,000.</TE>

<LD>Cheers to Steve Lopez for his May 8 column on District C Supt. Robert
Collins' ridiculous decree that students not headed for college or
the military cannot participate in commencement exercises. Every
person is not college material. Everyone who completes the high
school course curriculum deserves the same commencement exercise
regardless of future plans. Working at a job, which Collins says is
not sufficient, is actually a very good plan.</LD>
<LD>   Our society runs on a basis of everyone making his or her own
contribution based on his or her skills. Without sales clerks, truck
drivers, construction workers and a plethora of other job functions
our society would collapse. Part of education is learning what your
skills are and where they are best applied.</LD>
<LD>   If everyone went to college, who would build the schools or print
the newspapers? It is about time that our educators realize that it's
all about pride in one's work and not about how educated you are that
makes a society well-rounded and functional.</LD>

<TE>   It is inconceivable to me that there exists a policy in the
always-backward LAUSD that punishes kids who have earned the right to
walk the stage at graduation. As a college-bound senior at Hamilton
High School, maybe I am just a "well-off do-gooder," but I don't
believe it. I have a close friend who doesn't have enough money to go
straight to college after graduation. I have witnessed his tremendous
effort every day to take a two-hour bus ride to school, hold a steady
job to help support his family, all the while managing to get the
grades to graduate. If my friend, who deserves the right to walk the
stage more than any "do-gooder" who has college plans, including
myself, were refused a cap and gown, then I would refuse to walk the
stage as well.</TE>
<TE>   I am only a 17-year-old student of a barely functioning LAUSD
school, with embarrassingly low test scores, but I know what kids go
through to graduate, and I know District C's policy is insane.</TE>

<LD>I do not think that Bill Simon will win either, but Tony Quinn has
oversimplified the reason ("State GOP Courting Disaster," Opinion,
May 5). Simon does not need to compromise his social principles. What
I would tell him to do would be to sell his house in Pacific
Palisades and move to East L.A.</LD>
<LD>   This is the real trouble spot for Republicans, and it has nothing
to do with his views on abortion and homosexuality. East L.A. has no
problem with those. It is a deeper problem of connecting to the
common people of California, and Latino is what the common people of
California mostly now are. I'd bet Ronald Reagan could have done it.
But Simon, I regret to say, is no Reagan.</LD>

<TE>   Hopefully, Republicans will get a wake-up call from Quinn's
excellent opinion piece on the possible skunking of the GOP in
California for the next four (or more?) years. I personally was
absolutely dumbfounded to wake up on the morning after the primary to
find that Simon had won. What form of self-delusion had affected my
fellow Republicans to think an archconservative could beat a Democrat
in California these days (even though that Democrat is the very
unpopular Gov. Gray Davis)?</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, someone can convince Simon to come out from under that
conservative cloud of ether and realize that his points of view are
not those of the majority. If he can't do this quickly, we're
probably doomed to four more years of Davis.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Backs a Right to Bear Arms,'' May 8: This may not come as
pleasant news for the pro-gun-control lobby, but the Justice
Department's position on the 2nd Amendment is now consistent with the
original intent of the Bill of Rights.</LD>
<LD>   The claim that the amendment only conferred a group right to the
states to raise their own militias is difficult to defend logically.
The Bill of Rights did not concern itself with the matter of the
relationship between the states and the federal government. Every
other amendment in that document enumerated an individual right
(freedom of speech, freedom from self-incrimination, etc). For the
framers to haphazardly stick in an amendment dealing with a power of
the states would indicate rather disorganized thinking on their part.
I doubt that was the case.</LD>
<LD>   Just because the Justice Department is reversing 60 years of
precedent doesn't automatically mean the precedent was right.</LD>
<TE>   Paul McElligott</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for printing the text of the 2nd Amendment, a careful
reading of which resolves all controversy as to its meaning. Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft's interpretation mistakenly focuses solely on the
second half of the amendment ("the right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed") and completely ignores the first
half, which sets a clear condition upon that right ("A well regulated
militia being necessary to the security of a free State").</TE>
<TE>   The structure of the complete amendment makes clear that if the
condition that is set out first is not met, then the consequent right
has no foundation and ceases to exist; otherwise, why refer to a
militia at all? Today, that condition is not met: a "well regulated
militia" is no longer "necessary to the security" of a state, as we
have a professional standing army. Since the amendment's "right of
the people to keep and bear arms" is conditioned upon the need for a
militia to maintain security, the fact that no such need any longer
exists means that the right of the people to bear arms no longer
exists, either.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure the NRA won't be persuaded; but then I'd like to know why
its members believe the authors of the amendment commenced it with
that reference to a militia "being necessary," instead of going
straight to the right itself? Sloppy writing?</TE>

<LD>Re "Public Defenders Say Judge in Sentencing Furor Justified," May 6:
Where is the abused child's public defender? How do you explain to a
little boy now, or later in life, that his father was only following
cultural "customs and habits" when he held his hand over a gas stove
because the child pocketed a pack of gum?</LD>
<LD>   As a court-appointed special advocate for children who have been
removed from their homes because of serious neglect and abuse, I am
both saddened and appalled by a judge's decision that excuses such
parental behavior on the basis that that's the way the father was
raised. It's a safe bet that most abusive parents were at one time
abused themselves, whether in this country or Guatemala. Shouldn't
our aim be first to protect the innocent child from harm and then
work toward helping families break the tragic cycle of abuse?</LD>

<LD>"School Parking Scofflaws Caught on Tape" (May 7) says that Michelle
Nealy complained that the program of videotaping school parking
violations has "generated plenty of money for the city, but has not
changed the chaotic parking scene at her son's school."</LD>
<LD>   I have a great idea. Instead of ticket revenues going to the city,
they should go directly to the school. This morning, as I dropped my
child off at school, I counted six incidents of "illegal drop-off."
Let's see, at $50 a pop, that's $300. Multiply that by 180 (the
number of school days)--that's $54,000 per year for our financially
strapped school.</LD>

<LD>Re "President Bush's Wag-the-Dog Policy on Iraq," Commentary, May 7:
I am a lifetime liberal and a frequent fan of Robert Scheer, but at
times I wonder to what planet he has moved. Saddam Hussein must be
removed before he does great damage to the world. Whether he was
involved in Sept. 11--and the evidence seems to show that he
wasn't--is irrelevant. He exports terror and dreams of the day when
he can do worse.</LD>
<LD>   I can sympathize with Scheer's desire to expose a political motive
behind the Bush hardliners' campaign, but whether I like them or
not--and I don't--in this case they are right.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Turner</LD>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer's commentary is clearly another anti-conservative,
anti-Israel and anti-Bush piece of leftist rhetoric. Why has Bush
made "ousting Hussein the centerpiece of his otherwise undefined
foreign policy"? Is it perhaps that in the region of the world most
antagonistic and murderous toward innocent Americans, Israelis and
Christians, Hussein's Iraq has demonstrated the single greatest
threat to long-term U.S. security?</TE>
<TE>   Scheer seems to spin every issue to make President Bush and the
administration look bad or inept while taking every possible chance
to glorify the corrupt former president who happens to share his
political worldview. Truth does matter, even if it apparently doesn't
to Scheer.</TE>
<TE>   John Langstaff</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if Scheer's psychiatrist can explain how he developed his
delusional denial of Hussein's threat? How much evidence does it
take?</TE>
<TE>   Walt Miglinas</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Am I completely out of it to consider discussions such as William
Arkin's "Planning an Iraqi War but Not an Outcome" (Opinion, May 5)
horrifying--the consideration of something deeply immoral? Iraq was
generally condemned for its unprovoked invasion of Kuwait in 1991 and
was punished for it. Now the administration is considering an
unprovoked invasion of Iraq--which would deserve the same
condemnation.</TE>
<TE>   What principle would we be following? That might makes it OK?
Aside from such small matters as managing a suitable political
outcome in Iraq and an exit strategy, and the incalculable
consequences in the Middle East and with regard to Arab and world
opinion, isn't there just plain morality? Shouldn't we be working
toward a world of justice and law? Only this can bring peace and
stability; certainly power politics won't.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Crittenden</TE>
<TE>   Lake View Terrace</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see the reaction of the world community
to the evidence the U.S. is presenting regarding Iraqi missile
production (May 4). If the Israeli experience is any guide, we should
not expect that anyone will be swayed.</TE>
<TE>   Compelling evidence of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's sponsorship of terror and procurement of illegal weapons are
downplayed by an outside world that resists disturbing its
preconceived notions and policies. Scurrilous charges of Israeli
massacres, on the other hand, are accepted at face value and are
later only grudgingly disavowed. Ah, for the good old days of Sgt.

<HD>Beverly Robinson, 56; Folklore Expert</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beverly Robinson, a leading African American folklorist and popular
UCLA theater historian who championed multiculturalism and focused
scholarly interest on such seemingly mundane aspects of modern life
as the decoration of backyards in South-Central Los Angeles, has
died. She was 56.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson, a professor in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and
Television since 1978, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer at Santa
Monica-UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 20 years she taught African American theater
history, tracing the development of theater created and performed by
African American artists from slavery times to now. She also
originated a speaker series at UCLA that brought to campus such
celebrated artists as Maya Angelou, James Baldwin and John Bubbles.</LD>
<TE>   Nationally known for documenting expressions of African American
heritage and folk culture, she was one of the first black folklorists
in what had been a field dominated by whites.</TE>
<TE>   Her published studies ranged from "Aunt (Ant) Phylis," which
focused on the role of wise women in African American communities, to
"Home and Yard: Black Folk Life Expressions in Los Angeles," which
theorized that the arrangement of black families' backyards reflected
influences of African culture.</TE>
<TE>   In one of her last projects she was the lead scholar on a folklore
survey in Eatonville, Fla., the oldest incorporated African American
municipality in the United States. One of the most famous residents
of the central Florida town was Zora Neale Hurston, the Harlem
Renaissance figure, writer and Barnard College-trained folklorist,
who worked under harsh conditions to preserve the folk traditions of
rural Southern blacks in the early 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly was like a modern-day Zora Neale Hurston," said Peggy
Bulger, director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of
Congress in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "She really was able to do some of the most seminal work in terms
of what African American traditions have contributed to American
life. She was able to document craft and music. She would document
family traditions and food ways, such as how okra and grits
contributed to American food today. She was able to do the broad
brush of the culture."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson also was a documentary photographer whose 1977 studies of
black life in inner-city Chicago and rural Georgia were featured in
traveling exhibitions of the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   She later produced and curated shows at the Smithsonian National
Museum of American History and the Library of Congress that
highlighted her interest in black dolls and puppets. In 1981 she
organized the South-Central Los Angeles Folklife Festival as part of
the city's bicentennial celebration.</TE>
<TE>   She frequently was hired as a consultant in Hollywood, offering
advice on such films as "Coming to America" and "The Color Purple."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, Robinson grew up in Berkeley. She planned a
career in computer engineering and came to UCLA in 1968 to work as a
technician. She audited a course there that changed her life. Taught
by veteran actress Madie Norman, it was called "History of Black
People's Theater in America."</TE>
<TE>   "My computer degree was my family's goal, but I loved the arts,"
Robinson said in a 1997 interview for a UCLA publication. "I listened
in that class, and I thought, 'I've got to pursue my own dream.'"</TE>
<TE>   She became a full-time student, eventually earning a master's
degree in folklore from UC Berkeley and a doctorate in performing
arts and history from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1978, Norman
asked her to take over her course in black theater history until a
permanent replacement could be found. Robinson wound up teaching it
for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Under Robinson, the course became more eclectic and dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly showed the greatness of culture that, even though it
might not have been recorded, could be seen through performance,"
said UCLA theater professor Michael Hackett.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always an event in her class," Hackett said. "You could
go and see Leroi Jones or four gospel singers from a local church or
someone giving a lecture on Josephine Baker. It was very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson also led an effort in the late 1970s to diversify the
faculty and broaden the theater school's Eurocentric curriculum to
include works from African, Asian, Native American and Latin
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly was the catalyst for change in our department that
established without question the legitimacy and need for
multicultural perspective in our classes," said UCLA theater
professor Hanay Geiogamah. "In terms of multicultural, diverse,
ethnic theater, Beverly led the way."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her father, five sisters, nieces and nephews. A
celebration of her life will be held at 11 a.m. today at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television has established a
scholarship in Robinson's name. Contributions may be sent to The UCLA
Foundation/Beverly Robinson Award, c/o Rosalee Sass, director of
development, UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, Box 95122,

<HD>Michael Bryant, 74; Respected, Popular British Theater
Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Bryant, whose subtlety and power onstage made him a favorite
of critics and audiences during nearly 25 years of acting at the
National Theatre in London, has died. The actor was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant died at his home in Richmond, southwest of London, on April
25, a statement from the theater said. It did not give the cause of
death.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant threw himself into both starring and supporting roles,
quickly becoming one of the National's strongest and most reliable
actors after his debut there in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   "Michael Bryant was the spirit and essence of the National
Theatre," artistic director Trevor Nunn said in a statement. "He
embodied the ideas of ensemble, continuity and loyalty; he played
mighty leading roles and crucial smaller parts with equal passion and
commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant acted in scores of National Theatre productions, including
a long list of Shakespeare plays. He was Lenin in Robert Bolt's
"State of the Revolution," Uncle Vanya in Anton Chekhov's play by
that name, and Badger in Alan Bennett's production of "The Wind in
the Willows," among many others.</TE>
<TE>   His final performance at the National was as Firs in Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the National, he played frequently in London's West
End and acted for several years with the Royal Shakespeare Company.</TE>
<TE>   His performance as Willie Oban in "The Iceman Cometh" in the
mid-1950s prompted critic Kenneth Tynan to write that he "got closer
to the raw nerve than any West End debutant I can remember."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant won Olivier awards, the British equivalent of Broadway's
Tonys, for his performances in "Antony and Cleopatra," "Hamlet," "The
Voysey Inheritance" and "Racing Demon."</TE>
<TE>   Born in London, Bryant studied at the Webber Douglas Academy of
Dramatic Art. He became an associate director of the National Theatre
in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his second wife, Judy Coke, and four children
from his first marriage.</TE>

<HD>Lockyer Says Probe Clears Power Buyers of Conflicts</HD>
<DH>Energy: Consultants' interests in electricity sellers
aren't significant, attorney general says. Separate investigation is
still underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer cleared the state's electricity buyers of any
criminal conflict-of-interest violations Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A 10-month investigation uncovered no evidence that the
consultants hurriedly hired by the state last year to buy electricity
held significant stock or other financial interests in energy
companies with which they did business.</LD>
<LD>   "None of these people met that test," Lockyer said.</LD>
<TE>   The state's crew of power buyers greeted the news as vindication,
while Secretary of State Bill Jones, who first asked for such an
investigation in July, called the decision "completely unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's decision dims the hope of consumer advocates and
Republican lawmakers who had argued that potential conflicts rendered
many of the state's long-term power contracts void.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, as high electricity prices bled the state's major
utilities of cash, the state Department of Water Resources stepped in
to keep electricity flowing to 27 million utility customers. Forced
to transform itself into the largest power buyer in the West
practically overnight, the department hired dozens of consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, the consultants disclosed their financial interests,
as most state employees must do. It became clear that some owned
stock in or had recently done work for companies supplying California
with power. Gov. Gray Davis' administration fired five consultants in
July for conflicts of interest, and Lockyer launched an
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   His agency's review covered 11,000 pages of documents and 56
long-term electricity agreements, Lockyer said. Investigators
scrutinized the personal finances of 21 consultants, searching for
violations of a state law under which a conflict is triggered if more
than 5% of the consultant's annual income comes from the company
involved in a contract or if the consultant owns more than 3% of the
company's stock value.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's finding of no misdeeds does not end the controversy. It
remains under review at the Fair Political Practices Commission. That
state agency enforces other state laws that require employees and
certain contractors to disclose their personal financial interests
and disqualify themselves from certain decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the FPPC fined the Department of Water Resources $69,500
for failing to have consultants file timely statements of economic
interest. Staff members of the political watchdog agency said at the
time that as they continued to investigate, individual consultants
could face civil penalties or misdemeanor criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who first raised the issue of energy consultant conflicts
as an ultimately unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor,
strongly disagreed with Lockyer's conclusions. In a press conference
Thursday, he called on the U.S. attorney's office to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the public is confused and quickly losing faith and
trust in Sacramento," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is also still alive in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, where state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) filed a
lawsuit this month seeking to overturn the state's $43 billion worth
of long-term power contracts based on an alleged conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's suit singles out Vikram Budhraja, who was on the
payroll of Edison International--the parent company of Southern
California Edison--at the same time he was being paid to negotiate
long-term power contracts for the state.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock called Budhraja's conflict "self-evident" because the
state signed the contracts in part to keep power flowing to Edison's
customers and prevent the utility's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope the courts will do what the attorney general is
refusing to do," McClintock said, "and that is to ascertain the
facts."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he found no violation because Budhraja recused
himself from working on the state's contract with Mission Energy, an
Edison subsidiary. Budhraja's work on other long-term contracts that
would benefit Edison was considered too speculative to constitute a
violation of state law, Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Lockyer's announcement "confirms
what we've been saying all along."</TE>
<TE>   "We were confident from the beginning that there were no
conflicts," he said.</TE>

<HD>Dan Devine, 77; Hall of Fame Football Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Devine, a hall-of-fame football coach who never quite fit the
mold, died Thursday at his home in Tempe, Ariz., after a long battle
with heart problems. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   By all apparent standards--his college teams won more than 74% of
their games--Devine was one of the most successful coaches in the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Often, however, particularly in his last two assignments, he found
himself defending his coaching, his career and his style.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't understand," he said once. "I've stood across the field
from [legendary coaches] Bud Wilkinson of Oklahoma and Bob Devaney of
Nebraska. I've beaten their teams. And they say I can't coach?"</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't what they were saying when, in 1955, at 31, he took
over a an average program at Arizona State and turned it into an
immediate winner, coaching the Sun Devils to a 27-3-1 record in three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Or at Missouri, where in his 13 seasons the Tigers went 93-37-7,
winning two Big Eight championships and four of six bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardi a Tough Act to Follow</TE>
<TE>   That caught the attention of the Green Bay Packers, who had
decided after three seasons, that Phil Bengtson was not going to be
the next Vince Lombardi. They hired Devine as coach and general
manager, and in Green Bay, one of the cradle cities of the National
Football League, Devine began learning that winning wasn't
everything, it was the only thing.</TE>
<TE>   At Green Bay, after a honeymoon first season, the Packers inspired
cries of "The Pack is back!" in 1972, going 10-4 and making the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Credit for that season, however, went largely to glory-years
quarterback Bart Starr, who had abandoned a comeback and joined
Devine's staff as quarterback coach--and play caller.</TE>
<TE>   Starr went on to other things the next season--he came back two
years later as Devine's successor and had problems of his own--and
the team never was quite Devine's again.</TE>
<TE>   Players giggled at his habit of keeping his whistle in a jar of
alcohol, and during a player strike in the summer of '74, veterans
gathered at the sideline of the practice field and hooted at Devine
as he sent replacement players through their paces.</TE>
<TE>   By Packer standards, Devine should have been judged at least a
middling success. This was a team, after all, that had had only two
winning coaches in its long and storied history, and Devine's 25-27-4
mark in his four seasons was better than three of the other losing
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Devine wasn't Lombardi, though--wasn't anything like Lombardi, who
had taken the Packers to the heights in the '60s, winning five NFL
championships and the first two Super Bowls. Green Bay expected more
of the same.</TE>
<TE>   Devine couldn't deliver that and when the situation became
untenable, he, in one of the more memorable maneuvers in coaching
history, not only cheated the hangman but stole the rope.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning after the final game of the 1974 season--the
Packers had lost to the Falcons in Atlanta the day before, finishing
with a 6-8 record and three successive defeats -- reporters gathered
at Packer headquarters, anticipating the announcement that Devine was
being fired.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they encountered a jaunty Devine, decked out like a
leprechaun in not-quite-matching green sport coat and trousers, who
blithely announced, "I'm going to Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   And off he went to South Bend, where he regained his winning ways,
leading the Fighting Irish to a 53-16-1 record in six seasons, three
bowl victories and the national championship in 1977. For that, he
was mildly acclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   At Notre Dame, the bookish Devine was following a highly popular,
highly visible Ara Parseghian, and he encountered much of the same
kind of resistance he had experienced at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was he not Vince Lombardi, now he also wasn't Ara
Parseghian.</TE>
<TE>   It was the season opener for the Irish in 1975, Devine's first
game as Notre Dame's coach. Boston College kicked off and Devine sent
in the first play. The players in the huddle turned and looked to the
sideline, puzzled. They didn't recognize the play because, as it
turned out, it was one used by Devine's old team, the Packers.</TE>
<TE>   Devine quickly acquired a new nickname among the players, most of
whom had been recruited by Parseghian: Inspector Clouseau, the
bumbling French detective of the "Pink Panther" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Followed Instincts to Key Victories</TE>
<TE>   Despite some skepticism, Devine regained his touch at Notre Dame,
where he plucked fourth-string quarterback Joe Montana off the bench
on a hunch, then watched Montana rally the Irish from a 14-0 deficit
against North Carolina to a 21-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Devine never could adequately explain that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a feeling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In another coup, this one planned, Devine snookered USC in their
game at South Bend during the national championship season of 1977.
As Notre Dame students demonstrated around a huge Trojan horse,
Devine sent his players out for the pregame warmup in their standard
blue jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the Irish stormed the field for the kickoff wearing green
jerseys and ultimately trounced the Trojans, 49-19.</TE>
<TE>   After his six seasons at Notre Dame, Devine quit coaching. He
eventually went back to athletic-department jobs with his old
schools, Arizona State and Missouri, and was elected to the National
Football Foundation's college Hall of Fame in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Augusta, Wis., Devine earned a bachelor's degree in
history from the University of Minnesota at Duluth in 1948 and a
master's in guidance and counseling from Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   He underwent quintuple bypass surgery in February 2001, then had
another operation days later for an aneurysm, and had been ailing
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Jo, who had multiple sclerosis, died in 2000. Devine is
survived by his son, Dan Jr., a junior high football coach in
Columbia, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral will be at 10 a.m. May 17 at Corpus Christi Catholic
Church in Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Jacques Mapes, 88; Art Director Became Producer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacques Mapes, art director for such stylish musicals as "Singin' in
the Rain" and producing partner of the late Ross Hunter, has died. He
was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Mapes died Saturday in his sleep at his home in the Trousdale area
of Beverly Hills, publicist Warren Cowan announced. Cowan said Mapes
had not been ill, and died of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Together, Mapes and Hunter, who died of cancer in 1996, produced
such films as "Thoroughly Modern Millie" starring Julie Andrews in
1967 and "Airport" in 1970.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout their long association, the two also produced several
plays and revues in small theaters throughout Los Angeles and in San
Diego and New Orleans. They were major backers of annual Southland
Theatre Artists Goodwill Event shows, which raise funds for the AIDS
Service Center and AIDS Healthcare Foundation, among other groups.</TE>
<TE>   On his own, Mapes produced the 1967 movie "Rosie!" starring
Rosalind Russell and based on Ruth Gordon's Broadway play titled "A
Very Rich Woman."</TE>
<TE>   He also produced extensively for television, including movies such
as "The Lives of Jenny Dolan" in 1975 and "Suddenly, Love" in 1978
and the 1976 miniseries "Arthur Hailey's 'The Moneychangers.'"</TE>
<TE>   With Hunter, he produced the 1978 television special "A Family
Upside Down," which earned an Emmy for Fred Astaire.</TE>
<TE>   After growing up in Hollywood, Mapes began his career as an RKO
set decorator, working on the 1939 film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"
starring Charles Laughton.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Navy during World War II, he created sets for
such movies as "Delightfully Dangerous" in 1945 and "Good Sam"
starring Gary Cooper and Ann Sheridan in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   When Mapes introduced Sheridan to his good friend Hunter, the
actress asked Hunter to produce her upcoming 1953 film at Universal,
"Take Me to Town." The movie's success boosted both the producer's
career and the studio's financial future.</TE>
<TE>   Mapes went to MGM, creating sets for "Singin' in the Rain,"
"Everything I Have Is Yours" and "Latin Lovers." He also worked on
sets for television's glamorous "The Loretta Young Show" and created
a popular shampoo commercial boasting that "four out of five
Hollywood stars" used the product.</TE>
<TE>   He left no immediate survivors, and, at his request, no services
are planned.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday it will
not file felony child-abuse charges against an Irvine man suspected
of keeping a 12-year-old Egyptian girl as a servant, but he could
still face other criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI has also opened an investigation into possible
civil-rights violations by Abdelnaser Ibrahim, 41. Authorities said
Ibrahim and his family had the girl live in their garage and do
chores instead of go to school.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District won an eminent-domain action
Thursday on a hotly contested site for a new elementary school,
district officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed Lorin Griset Elementary School for a vacant 9-acre
property between the Santa Ana Freeway and Flower Street is opposed
by some residents who say the new school will bring more traffic to
their quiet, historic neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   The city had approved 36 luxury homes for the lot, but the
eminent-domain action means the district can now force the developer
to sell the land for the new school.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, residents opposed to the school filed a lawsuit
alleging environmental studies done by the district were inadequate.
That suit is pending.</TE>

<HD>Davis Returns $25,000 Oracle Donation</HD>
<DH>Politics: The governor reacts to controversy over software
contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday returned a $25,000 campaign contribution
from Oracle Corp. that he accepted last year just days after the
state sealed a $95-million contract with the software maker, an
agreement that both parties now want to break.</LD>
<LD>   Although Davis has "great respect" for Oracle and its role in
California's economy, his campaign said in a brief written statement,
the governor has decided to return the money "in view of recent
developments."</LD>
<LD>   Those developments include an audit that described the contract as
one-sided and of dubious value; the suspension of one department head
and the resignation of two others for their roles in crafting the
contract; and a series of legislative hearings seeking to uncover why
the Oracle contract moved so swiftly, with so little scrutiny,
through the state bureaucracy.</LD>
<TE>   Oracle's $25,000 donation to Davis imparts strong political
overtones to the controversy. An Oracle lobbyist gave the check to
Davis' director of e-government, Arun Baheti, several days after the
contract was signed last May 31, in an apparent violation of Davis'
policy that his staff not get involved in campaign fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti resigned last week, days after Department of General
Services Director Barry Keene stepped down. Department of Information
Technology Director Elias Cortez has been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said that Oracle had also
contributed $20,000 to the governor on Feb. 22, but that the money
was returned because Oracle had stopped payment on it.</TE>
<TE>   An Oracle spokeswoman said that she could not confirm payment had
been stopped, but that the company is looking into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   In returning an Oracle contribution, Davis follows the lead of
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lockyer returned $50,000 that he had accepted from
the company since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said that, although the money would not influence the
investigation of the Oracle contract that he launched two weeks ago,
returning it "seemed like the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Wednesday, Oracle Chief Financial Officer
Jeff Henley called the contributions to Lockyer and Davis "nothing
out of the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   "Because Oracle is headquartered in California and is one of the
largest employers in the state," he said, "we think it is important
for us to participate in the political process."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and its contract partner Logicon are now working with the
state to rescind the agreement.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas W. Harrell, 90, professor emeritus of applied psychology at
Stanford University, died April 17 in Portola Valley, Calif., of
complications from colon cancer.</LD>
<LD>   An expert on the personality traits of successful people in
business, Harrell spent much of his career studying the lives of
Stanford MBAs who graduated from 1961 to 1965. His periodic studies
of the group indicated that high-wage earners tended to be
communicative, outgoing, energetic and athletic.</LD>
<LD>   Harrell also researched the disparities between men and women in
the workplace with MBAs, noting in the early 1990s that women were
earning less, getting fewer promotions and reporting less job
satisfaction than their male counterparts.</LD>
<TE>   In 1991, he reported that marriage helped the careers of men but
failed to do the same for women.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Troup County, Ga., Harrell earned his bachelor's degree at
the University of Georgia and his master's and doctorate at Johns
Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army during World War II, attaining the rank of
lieutenant colonel.</TE>
<TE>   He started his academic career at the University of Illinois
before joining the faculty at Stanford in 1952.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Beach Stretch Opens After Month Off-Limits</HD>
<DH>Environment: Bacteria levels have abated, but the city is
uneasy that the source is still unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A section of Huntington Beach's coastline that has been closed to
swimmers for a month because of high bacteria levels has been
reopened, but officials said they are no closer to determining what
polluted the beach.</LD>
<LD>   The reopening Wednesday was met with unease by Huntington Beach
city officials and merchants as they prepare for the busy summer
tourist season.</LD>
<LD>   They fear that unless the source of the pollution is identified
and a solution found, the city could witness a repeat of the 1999
beach closure that devastated its tourist-dependent economy.</LD>
<TE>   That closure also did damage to the city's "Surf City" image, and
many residents fear the fallout of another summer of dirty water.</TE>
<TE>   "It may take one year to clean the beach up, but it will take 10
years to clean our reputation up," said Jinx Varona, owner of the
Catwalk nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington State Beach was closed 1,000 feet in each direction of
Magnolia Street on April 9 after county health officials noticed
elevated levels of bacteria considered harmful to humans, including
coliform and enterococcus. Initial tests could not pinpoint the
source of the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Early tests ruled out beach bathrooms and an 84-inch sewer line
paralleling the beach. Tests of the water at various levels from the
sand also failed to determine a cause.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery is reminiscent of the 1999 closure, the cause of which
has still not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from several institutions spent $5.1 million last
summer to test a UC Irvine scientist's theory that much of the
pollution resulted from a massive plume of partially treated sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The results of those studies will be released May 15 at the Orange
County Sanitation District board of directors meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Though preliminary results indicate that the tides are not sending
sewage back to shore, another study found the sewage plume could have
contributed to the 1999 beach closures. Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie
Cook said the plume is the most likely culprit.</TE>
<TE>   "We've exhausted every on-shore source," Cook said. "To me it just
seems so clear that 240 million gallons [of treated sewage] a day are

<HD>Tustin Base Dispute Is Settled</HD>
<DH>Land use: Santa Ana Unified gets 22 acres of the former
Marine air station and $38 million. Deal clears way for city to sell
site to developers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District and the city of Tustin settled
a nasty land fight Thursday that had spurred accusations of racism
and threatened to thwart redevelopment of the former Tustin Marine
base.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, the Santa Ana district will get 22 acres for a
combined elementary and middle school--a fraction of the 100 acres
the district wanted--plus $38 million toward the purchase of land for
a new high school elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   If the 22 acres prove too contaminated from years of military use
to build a school there, or if for any reason the school district
opts not to take it, the city will pay the district $22 million for
the land. The state's Department of Toxic Substance Control will
decide how contaminated the land is and what measures must be taken
before it is suitable for a school to be built.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't believe we are about to cross the finish line on this,"
Santa Ana board President John Palacio said after a special meeting
Thursday at which trustees unanimously approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin City Council is expected to approve the settlement at a
special meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas and Vice Mayor Tracy Wills Worley
paid a visit to the Santa Ana board shortly after its meeting to
greet school officials in a show of solidarity after years of
acrimony.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all of the mind-set of 'enough already,'" Worley said.
"Nobody got exactly what they wanted, but life is about compromises."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders want the deal inked before Tuesday, when Navy
officials arrive from Washington to officially deed most of the
1,600-acre base to Tustin. The city will sell most of the land to
private developers for homes, commercial space and a golf course; the
Navy will sell 234 acres for homes.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement ends eight years of fighting over the former
helicopter base, which closed in July 1999 with its sister base at El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified and the Rancho Santiago Community College
District, based in Santa Ana, were among five school districts
originally approved in 1994 to get land on the Tustin base. But
Tustin submitted a new plan later that gave 100 acres to the South
Orange County Community College District, with schools for districts
in Tustin and Irvine--and nothing for Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The land fight escalated in the past 18 months, with the districts
filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city last year,
arguing that its plan was racially biased against the Santa Ana
districts, where most students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the state passed a law that barred development of the
base by Tustin unless the city gave 100 acres for Santa Ana schools
or the parties reached an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The city responded with its own lawsuit, arguing that the state's
intervention violated federal law.</TE>
<TE>   In April, officials at Rancho Santiago agreed to a separate deal
with Tustin to get 15 acres. That property, along with the land for
Santa Ana Unified, is within the area that had been designated for
the south county college district.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) said Thursday that his bill did
exactly what it was supposed to do: compel both parties to reach an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The city had argued that it could not give 100 acres to Santa Ana
Unified without jeopardizing its redevelopment plan. The city needed
to sell the land within the Santa Ana district boundaries to
commercial developers to help pay for improvements such as streets,
sewers and utilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative, the city offered 22 acres and $38 million to
Santa Ana Unified. But the school district complained that the land
hadn't been tested for toxic contamination.</TE>
<TE>   In recent negotiations, Tustin sweetened its deal by offering
additional cash if the 22 acres weren't acceptable for a school. And
if Santa Ana Unified agreed to accept the property, the $38 million
would be paid in 18 months rather than four years.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the parties opted for a settlement rather than taking
their chances in court. The Santa Ana district needs land to build
schools to ease overcrowding, and the clock was ticking for Tustin as
it tried to move forward with its development plans for the former
base.</TE>

<HD>Simon Joins Push for Probe of Enron</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate for governor denies financial links
to the bankrupt energy giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY</DL>
<LD>Joining a bipartisan push to investigate Enron--and echoing the man
he wishes to replace--Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr.
said Thursday that he supports a full-scale probe into the company's
role in the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "Over the past two days Gov. Davis has been speaking out on the
Enron scandal and calling for a criminal investigation," said Simon,
meeting with reporters at a water conference in Monterey.</LD>
<LD>   "I share the governor's concern....If Enron did, as it appears,
manipulate the market and engage in criminal activity, they should
face the full weight of the law and receive a harsh penalty," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, whose family has made millions of dollars in the oil and
gas industry, disputed Davis' allegations that he courted Enron's
financial support while serving on the board of directors for Hanover
Compressor, a Houston-based gas industry supplier.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had no financial involvement with Enron," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis in recent days has stepped up his attack on Enron, following
the disclosure of Enron documents that show the company sought to
manipulate power prices in California during the height of the power
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has joined other U.S. lawmakers in calling for a criminal
investigation by U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm asking Bill Simon, who's a former business partner of Enron
and who has been very, very slow to criticize them, to step forward
so that we have a united front," Davis said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would welcome Ashcroft's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I am fine for whoever to get involved [and] who would assure a
complete and thorough investigation," Simon said. "That is what
people are owed--the truth."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I've always said we ought to conduct an investigation
and let the facts speak for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   While he agreed with Davis about the investigation, Simon got in a
few digs at the governor. The Republican challenger continued to
admonish Davis to give back campaign contributions received over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   "While the governor has spent a lot of time waving the smoking-gun
evidence of price manipulation by Enron in the last few days, he
hasn't found time to return his contributions from Enron," Simon
said. "Gray Davis has taken over $120,000 from Enron, more than any
member of the U.S. Congress or any politician in California," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also blasted Davis for the brewing scandal involving a
$95-million software licensing contract between Oracle Corp. and the
state.</TE>
<TE>   State auditors say the no-bid contract--touted by Oracle and its
business partner, Logicon, as a way to save the state more than $100
million over 10 years--could instead cost California $6 million to
$41 million more than it would spend otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was signed, the auditor concluded, in spite of
surveys that showed little demand for Oracle products within
California's bureaucracy.</TE>

<HD>CDC Discourages Use of Popular Anti-Gonorrhea Drugs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California doctors should stop prescribing a widely used, inexpensive
class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhea because a growing number of
infections have grown resistant to the drugs, known as
fluoroquinolones, federal health officials said Thursday. The
antibiotic family includes Cipro, which gained fame last fall for
treatment of inhalation anthrax.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention narrows the options available to treat gonorrhea, a
sexually transmitted disease. Only the cephalosporin class of
antibiotics has been proved to work without resistance, but those
drugs typically cost more per pill and sometimes must be injected.
Experts do not believe, however, that the change will discourage
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The CDC's recommendation--part of its 2002 treatment guidelines
for sexually transmitted diseases--marks the first time since 1987
that the health agency has essentially blacklisted an antibiotic for
treatment of gonorrhea in the mainland United States. Back then, the
drug was penicillin.</LD>
<TE>   In September 2000, the CDC recommended against prescribing Cipro
to treat gonorrhea in Hawaii and among people who have traveled to
Southeast Asia, where resistance is widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Bolan, director of STD control for the California Department
of Health Services, said the CDC recommendation is "the right thing
to do.... It's our only option at this point," said Bolan, who served
on the CDC advisory panel that reviewed the guidelines. "It doesn't
bode well when you're trying to control an infectious disease and
you're left with one class of antibiotics."</TE>
<TE>   About 5% of the gonorrhea cultures in California tested in the
second half of 2001 were found to be resistant to fluoroquinolones,
compared with 1% in 2000. The figures are far lower in the rest of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials estimate about 650,000 new cases of
gonorrhea occur each year in the United States, although far fewer
are actually reported. The most common symptoms include discharge
from the sexual organs and painful or difficult urination.</TE>
<TE>   Among the CDC's other recommendations Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Women with chlamydia should be rescreened for the infection
three to four months after they complete treatment. Researchers have
found that 15% to 30% of women become reinfected with chlamydia
within six months because their male partners never receive

<TE>   * The spermicide nonoxynol-9 should not be used to prevent STDs or
HIV. Some studies have found that it causes genital lesions in the
vagina, and may in fact increase the risk of HIV transmission. The
spermicide has also been found to cause damage to the lining of the
rectum, providing an entry point for STDs.</TE>
<TE>   Condoms lubricated with nonoxynol-9 "have a shorter shelf life,
cost more and have been associated with urinary tract infections in
women," the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   * Gay and bisexual men should be tested at least annually for HIV,
in addition to chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea, the CDC said. They
should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Strip Club Owner Guilty of Tax Evasion</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former owner of a Lake Forest strip club was convicted this week
of tax evasion for allegedly skimming $700,000 in cash from dancers'
tips between 1992 and 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Bailey, 52, of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, was an executive of a
company that operated Captain Creams, an exotic dance club.
Prosecutors accused him of taking the cash from strippers and not
declaring it as company income. He used some of the money to open a
club in Century City, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   While attempting to start an exotic club in Corona, Bailey
allegedly gave $310,000 in cash to his former lawyer to place in a
safe deposit box. The lawyer then used the cash to pay bills.</LD>
<TE>   Bailey, a former Laguna Niguel resident, was convicted Wednesday
in Los Angeles federal court.</TE>

<HD>Bomb Suspect's Aim: 'Smiley Face'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Student tells authorities his choice of targets was
based on forming the symbol on a map. He is due in federal court in
Iowa today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Accused pipe bomber Luke J. Helder may have had a strategy in his
selection of mailboxes, if his remarks to a sheriff's deputy shortly
after his arrest are to be taken seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Helder said his choice of targets, when plotted on a map, would
depict a "smiley face," the ubiquitous symbol of happiness
popularized during the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Helder, who is due in U.S. District Court today in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, was arrested Tuesday on a northern Nevada freeway after his
father alerted the FBI that his son might have planted the pipe bombs
found in mailboxes in five states.</LD>
<TE>   Six of the bombs exploded, each one causing an injury, none
life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Helder admitted to planting 18 bombs, 10 of which were not set to
detonate, according to FBI agents. Another six bombs were discovered
in his vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   When stopped, Helder held a shotgun to his head before throwing
the weapon out of the window of his car and surrendering to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   After he was captured, Helder casually "told my deputy that, when
he was finished, he wanted to make a smiley face," said Pershing
County Sheriff Ron Skinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any idea if he was serious or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been looking at those maps that show where the bombing
locations were, to see if any pattern was developing, and I'm not
sure there was one," Skinner said.</TE>
<TE>   At best, Skinner said, a circular cluster of mailbox targets in
northwestern Illinois and eastern Iowa, and another cluster in
Nebraska, could be construed as eyes.</TE>
<TE>   But if Helder intended to add the smile, by leaving single bombs
in Texas and Colorado, he was heading in the wrong
direction--west--to finish an arc.</TE>
<TE>   Helder, 21, remained under suicide watch Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they're observing him more than the average inmate,"
said Dave Romeo of the U.S. marshal's office in Reno, which will
transport him to Cedar Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Murphy, an assistant U.S. attorney in Cedar Rapids, said
Helder was scheduled to make his first appearance in federal court
there this afternoon, at which time attorney representation and other
procedural matters will be discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Helder, a junior at the University of Wisconsin at Stout, in
Menomonie, faces two federal charges in Iowa: using an explosive
device to cause personal injury and using such a device to destroy
mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of both charges, he would face 37 years to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Helder faces similar charges in Chicago and Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Helder's parents visited him at the Reno jail.</TE>
<TE>   After speaking to his son behind a glass partition for 30 minutes,
Cameron Helder told reporters, "We are here to see our son in his
hour of need.</TE>
<TE>   "We told him we love him. I feel a lot better after speaking to
him."</TE>

<HD>Former FBI Official Tells of Mob's Bribes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A former FBI supervisor testified Thursday that he took bribes of
wine and cash that retired Agent John J. Connolly delivered to him
from top-ranking mob informers.</LD>
<LD>   John Morris, Connolly's boss when he handled James J. "Whitey"
Bulger and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, took the stand on the
second day of Connolly's trial on charges of racketeering,
obstruction of justice and conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past I've lied to stay out of trouble," said Morris, who
has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe and was given immunity to
testify. "The only way I can stay out of trouble since the immunity
order is to tell the truth."</LD>
<TE>   Morris said Connolly twice gave him cases of fine wine that he
indicated were gifts from the gangsters.</TE>
<TE>   One time, he said Connolly "told me to be careful with the case,
because there was something special in the bottom"--an envelope with
$1,000 in cash.</TE>
<TE>   After a 1986 meeting, Morris said Bulger handed him an envelope
with $5,000 in cash, saying: "This is for you." His voice choking
with emotion, Morris said he used the money to buy his daughter a
car.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the relationship with the mob informants soured in
1995 after he leaked Bulger's identity as an FBI informant to the
media. Bulger called shortly after.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me I had taken money from him. If he went to jail I was
going with him," Morris said. "I was fearful of the repercussions
against me professionally--that I would lose my job, lose my pension,
disgrace myself, embarrass the bureau."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charge that Connolly accepted gifts from Bulger and
Flemmi and, in exchange, gave them confidential information that
helped them avoid prosecution--and led to at least two murders.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly's defense attorneys say he became the fall guy when the
FBI's too-cozy relationship with the mob was exposed.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. State Senator Charged in Bribery Case Surrenders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A New York state senator surrendered Thursday to face charges that he
accepted bribes in exchange for his assistance in getting public
funding on city and state projects.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment of Guy Velella, 57, also names his father, who is
his law partner; a former state housing official; and a construction
consultant on bribery charges.</LD>
<LD>   A fifth person, a construction company owner, was charged with
helping to launder bribes, Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau
said.</LD>
<TE>   All five pleaded not guilty at their arraignment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, the illicit payments were made
principally in the form of "legal fees" for which little or no work
was performed. It said the fees were paid through two law firms run
by the senator and his father, Vincent J. Velella, 88, who is also a
member of the New York City Board of Elections.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenthau said the defendants accepted more than $250,000 in
bribes from 1995 through June 2000.</TE>

<HD>Panel Loses a Fight Over Appointee</HD>
<DH>Courts: Conservative lawyer should take his seat on civil
rights commission, jurists rule. Supreme Court may be asked to
decide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that a conservative Cleveland
lawyer appointed by President Bush to the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights should take his seat on the panel, reversing a lower court
decision.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of Peter Kirsanow has been fought by independent
commission Chairwoman Mary Frances Berry and a majority of commission
members, who have refused to allow Kirsanow to participate in
commission meetings in recent months. The appointment of Kirsanow
would shift the commission's makeup from a 5-2 split that generally
favors Berry to a 4-3 split, with one vacancy.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Berry said the commission is studying the
possibility of appealing the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Observers said they would be surprised if the commission did not
follow through with an appeal.</LD>
<TE>   The panel investigates civil rights complaints and publicizes its
findings, though it has no enforcement power. Berry and the
commission were heavily critical of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for his
administration's handling of the 2000 presidential election won by
his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration is firmly committed to protecting civil
rights for all Americans, and the Court of Appeals ruling will now
allow the civil rights commission to move beyond the question of
membership to get to the important business before it," Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Berry said through her spokeswoman that the commission was pleased
to have the statute interpreted by the courts and not the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsanow plans to attend and participate in the next commission
meeting May 17, said his attorney, Robert Kelner.</TE>
<TE>   "Up to now, he has attended but not sought to participate," said
Kelner.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appointed the conservative Kirsanow to replace Victoria
Wilson, an ally of Berry. Berry and a liberal majority of the
eight-member panel contend that Wilson was appointed to a six-year
term in 2000. Wilson's attorney, Leon Friedman, said he was
discussing options with his client.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration contended that Wilson's term expired Nov.
29 at the end of the term of the commissioner she replaced--the late
Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEBANON, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A man framed his dog for a house fire so that he could collect the
insurance and pay off his debts, state police said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Boltz, 37, singed his dog's tail and pushed a candle
against a curtain in his home Feb. 16, according to authorities.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested and charged Wednesday with arson, cruelty to
animals and other offenses, and released on bail.</LD>
<TE>   Boltz told police that he had fallen asleep with four candles
burning in his living room, and was awakened by his dog's barking.</TE>
<TE>   In March, however, Boltz admitted to his former fiancee that he
burned his dog to make it look like Jake, a 9-year-old
Rottweiler-husky mix, had accidentally knocked over a candle and
ignited the blaze, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Boltz's property had been scheduled for a sheriff's sale because
he had fallen behind on the mortgage. After the fire, he received
almost $145,000 from his insurance company.</TE>

<HD>Laura Bush Ready to Try Her Wings as a U.S. Envoy</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The first lady and her daughter Jenna plan a
tour of Europe, to include a formal address in Paris on the education
of women in Afghanistan.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The first time Laura Bush traveled to Europe, she was just out of
college and on one of those seven-day, 17-country trips by bus and
train. She returns next week by Air Force jet for an official tour of
Paris, Hungary and the Czech Republic with her daughter Jenna.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Bush, who leaves Monday for 10 days on her first
international mission without her husband, wants to highlight
U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "We thought it's a really good time for us, for me, to have the
chance to travel to Europe and thank all of the allies," she said
Thursday, previewing the trip for reporters.</LD>
<TE>   She will travel as President Bush's official representative,
having been briefed by State Department officials who will also
accompany her, along with presidential counselor Karen Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say the first lady, after dozens of meetings with world
leaders and their spouses, has developed what she calls an easy,
"almost instant simpatico" with them that eliminates any butterflies
she might have about representing the United States overseas for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   She seemed determined to mix fun with business, saying she is
setting aside some time for "a little sightseeing, shopping,
eating--all of our favorite things."</TE>
<TE>   In a formal address in Paris to the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development, Mrs. Bush will underscore progress
toward ensuring the education of women and girls in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By visiting an exhibit of Afghan art at Paris' Guimet Museum, she
hopes to highlight the magnitude of reconstruction needs in
Afghanistan since its Taliban militia, which not only banned females
from schools but also destroyed centuries-old cultural treasures such
as the towering Bamian Buddhas, collapsed under the U.S.-led assault
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the destruction of the huge Buddhas that had been there
for so long is really just a symbol of how destructive the Taliban
regime was, how destructive to people, but also to all the fruits of
the labor of people for so many thousands of years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While in the Czech capital of Prague, headquarters of Radio Free
Europe, the first lady is to deliver a broadcast to the Afghan people
and add Afghanistan's banner to the lineup of flags from countries
that receive the U.S. government-funded radio news service.</TE>
<TE>   The trip also is a chance to see old friends in their new homes.</TE>
<TE>   At each stop, Mrs. Bush and Jenna, 20, will stay at ambassadorial
residences with Texas friends and campaign contributors who won
diplomatic postings from the president: Jeanne Phillips, U.S.
ambassador to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development; Nancy Brinker, ambassador to Hungary; and Craig
Stapleton, ambassador to the Czech Republic, whose wife is the
president's cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Brinker, one of the big-money "Pioneer" contributors to the
president's 2000 presidential campaign along with Stapleton, founded
the Dallas-based Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. She
recruited Laura Bush to help when she was first lady of Texas. At the
National Institute of Oncology in Budapest, they will speak to
patients about women's health and to Hungarian officials about the
role of philanthropy in public health.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Bush sounded especially eager to meet at Prague Castle with
Czech President Vaclav Havel.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a playwright, he was an intellectual, he was not someone
you would think of as becoming the president," she said. She also
will meet Hungarian President Ferenc Madl.</TE>

<HD>Batch of Mail Sent to Fed Tests Positive for Traces of
Anthrax</HD>
<DH>Screening: The tainted letters were found as a result of
routine testing that can be inaccurate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>About 20 pieces of mail sent to the Federal Reserve tested positive
for traces of anthrax in an initial screening, and additional tests
were ordered.</LD>
<LD>   The mail didn't have handwritten addresses or any other
characteristics the FBI considers suspicious, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The tainted mail, which did not make it into the central bank's
offices, was discovered as part of routine testing in a trailer in a
courtyard at the Federal Reserve's headquarters in downtown
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Such preliminary tests, performed late Tuesday and Wednesday in
this case, often prove inaccurate. Swabs that produced the positive
readings will be sent to a laboratory for additional testing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing indicates thus far that there is a real threat here,"
said Llelwyn Grant, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. His organization was not called in to do the testing,
which will be handled by a private lab.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal Inspector Dan Mihalko appeared to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very real possibility this could have been traces on
some piece of equipment," he said. "Until the very detailed culture
tests come back, we'll have to wait and see. It could be mail that
rubbed against something at an outside location."</TE>
<TE>   Mihalko said none of the letters was similar to the threatening
notes sent last year to media organizations and Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "The affected mail was routine commercial and business mail and
did not have any of the characteristics identified by the FBI as
suspicious," the Fed said in a statement. For instance, the mail did
not feature handwritten, block-letter addresses.</TE>
<TE>   The mail did not contain powder, Fed spokesman David Skidmore
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve did not have information on where the mail
originated or where it had been processed. All mail addressed to the
federal government is irradiated to kill any possible anthrax, but
even the presence of dead spores could produce an initial positive
reading.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the mail was addressed to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as
well as other officials, Skidmore said. He said the 20 pieces of mail
had postmarks of April or May.</TE>
<TE>   "Subsequent tests of mailroom surfaces and mail distribution
points within the board's buildings have all been negative," the Fed
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve stopped distributing mail to its buildings
Wednesday. However, the off-site mail facility is continuing to
receive mail.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said it is important not to
jump to conclusions. "I think the lesson that everyone has learned
from the anthrax episodes of last fall is preliminary information is
often incorrect information," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed also had positive initial test readings for a batch of
mail received in December. Extensive follow-up tests never found any
new letters containing anthrax. The Fed said Thursday that it
believes those initial positive readings were "the result of
cross-contamination."</TE>

<HD>Professor Takes Comic Books Seriously</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Is Spiderman's web really strong enough to support him as he swings
from building to building?</LD>
<LD>   Why did Superman's home planet of Krypton explode?</LD>
<LD>   How much would the Flash need to eat in order to run around the
globe in 80 seconds?</LD>
<TE>   The man to ask is University of Minnesota physics professor Jim
Kakalios.</TE>
<TE>   Kakalios is entering his second semester teaching an elective
course for freshmen called Science in Comic Books.</TE>
<TE>   He says using comic books to teach the fundamentals of physics is
a great way to stimulate his students. "It seems by the time they
left the class, they were looking at the world with a more critical
and more scientific eye," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The fun lies in pointing out where the comic book writers got the
science right and where they got it wrong, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Kakalios, a comic book lover, came up with the idea for his class
after applying physics to a 1973 Spiderman comic in which Peter
Parker's girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, dies. Gwen is knocked from a bridge
by the evil Green Goblin, but Spiderman catches her with his webbing
an instant before she hits the water. When Spiderman pulls her up, he
discovers to his horror that she is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Spidey was shocked, but Kakalios was not.</TE>
<TE>   The professor estimated Gwen's falling velocity, applied Newton's
Second Law of Motion and calculated the G-forces exerted when she
went from 95 mph to a standstill in an instant. "It's not surprising
her neck broke," Kakalios says.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion of Krypton is one of those cases in which the comic
book writers got the physics right, Kakalios says.</TE>
<TE>   In the early Superman comics, the explanation for his superpowers
was that he came from a planet whose gravity was much greater than
Earth's, Kakalios says, thus a hero so strong that he could leap a
tall building in a single bound.</TE>
<TE>   Kakalios calculated Krypton's gravity by working backward from the
force required to leap a building on Earth. From there, Kakalios
concluded that Superman's planet must have had a core of super-dense,
and dangerously unstable, material. "Then you realize why Krypton
exploded," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For his final exam, Kakalios had students choose a comic book
scenario to work as a physics problem.</TE>
<TE>   Kristin Barbieri tried to figure out how much caloric energy the
Flash would need to circle the globe in 80 seconds, as he did in one
comic book. She concluded that the superhero simply could not have
eaten enough to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "He would have been able to get the first burst of energy, but he
would have sunk [in an ocean] after that," Barbieri says.</TE>

<HD>Hasek On, Pronger Is Out</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dominik Hasek was back on his game, and the Detroit Red Wings needed
his best.</LD>
<LD>   Hasek rebounded from a lopsided loss, turning aside early and late
flurries as the Red Wings took command of their second-round playoff
series against the St. Louis Blues with a 4-3 victory on Thursday
night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt good the whole game," Hasek said. "It was a very good game
for us except for the last few minutes."</LD>
<TE>   The Red Wings, who have a 3-1 series lead, can wrap up the series
Saturday in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues' prospects took a devastating hit when defenseman and
captain Chris Pronger suffered a torn right knee ligament midway
through the first period. Pronger, who has been averaging more than
30 minutes, is out for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek was yanked in Game 3 after giving up five goals on 16 shots
in a 6-1 loss. The Blues tried to keep up the pressure again with a
10-0 shots advantage in the first five minutes. Brendan Shanahan,
Jiri Fischer and Sergei Fedorov each scored their first goal of the
series for Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Montreal 3--Niclas Wallin scored on a slap shot
through a screen 3:14 into overtime as the Hurricanes completed a
stunning comeback at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes regained the home-ice advantage in the
best-of-seven series by scoring four unanswered goals to even the
series, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's flurry started after Montreal Coach Michel Therrien was
assessed a crucial penalty. He was called for abusing the officials
after protesting a cross-checking penalty on defenseman Stephane
Quintal.</TE>
<TE>   That gave the Hurricanes, down, 3-0, a two-man advantage just 2:40
into the third. Sean Hill ended Jose Theodore's bid for his first
playoff shutout, scoring on a hard slap shot from the slot at 3:57.</TE>
<TE>   Bates Battaglia narrowed the lead to 3-2 with his second goal in
two games, scoring past Theodore's stick on a shot from the slot that
appeared to be slightly screened. With the Canadiens reeling and the
Hurricanes buzzing, Coach Paul Maurice pulled Arturs Irbe for an
extra attacker with 1:07 left, and it paid off with a goal by Erik
Cole.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King defenseman Philippe Boucher, eligible to become an
unrestricted free agent if he is not re-signed by the club before
July 1, underwent surgery Thursday to repair a detached retina in his
right eye, the Kings announced.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, 29, will be closely monitored for six weeks and a full
recovery is expected, the Kings said. Boucher suffered the injury and
a mild concussion April 25 in Game 5 of the Kings' first-round
Stanley Cup playoff series against the Colorado Avalanche when a shot
caromed off two other players and struck him in the face.</TE>

<LD>Sony Pictures-A story in Thursday's Business section incorrectly
said Sony Pictures Entertainment decided last fall to get out of
television production. Sony decided to dramatically scale back prime-time
television production, but the studio still has shows on the air,
including 'Dawson's Creek' for the WB, 'The Guardian' and 'The King of
Queens' for CBS and 'Jeopardy!' and 'Wheel of Fortune' in syndication.</LD>
