<HD>Visa Red Tape Is Tying Up Arts Venues</HD>
<DH>Denying performers entry to the U.S. results in a wave of
canceled concerts. One official says the cost could reach millions of
dollars nationwide.</DH>

<LD>An epidemic of canceled appearances by foreign performers unable to
secure visas to enter the United States because of stepped-up
post-Sept. 11 security checks has brought growing frustration and a
mounting threat of economic losses for performing arts presenters.</LD>
<LD>   The cancellations have been considerable in Southern California
alone over the past two weeks, affecting artists from the Middle
East, Cuba and Japan. The roster includes the Whirling Dervishes of
Damascus, who had been scheduled this weekend at the World Festival
of Sacred Music in Los Angeles; the Toronto-based Persian pop singer
Googoosh, who was to have performed Saturday at Staples Center; and
the Afro-Cuban All-Stars, who have canceled their entire 20-date U.S.
tour, including a Nov. 14 show at UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Also failing to secure visas in time were the members of Hanayui,
an all-female folk music and dance ensemble from Japan that was to
have performed Saturday at the Aratani Japan America Theatre in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The cancellations started cropping up this summer, ranging from
Iranian theater performers unable to appear at New York's Lincoln
Center to a Welsh harpist and Russian concert pianists who had been
booked by classical music festivals.</TE>
<TE>   While government officials maintain they are taking steps to
rectify the situation, members of the arts community remain dubious
and are organizing a campaign urging Congress to focus on the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The goalposts are being constantly moved" when it comes to the
time required to secure artists visas, complained David Sefton,
director of UCLA's heavily international performing arts program.
"There is a sense that it is completely unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Others are pointing to more philosophical concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Art is not terrorism, art is the antidote to terrorism and hate,"
said Mickey Hart, former drummer of the Grateful Dead and a leading
figure in world music circles, who said he intended to start raising
the issue publicly with his performance at Sunday's closing ceremony
for the World Festival of Sacred Music at the Greek Theatre. "The
idea is to expose this travesty to the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Sefton estimated that each cancellation costs his program $5,000
to $30,000 in advertising and promotional costs absorbed and profits
forgone, which becomes multiplied as arts presenters nationwide
absorb the losses.</TE>
<TE>   "If 10 tours go down in a year, you're talking about millions of
dollars in hits across the country," he said. "We're looking at huge
losses none of us are in a position to sustain."</TE>
<TE>   The Afro-Cuban All-Stars, an offshoot of the popular Buena Vista
Social Club, have previously traveled the U.S. and were scheduled to
return with a 17-city tour, beginning Nov. 1 in Madison, Wis. Many of
the shows were planned for large universities that, in many
instances, serve as primary presenter of cultural programming in
their regions.</TE>
<TE>   The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act, enacted in the
spring, places Cuba on a list of seven nations considered to be
"state sponsors of terrorism." The other nations are Sudan, Iran,
Iraq, Syria, Libya and North Korea. The law requires that visa
applicants from those countries undergo extra background checks,
which can prolong the process.</TE>
<TE>   Another post-Sept. 11 measure requires a 20-day waiting period and
heightened security checks for would-be travelers from 26 other
countries; the U.S. State Department will not say which are on the
list, but arts presenters say they appear to be predominantly Islamic
countries in Asia and North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The long-standing visa process for artists involves two steps:
First, the Immigration and Naturalization Service must determine that
a performer is highly distinguished or culturally unique--and
therefore not snatching work from Americans who could do it just as
well. Then the performer must get clearance from an overseas U.S.
Consulate.</TE>
<TE>   New, more stringent security checks are being applied at both
steps along the way to determine whether applicants are on
watch-lists compiled by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokeswoman Kelly Shannon acknowledged last week
that the system was clogged at first but said things should improve
because of "better processing procedures" installed in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The system previously wasn't designed to handle the new security
measures," she said. "It took some time to put them in place, but
we're able to move them through now without compromising security."</TE>
<TE>   But many arts presenters already have lost confidence in the
system and fear more problems. Four members of a loose-knit
consortium of world music presenters and behind-the-scenes operatives
say they will start a campaign this week to raise public awareness of
the bureaucratic logjams that are preventing or calling into question
many scheduled performances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are organizing at a national level to try to offer reasonable
alternatives that accommodate national security but avoid the trauma
and hardships" resulting from the unpredictable visa process, said
Bill Martinez, a San Francisco immigration lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez has started a committee with Isabel Soffer of the World
Music Institute, a leading traditional music and dance producer in
New York City, along with Phyllis Barney, executive director of the
Folk Alliance, a nonprofit service organization in Maryland for folk
arts presenters, and Alison Loerke, a Seattle-based agent for world
music acts.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to propose new regulations granting special
visa-expediting consideration for foreign artists who have proven
track records of successful, law-abiding touring in the United
States, especially when they are being booked by well-established
presenters.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists who have been here 15 times and been written up in every
major paper--to all of a sudden start questioning their backgrounds
is a little backward," Soffer said. "I think having a separate
category for artists is a practical step."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the artists who have had to cancel shows recently because
of visa problems have performed here before, including Cuban
singer-songwriter Pablo Milanes and the popular dance band from the
same country, Los Van Van. The expatriate Iranian singer Googoosh
performed at a sold-out Great Western Forum in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Denton of the American Arts Alliance, a lobby for performing
arts presenters, said her group is proposing legislation to help
small nonprofit presenters who can't afford the $1,000 fee that the
INS has required for speeded-up visa processing since June 2001. If
the INS did not act on their visa applications within a month, Denton
said, the nonprofit presenters automatically would get the faster
15-day "premium" treatment for free.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Chapman, chief of staff for Sen. Barbara Boxer, said
congressional staffs have intervened in the past for arts presenters
with visa problems. But he said there is nothing they can do now when
an applicant is hung up in security clearance checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We get calls like this regularly," he said Friday. "We've seen so
much of it that it's worth raising at a higher level" within the
State Department, to see what might be changed to improve the
process.</TE>
<TE>   Sefton, the UCLA performing arts director, said that visa woes
have been a time drain as well: He and three of his staff members
spent the better part of a week recently trying to get the visa
process unstuck for some European performers in his international
theater festival. "They're all coming now, but all normal work grinds
to a halt."</TE>
<TE>   Normal decision-making on what acts to book is going out the
window too. Sefton said an agent called him last week hoping he would
book artists from the Fez Festival of World Sacred Music for next
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's from Morocco, and I think, 'We won't get them in,' " Sefton
said. "It makes me think about not booking certain major, respected
artists. I think if nothing changes and I've lost five or six tours
this season, when I come to confirm things for next year, I'll have
to make drop-dead financial choices on whether I can take the risk.
That's a despicable position to be put in."</TE>
<TE>   One area presenter has received some good news. Dean Corey,
director of the annual Eclectic Orange Festival in Costa Mesa, said
that Friday was "a lucky day"--it appeared that visa problems had
been solved for three Moroccan horse riders and a Cuban dancer whose
absence probably would have jeopardized the performances of Theatre
Zingaro, the international equestrian troupe that is the festival's
cornerstone event, with a 20-show engagement starting Oct. 12.</TE>

<HD>Egyptian Curators Are Raiders of the Lost Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA BRYSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Gaston Maspero, the first director of Egypt's national storehouse of
ancient treasures, is said to have believed his museum should
resemble pharaohs' tombs--crowded with paintings and statues,
furniture and jewelry.</LD>
<LD>   One hundred years after the Cairo Museum opened, its basement, at
least, is everything the French Egyptologist could have envisioned.
Wandering through its shadowy maze is like exploring the insides of a
pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   A flashlight's beam picks out a 3-foot-long, bearded stone bust of
a pharaoh resembling those at Luxor and Karnak that date back some
4,600 years. Elsewhere, a trio of cupids straight out of a Victorian
cemetery form an incongruous honor guard for a dark stone Pharaonic
figure in the familiar pose--arms straight at the sides, left foot
forward, face imperious. A corner devoted to stone pedestals and
capitals could be a spare-parts shop for a classical architect.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, the basement is off limits to all but museum
staff and researchers. An Associated Press reporter was recently
allowed a rare visit. Once inside, it is something of an Indiana
Jones fantasy, minus the snakes.</TE>
<TE>   The first stop in the main chamber is an area cleared to store the
150 or so items of "Hidden Treasures of the Egyptian Museum," an
exhibit set to open Dec. 9 to showcase objects long hidden in the
basement and other storage sites.</TE>
<TE>   The "Hidden Treasures" include two sphinxes the size of beagles,
one headless, standing chest to chest on the cement floor under cowls
of bubble wrap. On shelves behind sheets of clear plastic are a
graceful, shallow stone vessel marbled in gray and charcoal, and
delicately detailed funerary statues of workers doing tasks for the
royal dead--offering beer, grinding grain. They haven't been dated
yet but resemble those found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, who ruled
more than 3,300 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For years, museum curator Elham Salah had seen the basement as
merely a place for leftovers. Then came an order from the
irrepressible Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of
Antiquities, to choose items for "Hidden Treasures." That opened her
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a discovery," she says. "We conducted an excavation inside
the basement itself."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the basement treasures are tagged, though dust and time
have obscured some information. Pieces from the museum's holdings are
cataloged, but the basement also has become the resting place for
items from excavations and overflow from other museums for which
there's no central registry. Until planned cataloging of the entire
basement begins in earnest, it will be difficult to determine how
complete the basement records are, and how many pieces may remain
mysteries forever.</TE>
<TE>   Hawass estimates the basement holds some 100,000 items, about as
many as in the galleries above that are open to the public. He has
ordered every basement piece cleaned, cataloged and eventually
transferred to new storage quarters to be built next to the museum.</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Actor Under Fire for U.S. Film Roles</HD>
<DH>Cinema* Officials in his country have condemned Don Duong's
war films and pulled his passport. Hollywood pledges help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Duong, a 45-year-old actor once considered Vietnam's shining
star, has been branded "a national traitor" in his native country.
The Vietnamese government has seized his passport and is threatening
to throw the screen veteran in jail and ban him from acting. His
crime: co-starring in "We Were Soldiers" with Mel Gibson and the
drama "Green Dragon" with Patrick Swayze and Forest Whitaker, films
that the Vietnamese government has condemned.</LD>
<LD>   His plight, which first surfaced in media reports in Vietnam
earlier this month, is drawing an unusual and impassioned response
from Hollywood's creative community. Gibson, Swayze and Whitaker are
speaking out on his behalf and are taking part in a letter-writing
campaign to the State Department with others including filmmaker
Randall Wallace, Harvey Keitel and Ken Brecher, the executive
director of the Sundance Institute.</LD>
<LD>   "We Were Soldiers" and "Green Dragon," both released earlier this
year, only recently came to the Vietnamese government's attention
when they became available on the black market there.</LD>
<TE>   "Both movies distort the legitimate war history of our people and
the humanity of the Vietnamese," said the state-run paper Quan Doi
Nhan Dan in a front-page article, according to the Associated Press.
Another paper quoted Luu Trong Hong, deputy chair of the National
Film Censorship Council, as saying, "Don Duong has lost his honor
among the people and has become an instrument in the hands of forces
hostile to the Vietnamese nation."</TE>
<TE>   According to Duong's eldest sister, Susie Bui, who lives in the
U.S., the government seized Duong's passport about two weeks ago, and
the family has had a difficult time communicating with him. The
government last week said it will not allow Duong to attend the Asian
Pacific Film Festival in Korea and is considering a proposal that
would bar him from acting and leaving the country for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the Vietnamese consulate were not returned. As the family
awaits word from Vietnam, Susie Bui said she is concerned for her
brother's safety. "Before he did these two films, he would come in
and out of Vietnam easily," she said. "The government thinks the two
films portrayed the country in a bad image. For his safety, we are
being careful because we don't know what's going on. We don't want
anything more to happen to him."</TE>
<TE>   In "We Were Soldiers," Duong portrayed the commander of the
Vietnamese forces, the late Col. Nguyen Huu An. In the film, which
was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, both the U.S. and
Vietnamese forces are portrayed as fearless. The film also showed
heavy casualties on both sides. In Vietnamese movies about the war,
Americans are portrayed as arrogant imperialists who exploit the
local communities, while the Vietnamese are righteous nationalists.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of films have been done that denigrate the Vietnamese,"
said Gibson, speaking from Rome, where he is in pre-production on
"The Passion," a film about the last days of Jesus Christ. He said
that "We Were Soldiers" showed "the courage of the Vietnamese
soldiers. Nothing [Duong] did brought dishonor to the Vietnamese
people. I think he showed artistic courage."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the irony in all of this is that this movie was
never political," said Wallace. "We've been criticized by some for
showing the humanity of American soldiers. And here is a man being
persecuted in Vietnam for showing the humanity of a Vietnamese
soldier."</TE>
<TE>   Letters are being sent to U.S. Ambassador Raymond Burghardt as
well as to Vietnamese officials. Wallace wrote to Burghardt that "Don
Duong ... has portrayed an officer who loved and cared for his men,
who was wise and ferocious in battle ... and who in the end was even
more perceptive than the leaders of the American government, in that
he recognized that the continuation of America's military effort in
Vietnam would only produce a greater tragedy in lost lives.... In the
eyes of the non-Vietnamese, Don Duong has represented his people in a
way that has brought them honor and respect."</TE>
<TE>   Hal Moore, a retired three-star general who served in Vietnam and
co-authored the book on which "We Were Soldiers" was based, said he
and An became friends after the war. "He was a great leader," said
Moore, who served as a consultant on the film. "The last time I saw
him, I gave him my wristwatch and he gave me his pith helmet, which
had his name written on the inside." Years later, the Vietnamese
government gave him permission to enter the country to visit An's
widow and her family. He said he has never met Duong, but "I think
[An] was portrayed very accurately in the film."</TE>
<TE>   Green-Lighting a Film</TE>
<TE>   In order to film in Vietnam, producers must submit a script to
that government for approval. Since "We Were Soldiers" and "Green
Dragon" were filmed in the U.S., the filmmakers did not submit the
script to the Vietnamese government. It is unclear if Duong submitted
the script or if the government approved the actor's participation in
the films.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier Associated Press interview, Duong said that he was
surprised by the criticism of the film and that he has decided not to
play any more roles in foreign movies about the Vietnam War. Duong,
who lives in Ho Chi Minh City, was unreachable for comment this week.</TE>
<TE>   Also under attack in Vietnam are Duong's nephews, the U.S.-based
filmmakers Timothy Linh Bui and Tony Bui, who made "Green Dragon."
The Vietnamese state-owned press is calling for the Buis to be barred
from setting foot in Vietnam again.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was the Buis' 1999 film "Three Seasons" that was
embraced by the Ministery of Culture of Vietnam and entered as the
country's official selection as best foreign film for the 2000
Academy Awards. Don Duong was the star of that film, the first
American production to be filmed in Vietnam after the war.</TE>
<TE>   The Buis said "Green Dragon"--which in 2001 won a Humanitas Award,
given for outstanding writing that enlightens the audience--was an
extension of "Three Seasons." "We wanted to reflect what was going on
in the U.S. in 1975 at the time with Vietnamese refugees," said
Timothy Linh Bui. "We weren't making any judgments or comparisons. It
was our own personal story."</TE>
<TE>   In "Green Dragon," Duong portrays a Vietnamese refugee sent to
Camp Pendleton who befriends a Marine sergeant played by Swayze. The
film, set in 1975, tells the story of a little boy's search for his
mother and the confusion and fear of starting over in America.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Duong was a pleasure, Swayze said. "We had a language
barrier but no communication barrier. We became wonderful friends,"
he said. "The movie was completely intended to show the dignity and
the beauty of the Vietnamese people. Don loves his country."</TE>
<TE>   The scene that the Vietnamese government objects to is one in
which Duong, having left the camp to see some of America, returns to
tell the other refugees not to be afraid. Duong's character tells
them about things he saw and learned about--grocery stores, the
minimum wage, Cadillacs--and says that America is nothing to fear.</TE>
<TE>   Tony and Timothy Bui said that Duong wants to tell his side of the
story in Vietnam but has not been given the opportunity to speak in
the state-owned press.</TE>
<TE>   The Buis said that they began contacting people in Hollywood who
had worked with Duong two weeks ago to let them know of his
situation. "We're extremely moved that people have reacted this way,"
said Tony Bui.</TE>
<TE>   Whitaker, who was the executive producer "Green Dragon" and acted
in the film, said he is saddened by the situation. "I wouldn't have
raised the money for the film if I thought it reflected badly on the
Vietnamese. It was this universal story about immigrants trying to
find a home. The Buis [who came to the U.S. as refugees when they
were children] are the only filmmakers telling stories about the
Vietnamese. They are educating us about Vietnam. They told me that
they went to Vietnam and were so inspired by their heritage. They
have so much respect for Vietnam and the people. It's so contrary
that it's a hard pill to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   "Three Seasons" was filmed in 1998 and set in modern-day Vietnam.
It intertwines a collection of stories about people finding their
place in a changing country. Duong starred in the film with Keitel,
who portrayed an American in search of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Keitel spent three weeks with Duong in Ho Chi Minh City during the
filming of "Three Seasons." He called Duong "a gentle man" and "one
of the best actors I have worked with." Keitel said that he is
returning to Vietnam to shoot "A Beautiful Country" this winter. He
said that after seeing "Green Dragon," he called his director, Hans
Petter Molan, and told him that he should view the film "to see how
extraordinary the Vietnamese talent is. I felt that all Americans
should see this film to see the beauty of a people we once upon a
time looked upon as our enemies and fought against."</TE>
<TE>   "Three Seasons'" producers, Jason Kliot and Joana Vicente, in a
letter to Vietnam's Ministry of Culture, urged the government to
consider Duong's entire body of work, which includes more than 50
films, not just the two films now deemed objectionable. "Don Duong
... has always been a positive symbol, image and ambassador for
Vietnam in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The Early Years</TE>
<TE>   Prior to "We Were Soldiers" and "Green Dragon," Duong was
considered one of Vietnam's top actors. Born in Dalat in 1957, he
grew up with six siblings in central Vietnam. He studied to become a
pharmacist and worked for a time in a government lab. During the war,
his family was torn apart.</TE>
<TE>   He began acting in 1982. Eleven years later, he won the Vietnamese
best actor award for the film "Dau An Cua Quy" ("Mark of the Devil").
Two other films in which he starred also won best picture at
Vietnamese film festivals.</TE>
<TE>   His breakthrough film in the U.S. was "Three Seasons." The film
won the Grand Jury and Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival
in 1999. "Up until that film, Vietnam was known as a war, not as a
country," said Timothy Linh Bui.</TE>
<TE>   By late last week, news of Duong's situation had reached Southern
California's Vietnamese community, the largest population outside
Vietnam. "I think the whole thing is unfair treatment for Don," said
songwriter Nam Loc Nguyen in Los Angeles on Friday. "He's a
professional actor" who was just doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   But for many in the traditionally anti-communist immigrant
community, the Duong affair is not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "The communist government always claim there's freedom, but this
clearly represents that they still control everything," said Hung
Nguyen, 57, of Garden Grove.</TE>

<HD>A Neighborhood Sanctuary for Mozart</HD>
<DH>In its first musical event, the new cathedral in downtown
L.A. welcomes the Philharmonic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first musical event to be given in the new Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels was, appropriately, a free Neighborhood Concert by the
Los Angeles Philharmonic on Friday, conducted by the orchestra's
music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen. Appropriate because, with all the
new cathedral's size, beauty and awesomeness, it is also located
across the street from the Music Center, where it will serve the
neighborhood as the orchestra does already.</LD>
<LD>   The fitting subject of the inaugural performance in the massive
sanctuary--a room that reaches a height of 95 feet above a floor
space of 57,000 square feet--was Mozart's touching and austere
Requiem.</LD>
<LD>   In this handsomely lighted sanctuary, a capacity audience of 3,000
listeners crowded comfortably into permanent and movable seating, and
heard the performance in rapt concentration. Applause came only at
the end, then enthusiastically and with the listeners standing.</LD>
<TE>   The high ceilings and the volume of space in the large room
produce an acoustic ambience not unlike that in the Crystal Cathedral
in Garden Grove: The listener is awed by the perceived distance of
the musical sounds coming from the front of the sanctuary. One senses
no great distortion, only the sort of low reverberation associated
with an outdoor setting.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, this Requiem was delivered across the large space by
Salonen and company with warmth, astuteness and a tight balance of
elements. Everything was clear but, even only halfway back in the
sanctuary, apparently far away.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra numbered 55; the combined choirs of North
Hollywood's St. Charles Borromeo Church, St. Cyril of Jerusalem
Church in Encino, and the new downtown cathedral totaled 95.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic, which had not played the Requiem since
1991--when Gerard Schwarz conducted it in the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion on the 200th anniversary of the composer's
death--contributed handsomely, and the combined choir, which had been
prepared by Paul Salamunovich, sang with pure and edgeless tones. Not
surprisingly, given the acoustical situation in the room, the new
Dobson pipe organ spoke out resoundingly--perhaps because it was
built for the room.</TE>
<TE>   Four promising young singers--Jessica Rivera, Deborah Domanski,
Michael Slattery and Joshua Winograde--were the vocal soloists. As a
group, they performed most compellingly in the Benedictus, where they
were not competing with other instruments and voices. Otherwise, they
provided little ring in this low-resonance venue.</TE>

<HD>Kahane Looks in Midseason Form at L.A. Chamber Orchestra
Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The combination of exuberance, concentration and deep probing that
has become the trademark quality of Jeffrey Kahane at the helm of the
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra came alive at the opening of the
ensemble's 34th season, when Kahane led a Bach-Pierre Jalbert-Mozart
program in the Alex Theatre in Glendale on Saturday night (scheduled
to be repeated Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall).</LD>
<LD>   It became a festive occasion purely with the bold and tight
performances led by the 46-year-old musician, who in 14 years of
conducting experience has become a solid and masterly podium
presence.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of a demanding program, Kahane led a performance of
Mozart's "Jupiter" Symphony sweeping in its continuity and abundant
in telling details. Too many "Jupiters" emerge arcane, dull and too
smart to communicate; this one glowed with spontaneity.</LD>
<TE>   The first half of the agenda was dominated by young Hilary Hahn's
world-class Bach playing. A poised veteran of 22, Hahn first offered
a pristine but warm-toned reading of the E-major Violin Concerto, and
followed up in the Concerto for Two Violins in D minor with chamber
orchestra concertmaster Margaret Batjer. The tempos were bracing but
articulate, the playing immaculate, the sense of rapport between
soloists, conductor and orchestra thrilling. The participants will
record the two Bach works this week for the Deutsche Grammophon
label, and next spring will record two more concertos for the same
release.</TE>
<TE>   In between the two concertos, Kahane added another Bach texture in
Anton von Webern's orchestral transcription of the Ricercare from
"The Musical Offering."</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of this program was Jalbert's moody and engrossing
"Les espaces infinis," a work the 34-year old composer describes as
"a quiet meditation on the nature of time and space." The piece,
which begins and ends quietly but achieves a resonant climax at its
center, holds the listener through a canny blend of instrumental
colors and combinations, chromatic but not dissonant, and ultimately
pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   This season marks the beginning of Jalbert's tenure as the chamber
orchestra's composer in residence.</TE>

<HD>Some Tasty Bites on Ukrainian Buffet</HD>
<DH>Kiev orchestra concert at El Camino College is a hodgepodge
of kitschy, unusual and inspired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since declaring independence in 1991, Ukraine became a magnet for
such enterprising Americans as Roger McMurrin, who founded a ministry
(the Church of the Holy Trinity), a nonprofit organization (Music
Mission Kiev) and the Kiev Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, which he
and a team of Ukrainians conducted Friday night at El Camino
College's Marsee Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   While the main musical purpose of this organization seems to be to
perform major European sacred works that were banned by the Soviets,
what we heard was a variety show geared to short attention spans,
trying to be all things to everyone.</LD>
<LD>   A truncated edition of the third movement from Tchaikovsky's
Symphony No. 6 served as an "overture"; a pompously kitschy
elaboration of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" by Ovid Young introduced the
chorus. One could hear Italian operatic arias and duets agreeably
sung by the four soloists featured in the "Ode," sample the finale
from Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 and Mussorgsky's "The Great
Gate of Kiev," or experience the cultural dislocation of hearing the
Quintet from "West Side Story" sung in lusty Ukrainian.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there was ample compensation in the soaring a cappella choral
settings by Rachmaninoff and Ukrainian composers such as Dmytro
Archangelsky and Artemly Vedel. Best of all was the interlude of
high-spirited Ukrainian folk music near the close, complete with
colorful costumes and Eastern European instruments like the cimbalom
and bandura.</TE>
<TE>   From this hodgepodge, one could draw a few conclusions. The chorus
is a very good one with a solid, rich bass end, shown off at its best
in the a cappella material. The orchestra's playing, though, needs a
lot of work, as well as better-quality instruments (always a problem
in Eastern European countries). And the shameless hawking of
souvenirs onstage by the McMurrins was unintentionally amusing; it
felt like a pledge break on PBS.</TE>

<HD>Vives Keeps Fans on Their Feet</HD>
<DH>The singer's enthralling concert eases the impact of an
ill-conceived skit on the Latin Grammy telecast a week earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of fans who nearly filled the Universal Amphitheatre on
Saturday for a one-night stand by Carlos Vives had paid good money
for their seats--but they barely used them.</LD>
<LD>   From the moment the Colombian singer started his two-hour show,
the crowd was on its feet and refused to sit down the entire night.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Vives' commanding performance wouldn't let them. The
singer and his superb band, La Provincia, exploded on stage with "La
Gota Fria" (The Cold Drop), the 1993 hit that made him an unlikely
Latin pop star, a long-haired kid in sandals and blue jeans, playing
guitar left-handed and singing coastal folk music known as vallenato.</LD>
<TE>   By his third number Saturday, played from the opening without a
break, La Provincia was jamming like a jazz band, joyful and fiery.
Vives with his long curls was hopping about as if doing a rain dance.
Overhead lights, the show's only stage effect, flickered in precise
time with the high-speed torrent of notes coming from the accordion
of Vives veteran Egidio Cuadrado.</TE>
<TE>   The effect, like the music, was dazzling. So why couldn't Vives
generate this kind of excitement a week earlier when he appeared on
the third annual Latin Grammy telecast, whose ratings were as
lackluster as some of its performances?</TE>
<TE>   For the prime-time show, Vives chose a terrific number, "Carito"
from his latest hit album "Dejame Entrar" (Let Me In), which earned
him two Latin Grammys. "Carito" is a touching remembrance of his
boyhood crush on a tall, blond English teacher from Boston, complete
with grammatical mistakes expected of a student more interested in
the teacher than her lessons.</TE>
<TE>   It also hits just the right note in capturing that awkward stage
between innocence and sexuality. The undisciplined "Carlitos" quietly
longs for his gently demanding teacher who instructs him to write "a
muy perfecto paragraph." Even after departing his rural valley and
returning home, her spell on the boy remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way crushes work--from a distance. But on the Latin
Grammy show, the teacher in the salacious skit, played by the
raven-haired actress Roselyn Sanchez, cavorts with a grown-up Vives
after stripping off her classroom clothing, revealing far too much
flesh for the grade-school students skipping around the stage with
them.</TE>
<TE>   This must have seemed cheesy, if not scandalous, to the average
viewer unaware of the song's sweet message of tolerance for national
and regional differences.</TE>
<TE>   An impassioned Vives closed Saturday's show with that song, minus
the skit, one of seven he performed from the new album. In a
typically charming exchange with the audience, Vives revealed the
tune about the teacher was inspired by reporters' frequent questions
about his possible plans for an English crossover.</TE>
<TE>   "I speak English worse than Celia Cruz," he cracked (in Spanish)
about the famed salsa singer who also appeared on the Latin Grammy
show.</TE>
<TE>   As nationalistic as he is, Vives has an eye for what unites us.
Looking down from a plane, he says during the show, New Orleans looks
a lot like Barranquilla, the Caribbean coastal town that also has a
river, and the spirit of carnival, running through it. The comparison
yielded one of many clever lines in "Decimas," which delights in
enumerating unapparent similarities, in things as well as people.</TE>
<TE>   Yet crossover seems out of the question for this artist, whose
strength has always rested in an unswerving commitment to his
origins. His contribution lies in showing us the uplifting and
life-affirming power of his native music in its unadulterated form.</TE>
<TE>   That's what came across so forcefully Saturday--through his
intense prayer for peace and understanding in Papadio, his aching
nostalgia for his homeland in "La Tierra del Olvido," his heartfelt
offering to a wounded America in "Santa Elegia."</TE>
<TE>   And that's why people couldn't sit down.</TE>

<LD>Bill Miller (Mark Addy) opens his bathrobe to his wife, Judy (Jami
Gertz) and proclaims: "I'd like you to say hello to a friend of
mine."</LD>
<LD>   No accident that he sells toilets for a living, for the new CBS
comedy "Still Standing" overflows with gross toilet humor. If that's
your aroma, this is your series.</LD>
<LD>   It's a blue-collar comedy with occasional laughs. It's also a
"King of Queens" wannabe whose sheer banality stands in sharp
contrast to the Emmy winner it follows, "Everybody Loves Raymond."</LD>
<TE>   You suspect many fewer will love Bill and Judy, who are about as
mismatched as couples get. She's a looker, he's a palooka with a
crude mouth and a big belly fronting a slobby body that looks like an
unmade bed. No wonder she fell for him.</TE>
<TE>   British actor Addy ("The Full Monty") needs to work on his
Americanspeak. He can skillfully deliver a punch line, however, and
this comedy squirts raunchy ones continually. As when Bill pops in on
his precocious, computer-whiz son for a chat about the facts of life.
"Do you want to be smart," he asks, "or do you want to touch a
booby?"</TE>
<TE>   The working class, fall-season style.</TE>
<TE>   "Still Standing" will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Mondays on CBS. The
network has rated it TV-PGD (may be unsuitable for young children,
with advisory for suggestive dialogue). Howard Rosenberg can be

<HD>'The Tramp and the Dictator': The Laugh Was on Hitler</HD>
<DH>Television* A new documentary begins a monthlong festival
of wartime films and cartoons on TCM.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By SUSAN KING TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   During his heyday, Charlie Chaplin was one of the most beloved men
in the world; Adolf Hitler was arguably the most hated figure of the
20th century. It seemed that there was little in common between the
two men save for their little square mustaches. "The Tramp and the
Dictator," a new documentary from film historian and archivist Kevin
Brownlow ("The Unknown Chaplin"), looks at the similarities and
differences between these two men who were born within four days of
one another in April 1889 and rose to fame during the early part of
the century. The documentary, premiering Tuesday on Turner Classic
Movies, kicks off a festival of 28 films and wartime cartoons that
reflect how Hollywood portrayed the Nazis during World War II.
Offerings include Chaplin's restored 1940 classic "The Great
Dictator," in which the Little Tramp confronted the evil of Hitler's
Germany through laughter and tears. "The Tramp and the Dictator" also
features recently unearthed behind-the-scenes color footage from "The
Great Dictator"; interviews with historians, members of both men's
inner circle and Chaplin's family members; and newsreels and clips
from Chaplin's films and Hitler's propaganda films. The Chaplin
family contacted Brownlow after two of the actor's children,
Christopher and Vicki, found the color footage of "The Great
Dictator" in a suitcase in the basement of their family home in
Switzerland. Chaplin's brother, Sydney, had shot the footage.
Brownlow and his producer, Patrick Stanbury, went over to Paris to
look at the footage. "I felt at once as fascinating though it was, it
wasn't revealing enough to carry a 50-minute documentary," says
Brownlow. He didn't think any more about it until his German
counterpart, Michael Kloft, rang him up about the footage. "He said
why don't we do it as a portrait of Chaplin and Hitler?" recalls
Brownlow. "That was the clue--then you could do it." The
documentary reveals that Hollywood was afraid in the late '30s to
upset the Nazis and was careful to excise anything anti-Third Reich
from scripts. Part of the reason for their resistance to make
anything critical toward Hitler was the fact that Hollywood didn't
want to lose the lucrative German film market--Hollywood
exported movies to the country until 1941. More importantly, Brownlow
asserts, Hollywood feared repercussions against Jews left in Germany.
So when Chaplin decided to make "The Great Dictator" in 1939, before
Hitler invaded Poland, Brownlow says Hollywood was "desperate to stop
him. One can understand that." Even after Chaplin made the film with
his own money, the studio chiefs didn't want it released. Finally,
says son Sydney Chaplin, it was President Roosevelt who stepped in.
"My father didn't like Hitler at all," recalls Chaplin. "He thought
he was pompous and ridiculous. But we weren't at war. He finally had
to get permission to release the picture from President Roosevelt.
Roosevelt said that this man should be ridiculed." In the satire,
Chaplin plays a Jewish barber trying to survive in the Jewish ghetto
of Tomania under the look-alike dictator of the country, the pompous
Adenoid Hynkel, who is planning to invade the country of Osterlich.
Jack Oakie plays the equally bombastic Napolani, the dictator of
Bacteria (and a stand-in for Mussolini). Paulette Goddard, then
married to Chaplin, plays the barber's love interest, Hannah. "Great
Dictator" boasts many classic scenes, including Hynkel's ballet with
a globe and his stirring anti-fascist speech at the film's
conclusion. Brownlow says that Chaplin actually put his life on the
line making the film. "The number of political assassinations by
Hitler and Stalin at that time was enough to worry someone of his
importance," says Brownlow. "Trotsky had been assassinated in 1940
and Chaplin might well have been killed in California. He could have
been quietly shot." Though Hitler hated Chaplin, says Brownlow,
because the dictator thought he was a Jew, he loved American films
and even graded them in his notebooks. Greta Garbo, for example, was
one of his favorites. "But he didn't like 'Tarzan,' " says Brownlow.
"He loved 'The Lives of a Bengal Lancer.' " The jury is still out on
whether Hitler ever saw "The Great Dictator." Co-director Kloft was
able to track down a member of Hitler's inner circle who says it is
likely the Fuehrer did screen the film. Nazi propagandist Joseph
Goebbels "has said in his diaries that Hitler concentrated on
newsreels once the war began, but I cannot believe that; the
temptation would be too great," Brownlow says. "The Great Dictator"
marked the silent comedian's first foray into talkies. Ironically,
Hitler never came across well in silent films. Brownlow says it was
only after sound came in and he took acting lessons that he became so
powerful and dramatic in front of the cameras. Sydney Chaplin says
since the 1930s he's heard stories that Hitler adapted the Little
Tramp mustache because his father was so popular. Brownlow disagrees
with that theory. "If you think about it, Hitler loathed Chaplin
because he thought he was Jew. So why would he adopt the mustache?
People said he adopted the mustache to soften his personality and to
look like the best-loved man in the world, but he wouldn't want to
look like a comedian. It was a style adopted by many military men in
Germany at that period." Chaplin has said that if he had known just
how insidious Hitler and the Nazi regime were, he never would have
made "Great Dictator." "I think it made everyone sick when the truth
came out," says Brownlow. "Comedy was impossible once that had
happened." The film, though, helped audiences cope with the horrors
of World War II. "In England, it was so successful that every cinema
in a town would be running it," says Brownlow. "It was a godsend in
England during the blitz." "The Tramp and the Dictator" can be seen
Tuesday at 5 and 8:30 p.m. on TCM; "The Great Dictator" is at 6 p.m.;
"To Be or Not to Be" follows at 9:30 p.m.; "Confessions of a Nazi
Spy" at 11:15 p.m.; "The Mortal Storm" at 1 a.m. and "Foreign
Correspondent" at 3 a.m. The "Hollywood Takes on the Nazis" festival
continues every Tuesday through October.</TE>

<LD>They were two close friends who became deadly enemies, and now the
story of gangsta rappers Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (aka
Biggie Smalls and Notorious B.I.G.), whose deaths shook the world of
rap music, is the subject of a documentary called "Biggie &amp; Tupac"
that seeks to answer the lingering questions: Who killed them and
why?</LD>
<LD>   Shakur was fatally wounded in Las Vegas on Sept. 8, 1996,
following a scuffle at the MGM Grand Hotel. Wallace was shot and
killed following a Vibe magazine party in Los Angeles on March 9,
1997. No one has been charged in either case.</LD>
<LD>   British filmmaker Nick Broomfield ("Kurt &amp; Courtney") has
assembled an array of on-camera interviews that imply that Marion
"Suge" Knight, the 6-foot 3-inch, 315-pound chief executive of Death
Row Records, played a role in Shakur's murder, which Knight has
denied. The film also suggests that former Los Angeles police
officers linked to the infamous LAPD Rampart scandal may be connected
to Wallace's killing.</LD>
<TE>   "I think in the case of Tupac, it came down to a monetary dispute
between him and Death Row Records," Broomfield said. "He was owed
more than $10 million."</TE>
<TE>   The film provides an alternative theory to a recent Times
investigation that reported that Wallace provided L.A. gang members
with a gun and promised them $1 million if they made good on their
intention to kill Shakur in retaliation for the beating of one of
their members.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's family denies he had any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   The film is scheduled to open Friday at the Sunset 5 in West
Hollywood, the Magic Johnson Theatres in the Crenshaw district, in
the Playhouse 7 in Pasadena, in Long Beach at the Stadium 26, and in
Irvine at the University 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, it opened in England first," Broomfield said, noting
that fears of gang violence in the theaters frightened off most
distributors in the U.S. "Roxie Releasing is basically the only
distributor tough enough to release it. Everyone else said they were
interested and then got worried. We're having to pay for extra
security."</TE>

<HD>Witherspoon's Feeling at 'Home' at No. 1</HD>
<DH>Box Office* The actress' hot streak continues as her latest
effort debuts with a September-record $37.5 million; No. 2 "Tuxedo"
is well back at $15.1 million.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reese Witherspoon continued her rise to the ranks of the nation's
biggest female stars with weekend estimates showing Disney's "Sweet
Home Alabama" coming in at No. 1 with a record September opening of
$37.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The second-highest-grossing film this weekend, DreamWorks' Jackie
Chan action film, "The Tuxedo," took in less than half as much, an
estimated $15.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Although "Sweet Home" received mixed reviews, its romance and easy
comedy connected with audiences nationwide. On Friday, the movie's
demographics were skewed 60% women and 40% men; by Saturday, the
percentages had leveled out to 50-50 and included many families,
according to Disney executives. It was apparently the perfect choice
as a "date movie."</LD>
<TE>   The movie, which opened on 3,293 screens, grossing $11,378 per
screen, represents the industry's biggest September opening. "Rush
Hour" set the old record in 1998 with $33 million, according to
Exhibitor Relations Co., a box-office tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   The film's performance is all the more impressive because romantic
comedies usually have a tough time seducing a mass audience.</TE>
<TE>   The only actress who has had a movie to perform better in its
opening weekend is Angelina Jolie, whose video-game-based action
movie "Tomb Raider" debuted with $47.7 million in June 2001,
according to Exhibitor Relations. Julia Roberts' biggest opening was
in July 1999 with "Runaway Bride," which grossed $35 million in its
first weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon, who has gone from starring in the critically
acclaimed film "Election" to last year's surprise hit "Legally
Blonde," saw her fee rise to $15 million for MGM's "Legally Blonde
2," scheduled to open next July. "Legally Blonde" opened with $20
million and went on to gross $96.5 million domestically--making it
one of the few hits for the studio that year.</TE>
<TE>   "This young lady is a huge movie star," said Chuck Viane,
president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. "She is such
a crowd-pleaser. This is the exact right kind of vehicle for her."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon's payday for "Sweet Home Alabama" was estimated at $12
million.</TE>
<TE>   With the top 10 films grossing $91 million, box-office business
has rebounded from its August slump. This weekend was 41% ahead of
last weekend and 49% ahead of the comparable weekend last year, when
the top two movies were "Don't Say a Word" and "Zoolander," according
to Nielsen EDI, another box-office tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   In other box-office news, Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt's
martial arts comedy averaged $4,997 per screen in 3,022 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's comedy "Barbershop" came in at No. 3, holding up solidly on
its third weekend out despite threats of boycotts by some of the
nation's African American leaders. The film, which stars Ice Cube,
has grossed $51 million and took in an estimated $10.1 in its third
weekend--a respectable drop of only 21% from last weekend. It has
become one of the most successful movies ever produced, written and
directed by and starring African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenal indie hit "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" came in at No.
4 with $9.8 million, holding steady in its 24th weekend of release.
The movie has now grossed $136.9 million. By next weekend it should
pass "The Blair Witch Project," which in 1999 made $140.5 million,
stunning Hollywood with its unorthodox marketing approach and making
it the most successful independent movie ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Searchlight's "The Banger Sisters" dropped 45% this weekend,
coming in at No. 5 with an estimated $5.4-million weekend for a
two-week total of $18.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount's costly epic "The Four Feathers" dropped to No. 6,
grossing an estimated $3.6 million for a total of $12.4 million. Fox
Searchlight's "One Hour Photo" continues to hang in there, coming in
at No. 7, with a $3-million weekend for a total of $26.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever" came in eighth with an
estimated $2.6 million for a total of $11.5 million. Buena Vista's
"Signs" came in at No. 9 with $2.3 million for a total of $221
million since its August release.</TE>
<TE>   "Swimfan" dropped to No. 10, grossing $1.5 million for a total of
$26.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although it did not make it into the top 10 this weekend, Hayao
Miyazaki's acclaimed animated feature "Spirited Away" grossed an
estimated $520,000 on 53 screens, averaging $9,827 per location.</TE>

<HD>A Minute Look at Monumental Process</HD>
<DH>Exhibits* Projects by artist Christo and wife Jeanne-Claude
are examined, from concept to staging, at a San Diego museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When we think of Christo, we think of the grand gesture: Berlin's
Reichstag wrapped in acres of silver mesh; thousands of golden
umbrellas landing like dandelion spores on the hills along the
California Grapevine; islands in Florida's Biscayne Bay encircled by
broad, floating necklaces of pink. Christo--together with his wife
and working partner, Jeanne-Claude--is a phenomenon, a stager of
spectacles, the Cecil B. DeMille of the art world.</LD>
<LD>   What goes on behind the scenes to make these monumental projects
happen is also considered by the artists a part of the works. The
negotiating, sketching, mapping, planning, and permitting processes
are intensive. The wrapping of the Reichstag took an arduous 24 years
to bring to fruition. These are complicated feats not just of
physical engineering, but also of political and financial strategy.
They are wild, conceptual dreams labored into sensual reality.</LD>
<TE>   The artists' work, then, is a matter of indoor prep and outdoor
extravaganza. Exhibitions of their work, however, can accommodate
only one of these--and it's not the one with the glamour and pizazz.
A current effort, "Christo and Jeanne-Claude in the Vogel Collection
From the National Gallery of Art," does a responsible job surveying
40 years of work, primarily through the preparatory process and its
material evidence: drawings, collages, photographs and sculptures.
The show, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, is broad
enough and informative. Several early sculptures even deliver a
visceral thrill, but the preparatory works remain just
that--preparatory and secondary. They don't generate the enthusiasm
of the realized projects any more than an architectural model can
match the physical impact of a built structure, or a score on paper
can penetrate as deeply as the music played. That said, the show has
its high points, and together with a companion exhibition provides a
solid introduction to Christo and Jeanne-Claude's work.</TE>
<TE>   The National Gallery show, organized by curator Molly Donovan, is
supplemented in San Diego (its only other stop) by an exhibition of
Christo's work from the extensive collection of MCA trustee David C.
Copley. (Copley's collection is a promised gift to the museum.) The
two shows overlap considerably in content, so their separate
installation does little for continuity or chronology. Each show,
though, helps flesh out the other, as do additional works from MCA's
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Christo has evolved into an art celebrity known
on a first-name-only basis, but his origins were far humbler and his
initial bent more subversive. He fled his native Bulgaria, discontent
with Communist rule there, at age 21, and settled, after brief stays
elsewhere, in Paris in the late 1950s. One of his first publicly
staged actions consisted of blocking off a small Parisian street with
a wall of oil barrels, a piece he called "The Iron Curtain"
(1961-62).</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he was supporting himself by painting portraits, and
in 1963, he took a painting he had made of Jeanne-Claude and wrapped
it in a sheer material. Her face shows through but is veiled the way
the body is veiled by lingerie. This stunning and important early
work from the Copley Collection is matched in the Vogel show by
several landmark sculptures Christo made in the early '60s by
wrapping unknown objects in tarpaulins and twine.</TE>
<TE>   Christo and Jeanne-Claude refer to their monumental outdoor works
as "gentle disturbances." These early mysterious bundles of Christo's
operate similarly, upsetting the conventional relationship between
art object and viewer. The wrapping is a ploy, a promise, a paradox.
It makes unviewable whatever is beneath the tarps, even as the
object's sole function, as sculpture, is to be viewed. These
remarkable early sculptures nod to Duchamp, and evoke as well a
Surrealist sense of poetic displacement that captivated Christo early
on. As an exile, and something of a nomad (the artists moved to New
York in 1964, but continue to work internationally), displacement
remains an undercurrent.</TE>
<TE>   The technique of wrapping also resonated well with the Pop era's
preoccupation with consumer culture and the politics of display. Such
latent meanings seem largely to fall away, however, as the work
expanded to grand, environmental scale, beginning with the
one-million- square-foot "Wrapped Coast" in Sydney, Australia.
Temporary gestures of spectacular drama, the environmental works are
Christo's audacious answer to the oppressive system he grew up under
in Bulgaria. Through the work, he flaunts his freedom from social or
political imperatives. He and Jeanne-Claude have refused outside
sponsorship; they sell preparatory works like those in the exhibition
to fund the large-scale projects.</TE>
<TE>   The outdoor works all engage boundaries of some sort, whether in
the form of wrapping (the Reichstag, Pont Neuf, a grove of trees) or
installing a fence ("Running Fence" 1972), a curtain ("Valley
Curtain" 1970-72) or a canopy, as in a project planned for the
Arkansas River in Colorado. Using fluid, vibrant fabrics, Christo and
Jeanne-Claude evoke skin and its coverings, aligning their work with
the long art history of draped fabric more consistently than with any
particular style or school.</TE>
<TE>   Outrageous physicality is what excites about Christo and
Jeanne-Claude's work. The drawings, collages and photographs here are
well-executed, and all make a valiant effort to convey that essential
relationship of viewer to place, but scale, time and movement are
missing. Without these, the work's core appeal remains under wraps.</TE>

<HD>Strong Cast Overcomes 'Othello's' Unusual Nuances</HD>
<DH>Resourceful San Francisco Ballet excels despite material
that raises more questions than it answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shakespeare's genius in "Othello" is partly to keep us from asking
when there's been time or opportunity for Desdemona to have slept
with Cassio. (There hasn't been any.) But questions about what's
going on in Lar Lubovitch's "Othello," danced by San Francisco Ballet
in its Southern California premiere over the weekend at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, start at the very beginning.</LD>
<LD>   Who is that solitary figure in front of the drop curtain painted
with enigmatic symbols, and what is he doing? Is it Othello or Iago,
his nemesis? It takes a minute to realize it's Othello, and he's
engaging in some kind of devotional ritual before his marriage to
Desdemona.</LD>
<LD>   The action establishes him as a cultural outsider. It also
initiates an intriguing entry into the narrative, as sets of huge
glass panels designed by George Tsypin slide open to reveal other
characters behind him. It's a potent suggestion that the events are
going to be viewed through Othello's mind, perhaps as distortions.</LD>
<TE>   But other questions that come up in the overlong, overwrought
ballet version--based on Shakespeare's source, rather than his
play--aren't so rich, rewarding or answerable.</TE>
<TE>   Why does Emilia, Iago's wife, adore him when he's so abusive to
her? Can we really believe his falling at her feet at the end of
their duet that closes the first act? Why does Othello, who has been
steadfastly ignoring Iago, suddenly begin trusting him? Why does
Desdemona, who has recoiled from Iago, suddenly seek comfort in his
arms? Why do the second and third acts end so anticlimactically?</TE>
<TE>   Few people in the audience Saturday evening seemed troubled by
these or other questions as Yuri Possokhov as Othello and Yuan Yuan
Tan as Desdemona dominated a resourceful, committed San Francisco
Ballet cast whose dedication extended from principals to all the
corps members.</TE>
<TE>   Possokhov brought heroic weight, seriousness and powerful,
sometimes labored virtuosity to the title role, even when it required
such excessive descent into maddened jealously. Tan was lithe,
lyrical and loving as Desdemona.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalo Garcia made a boyish, devoted, totally unthreatening
Cassio. Parrish Maynard was an intense Iago, even in the crazed
kinetic distortions Lubovitch thought appropriate to telegraph evil.
Katita Waldo was a sympathetic Emilia. It's more the choreographer's
fault than hers that we know less about the character at the end than
at the beginning of the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   As Bianca, a whore of Cypress and supposed mistress of Cassio,
Lorena Feijoo turned up the heat at the second-act party
sufficiently. Dalene Bramer, Megan Low, Caroline Loyola, Kester
Cotton and James Sofranko kept their dignity as the bizarre first-act
divertissement dancers who would have been thrown out of any real
state marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Neal Stulberg expertly conducted members of the Pacific Symphony
in Elliot Goldenthal's derivative though masterly orchestrated

<LD>See pop choirboy Paul McCartney in the custody of Japanese
authorities after being busted for marijuana possession. See
hard-rock bad boy Axl Rose in a not-unflattering police mug shot
taken when the Guns N' Roses singer was arrested in connection with
assault and property damage after jumping into the crowd at a
Milwaukee concert to stop a fan from snapping photos. See fugitive
rock star David Crosby after being nabbed and charged with cocaine
and weapons possession.</LD>
<LD>   See them all starting Thursday at 10 p.m. in a new episode of the
"VH1: All Access" series titled "Rock's Most Outrageous Busts!"
Already famous for its "Behind the Music" profiles of the ups and
downs of rock stars' lives, the channel digs deeper into the
underbelly of pop music with a show that could have been called "VH1:
Behind Bars."</LD>
<LD>   It promises to be a feast for fans who can't get enough of
musicians' walks on the wild side. To chronicle the travails of
dozens of rockers, rappers and punks who fought the law and the law
won, the show will use police logs, booking photos and court records,
along with interviews of the lawyers who represented them, the
officers who brought them in and the PR agents who struggled to put a
positive spin on it all.</LD>
<TE>   The show spans virtually the entire history of rock 'n' roll, from
Elvis Presley's arrest in 1956 after a fight with two gas station
attendants in Memphis, up through R&amp;B singer R. Kelly's indictment in
June on 21 counts of child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   In between, it covers a gamut of offenses, some of which now sound
quaint (Janis Joplin's 1967 arrest on two counts of vulgar and
indecent language), some just plain bizarre (James Brown's infamous
high-speed flight from police across two states in 1988, during which
officers shot out all his tires) and some sadly sordid (Sex Pistols
bassist Sid Vicious, charged in 1978 for the death of his girlfriend,
Nancy Spungen, after which he died of a heroin overdose while on bail
awaiting trial).</TE>
<TE>   The point? "Even if you're a big rock star, it's probably not a
good idea to pack drugs in your suitcase or expose yourself in a
public restroom," says executive producer Brad Abramson.</TE>

<HD>New World Teaches Old World Some Diverse Latin Dance Steps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LYON, France--Europeans first blundered into Latin America in 1492,
but 510 years later, genuine cultural discoveries have been taking
place night after night in this city of nearly 1.1 million. A
festival of Latin American dance, on a scale never before seen here,
has enabled the Old World to reappraise the New and even discover
what's missing in its own dance culture.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly devoted to contemporary choreography, Lyon's 10th Biennale
de la Danse opened Sept. 10 with companies from Brazil, Venezuela and
Mexico. By the end of the week, it added Chileans, Argentines,
Bolivians and Colombians. And by the festival's end Sunday, five
additional countries came on board.</LD>
<LD>   On the first Sunday, the daily schedule of half a dozen
performances was suspended in favor of an event that allowed French
choreographers and community groups to respond to the Latin American
theme: a grand defile along the banks of the Rhone River.</LD>
<TE>   Traditionally, a defile is a throwback to ballet's aristocratic
origins, presenting a classical company in a formal march. First the
lowly apprentices and the corps take their places onstage, then the
soloists, principals and finally the stars.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Lyon defile celebrated creativity instead of
hierarchy, enlisting 29 companies and about 4,500 performers--all
expressing their feelings about Latin culture down a mile-long route
for an audience estimated at more than 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Besides devotees of the mambo, the samba, the rumba and Latin
rock, you could find feathered serpents galore, giant puppets and
what seemed like every stilt dancer alive, even some on wheels. Some
of the presentations proved simple and startling: more than 100 tango
dancers, for instance, moving stylishly down the street--nearly all
of them blind.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments aimed for a more political effect. Depicting the
shantytowns of Rio and other South American cities, one giant float
looked like a contemporary cityscape from the front, but when it
passed by, the back of it showed poor people living, and dancing, in
trash boxes. A drug dealer counted his profits while overdressed
women pushed shopping carts loaded with chunks of the Amazon rain
forest. Imagine seeing that on New Year's Day in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the French participants, four of the Latin American
performing companies also took to the streets--Bolivian and Colombian
folkloric dancers who earlier had presented a glorious "Latino
Carnivals" program.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was a guest Carnival dancer: the Biennale's artistic
director, Guy Darmet, high-stepping along the route, hand in hand
with two masked devils.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Darmet, 55, had described the defile as the jewel
in the crown of his festival. "I think this is the first time that we
have succeeded in being totally a part of the life of the city," he
said of the latest Biennale. "At the beginning [in 1984], we were
trying to reach the highest artistic level, but now we know what that
level is and we can work on the audience, to be a meeting point."</TE>
<TE>   Each Biennale has had a different theme or geographical focus, and
Darmet said that the choice of Latin America for 2002 sprang from his
view of the region as a neglected but important sphere of creativity.
"In this Biennale, I tried to fight against cliches," he explained.
"I'm trying to give an impression of what dance really is in Latin
America today.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of young companies because they are the reality of
what's happening, even if in their own country it's only 20 people or
40 people in the hall." In all of them, Darmet finds a connection to
the popular culture of their homelands--what he calls "something very
strong from their roots, their histories, their cultures."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't say it's the same thing in every country," he continued,
"But they all have a lot of energy, commitment, and when they are
dancing, they are fighting--against the politicians of their
countries, against the absence of interest of the audience, but
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "In contemporary dance in Europe, companies don't have to fight,
and they are maybe a little bit spoiled. These days, you can take
between five and 10 groups and do all the dance festivals in a year
and the full seasons at most of the theaters. But for me, dance is
not only five or 10 groups."</TE>
<TE>   For Darmet, then, "globalization" is not a dirty word but an
invitation "to be open to the world," and to bring it to Lyon. "We
speak of world music but not as often about world dance," he
commented, "and I don't mean only the ethnic things. We find
important quality choreographers everywhere and we try to open doors
for them through the Biennale."</TE>
<TE>   One Biennale tradition is a daily multilingual press conference.
Held every morning at Lyon's Museum of Decorative Art, the sessions
tried to mediate between the artistic priorities of the Latin
American performers and the expectations of critics and reporters.
Insights from the choreographers encouraged everyone to see their
creations through the eyes of their cultures. And it helped.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, knowing that Chile's Paulina Mellado S. wanted to
work with actors, rather than dancers, helped account for the raw
physicality and emotionalism of her dance drama "Place of Desire,"
which had its European premiere late in the first week. When she had
a man kick a woman, it didn't look like a dance step or a motif but
an ugly and dangerous expression of machismo brutality.</TE>
<TE>   The tone of the press conferences remained convivial even when
disputes arose. At the Biennale's official public forums, however,
the gloves came off. At the first one, for example, Costa Rican
choreographer Alejandro Tosatti called the term "Latin America"
bogus--"a French notion." In his view, each country's social and
political identity and its effect on dance were unique.</TE>
<TE>   However, Tosatti also emphasized that the publicity generated by
the Biennale and similar events "gives us visibility in our own
countries." Similarly, Brazilian choreographer Lia Rodrigues told the
forum participants that companies involved in the 1996 Biennale,
which was devoted to her nation, "found more space and opportunities
to work as a result of their participation. So we need the
perspective of outsiders."</TE>
<TE>   To this outsider, three contemporary companies in the first week
of the Biennale were as impressive as anything programmed this year
at UCLA or the Irvine Barclay Theatre, the Southland's primary sites
for modernist expression.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's Danzahoy physicalized a tragic worldview with great
power. The same country's Dramo Dramaturgia del Movimiento made an
alternately touching and scary dance ritual from the unlikely subject
of child abuse. And Brazil's Quasar unleashed a hybrid style as
sophisticated and distinctive as any danced anywhere. In addition,
the recontextualized hip-hop of Brazil's Bale de Rua and the "Latino
Carnivals" groups offered high excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Darmet promised us revelations from an undiscovered dance world
and proved his point with dazzling certainty. So, anyone searching
for the next Big Thing in an art that definitely needs new blood
could do far worse than spend time in a city mad for Latino modernism
and creative adventure. Los Angeles should be so lucky.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--Olivier Messiaen's opera, "Saint Francois d'Assise,"
is very long and contains little external drama. The composer's own
plot synopsis of the fifth of the opera's eight scenes, for instance,
describes the action in two brisk sentences. An angel appears to
Francis and plays for him a solo on the viol. That foretaste of
celestial bliss is so pleasant that the saint swoons.</LD>
<LD>   Yet you might also say that the opera's five hours are a short
time in which to observe the progress of grace in the soul of St.
Francis of Assisi, which was Messiaen's insistent intent. You could
even say that time has nothing at all to do with this intently
spiritual journey. It takes as long as it takes. It might be an
exaggeration to say that time flies during this opera, but it is less
of one to say that time seems to stop altogether.</LD>
<LD>   It is hardly surprising that such a demanding opera, which had its
first American staging at the San Francisco Opera on Friday night,
has taken two decades since its Paris premiere to reach our shores.
It is a simple, direct, unquestioning, utterly religious and dazzling
ritual of music theater expressed through mind-blowingly flamboyant
and complex music.</LD>
<TE>   Americans, of course, typically receive just the opposite in
opera--morally ambiguous, flamboyant subjects expressed with naive,
unsophisticated music. And no place has been prouder of that penchant
than San Francisco Opera, which brought us Jake Heggie's "Dead Man
Walking." But this stunning, overwhelming "Saint Francois"--the first
new production for which Pamela Rosenberg is responsible since
becoming its general manager last season--San Francisco has suddenly,
spectacularly, stopped underestimating its audience.</TE>
<TE>   There are several ironies in "Saint Francois" first landing in
America in the town of the saint's Spanish namesake. When the Paris
Opera commissioned its most celebrated living musician to write an
opera in 1975, it was hardly prepared for the uncompromising
spiritual extravaganza it got.</TE>
<TE>   The work is immense, asking for an orchestra of 110 and a chorus
of 150. It utilizes three Ondes Martinot, the obscure Space Agey
electronic keyboard to which Messiaen had been devoted since the
'40s, and a forest of percussion instruments. An avid student of bird
song, Messiaen requires the orchestra to erupt in continual,
captivating, brilliant bird song. A pioneering avant-gardist who led
the movement toward the mathematical serialization in the '50s but
who also was an unflinching sonic hedonist who loved nothing better
than orgasmic sensuality, the composer somehow found a way to put it
all into this devout work.</TE>
<TE>   At its premiere in 1983, which Seiji Ozawa conducted, "Saint
Francois" was thought of, even in Paris, as a kind of peculiarly
French indulgence, an opera that, at best, would never get beyond the
most distant fringes of the repertory. In fact, that might have been
the case for quite some time were it not for American ingenuity and
dedication. Kent Nagano, Ozawa's assistant for the premiere, helped
keep the music alive in early concert performances in the
Netherlands, London and Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a celebrated production at the Salzburg Festival in
1992, the year Messiaen died, that first won over the opera world.
That production, staged by Peter Sellars and featuring the Los
Angeles Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, was promised for
Los Angeles Opera as well, but it never arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco production, entrusted to a German team, is
nothing as elaborate as was the Salzburg staging, but despite a few
Germanisms (the inevitable fedoras and trench coats), it is very
well-thought out. Messiaen wrote his opera as a series of scenes in
the progress of Francis' spiritual enlightenment. Francis overcomes
fear by kissing a leper, is transformed by meeting an angel, becomes
one with nature penetrating the Babel of bird song in his sermon to
the birds, finds the ultimate joy in agony as he receives the
stigmata and moves on to higher realms at his death, which set the
very War Memorial Opera House vibrating along with the tolling of
otherworldly bells.</TE>
<TE>   The central image in Hans Dieter-Schaal's graceful set is a curved
road, which revolves to provide grottoes and monastery rooms. Nicolas
Brieger begins his production with a video production of the 1997
earthquake in Assisi, and he places the opera in a gloomy atmosphere
of ruin, helping to give a bit of dramatic contrast to Francis'
saintliness. There are inappropriate sparks of whimsy. The stigmata
scene, in which Francis stands erect on a rising pillar, is amazing.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, this will likely go down as one of the company's
greatest achievements. It could not fit all the players Messiaen
wanted in the pit, so there were fewer strings than ideal, although
the orchestra of 97 still produced a magnificent noise. The Ondes
Martinot and mallet instruments were placed on special platforms on
the sides of the stage, effectively making them part of the drama.
The company's music director, Donald Runnicles, led a powerful,
impassioned performance.</TE>
<TE>   The three American principals were ideal. As Francis, Willard
White grew in command throughout the performance, his baritone and
his presence seeming to get stronger, the greater the demands of the
musicand staging. For his receiving the stigmata and serene death in
the last act, he had come to seem the personification of
transcendence. Soprano Laura Aikin's alluring Angel was an excellent
advertisement for a heaven where delightful mischief and blinding
splendor are not contradictions. Chris Merritt, a piercing tenor, was
the frightening Leper. The six singers who portrayed the brothers in
Francis' monastery further sustained the performance's triumphantly
high level.</TE>

<LD>The relentlessly ambitious folks at Home and Garden Television have
managed to churn out a half-dozen new shows for the fall season, but
if tonight's premiere of "Love by Design" is any indication, that
thud you hear is the channel hitting the creative wall.</LD>
<LD>   The new program, airing at 7:30, is an amiable but awkward attempt
to graft a "Blind Date" format onto an interior design makeover show
like TLC's "Trading Spaces." The attempt is such a contrived struggle
that even the preview tape had beads of sweat on it.</LD>
<LD>   The "Love by Design" concept is this: Using hip-hoppish music,
zippy graphics and jittery hand-held camerawork, actor and co-host
Richard Yearwood interviews three bachelors, who give us brief tours
of their individual apartments. Then the other host, architect Dee
Dee Taylor Hannah, takes a young lady through each of the pads while
the guys are away. The woman is supposed to pick the guy she thinks
has the most romantic potential based solely on his apartment, and
then she must decide how she'll re-do the place for him. After the
make-over, the bachelor returns, meets the woman, sees what she's
done with the place, and the new couple are left alone to ponder
their future.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's young woman, an actuary named Takami who loves sports
and musicals, seems an eager participant. Yet after she picks the
apartment, it's Taylor Hannah who takes over and makes all the new
design choices. The bachelor returns and tells Takami how impressed
he is with her decorating abilities, but neither she nor Taylor
Hannah have the heart to tell him the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Still, perhaps there's something to the concept. As the cheery
hosts left the apartment, Takami and her new man huddled on a day
bed, oblivious to the world as their fingers moved over a backgammon
board.</TE>

<HD>Winning on Appeal</HD>
<DH>Patients whose insurers say 'no' have new ways to pursue
complaints and make them pay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers once faced a lonely struggle--and lousy odds--when they
challenged a health insurer's decisions. But that is changing as new
methods of appeal give people a fighting chance in disputes with
their health plans.</LD>
<LD>   In California and 40 other states, the creation of external review
boards that have the power to investigate and, when necessary,
overrule insurers' decisions are helping to turn the tide. Consumers
who doggedly pursued their right of appeal are winning a wide variety
of cases. For example:</LD>
<LD>   * A 4-year-old California girl undergoing speech therapy was
denied continuing treatment on the grounds it was not medically
necessary. The case was reviewed by an independent doctor hired by
the state, who said the girl was making progress, and the health plan
was ordered to continue coverage.</LD>
<TE>   * A Maryland woman was referred by her gynecologist for a
mammogram, but her health plan refused coverage because she had the
screening procedure 18 months earlier. The insurance policy called
for a mammogram every 24 months. Her doctor said there was a family
history of breast cancer, and the plan was ordered to pay for the
mammogram.</TE>
<TE>   * A 7-year-old girl in Texas with sickle cell anemia had been
receiving periodic blood transfusions. The heath plan refused to pay
for a bone marrow transplant that could reduce the need for the
painful and frequent transfusions. The family appealed, and the
insurer was forced to pay for the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Though disputes between health plans and their customers over
expensive and experimental lifesaving procedures make the most
headlines, most complaints are more mundane: Patients have already
received the medical services and HMOs don't want to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by Rand Corp., a Santa Monica research firm, found
that it is becoming easier to appeal as health plans come under
increasing pressure from disgruntled patients. The study cited the
prevalence of "goodwill payments," cases in which the health plan
believes its decision to deny a member's claim is correct but pays it
anyway because it doesn't want to upset the member or an employer.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the internal appeal process at the health plans, the state
external review boards give consumers another way to press their
case. This puts pressure on the health plans to settle complaints
before they get the attention of state regulators. In high-profile
cases, a disciplinary action by regulators and the accompanying
publicity can be embarrassing to an insurer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Rand researchers, who studied 11,000 appeals between 1998 and
2000 at two large California HMOs, found that consumers were
overwhelmingly successful in appealing for reimbursement for past
services. They won 89% of the appeals at one HMO and 78% at the other
health plan. Particularly striking was the fact that patients won
appeals involving emergency-room care 95% of the time. Patients were
less successful when they tried to ensure payment for a future doctor
referral, treatment or prescription, winning only one in every three
cases, the Rand study found.</TE>
<TE>   Most insurers have a two-step internal appeals process. After an
insurer's initial denial of a member's request, the insurer will
reconsider it once, then again. In effect, the insurer has three
chances to say "yes"--or "no." Consumer advocates say that anyone
whose claim is denied should immediately write a letter to the
company asking for reconsideration. A phone call can be ignored. A
letter establishes a paper trail that may be needed later. Your
doctor can be a key ally in the appeal. Ask your doctor to write a
letter supporting your claim. Or get a second opinion from another
physician and send copies to your health plan.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, also, that details count. Health plans often do not get
enough information from hospitals or doctors to substantiate a
patient's claim, so patients can help their cases if they provide
those details, said Joe Baker, a health advocacy official with the
New York state attorney general's office. When appropriate, get
information from an emergency room doctor or other attending
physicians who provided follow-up care.</TE>
<TE>   One common area of conflict between patients and health plans is
payment for prescription drugs. As costs rise, many plans are making
it more difficult for members to get some brand name drugs.
Weight-loss drugs such as Meridia and Xenical may be excluded under
some health plans. Claritin may come with a much larger co-payment to
encourage use of cheaper allergy medications.</TE>
<TE>   Health plans are turning to strict formularies, which are approved
lists of medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug, but the
health plan insists a cheaper generic is adequate. A letter from your
doctor stating that a particular drug is medically necessary may help
you win an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doctors sometimes differ in the way they treat ailments, and this
can result in disputes between patient and insurer. In some
communities, a patient with back pain will get a prescription for an
anti-inflammatory medication and advice to rest. Elsewhere, doctors
may use needles and electrical stimulation to deal with back pain.
The insurer may initially reject the claim for this treatment, but a
letter from the doctor explaining that this is the standard treatment
in his practice and his community may get the bill reimbursed.</TE>
<TE>   If the internal appeal, buttressed by help from the doctor, fails,
the consumer can go to the state for help. In California, it is the
Department of Managed Health Care. The California agency gets about
15,000 phone calls a month from consumers. About half are from people
who want to know how to complain to their HMOs but don't have a phone
number to call. The department supplies the complaint number.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the calls are from people trying to get a bill paid or
a decision reversed. Department staff members join the HMO and the
customer in a three-way conference call to resolve the dispute.
Consumers prevail in about a third of the disputes, according to
department estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult cases, which can't be resolved by discussions
among state officials, health plans and the member, are sent out for
independent review. This is a medical Supreme Court, where the state
hires independent doctors to consider the case. There have been 924
cases decided at this level since the department began three years
ago, and consumers have won about a third of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Zingale, director of the Department of Managed Health Care,
thinks many Californians still don't know what his agency does. He
wants information about the agency's services posted in every
hospital and every physician's waiting room. His agency oversees HMOs
and other health plans serving about 15 million Californians.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zingale worries that many consumers don't realize they have appeal
rights. "The health-care system is so overwhelming, confusing and
complex," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, it can be difficult for patients to know whom to
blame. California, for example, has many large medical groups--or big
partnerships among doctors--that function much like a mini-HMO, with
their own policies, restrictions and attention to bottom-line
business concerns. When a patient is told "no," he or she often
blames the "uncaring" health insurer, when the decision actually may
have been made by a doctor or administrator within the medical group.
In those cases, the appeal process becomes even more vital because
the insurance company may tell the medical group that the coverage is
justified.</TE>
<TE>   Too often in the past, people haven't asserted their appeal
rights, the regulators say. In New York, Aetna-US Healthcare and
United Health Care are reviewing old claims because customers weren't
properly informed that they could challenge rejections of coverage.
The state insurance department has called for the reopening of the
claims, some going back as far as 1994 for United.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people say it's not worth it to appeal, but I tell them
it's free and it's easy--get that appeal in," said Joe Baker of the
New York attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Managed Health Care can be reached at
(888) 466-2219. TDD listing is (877) 688-9891. The agency also has a
Web site: www.hmohelp.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>Aspirin as an Ally of Memory</HD>
<DH>Neurology: A study finds anti-inflammatory drugs may
prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may
reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease when they're taken
regularly long before any symptoms arise.</LD>
<LD>   A study appearing in the Sept. 24 issue of Neurology, a journal of
the American Academy of Neurology, bolsters the thinking among many
Alzheimer's doctors that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs somehow protect brain cells against the ravages of the
memory-robbing disorder.</LD>
<LD>   The study was based on an analysis of 5,092 elderly residents of
Cache County, Utah, from 1995 to 1996 and a follow-up three years
later. The seniors with the longest history of taking the medications
at least four times a week derived the greatest protective benefit,
the study found. Those who took aspirin or such drugs as ibuprofen,
naproxen, diclofenac, nabumetone, sulindac and oxaprozin for at least
two years had just 45% of the rate of developing Alzheimer's as
nonusers. Those who had taken them only recently experienced little
neurological benefit.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, several studies that looked at treating Alzheimer's
with anti-inflammatories failed to show benefit. But the current
results, taken together with studies conducted in Baltimore and in
the Netherlands, suggest that sustained use of anti-inflammatories
may delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's if they're taken
"during a critical window" before the brain suffers enough damage to
cause symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The authors, led by Dr. John Breitner of the VA Puget Sound Health
Care System in Seattle, suggested the window may close "several years
prior to the onset of dementia."</TE>
<TE>   The study was supported by a grant from the National Institute on
Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health.</TE>

<HD>Wrestling With Weight Issues</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Health plans can be stingy in their coverage of
obesity and diet treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many people know how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off.
It can also be expensive, if you count the cost of diet programs such
as Weight Watchers or Jenny Craig, fitness club memberships and all
the assorted gear and clothes that we buy to help motivate us to
exercise. When diet and exercise don't work, some people turn to
medications to alter their metabolism and drop some pounds. And as a
last resort--if obesity poses a severe risk to one's health--some
will opt for surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Given obesity's role in triggering heart disease, high blood
pressure, diabetes and other ailments, it's no surprise that people
would expect their health insurance to pick up the tab for treatment.
But getting your health insurance to pay for weight-loss treatments
is a big "if," depending on which type of insurance coverage you have
and where you live. Coverage is spotty, and many insurers still seem
to take the attitude that being overweight is a personal failure of
will.</LD>
<TE>   Attitudes are changing--but slowly. In California, one of the most
common disputes between consumers and health insurers involves an
operation known as gastric bypass surgery, used to treat morbid
obesity. The California Department of Managed Health Care, which
regulates health plans, reports 86 cases in which patients appealed a
health insurer's decision involving treatment for morbid obesity, a
condition defined as someone who weighs at least 100 pounds more than
his or her ideal weight. When those 86 cases were sent to an external
review board, a panel of independent doctors hired by the state, the
patients won 49 of the appeals, an unusually high success rate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rulings, insurers are skeptical about the value of
some obesity treatments. Aetna-US Healthcare, one of the nation's
largest insurers, largely excludes coverage for obesity surgery, said
Jill Griffiths, a company spokeswoman. Employers who provide health
insurance for their workers have the option of including obesity
surgery as a benefit, she noted.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fair amount of disagreement in the medical community
about when [gastric bypass surgery] is appropriate and when it is
not," said Jim Anderson, a spokesman for Kaiser Permanente. Anderson
said that the surgery can be risky and that Kaiser wants to make sure
patients have tried all other alternatives. Even so, Kaiser approves
hundreds of gastric bypass procedures a year, he said. In at least
one case, however, state medical reviewers overturned Kaiser's denial
of a patient's request for obesity surgery, ruling that the operation
was appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Insurers are more likely to approve obesity treatments today than
five years ago, said Dr. Gary Anthone, director of the bariatric
surgery program at USC's Keck School of Medicine. Attitudes have
begun to change as the medical community has begun to consider that
obesity is a disease itself, not just a contributing risk factor to
other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Anthone says gastric bypass surgery is appropriate for people who
have tried diet and exercise unsuccessfully and who are threatened by
the other ailments that can come from obesity, including diabetes,
heart disease and sleep apnea. But only as a last resort. The
operation has a 1% death rate within 30 days of the surgery. And it
means a permanent lifestyle change for patients who will be taking
special vitamins and nutrients for the rest of their lives and eating
tiny meals.</TE>
<TE>   "We get calls all the time from people who say they want the
surgery because they lost 20 or 30 or 40 pounds and gained all of it
back," Anthone said. He invariably refuses their requests. "We tell
them diet and exercise--and stress the exercise."</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that insurers would be reluctant to pay for
many weight-loss programs when the most effective treatments, a more
healthful diet and regular exercise, do not require a doctor's
involvement. After all, medical care in the United States has long
emphasized treatment over prevention. So lots of money is spent on
helping people after they have developed diabetes, heart disease or
other ailments in which a serious weight problem is a key
contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   Many health insurers have programs that focus, for example, on
reminding diabetics to have annual eye examinations or to regularly
check their blood sugar and cholesterol. Some insurers provide nurses
to work directly with diabetes patients to provide education and
encouragement to help them cope with their illness. But these efforts
come after the fact, when someone has fallen victim to disease. There
is mounting evidence that much earlier intervention could benefit
patients' health while also helping to reduce medical costs.</TE>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Endocrinologists recently declared that
"insulin resistance syndrome" is a tip-off that people will develop
diseases associated with obesity, such as diabetes, congestive heart
failure and sleep apnea. Perhaps as many as one in four adults have
the condition. Not all of them will develop diseases, but the
condition can be a trigger.</TE>
<TE>   What causes it? Probably a combination of genetic predisposition
plus the modern work and social environment. We exercise less and eat
out more at restaurants serving hefty portions of food.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The doctors say they can identify people at special risk long
before they come down with costly ailments. They include: sedentary
people older than 45. Those whose blood pressure exceeds 130 over 85,
whose waistline is 40 or more for a man, and 35 or more for a woman,
and whose "fasting" blood sugar reading is 110 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Among ethnic groups, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans face
greater risks. With all these risk factors known, health insurance
programs shouldn't wait for people to get sick with obesity-related
ailments, said Dr. Daniel Einhorn, medical director of the Scripps
Whittier Institute for Diabetes in La Jolla. He believes that
insurers should pick up the tab for some people who enroll in
weight-loss programs or who join gyms and health clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about cosmetics, not about looking better, but about
medical disease with medical consequences," Einhorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as health insurers have helped to validate some alternative
medical treatments, such as acupuncture, by offering these therapies
as a benefit to members, the same might be true of weight-loss
programs. If insurers covered weight-loss programs or gym
memberships, it would send a signal that such activities are
important, Einhorn said.</TE>
<TE>   As obesity gets increasing attention as a vital national health
issue, change is likely. Earlier this year, New York Gov. George
Pataki signed legislation that orders state health officials to
review information about obesity and its treatments and devise a plan
to keep New Yorkers from getting too fat. One possible strategy: a
mandate that insurance companies pay for members to enroll in
weight-loss programs, said Guy Velella, a Republican state
assemblyman who co-sponsored the legislation.</TE>

<LD>Tattoos, tooth jewelry, tongue-piercings ... in a decade or so,
teenagers (and their fuddy-duddy parents) may have yet another tool
for self-expression--hair that's genetically engineered to glow
green, yellow, blue, red or all of the above, in cunning designs.</LD>
<LD>   Under normal lighting conditions (say, when Aunt Milly comes to
visit), Janey or Jonny's hair could look conservatively brown or
black. But under a gentle blue light, chemicals artificially
engineered into Jane and Jon's hair shafts would cause the shafts to
brightly fluoresce.</LD>
<LD>   This hip scenario already exists in the rodent world. Mice whose
skin glows green from tip of tail to end of snout--handy for certain
experiments--can be purchased from the Jackson Laboratory in Bar
Harbor, Maine, purveyors of fine mice, but only by scientists with
legitimate research purposes. (So you can forget about ordering
green, glowing mice for your Halloween bash.)</LD>
<TE>   And, according to a recent article in the scholarly Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, mice with green fur also are
scampering around in labs.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hoffman, president of San Diego's AntiCancer Inc. (the
company that made the green-furred mice), says the creatures aren't
green all over, nor spotted exactly--more variegated. Here's how they
got that way.</TE>
<TE>   First, bits of skin were removed from the mice and treated with an
enzyme to loosen them up.</TE>
<TE>   Next, a jellyfish gene inserted into a harmless virus was added to
the brew. If the gene successfully entered the genomes of
hair-producing cells, that soon became very apparent. The gene, which
directs formation of a fluorescent protein, causes hairs and their
follicles to gleam green under the right kind of light.</TE>
<TE>   Final step: Transplant the glowing skin back onto the mice.</TE>
<TE>   What, we asked Hoffman, is the point of all this? To create zany,
designer pets for the rich, famous and twisted?</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman says he has no problem with people one day genetically
altering their scalps for cosmetic reasons: "What the heck, I'd
rather see people use a safe gene than toxic hair dyes," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But, as the name of the company suggests, that isn't AntiCancer's
purpose. Instead it's to learn how to stop hair from falling out
during cancer chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Green hair, in fact, was created only for convenience. The
scientists are trying to figure out how to insert genes efficiently
into hair follicles--and a bright, eerie glow just happens to be an
in-your-face, can't-be-missed sign that a gene was successfully
inserted.</TE>
<TE>   Now Hoffman and colleagues plan to sift through the human genome
to find ones that might help hair grow back again and insert those
into hair cells.</TE>
<TE>   They are not, moreover, uninterested in other types of hair
loss--such as male pattern baldness. Men go bald when their hair
follicles respond to male hormones and transmogrify into a different
kind of follicle (the kind we have on less hairy parts of our
bodies). What if there was a way to insert genes to transmogrify them
right back again? "Everyone who works on hair biology has an eye on
that goal," Hoffman says.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman even dreams of engineering hair follicles into veritable
factories of important medical chemicals that could be pumped into
the bloodstream to treat disease. After all, the hair-producing cells
are productive.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of it: a meter-long hair shaft coming out of a tiny little
follicle," he exalts. "Now instead of making a beautiful hair on a
lady, imagine making a protein that cures diabetes, Parkinson's,
cancer."</TE>
<TE>   A whole pile of work needs doing before such dreams can
transpire--like making sure that the genes are turned on good and
strong; that they stay turned on good and strong; figuring out how to
get DNA efficiently into follicles by applying it directly to a head
(which would be nicer than having bits of one's skin taken off)--and
last, but certainly not least, that the therapy is safe.</TE>
<TE>   If all that's done, hair color changes could feasibly follow,
Hoffman speculates--and the palette of possible hues only stands to
increase. Already, scientists have figured out a way to modify the
jellyfish protein so it glows yellow or blue. Another protein--this
one from a coral--glows red. They're searching for even more colors
among the luridly colored fish, polyps and other creatures dwelling
in the tropical reefs of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The look would be fabulous--and we'd never have to touch up our
roots.</TE>

<LD>Bike helmets have reduced the number of children's head injuries, but
there's still nothing to protect a child from rupturing an abdominal
organ. During a fall, the front wheel can turn so that the handlebars
are perpendicular to the body, creating a blunt spear that can
rupture the intestine, liver, spleen or other abdominal and pelvic
organs.</LD>
<LD>   Now, researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia along
with colleagues at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation
have calculated the annual cost of these often serious injuries.</LD>
<LD>   By reviewing hospital discharge data, researchers estimate that
more than a thousand young bicyclists had serious abdominal or pelvic
organ injuries in 1997 and that handlebars caused nearly 900 of them.
None of the accidents in the study involved cars. Factoring in the
costs of hospital stays (ranging from three to 47 days), ambulance
use, medical care after discharge, work lost by parents or another
caregiver, quality of life differences, even the filing of insurance
claims, the researchers concluded that children's handlebar-related
injuries amounted to more than $500 million in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers hope that awareness of the high cost of these
injuries will lead to regulating bicycle design and prompt bike
manufacturers to make a safer handlebar. Working with bioengineering
students at the University of Pennsylvania, the researchers have
designed a retractable handlebar that would absorb the energy of
impact with a child's body. The design has a patent pending, but it
has yet to be licensed by a manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Lead author Dr. Flaura K. Winston says that, until a safer
handlebar is produced, parents should be sure the bicycle fits the
child and that the bike is in good condition. When sitting on the
seat, the child should be able to put both feet on the ground.
Keeping tires fully inflated and the chain well oiled will make the
bike easier to steer, she says. Also, the wheels should be aligned
and handlebar grips should cover the metal ends.</TE>

<TE>   Link Between Diet, Cancer Doubted</TE>
<TE>   The first study to look closely at the link between diet and a key
indicator of prostate cancer casts doubt on the value of a low-fat
diet in preventing the disease, at least in the short run.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
found that after four years, there was no difference in prostate
specific antigen, or PSA, levels among 689 men who ate a diet made up
of 20% fat and five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day
and 661 men who were just given written instructions on a healthy
diet.</TE>
<TE>   Several previous studies had implicated diet, particularly fat, in
the development of prostate cancer, but this was the first to look at
the effect of diet on a biological marker for prostate cancer over
time. "As randomized studies go, four years is a long time, but in
the lifespan of a man it is a short time," says lead author Dr. Moshe
Shike, director of cancer prevention at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York. "If a person starts eating a diet like
this in childhood, it may have an effect. If you are middle-aged or
past middle age, [eating this diet] for a few years doesn't seem to
affect the risk. But this study doesn't mean people shouldn't change
their diet. We still believe a low-fat, high fruit and vegetable diet
is the best overall," he says.</TE>

<TE>   Travel Poses Risk to Asthmatics</TE>
<TE>   Californians sensitive to tobacco smoke may take for granted the
laws that prohibit smoking in most public places--until they travel
to areas that don't have such restrictions. A study of more than 300
people with asthma found that the intermittent exposure they
encounter when traveling is enough to cause breathing problems. Eye
and nose irritation may even be worse.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of those participating in the study reported being
exposed to tobacco smoke while traveling in the year prior to being
interviewed, says the lead author, Dr. Mark D. Eisner, assistant
professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. "And the number who had
respiratory symptoms or asthma attacks [as a result] was quite high,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner reported that about two-thirds of those exposed to smoke
complained of coughing, wheezing or chest tightness. More than half
who had symptoms needed extra inhalation medication.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a person lived with a smoker or was somehow regularly
exposed to secondhand smoke didn't seem to make a difference in the
respiratory symptoms they encountered on the road. However, those who
didn't have such regular exposure were more likely to suffer from eye
or nose irritation.</TE>

<TE>   'Heat Strain' Bothers Athletes Less</TE>
<TE>   Most people know when they're too hot to keep exercising, Canadian
researchers have found, but athletes are better able to tolerate heat
strain--the combination of increased heart rate and core temperature
in response to heat--than are untrained men and women.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at Defense Research and Development Canada in Toronto
put 26 men and women through their paces on treadmills in a hot room
wearing the research version of a rubber suit. While the volunteers
exercised, their deep body, or core, temperature and heart rate were
measured.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, both trained and untrained people had a nearly
identical increase in core temperature, but the untrained group had a
higher heart rate. The untrained subjects also felt hotter than the
trained ones.</TE>
<TE>   The endurance-trained subjects tended to underestimate the heat
throughout their time on the treadmill, which ranged from 75 to 135
minutes. "Trained people are routinely exposed to physically
stressful conditions, and so they can tolerate higher levels of
strain--a higher core temperature and heart rate," says Peter
Tikuisis, the lead author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   The increased tolerance doesn't usually get an athlete into
trouble, says Tikuisis, unless they ignore their body and keep
pushing beyond a safe limit because of peer pressure or desire to win
a race. "Swallow your pride and watch for symptoms like nausea,
lightheadedness, headache, impaired coordination and muscle
cramping," he says.</TE>

<TE>   Cats as Disease Spreaders</TE>
<TE>   Cat fanciers may not want to hear that their pets are anything but
perfect, but their feline companions are capable of transmitting
serious infections. In a review of cat-associated diseases in humans,
doctors at Yale University School of Medicine and the VA Connecticut
Health Care System in West Haven. Conn., tick off about a half-dozen
illnesses, from the trivial to the life-threatening. With cats
calling a third of American households home, the potential for
sickness is no small thing.</TE>
<TE>   Bites are by far the most common cause of cat-associated
infection, and, 90% of the time, those injuries are because the cat
was provoked in some way. (Dogs, in contrast, don't bite just to
defend themselves.) The long, sharp teeth of a cat can create a
puncture wound that carries microbes in the cat's mouth to dangerous
depths in the victim's flesh. Between 28% and 80% of cat bites become
infected. The authors recommend that "all persons with a cat bite
should be treated with prophylactic antibiotic therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Another common, but more benign, infection that usually resolves
itself within a couple of months is cat-scratch disease. In one
study, 41% of San Francisco Bay Area cats harbored the bacteria
responsible for the infection. Children are the most common victims
of the illness, which is usually transmitted by a cat bite or scratch
or via a fleabite.</TE>
<TE>   Preventing these illnesses is a matter of common sense, the
authors say: Wash your hands before eating, take your cat to the vet
for appropriate vaccinations and whenever it is sick--and don't give
the cat reason to bite you.</TE>

<HD>Drugs That Can Compound Health Risks</HD>
<DH>Study: Medications made by pharmacies may be less likely to
meet quality standards than commercially made products, research
finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmacists who will prepare medications to suit a particular
patient's needs can be a lifesaver for some people, but a new study
shows the drugs may not be as potent or as pure as their commercial
counterparts.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Food and Drug Administration researchers selected more than a
dozen commonly used products that had a potential for health risks if
made incorrectly, including eyedrops for glaucoma, injectable
steroids and Viagra substitutes, from 12 compound pharmacies.</LD>
<LD>   Testing revealed that more than one-third of the 29 products
sampled failed to meet quality standards. One product was
contaminated with bacteria and nine didn't meet potency standards--of
those nine, five had a potency of less than 70% of what was stated on
the label for the approved drug.</LD>
<TE>   In comparison, only 1% to 2% of commercially made drugs that are
sampled each year by the FDA fail these standard tests.</TE>
<TE>   "These results don't mean that all compound drugs will fail
standard tests," says Jane A. Axelrad, associate director for policy
in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in Rockville,
Md. But the study results should alert consumers to "the importance
of carefully compounding products." Results of the tests were
presented Sept. 23 at the American College of Clinical Pharmacology
meeting in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Compound pharmacies are similar to old-fashioned apothecaries, in
which pharmacists use bulk chemicals to make their own versions of
prescription drugs. Some consumers need such preparations because
they are allergic to a dye or preservative in a traditional drug, use
different dosages than are available in commercial preparations, or
prefer medications made from natural sources. More than 250 million
prescriptions are filled annually by compound pharmacists--about 1%
to 8% of total prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   To get a representative sample of the nation's 20,000 compounding
pharmacies, the FDA investigation focused only on high-volume
pharmacies.</TE>
<TE>   Improper compounding can have serious health consequences. In one
instance, a child died after ingesting a liquid form of the
antidepressant imipramine, which was compounded at five times the
prescribed dose. Eight recent cases of meningitis, including three
deaths, stemmed from a contaminated batch of steroid injections made
by a California compounding pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid problems, use commercially made drugs, Axelrad says. If
consumers need to use a compound pharmacy, "make sure they have a
good quality control program," says Loyd V. Allen, editor in chief of
the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding in Edmond,
Okla.</TE>

<HD>Depo-Provera News Upbeat and Troubling</HD>

<LD>Long-term hormone use in women is complicated, as the recent findings
about hormone replacement therapy--namely, that it contributes to
heart disease in some users--attest.</LD>
<LD>   Here's another case from the other side of a woman's reproductive
life: In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health and
published this month in the journal Epidemiology, Depo-Provera, an
injectable contraceptive, was found to cause significant loss of bone
density, a risk factor for osteoporosis.</LD>
<LD>   That's the bad news.</LD>
<TE>   The good news is that within 2 1/2 years of stopping the
contraceptive, most of the women who had used Depo-Provera had bone
densities similar to women who had never used it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our findings certainly indicate that if you use this method, it
will have some effect on bone density," said the lead author, Delia
Scholes of the Group Health Cooperative in Seattle. However, she
said, "it was pretty gratifying to see steady gains in bone density
once a woman stopped the contraceptive."</TE>
<TE>   Depo-Provera, produced by Pharmacia Corp., is a progesterone-only
contraceptive given as a shot every three months. It stops the
ovaries from releasing eggs--meaning a woman doesn't get a
period--and it thickens the cervical mucus and changes the uterine
lining, making it harder for sperm to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Developed 30 years ago, Depo-Provera was introduced in this
country in 1992. It has an estimated 10 million to 30 million users
worldwide, and it's growing in popularity here, especially among
teenagers, said Jennifer Frost of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
New York-based reproductive health research organization. Frost said
that in 2001, about 20% of American women who use federally funded
family planning clinics used Depo-Provera.</TE>
<TE>   The reason it's popular is that it's as effective as surgical
sterilization, is reversible and doesn't require remembering to take
a pill every day, said Dr. Andrew Kaunitz of the University of
Florida at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   It also gives users privacy: No one but your health-care provider
has to know you get the shot, said Berta Portigiani of Planned
Parenthood of Hudson Peconic, which serves Suffolk County in New
York. It's useful for women who can't use a contraceptive with
estrogen and for women who are breast-feeding and want to avoid
getting pregnant, Portigiani said. Each shot costs between $30 and
$75, according to Planned Parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a good method for someone who might want a baby soon,
however: Once a woman stops taking the shots, it may take up to a
year to get pregnant, said Nancy O'Keefe of Planned Parenthood of
Nassau, N.Y. And it's not without side effects (irregular bleeding,
weight gain).</TE>
<TE>   The bone loss and its reversal have been seen in smaller studies,
but Scholes' study is the largest with the longest follow-up so far.
It included 183 women using Depo-Provera and 274 who did not. Of the
183, only 43 were first-time Depo-Provera users; the rest had been
using it from a month to 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Among Depo users, bone density declined throughout the four-year
study, while it increased slightly among nonusers. Bone loss at the
hip was greater than at the spine. After four years of Depo use, the
bone loss was like that seen in post-menopausal women and among women
who are breast-feeding. The researchers said that in post-menopausal
women, "this degree of bone loss would increase the risk of hip
fracture by about 50%."</TE>
<TE>   But 2 1/2 years after stopping the shots, most women regained bone
so that density equaled that of nonusers--although the researchers
found the hip was slower to regain density. And the 18- to
21-year-old Depo-Provera users who started the study with lower bone
densities still had less density 2 1/2 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Kaunitz, who is conducting a similar study for Pharmacia, said
that though the Scholes study "doesn't answer every single question,
the emerging picture is reassuring." And, he said, he'd have no
qualms letting someone on Depo- Provera stay on it "six months to six
years to 16 years." In a statement, the company said, based on the
study, "we would ... not expect to see any long-term impact on
osteoporosis from Depo-Provera use."</TE>
<TE>   Others were less reassured. "I really do think this information
should weigh significantly, particularly for those under 30," said
Amy Allina of the nonprofit National Women's Health Network.</TE>
<TE>   Questions remain. Women don't reach peak bone density until about
age 30. Depo-Provera is a method popular among teenagers, so what
does the study's findings about 18- to 21-year-olds portend,
especially if they use the shot for years? And what about
breast-feeding women? Generally a woman regains whatever bone density
she lost after she stops breast-feeding. But what happens to someone
on Depo-Provera? Scholes said no one knows.</TE>
<TE>   Given the recent rethinking about HRT risk, which has been studied
far more than Depo-Provera, that's disturbing.</TE>

<HD>Diet Ads Are Hard to Swallow</HD>
<DH>Consumers: Too many people buy into claims that say some
products can help them lose weight without exercising or changing
eating habits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Knock off your unwanted weight and fat deposits at warp speeds! You
can lose 18 pounds in one week!"</LD>
<LD>   "Lose up to eight to 10 pounds per week--no dieting, no strenuous
exercise."</LD>
<LD>   "No exercise, and eat as much as you want--the more you eat, the
more you lose, we'll show you how."</LD>
<TE>   Those are just three of the misleading, deceptive and false diet
product ads cited by the Federal Trade Commission recently in a
report written in conjunction with the Partnership for Healthy Weight
Management, a coalition of business, science, government, health-care
and public interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Some ads promise that you can eat all the cake you want--as well
as ice cream, porterhouse steaks, fried chicken and hot fudge--and
still lose weight. These weight-loss products, which range from
dietary supplements to videos, often guarantee instant success and
long-term results, and are bolstered by testimonials, including this
one cited by the report:</TE>
<TE>   "Seven weeks ago, I weighed 268 pounds. Now I am down to just 148!
During this time, I didn't change my eating habits at all."</TE>
<TE>   Just do the math. That claim would work out to a loss of 120
pounds in seven weeks, or about 17 pounds per week. That's more than
2 pounds a day.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC said these types of diet ads are proliferating and
generated $35 billion in sales in 2000. The deceptive ads bombard
consumers on television, radio, the Internet, in magazines and in
newspapers. Earlier this month, the FTC also announced that on Sept.
3 it had accused a Canadian corporation operating in the United
States under the name Bio Lab with deceiving consumers through ads
and sales of Quick Slim and Cellu-Fight. Quick Slim is a dietary
supplement sold as a "fat blocker" that appeared in free-standing
inserts that were distributed in major newspapers, including The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   So why do so many otherwise savvy consumers continue to reach for
the quick fix when it comes to weight loss? "We are told we can buy
our weight out with the right product," said Lynn McAfee, medical
advocacy project director with the Council on Size and Weight
Discrimination, who described her lifelong struggle with obesity at
the FTC news conference last week.</TE>
<TE>   McAfee saw ads for weight-loss products. "Suddenly," she said, "it
was not that my body or my will was in error, but that I could buy a
secret.... Is there anyone in this room who would not choose to do
something the easy way?"</TE>
<TE>   Although the FTC did not name companies or products engaging in
deceptive ad practices last week, the commission raised these
advertisement red flags for consumers:</TE>
<TE>   * Testimonials or the use of before-and-after photos. Nearly
two-thirds of the 300 ads studied by the FTC included testimonials
and 42% had before-and-after pictures. Rarely did either portray
"realistic weight loss," the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   * Claims of rapid weight loss. The falsity of some claims, such as
losing 8 to 10 pounds per week, "is obvious," the FTC noted.</TE>
<TE>   * No diet or exercise required. "Despite the well-accepted
prescription of diet and exercise for successful weight management,"
the report found, 42% of ads reviewed promoted an array of quick-fix
pills, patches, potions and programs for effortless weight loss, and
nearly two-thirds promised fast results.</TE>
<TE>   * Clinically proven/doctor-approved claims on products. Found on
about 40% of diet ads scrutinized by the FTC, these claims "may cause
consumers to conclude mistakenly that the clinically proven benefits
are substantial, whereas in fact, the difference between use of the
product and dieting could be small."</TE>
<TE>   * Natural/safe weight-loss claims. Nearly half of product ads made
safety claims while almost three-quarters touted the products as "all
natural." Safety is difficult to evaluate, the FTC concluded, "when
so many ads fail to disclose the active ingredients." Other products,
such as those containing the controversial herbal stimulant ephedra,
disclosed ingredients "but did not include a health warning about
possible adverse effects," making safety claims misleading.</TE>

<HD>Immune System Failings</HD>
<DH>Research: Endometriosis and other ailments such as lupus
and fibromyalgia have been linked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMA ROSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Women with endometriosis--a leading cause of infertility in which
tissue from the womb lining grows elsewhere in the body--are much
more likely to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, chronic
fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and allergies, new research has found.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published last week in the journal Human Reproduction,
is the first to document something that has been noticed by many
women with the painful disorder.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers urged doctors to look for the other diseases in
women when diagnosing endometriosis, which afflicts between 8% and
10% of women of childbearing age.</LD>
<TE>   The new research suggests an immune system abnormality may
underlie all these conditions, said Warren Nothnick, a University of
Kansas professor of obstetrics and gynecology who was not connected
with the study.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the underlying factor, the commonality, between all of
these diseases? If we can find out what the one factor is, or group
of factors, we can target that and hopefully come up with a way to
treat not only the endometriosis, but also some of the other
diseases," Nothnick said.</TE>
<TE>   His own work, as well as that of other scientists, suggests that
the malfunctioning of certain immune system chemicals called
cytokines may be a common link.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming endometriosis occurs before the other diseases, it may
also be possible one day to spare women with endometriosis from
developing some of the additional diseases, Nothnick said.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted by scientists at the U.S. National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development, George Washington University
and the Endometriosis Assn., involved 3,680 women with endometriosis.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For an office worker, getting exercise during the workday can be
difficult. Some companies provide gyms, but that means never leaving
the office. Running during the lunch break is another option, but
some of us aren't the running types.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a happy medium. I'd heard of a group here at the
office that uses the landscape of downtown Los Angeles as an exercise
vehicle, climbing area steps for an intense cardiovascular workout in
less than an hour. In all, these walkers cover slightly more than two
miles, seeing a lot of the city as they alternate between stair
climbing and brisk walking during their circuit.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is this type of trek good for the heart, it also
strengthens legs and endurance. And it can be done almost anywhere
there are steps--from a building stairwell to the famed Fourth Street
Stairs in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that if people
spend at least 10 minutes a day walking up and down stairs, they
could lose as much as 10 pounds over the course of a year. For some
of us, that would go a long way toward shedding a paunch. But
elevators and escalators have made stair climbing a lost art. People
take elevators to go up a single floor these days.</TE>
<TE>   The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine once did a study at a
suburban Baltimore mall in which fewer than 5% of the 17,000 shoppers
observed took the stairs rather than using the escalator.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because I liked the concept of dividing the day with exercise, I
decided to give the walk/climb a try. After changing into gym clothes
in the company locker room, I met the group--all women--at the corner
of 2nd and Spring streets and we set off at a brisk pace on a hot
September day. Leading the band of six people was copy editor Mary
Forgione, a fitness buff and marathoner who not only selects the
route, but can reel off the number of steps the group must
negotiate--that day, a total of 354.</TE>
<TE>   "The first part is the hardest," she said. "If you get through
that, the rest is pretty easy."</TE>
<TE>   We made our way through the lower part of downtown, walking
several gritty blocks until we reached the Angel's Flight stairwell
directly across from Grand Central Market.</TE>
<TE>   Up we climbed the Angel's Flight stairway, with Forgione
emphasizing a steady pace for the best possible exercise. After 151
steps--and with me gasping for breath--we reached the top and walked
quickly through the California and Wells Fargo plazas--and several
more blocks beyond that--before finally arriving at the steps to the
Los Angeles Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the talk turned to the upcoming YMCA-sponsored race
to the top of the Library Tower, the tallest building on the West
Coast. This Friday and Saturday, hard-core stair climbers will tackle
the 1,500 steps in the 75-story building. Last year's winner, a Los
Angeles County lifeguard, made the climb in 9 minutes 26 seconds, or
roughly three steps a second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We, however, went down and up the 102 steps outside the library,
then past the construction site of the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Through it all, I tried to keep my posture erect because I'd read
that being bent at the waist will cause distress and undue fatigue
during and after climbing. I was slightly winded anyway, but the
walking between stair climbing allowed for recovery time.</TE>
<TE>   We wound our way around the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and back to
the Civic Center subway stop, where we descended, then ascended the
76 steps that lead to the Red Line.</TE>
<TE>   It was on this leg of the circuit that I reached my highest heart
rate--a count of 169. From there, it was an easy two-block walk back
to the office, a time to cool off. The event's elapsed time was just
under 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   According to my heart-rate monitor, I'd burned 562 calories. I'd
been to parts of Los Angeles I hadn't seen in awhile, had some good
conversations and gotten back in time to grab a sandwich.</TE>

<LD>Question: Should I always time my workouts in the park or when I'm on
the treadmill in the gym?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I'm a huge fan of all those gadgets that help us perform
our sports and activities better, and I particularly like some of the
new digital watches that can be programmed to beep at selected
intervals during my runs. However, it's not always necessary to time
activities. At least once a week, turn off these functions and just
listen to how you feel instead of listening for signals from your
wrist that tell you when to speed up, slow down, stop or hit the
showers.</LD>
<LD>   Exercise is good for our hearts and bodies but it's also a time to
recharge and meditate, without being bombarded by schedules and/or
signals.</LD>
<TE>   Once a week, tune out the rest of the world and run, walk or cycle
in silence.</TE>

<LD>National Rosacea Society</LD>
<LD>   rosacea.org</LD>
<LD>   Background: This nonprofit group is committed to telling the world
about rosacea, the often painless but always annoying rosy patches
that commonly break out on people's noses, cheeks and foreheads. The
Web site functions as an online community and library for sufferers
and their doctors.</LD>
<TE>   What works: The site takes a mystifying condition--few people
study rosacea (pronounced roh-ZAY-sha); no one knows why it
develops--and hits it from every possible angle. The society does its
own surveys, on the heritability of the condition and possible ethnic
risk factors. About 40% of sufferers report having a relative with
the red patches, for example, and about a third of them have some
Irish ancestry. The facial redness usually has nothing to do with
drink: Triggers include heat, cold and a wide range of foods.
Lifestyle modifications are often the best treatment. Perhaps the
only thing the site lacks is color: It could benefit from adding
stories from those with rosacea.</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Vaccine to Be Tested on Children</HD>
<DH>Trial: Federal health agencies plan to store proper dosages
for kids in case of bioterrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors are planning an unprecedented clinical trial in which the
smallpox vaccine will be tested in a small number of children in two
states, federal health officials confirmed last week.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is to establish vaccine dosages suitable for children in
the event that mass vaccination is needed because of a bioterrorist
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Tests, which will be conducted at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, will mark the first
time the vaccine has ever been tested in children, using the rigors
of modern science.</LD>
<TE>   Though doctors administered the vaccine successfully in children
for two centuries before the disease's eradication, a formal
controlled clinical trial had not been performed even in the 1960s, a
period well within the era of evidence-based medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors involved in the design of the trial hope testing will
begin before the end of the year. Fewer than 50 children are expected
to be entered into the trial in both states.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just waiting for the final word, to hear that it's a go.
All of the pieces seem to be in place," said Dr. David Bernstein,
director of the division of infectious diseases at the Cincinnati
hospital. Bernstein will be the chief investigator of the study's
Ohio arm.</TE>
<TE>   He does not foresee trouble enrolling children into the trial and
is discussing the test with Cincinnati pediatricians. Because test
subjects must be closely monitored and wear special bandages after
the inoculation, neither site will accept enrollees from out of
state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good vaccine, and millions of children have been safely
immunized with it," said Dr. Michael Lane, a smallpox expert now
retired from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Medical researchers plan to test the Dryvax vaccine, Bernstein
said, which was the same one used to eradicate smallpox in an
aggressive global campaign in the 1960s and '70s. It is also the same
vaccine administered in a nationwide adult clinical trial that began
late last year. Findings announced in March showed that Dryvax could
be diluted and still be effective.</TE>
<TE>   But Dryvax is not problem-free. Although doctors believe current
medical knowledge may make the vaccine safer, it is a live-virus
vaccine that has caused encephalitis and potential brain damage in
some recipients. It also carries a 1-in-1-million chance of death, a
ratio worked out by Lane and colleagues in a series of groundbreaking
studies on the vaccine conducted at the CDC in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccine doses to be used in the pediatric trial are more than 40
years old and are based on viral stocks that first were prepared by
the New York City Health Department at the turn of the 20th century.
Dryvax, public health officials say, is a mainstay in the National
Pharmaceutical Stockpile. The stockpile is the government's cache of
medications, vaccines and other supplies that are deployed in the
event of an attack. The stockpile is kept in several secret
locations.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Carol Heilman of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, and one of the pediatric trial's designers, said
researchers will be seeking some of the same answers that were sought
in the adult study.</TE>
<TE>   In the adult trial, lower strengths than would have been
administered in the 1950s or '60s proved powerful enough to generate
a "take," evidence of an immune response.</TE>
<TE>   Heilman said there are still technical matters that must be
resolved before the trial can begin. For that reason, no one can set
a starting date, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the trial's protocol is still under review by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A core
unresolved matter is the age groups of children that will be sought.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is to be jointly overseen by the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>

<HD>Snack Makers Targeting Trans Fats</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: Frito-Lay becomes the latest firm to eliminate
'partially hydrogenated' vegetable oils. But the health connection
isn't clear-cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First we learned that butter was bad for our hearts. Then we switched
to margarine and found that was unhealthful too. Now nutrition
experts are declaring war on the fats used in almost all commercially
prepared foods.</LD>
<LD>   Commonly listed on food labels as "partially hydrogenated"
vegetable oils, these semisolid shortenings are prized for their
shelf life and less greasy taste. But they contain trans fats, which
studies have associated with higher blood levels of LDL, or bad
cholesterol. Elevated cholesterol is considered a major risk for
heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration is expected early next year to
require the listing of trans fats on nutrition labels. And in two
reports this summer, an expert panel of the National Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Medicine said trans fats aren't essential to
the diet and provide no known health benefit, adding that there is no
safe level of trans fats.</LD>
<TE>   Knowing where the federal government was headed, leaders in the
snack and fast-food arenas have taken action.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Frito-Lay announced that Doritos, Tostitos and Cheetos
are going "trans-fat free" in early 2003. (The company's Lays and
Ruffles potato chips and Fritos corn chips never contained trans
fats.)</TE>
<TE>   Abelardo E. Bru, president and chief executive of Frito-Lay North
America, said the company would simply replace partly hydrogenated
soybean oil with corn oil, one of the polyunsaturated oils thought to
lower bad cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's announced earlier this month that beginning in October,
it would halve the trans fats in its signature French fries and
eventually its chicken nuggets, fried fish and fried chicken
sandwiches and hash browns. McDonald's will change its frying oil to
a new blend of corn and soybean oils. Eventually, it plans to zero
out trans fats from all its foods.</TE>
<TE>   But the health rationale behind all this activity isn't as clear
as we might think, given all the public and commercial concern.</TE>
<TE>   When researchers have given people various amounts and types of
fat, those eating trans fats had higher bad cholesterol, lower HDL
(the good cholesterol), higher triglycerides (another unhealthy blood
fat) and higher lipoprotein A than test subjects given the same
amount of saturated fat each day.</TE>
<TE>   Each of those measures is associated with heart disease, said Dr.
Walter C. Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the
Harvard School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   Saturated fat's seeming superiority was particularly telling,
experts say, because it's that type of fat--found in meat, dairy
products such as butter, coconut, palm and palm kernel oils--that has
long been dietary enemy No. 1 in heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Willett said data from 90,000 women in Harvard's landmark
Nurses Health Study showed "that trans fat was the worst type of fat
in terms of future heart disease risk."</TE>
<TE>   There also is some evidence that those who eat trans fats instead
of more healthful polyunsaturated fats have a higher risk of type 2
diabetes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So although no one has proven that trans fats directly cause heart
disease, nutrition and heart experts are making their judgments based
on the evidence at hand, hammered home through the persistent
lobbying of organizations such as the nonprofit Center for Science in
the Public Interest.</TE>
<TE>   The trans-fat message isn't an easy one to convey to the eating
public. We've been conditioned to think about eating less
cholesterol-laden food, although even the link between dietary
cholesterol and high blood cholesterol remains controversial and far
from proven.</TE>
<TE>   There are three main kinds of fatty acids--saturated,
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated--all made up of carbon and
hydrogen. They get their names based on how those hydrogen atoms
attach to the carbon atoms.</TE>
<TE>   When the maximum number of hydrogen atoms are attached to carbon
atoms, a fat is said to be "saturated."</TE>
<TE>   When some hydrogen is missing and two carbons attach by a double
bond, the fat is said to be "monounsaturated." Examples include
olive, canola and peanut oils, and nutritionists encourage more
consumption of these oils because they're thought to lower our bad
cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   When there are several missing hydrogen atoms and multiple double
bonds, the fat is said to be "polyunsaturated." These also are
considered healthful fats that can lower bad cholesterol. Sources
include seafood and vegetable oils such as safflower, sunflower,
corn, flaxseed and canola.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and
alpha-linolenic acid, are needed by the body.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes hydrogen atoms are added back to a fatty acid to
make it solidify, retain its flavor and last longer, all
characteristics prized by food makers. When this happens, the fat is
said to be "hydrogenated," and the extra hydrogen makes it less
healthful.</TE>
<TE>   "Partly hydrogenated" vegetable oils, in which some of the double
bonds remain, also are solid at room temperature. They're called
"trans fats" after the Latin word "trans," which means "across,"
because the hydrogen atoms end up on either side of a double bond,
across from each other.</TE>
<TE>   The softer the fat, the fewer the trans fats, so liquid margarines
and tub margarines have lower trans fats than those in solid stick
form.</TE>
<TE>   To make a huge dent in the amount of trans fat the average
American consumes, snack makers will need to move beyond fries and
chips to cookies, crackers and cakes. That's not happening as
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial bakers use partly hydrogenated fats not only because
they have longer shelf life, but because they improve texture, said
Mary Mead, a lecturer in the nutritional sciences department at UC
Berkeley. Because the batter or dough is better at holding the air
beaten into it, cakes are lighter, pies are flakier and crackers are
crunchier.</TE>
<TE>   Though trans fat's critics are pleased with recent actions by
McDonald's and Frito-Lay, the changes won't transform Americans'
overall diet--a diet that gets more of its calories from fatty,
salty, fried and processed foods than from old-fashioned,
nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean protein.</TE>
<TE>   That type of eating is a culprit in obesity, heart disease, cancer
and diabetes.</TE>

<HD>When Not Even the Icing Is Enticing</HD>
<DH>Some people appear to have a built-in ability to avoid
food's temptation until they're hungry</DH>

<LD>The key to maintaining a normal body weight may not be a specific
diet, whether it's high in protein, low in fat or rich in fiber.
Instead, Tufts University researchers say, it may depend on your
level of "disinhibition" around food.</LD>
<LD>   People with low disinhibition simply are not tempted by the sights
and smells of great-looking, lip-smacking morsels unless they're
actually hungry, the scientists have found.</LD>
<LD>   People with high disinhibition are quite the opposite, wanting to
eat regardless of their actual state of physical hunger. If they see
something tasty, it's as good as already eaten.</LD>
<TE>   In a study of more than 600 women, Tufts researchers found that
thinness is part and parcel of low disinhibition--the lower the women
scored on a scale of disinhibition, the lower their body mass index.
The study was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Lead researcher Susan Roberts, a nutrition professor and chief of
the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts, says that a person's level
of disinhibition is the strongest predictor of whether she or he will
be fat.</TE>
<TE>   The level appears to be genetically fixed--in other words, we're
born to react a certain way around food--but a conscious decision to
manage a high disinhibition can profoundly affect its expression, and
thus your weight.</TE>
<TE>   Although psychologists have long known about disinhibition and how
it can affect behavior around drugs and alcohol, this was the first
study to prove that levels of disinhibition and eating clearly affect
body weight.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine a culture more likely to encourage mindless
eating than that of industrialized nations. Fatty, sugary,
calorie-laden fare is available everywhere we go. Even when we're not
confronted with the aroma and sight of such foods, we're constantly
reminded of them through advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a culture that encourages disinhibition," Roberts
says. "We have large portions and menu items called Death by Dessert.
The possibilities for opportunistic overeating when you are not
hungry are overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   But forewarned is forearmed. Being aware that you are easily
tempted can help you take control.</TE>
<TE>   The rather old-fashioned concept of counting calories is one of
your strongest allies in this daily battle. So too are using simple
strategies such as putting your knife and fork down between bites to
help slow the eating process. Compensating for eating a large meal by
having less the next day or avoiding foods that you know will trigger
total loss of control are other strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Though such restrained eating is viewed by some professionals as
encouraging neurosis about food, Roberts says it's needed to combat
the ever-increasing problem of obesity.</TE>
<TE>   Neurosis, vigilance, extra care--however you wish to describe this
controlled behavior around food, awareness of high disinhibition
could be the key to preventing a weight problem from spiraling out of
control.</TE>

<HD>Internet Draws the Prying Eyes of the Voyeur</HD>

<LD>Word to women: If you are in the state of Washington, wear pants. Two
Washington men who were convicted of violating the state's voyeurism
statute for secretly taking pictures up the skirts of women and
little girls successfully challenged the law earlier this month. The
use of what has been called "upskirt cams" and "upskirt voyeur
photography" is "reprehensible" and "disgusting," the state Supreme
Court ascertained, but secretly taking photos up women's skirts in
public places is not criminal.</LD>
<LD>   The state's "voyeurism statute, as written, does not prohibit
upskirt photography in a public place," Justice Bobbe Bridge, one of
four women on the state Supreme Court, wrote in a unanimous opinion.
The language of the law fails to explicitly protect people from being
photographed in public places, the justices noted, where people don't
have a reasonable expectation of privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, an expectation of privacy for the interior of one's
skirt--worn explicitly to conceal one's private parts--is not
reasonable.</LD>
<TE>   (After police caught a man taking upskirt videotapes at Disneyland
and could not charge him with doing anything illegal, California
legislators passed a law in 2000 that made it illegal to take
surreptitious photographs or videotapes of a "person's private parts"
or undergarments.)</TE>
<TE>   Time was when a peeping Tom's only means for peeping was a drilled
hole in the wall of a girls' bathroom, but the technology of fish-eye
cameras the size of a pea and the wide world of the Internet have
greatly expanded a voyeur's opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Voyeuristic behavior exists on a continuum in our society from a
person passing a window and noticing someone undressing, to viewing
scantily clad actors parade on television, to the hard-core,
compulsive voyeurs for whom surreptitiously looking up someone's
skirt, down a blouse or at snapshots of undergarments becomes the
primary sexual experience, said Al Cooper, director of San Jose
Marital and Sexuality Centre, a mental-health treatment facility in
Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   Voyeuristic Web sites are the fastest-growing areas of Internet
sexuality, said Cooper, editor of the newly released "Sex and the
Internet: A Guidebook for Clinicians" (Brunner-Routledge), one of the
first professional books of its kind with contributions from leading
clinicians, scholars and academics.</TE>
<TE>   The two general categories of Internet voyeurism, said Cooper, are
photographic shots of unsuspecting women in compromising positions
such as the upskirt, downblouse and bathroom shots, and live
streaming videotape of such things as couples having sex and women
performing their own activity.</TE>
<TE>   The voyeur who cannot control the impulse to gaze at sexual images
of an unsuspecting person for the purpose of sexual gratification has
what psychologists and psychiatrists call a paraphilia, "a condition
in which a person's sexual arousal and gratification depend on
fantasizing about and engaging in sexual behavior that is atypical
and extreme," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   For a voyeur whose behavior qualifies as a paraphilia, the
Internet is the equivalent of a drug to an addict. "The Internet, in
part, is creating this problem," said Fred Berlin, an associate
professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School, who added
that some people stumble upon the sexual images when they go online
and discover the images are arousing.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many people develop cases of pathological
voyeurism, but 25% of Internet users engage in online sexual
activity, Cooper said. Of that 25%, somewhere between 8% and 15%
develop compulsive sexual behavior problems that significantly
disrupt their lives, he said. Voyeurism is a learned behavior, almost
completely a male penchant, and it sometimes starts innocently enough
in adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a normal adolescent prank to peep in a girl's window or
bathroom," observed forensic psychologist Clark Clipson, an evaluator
of sex offenders for the state of California based in San Diego. "It
is a sexual outlet that is safe when all the other avenues are not
available. The repeated association of sexual gratification with
peeping can turn it into a sexual fixation. Part of the arousal for
the voyeur lies in the power and control over the victim who doesn't
know she is being watched."</TE>
<TE>   Though voyeurism bears an element of hostility, said Clipson,
rarely do voyeurs go on to commit hands-on sexual offenses. "These
guys generally don't want to be caught or seen," he said. "They would
be horrified if their victims found out. The idea of actually going
on to rape someone is so completely foreign to them." There are some
voyeurs who use the images purely for sexual gratification. For
others, the sexual behavior is an indirect outlet for repressed
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Like any compulsive sexual behavior, said Jennifer Schneider, an
addiction medicine physician in practice in Tucson, voyeurism
involves the objectification of a person or an anatomical part.
Nothing demonstrates that better than the black band obscuring the
identity of many of the women featured on the voyeuristic upskirt,
downblouse and undergarment-peeping Web sites. Voyeurism distances
the voyeur from intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Voyeurs have to learn how to have real intimacy," said Schneider.
"Obviously, when you are focusing on upskirt or downblouse you are
focusing on the anatomy, not the person." Schneider, who co-authored
"Cybersex Exposed: Simple Fantasy or Obsession?" (Hazeldon, 2001)
with Robert Weiss, a Los Angeles sex addiction therapist, said that
though voyeurs insist their penchant for looking does no harm,
evidence suggests otherwise. In an anonymous online survey of 100
"cybersex addicts" and 100 partners of users of online sex sites,
including voyeuristic ones, Schneider and Weiss asked how
participants thought the online activity affected their sex lives.
Two-thirds of participants said that because of the online activity
they had no sex life or a lousy one.</TE>
<TE>   "Online users said that they found the sex life with their partner
boring or that after looking at images ... they were physically
unable or uninterested in sex with their partner," said Schneider,
who added that stress often drives voyeurs to engage in the behavior.
"The partners said that they were asked to do things they did not
feel comfortable doing, things the online user learned on the
Internet. They also said they felt they could never compete sexually
with what's available on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   For the hard-core voyeur, the path back to real intimacy is not
unlike the path for other addicts, said Berlin, who wrote a chapter
titled "Paraphilias and the Internet" for the book "The Internet and
Sex." People who are compulsive voyeurs "have to recognize that the
behavior has to stop," said Berlin, who added that there are ways to
curb the addiction. Some people take drugs that suppress their sex
drive, some block their computer and some give their wives the code.
"They have to be in a supportive environment where they can speak
openly about it when experiencing a craving. Things can be done from
a mental health perspective. But the public doesn't know about them.
When is the last time you heard an advertisement about where to go if
you are struggling with difficult sexual cravings?"</TE>

<LD>SURVIVING MADNESS: A THERAPIST'S OWN STORY</LD>
<LD>   By Betty Berzon</LD>
<LD>   University of Wisconsin Press</LD>
<TE>   242 pages, $27.95 (illustrated)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a world filled with dangers of all kinds, from terrorism,
global warming and overpopulation to economic injustice, pension-fund
raiders, serial killers and drunk drivers, it is hard to understand
why so many people feel threatened by the mere existence of men and
women who happen to be sexually attracted to members of their own
gender.</TE>
<TE>   Yet homophobia is an attitude so tenaciously entrenched, for a
long time it has afflicted homosexuals as well. Few people know this
better than Los Angeles-based psychotherapist, author and gay
activist Betty Berzon, who tells the story of her own experience in
her dramatic, action-packed autobiography, "Surviving Madness."</TE>
<TE>   Born in St. Louis in 1928, Berzon came of age in a world where she
had no idea what to make of her feelings. She dated boys, but, oddly,
had no fantasies about them. Instead, in her daydreams, she imagined
herself as "Clark Gable or Errol Flynn sweeping some beauty off her
feet....I'd heard of homosexuality ... heard that it was a sickness,
and I wondered if I had caught it." A bright, outgoing girl with no
trouble attracting boys, she was frightened by her overpoweringly
sexual feelings for women.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon alternated between two approaches. She went ahead with a
"normal" life of dating--and later, having affairs with--men. And she
began to investigate the lesbian scene.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the "normal" world of dating and mating, nor the intense,
closeted world of 1950s lesbians felt right to her. In her 20s,
Berzon, by now a successful Los Angeles bookseller, suffered a mental
breakdown following the breakup of her relationship with a female
lover. It was during her sojourn as a patient at a psychiatric
hospital that two people--a fellow patient and a doctor--suggested
her gift for talking to people and drawing them out might make her a
good therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon plunged into her new career with energy and zest, becoming
involved in all the latest trends, from encounter groups and the
Human Potential Movement to (heterosexual) orgies. But her 40th
birthday in 1968 marked a turning point when she realized that she
was no longer content to evade her sexual orientation. The rest, as
they say, was history--in this case, part of the history of the gay
rights movement, as Berzon became involved in a multitude of
activities, from the establishment of Los Angeles's Gay and Lesbian
Community Services Center to the successful campaign to persuade the
psychiatric and psychology professions to drop homosexuality from
their list of mental disorders. Along the way, she fought her own
internalized homophobia and anxieties about romantic commitment,
finding true love at last with her permanent partner, Teresa
DeCrescenzo.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon's experiences as a "gay affirmative" therapist, a political
activist and a woman committed to a permanent partnership were
reflected in the popular advice books she went on to write. "Setting
Them Straight" provided solid suggestions as to what gay and
gay-sympathetic people could do when confronted with homophobic
remarks and attitudes. "Permanent Partners" and "The Intimacy Dance"
offered sound advice on building long-term relationships. Too often,
Berzon believes, gays and lesbians have "internalized" society's
dismissive attitudes toward their partnerships: "can't work, won't
last, don't count." "Our relationships," she insists, "can work and
last, and they absolutely do count just as much as we want them to."</TE>
<TE>   Although not an advice book, Berzon's memoir has the same
pragmatic, can-do approach, and it is instructive to see how her
ideas grew out of the difficulties she experienced. Having found
strength in the sense of "rage" that animated the post-Stonewall gay
rights movement, Berzon was shocked to find some of that "rage" being
turned against her and her colleagues, when a cadre of disaffected
staffers at the Gay Community Services Center accused the project
directors of mismanagement: "CLOSE IT DOWN OR WE'LL BURN IT DOWN!"
they screamed helpfully.</TE>
<TE>   "What insanity was this?" wondered Berzon. "Friend against friend?
How gullible people can be, allowing themselves to be misled into
villain-victim scenarios, manipulated into violent protests with
little or no evidence that a wrong has been done to them." Berzon
notes how the rage that feeds legitimate protest movements can become
a permanent attitude, turning former allies into enemies and leading
to "the circular firing squad" that has been such a prevalent feature
of revolutions ever since the French one.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the psychiatric help she received in the 1950s,
Berzon feels gratitude rather than rancor toward the doctor who saved
her life but who also reassured her that she was not homosexual: "Did
Fred Feldman do me a disservice by reinforcing my own homophobia?
Given the zeitgeist of the 1950s, I don't see how he could have done
anything different....I have never wavered in my certainty that his
only motive was to help me. I'm just sorry he didn't stick around to
see the world change. I truly believe he would have changed with it.
In later years, I wanted to go back to Dr. Feldman for two reasons:
to fix his thinking about ... gay people and to pay him something for
the years he saw me without charge. I was distressed to learn he had
died before I could reconnect with him. I still believe I owe him my
life."</TE>
<TE>   And a useful and fascinating one it turned out to be!</TE>

<HD>Clash of the Featherweights</HD>
<DH>At virtual cockfights, the scene is wacky and hip--and the
crowds are downright fowl</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squeezed into a dark basement in a Chinatown alley were a couple
hundred people, their bodies glistening with sweat as they slapped
down bets, swigged Tecate and bellowed as two contestants attacked
each other.</LD>
<LD>   Feathers flying, the rivals grappled in a pecking and clawing
frenzy. Soon enough, one died. The other strutted in victory.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Cockfight Arena.</LD>
<TE>   This was no ordinary fowl play. In fact, no real roosters were
hurt during the fight because no real roosters were involved. The
contestants were people dressed in rooster regalia rigged with
sensors. Their flapping and pecking were turned into digital data via
accelerometers--tiny chips used to sense movement--and mapped by a
computer into a virtual cockfight between on-screen birds.</TE>
<TE>   Think of the costumes as elaborate controllers for a computer game
and the contest as a convergence of gaming, physics and performance
art--all designed to be maximally absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in how you can have the audience be performers in
a way that's not corny," said Mark Allen, one of the organizers of
the event, held Sept. 20 at a cooperative space called C-Level in the
burgeoning artists' enclave in Chinatown. "If you look at performance
art in the 1970s, it was about breaking down space between artist and
audience. People live in bubbles, and you had these sidewalk
performances to break people out of their bubbles. But there was
something intrinsically confrontational about that. Who's to decide
that it's my role to break you out of your bubble?"</TE>
<TE>   At Cockfight Arena, guests signed up for bouts using pseudonyms
such as "Thermonuclear Slug." In the course of the evening, close to
20 bouts were fought, with several people signing up more than once.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something charming about taking volunteers," Allen said.
"Once they wear the bird suit and start playing, there's something
about the competition, the virtual space, that makes them let go of
their self-consciousness and give these out-of-control performances.
How could you not? I mean, cockfight? Basement?"</TE>
<TE>   One volunteer was Molly Rysman, a tattooed 25-year-old from Echo
Park. She suited up as "Foghorn Leghorn," donning a beaked helmet and
aluminum-framed wings. A trumpeter, musician Jeff Knowlton, signaled
the beginning of her bout. Vigorous flapping ensued. Rysman's
bit-mapped bird rose to the top of the screen as she flapped toward
her opponent. The two approached each other, then both started
pounding their foot pedals to initiate their claw attacks, spilling
virtual blood. They pulled away. More flapping. The crowd went mad.</TE>
<TE>   "You fight like a hen!"</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon, you chicken!"</TE>
<TE>   "Shake it! Shake it!"</TE>
<TE>   Rysman won one round, but lost the other two.</TE>
<TE>   She paused later to evaluate her performance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty intense," said Rysman, who coordinates a city program
for troubled teenagers. "When your cock gets hit, you see all this
blood, and you see some of your soul fly away. It's kinda gruesome.
And it's disheartening when your see your cock die."</TE>
<TE>   The evening was the second in an occasional series of
collaborations by a loose group of artists, gamers and geeks. Their
first was based on the video game Tekken and called "Tekken Torture."
In that stunt, players got electric shocks when their online
characters were hit. The zapping did not inflict pain as much as it
momentarily hobbled the player.</TE>
<TE>   Cockfight Arena was organized by CalArts graduates Mark Allen and
Eddo Stern. The costumes were designed and built by Jessica Hutchins,
Karen Lofgren, Bill Balou and Cecile Bouchier, and Julian Gross and
Jason Brown helped design the game's graphics and sound. Daniella
Meeker, a Caltech grad student, designed the gambling software that
calculated the odds and the payout.</TE>
<TE>   Although just as competitive, the bouts differed radically from
traditional cockfighting. In many parts of the world the sport is
considered a male contest, and women are often barred from attending,
said Alan Dundes, a professor of anthropology and folklore at the
University of California at Berkeley who wrote "The Cockfight: A
Casebook."</TE>
<TE>   Much like football, Dundes posits, cockfighting is homoerotic
combat. In his book, he reprints a passage from the 4th century, a
rumination by St. Augustine on the question: "Why do cocks fight?"
Such combat--like war--is evidence of the presence of evil, which
proves the existence of good, Augustine concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Such profound thoughts were unlikely to have crossed the minds of
the revelers at Cockfight Arena, most of whom were there for the
spectacle. The crowd, a mix of Chinatown denizens, game industry
nerds, art school grads and Caltech alumni, was charged with a giddy
sense of being part of something absurd, unpredictable and entirely
hip.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wacky, bizarre, insane," said Eddie Diaz, who wandered in
after having dinner in the neighborhood. "I love these costumes!
They're perfect. Are the feathers real?"</TE>

<LD>Leopard Cats</LD>
<LD>   Did you know there is a wildcat that looks a lot like a house cat?
It's called a leopard cat.</LD>
<LD>   The most common subspecies, the Asian leopard cat, has a highly
spotted pattern on its fur and looks somewhat different from your
average tabby. It lives in India, China and Southeast Asia. But the
Amur leopard cat that lives in Russia isn't as distinctly spotted. At
quick glance, it can easily be mistaken for a house cat. However, its
striped tail, spotted coat and thick fur would soon make it appear to
be something different. And its personality would certainly not be
the same as a pet cat's.</LD>
<TE>   Leopard cats weigh 5 to 10 pounds and are fairly common in the
wild. They are sometimes mated with domestic cats. The resulting
breed is called a Bengal cat, because the scientific name for a
leopard cat is Felis bengalensis.</TE>
<TE>   The Exotic Feline Breeding Compound's Feline Conservation Center
in Rosamond is home to a pair of Amur leopard cats. You can see and
learn more about leopard cats and other wild felines by visiting the
center or its Web site at www.cathouse-fcc.org. Center hours are 10
a.m. to 4 p.m., Thursday through Tuesday. For more information, call
(661) 256-3793 or (661) 256-3332 for recorded directions.</TE>

<LD>"Sleeping Ugly"</LD>
<LD>   by Jane Yolen</LD>
<LD>   This book is about a princess who is beautiful on the outside and
ugly on the inside. Her name is Princess Miserella. One day, she gets
lost in the middle of the forest. She kicks an old fairy to wake her
up so she will take her home. Instead, the fairy takes her to Plain
Jane's house. Plain Jane is ugly on the outside and beautiful on the
inside.</LD>
<TE>   I like the story because it is the opposite of "Sleeping Beauty."
Read the book to see how it ends.</TE>

<HD>A Mini, Mini, Mini World</HD>
<DH>With the short, short skirts and the gangster-inspired
wear, it's '60s deja vu. And then there's gladiator chic.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MILAN--Sometimes you just have to stop and listen to the music: the
Beatles at Gucci, Lou Reed at MaxMara and again at Dolce &amp; Gabbana,
and Jimi Hendrix at Emporio Armani. While many designers in New York
were time-traveling to the 1940s and '50s, designers here can't get
enough of the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   In an apparent nod to Paco Rabanne, whose retrospective opened
here just last week, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana showed a
chain-mail miniskirt and a fur coat with chain-mail insets. At Prada,
stark-white modernist mini-dresses decorated with chunky plastic
beads harked back to Courreges, and the silver metal collars that
anchored MaxMara's jersey dresses mixed references to Pierre Cardin's
work with another of the week's emerging themes: gladiator chic.</LD>
<LD>   Gucci's Tom Ford managed to capture both the glamour of 1960s
jet-setters and 1980s "glamazon" supermodels without looking too
retro. There were soft, silk tunic dresses with fluttery sleeves and
super-short, tight skirts; tulle kimonos embroidered with
hummingbirds and cherry blossoms; and streamlined flight pants tied
at the ankle and accessorized with metallic silver wedge-heel pumps,
aviator glasses and bamboo-handled rectangular calfskin bags. His
piece de resistance was a kinder, gentler bondage dress that wrapped
the body (at least to the top of the thigh) in strips of fabric woven
out of pinkish gold metallic thread.</LD>
<TE>   With news last week that Gucci Group's profits are down 55% in the
second quarter, there's a lot riding on the bum-grazing hems of
Ford's skirts, but he seemed confident that his customers will be
willing to show some leg and spend some cash for that special piece.</TE>
<TE>   Miuccia Prada's take on the 1960s was more literal--sleeveless
white or black mini-dresses with sculptural plastic beads sewn onto
the collars like necklaces; slim Bermuda shorts in Sgt. Pepper-like
pink satin brocade; and a hot-pink cheongsam top paired with an
acid-orange satin miniskirt.</TE>
<TE>   Accessories were equally dramatic--flat silver sandals with metal
cuffs around the ankles instead of straps, and rectangular or
half-moon-shape bags with similar metal rings for shoulder handles.
(And you thought YSL's Mombasa horn handle was uncomfortable!) The
collection will probably be a little much for most tastes, but it
succeeded at capturing the excitement that comes from finding and
wearing a one-of-a-kind vintage piece, minus the mothballs.</TE>
<TE>   Emporio Armani's collection, although exhaustive as always, was
all about an ease reminiscent of Faye Dunaway's clothes in "Bonnie
and Clyde," complete with beret-wearing models holding unlit cigars.
Wide-legged trousers, some gathered at the ankle following an Armani
fall trend, fitted blazers in muted stripes that hit just below the
waist, suede bomber jackets and long skirts ruched partway up the
sides, were some of the most wearable clothes to come down the
runways here thus far. But with so much to look at, it was hard to
remember any of them.</TE>
<TE>   At Fendi, Karl Lagerfeld presented the sophisticated warrior
dressed in goddess-like tunics in a painterly, blue and purple
abstract print, accessorized with metallic gladiator sandals, arm
bands and chokers. Lean blue-suede pants were slashed across the legs
to reveal a touch of skin, and deep V-neck chiffon blouses were held
together across the chest with silver chains, which also dangled from
hobo bags and decorated the sleeves of a leather motorcycle jacket.
It was a stunning collection of clothes for the woman who fights her
battles not on the field or even in the boardroom, but in the back of
a chauffeured car.</TE>
<TE>   MaxMara's collection began with a smart, olive-green
patent-leather trench coat before moving into fair-weather cotton
tunic dresses with back ruching. Nighttime looks included '60s-era
bra tops that were a nod to Rudi Gernreich, and more goddess dresses,
these anchored with silver collars, and sparkling slouchy silver-mesh
turtlenecks, all worn with gladiator sandals, this time with straps
that buckled around the calf.</TE>
<TE>   Dolce and Gabbana introduced the teen warrior in their D&amp;G
diffusion line, offering T-shirts with "Roma" in gold lettering
across the chest, over an image of the Roman Coliseum, fun visors
with Mercury's silver wings on either side and gold clutch purses
with the word "slave" scrawled across the front. The now-familiar
toga-like dresses were shown over T-shirts at D&amp;G and sliding off
bare shoulders in the designers' main line.</TE>
<TE>   At the main line Dolce &amp; Gabbana show Sunday, Sean "P. Diddy"
Combs took a front seat for the designers' dizzying mix-and-match of
40 years of fashion that included motorcycle jackets and clunky boots
weighted down with more silver studs than you'd find at a Sex Pistols
concert, astronaut-like silver-lacquered muslin anoraks sprinkled
with zippers, and off-the-shoulder striped sailor shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The designers also used the show to launch a small new line, Dolce
&amp; Gabbana Vintage, that included black, side-laced tube dresses and
other creations inspired by their archives. After 17 years, why
shouldn't they recycle? If fashion is going to continue to dip into
the past season after season, designers may as well start referencing
themselves.</TE>

<HD>Pucci Goes Sexy, Wild With Christian Lacroix</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILAN</DL>
<LD>Christian Lacroix has had a love affair with color since he was a
toddler so taken with the multihued flowers in his family garden in
Arles, France, that he tried to eat them. Now, after more than 20
years in the fashion business, the designer most often associated
with the pink pouf-skirted excess of the 1980s is playing with color
again as the new head designer of the beloved Italian fashion house
Pucci.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, at one of the most anticipated events of fashion week
here, his debut collection was well-received for breaking with the
old, dowdy image of Pucci and sexing things up, although the
sportswear still needs refining.</LD>
<LD>   Famous for its vivid, abstract prints, the label was founded in
1950 by Italian aristocrat Marchese Emilio Pucci di Barsento (the
title dates back to the 1600s) and worn by Sophia Loren, Paloma
Picasso, Grace Kelly and other jet-setters. Legend has it, Marilyn
Monroe was even buried in a Pucci silk jersey dress.</LD>
<TE>   The house has been attempting a fashion rebirth since Pucci died
14 years ago and luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
acquired a majority stake in 2000. Soon after, Julio Espada, a
virtual unknown in the fashion world, became head designer. Although
there has been a lot of recent interest in vintage Pucci, Espada's
three collections failed to generate much excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I heard that LVMH bought the house of Pucci, I
thought, 'What a lucky guy who gets to be in charge of that,' "
Lacroix said Thursday at the Pucci studio off Piazza della Republica.
The Paris couturier was dressed in uncharacteristically drab
colors--a gray vest over a white T-shirt and black pants--so as not
to lose himself in the prints, he said in near-perfect English.</TE>
<TE>   Lacroix made his fashion mark in 1981 when he landed a job as a
designer for Jean Patou. Six years later, he set up his own couture
house with the help of then-budding entrepreneur Bernard Arnault, who
now heads LVMH and who also counts Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and
Givenchy in his fashion stable. Today, Lacroix, 51, has
ready-to-wear, jeans, children's, bridal and table-top collections
under his own name, as well as projects doing theatrical set design
and decoration for France's TGV high-speed trains. It was Arnault who
suggested him for Pucci.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a synergy, a link between the house of Pucci and
my own inspiration," said Lacroix, who recalls a time when, as a
college student, kids threw stones at him for dressing like a dandy.
(The style may have been at home on London's Carnaby Street but was
apparently a bit too peacockish for the south of France.)</TE>
<TE>   His admiration for the label runs deep: Some of his first fashion
sketches were inspired by Pucci; his wife, Francoise, is an avid
collector of vintage Pucci; and in 1988, Lacroix dedicated a
ready-to-wear collection to the man himself, titled "Homage to the
Marchese."</TE>
<TE>   He met Pucci's daughter, Laudomia, presently the company's image
director, when he invited her to the show in Paris. "It was like
going home," she said Thursday at the Pucci studio. "We've done a lot
since my father died, but it's always been an interpretation, not a
re-creation. With Lacroix, we're starting to move in that direction,"
said the 41-year-old, who lives in Florence, where Pucci is based,
and who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the company archives housed
there.</TE>
<TE>   Lacroix's task is to expand sportswear offerings and develop a
winter image for a label that started with skiwear but eventually
became known for resort wear. He tells the now famous story of how
Emilio got his start in the fashion business when in a 1948 issue of
Harper's Bazaar, Diana Vreeland published a chance photo of Pucci
skiwear shot on the slopes of St.-Moritz.</TE>
<TE>   "Skiing is at the beginning of story, so why not do printed fur or
even printed snowboards?" asked Lacroix, who traces his own color
consciousness to a lifelong love of bullfighting, Provencal and gypsy
traditions and modern art.</TE>
<TE>   At the debut show Saturday, he displayed his knack for combining
tricky colors and patterns. Sexy, printed chiffon dresses with
handkerchief hems will be brilliant in Ibiza, Capri and maybe even on
the HBO series "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   But the sportswear wasn't as impressive. Lacroix's best pieces
were his simplest: a short, fitted trench coat in a swirling pink,
purple and lime-green print, and a classic, knee-length full skirt in
Pucci's original 1954 black-and-white Palio print. Hooded, zip-front
blouson jackets with strips of black-and-white print down the arm,
and print leggings looked dated compared to the shrunken hooded
sweatshirts and low-slung sweatpants that are today's wardrobe
staples.</TE>
<TE>   The collection was already in progress when Lacroix was hired in
April. Hopefully, next season he will do even more simple, yet
refined, sportswear--slim-fitting T-shirts, shaped oxford shirts and
jean jackets, for example--and be more whimsical about how he uses
Pucci's signature prints. After all, the formula worked wonders for
Burberry plaid.</TE>

<DH>Should the media refer to Iraqi president as 'Saddam' or
'Hussein'?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN and RANDY TRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein has been a familiar name since the Persian Gulf War in
1991. But as the United States again weighs the prospect of war with
Iraq, the question of what to call the Iraqi president is becoming a
bit of a media quandary.</LD>
<LD>   At National Public Radio, a caller from Grand Rapids, Mich.,
wondered whether calling the Iraqi president by his first name was
part of a deliberate media effort to demean him.</LD>
<LD>   In Seattle, Post-Intelligencer reader representative Glenn
Drosendahl tussled with a similar question from a reader.</LD>
<TE>   And in Jacksonville, Fla., an editor at the Times-Union raised the
same topic at a periodic review of rules by the paper's in-house
style committee, which decrees every element of style from how to
quote those who stutter to whether to use obscenities.</TE>
<TE>   Most Arab scholars insist that it is not belittling to refer to
Saddam Hussein as Saddam for several reasons: first, that is his
given name, whereas Hussein is his father's given name; second, that
is how most English-language newspapers in the Arab world refer to
him and how Iraqis refer to him when they're not calling him Mr.
President; and finally, Saddam seems logical because that is how most
Americans now know him.</TE>
<TE>   "Strictly speaking, calling him by Hussein makes no sense," said
Michael Fischbach, a historian at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland,
Va., who specializes in the Middle East. "It's like Madonna. That's
his name."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a vague sense of discomfort is felt by some editors, who
worry that perhaps they are being manipulated by a White House
seemingly intent on war, as they were 12 years ago when the
president's father, George H.W. Bush, deliberately mispronounced
Saddam Hussein's name. Putting the emphasis on the wrong syllable,
experts say the first President Bush also converted the meaning of
the name in Arabic, from sa-DAM, which means one who confronts, to
Sad-um, which means a barefoot beggar.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last war, you saw Saddam in print more because the
first President Bush decided to have fun with the pronunciation,"
said Edward Turzanski, who teaches political science at La Salle
University in Philadelphia and who used to be a government analyst.
"Now you see Hussein more often. It's anglicized."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest newspapers--including the Los Angeles Times
and Washington Post--refer to the Iraqi leader on second reference as
Hussein; the more formal New York Times and Wall Street Journal call
him Mr. Hussein. By contrast, USA Today is sticking with Saddam, as
is Associated Press, which sets style rules for 1,700 U.S. newspapers
and 5,000 television and radio outlets in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   CNN splits the difference--using neither Saddam nor Hussein on
second reference, but rather Saddam Hussein, or the Iraqi president.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the larger question is whether calling the Iraqi leader
Saddam, although linguistically proper, may play into White House
efforts to personalize the conflict with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not in and of itself insulting," said Shibley Telhami, the
Anwar Sadat Professor of Peace and Development at the University of
Maryland. "In Iraq, they do call him Saddam, and sometimes in an
endearing way."</TE>
<TE>   What bothers him, said Telhami, is that the American media treat
Saddam Hussein as if he were Iraq, something he says the press would
never do to the king of Saudi Arabia or the president of Egypt. "Ever
since the Gulf War, there's been an individual focus on Saddam," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That finding is borne out by Robert Lichter, president of the
Center for Media &amp; Public Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based media
think tank. A study conducted by the center found that in coverage of
the Persian Gulf War, 86% of references to the Iraqi leader on
television broadcasts were negative, portraying Saddam Hussein as a
butcher who had used chemical weapons on his own people or as a
dictator who had tortured and killed his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Lichter says television journalists were hardly benign in their
descriptions. "If they shifted from the full name to the first name,
it's not an indicator of some lessening of respect," he said, since
there was apparently precious little of that to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   The problem of how to refer to international figures is not new.
Asian names have long bedeviled Americans trying to pronounce them
correctly, but their ordering has never been much of a problem--in
referring to Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung as Mao, for example,
American editors were only conforming to Chinese style that puts the
family name first.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan names have been more of a challenge, as many in Afghanistan
use only one.</TE>
<TE>   And there are others whose names cause confusion. An opposition
leader who was killed as he attempted to enter Afghanistan last
October was named Abdul Haq. Abdul means "son of," so his name
translates as son of Haq, his father. Some news outlets referred to
the assassinated leader as Mr. Haq, even though, in this case, using
both names might make linguistic sense.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, reader's representative Drosendahl consulted with an
Algerian reporter in the newsroom and Palestinian community members,
about the appropriate way to refer to Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   All felt Saddam on second reference was demeaning. But when he
checked with an expert at the University of Washington, he learned
that Saddam was technically correct.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want it to be perceived as pejorative," Drosendahl
said. "[But] there's enough common usage of Saddam. We decided we
wouldn't change our policy."</TE>
<TE>   At one Florida newspaper, style gurus decided to stay the course
with "Saddam," after discussing the matter at a recent meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The gist is that internationally, in general and among our
readers, he's referred to as Saddam," said Mike Marnio, news editor
of the Times-Union.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press recently reminded papers of the
Saddam-on-second-reference rule. Although AP style is not binding on
member papers, the edicts tend to be respected, if only because
changing the name in every story sent by the Associated Press could
be a time-consuming--and error-inducing--prospect.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times has not revisited the issue since the last
war. Nor has the New York Times. "We haven't had reason to reconsider
our usage, and we haven't received complaints from readers,
authorities or sources," e-mailed New York Times assistant managing
editor Allan M. Siegal, the paper's language guardian.</TE>
<TE>   One reason some newspapers adopted the Saddam usage for the last
war is that King Hussein of Jordan (he had one name only, like Queen
Elizabeth), was still alive, and there was concern about confusing
the two. But the king died in 1999, and now, what binds Saddam to
U.S. readers and listeners is more habit than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually his name is Saddam Hussein al-Majd al-Takriti," said Tom
Kent, deputy managing editor at Associated Press. "He uses neither
al-Majd or al-Takriti, and Hussein is not a last name."</TE>
<TE>   So, at AP anyway, Saddam for the first war, Saddam still.</TE>

<DH>Despite rough start in life, Russian-born skater sets
sights on Olympics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arms spread like wings, 11-year-old Grisha Fournier zips across the
ice, 70 pounds of intensity on skates. A gaggle of little girls in
sparkly skating costumes, sort of Grisha groupies, cheers him on.</LD>
<LD>   Two-and-a-half years ago, Grisha was in a Russian orphanage.
Today, he is a schoolkid in Rancho Cucamonga talking about "when I
get to the Olympics" in 2010. His heart is set on following in the
skateprints of reigning men's Olympic gold medalist Alexi Yagudin of
Russia--but doing it as an American.</LD>
<LD>   Is he competitive? "Yeah," but "you don't want to get too cocky so
your head blows up," says Grisha, a charismatic, auburn-haired
fifth-grader who's been figure skating for only a year but has won
three of the four competitions he's entered.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday at Center Ice in Ontario, his parents, Gina,
40, and Mike, 45, watched as Grisha took to the ice in the Rim of the
World Open Championships, catching their breath as he missed an axel
jump and fell. But, as quickly as he went down, Grisha was up again,
executing a flawless axel.</TE>
<TE>   Off the ice, getting an encouraging hug from his mother, he was
annoyed with himself--"That jump is one I do every day." His father
observed, "A lot of kids would fall apart" after missing a jump. "He
doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   The kid has grit and determination, qualities associated with a
survivor. Which he is. Abandoned by his mother when he was 2, Grisha
lived with his alcoholic father and later with his older sister,
Kseniya (called Susha), in their elderly grandmother's one-room
apartment in Perm, a Ural regions city of 1 million. When the
grandmother could no longer care for them, she placed them in an
orphanage known as Children's Home No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   There they stayed for about two years, two of hundreds of older
children for whom adoption--especially as members of a sibling
group--is a faint hope.</TE>
<TE>   For Susha and Grisha, there had been one wrenching disappointment.
In the summer of 1999, they'd been among abandoned and
institutionalized children brought to America by Kidsave
International for an eight-week stay--the first time they'd left
Perm. But their host family in Memphis, Tenn., decided not to adopt
them. "They wanted me," says 14-year-old Susha, but not Grisha. The
two refused to be separated.</TE>
<TE>   So, it was back to the orphanage. But that August, as Gina
Fournier was browsing the Internet, she read about the siblings on an
adoption Web site. She and Mike had been hoping for two years to
adopt an infant.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd already ruled out international adoption because of the
cost," Gina says. Still, she was intrigued enough to contact Kidsave,
which promptly sent a grainy video of Susha and Grisha being
interviewed at the orphanage--a rather solemn girl of 11 and a
gap-toothed boy of 8.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what we could handle," Gina adds. "We'd read all
the horror stories about Romanian adoptions," of children with severe
trauma and stress disorders. But, watching the video, they "fell in
love immediately."</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, the Fourniers traveled to Perm to meet the kids
they'd decided to adopt. "It was a leap of faith," Gina says. "But
it's just been magic from Day 1. We're much luckier than they are.
They would have been something no matter what. But our house was so
empty before them." Although they learned right afterward that a
birth mother had chosen them to adopt her infant, they have no
regrets, Gina says. "Fifty million people were lined up for that
infant. No one wanted these kids."</TE>
<TE>   That first meeting in Perm, all parties agree, was "kind of
scary." Susha was "frozen in fear," Gina says. "Now she's Miss
Outgoing." The Fourniers had sent the children pictures of their
home. Grisha says, "It was scary for the first 30 seconds, but then
it was, like, yes! I'm, like--whoa!--a giant bedroom." Seeing the
backyard spa, Grisha says, "We thought it was a giant bathtub."</TE>
<TE>   A week after the Fourniers returned to their Alta Loma home, Susha
and Grisha flew to L.A. They spoke almost no English. Grisha recalls,
"Me and my sister would talk at the dinner table in Russian. My
parents said, 'No more Russian at the table.' That's how we learned
English." The Fourniers anglicized his given name--Grigori--to
Gregory, but he chooses to keep his nickname, Grisha. Mike laughs and
says, "On the [Little League] baseball team, he's Greg. On the ice,
he's Grisha. Analyze that."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Grisha and Susha arrived, they learned that their
father had died in an alcohol-related accident. They maintain some
ties to Russia, telephoning their grandmother once a month. Grisha,
who now speaks English better than Russian, can be overheard saying,
"yeah, yeah--I mean, da."</TE>
<TE>   To help them make the transition to Southern California, Gina
signed them up for an eight-week city recreation figure-skating
program. Then, she says, "we moved on to soccer. Grisha didn't like
it. It was too hot." He took to baseball, but at 4 feet, 6 inches he
was a bit short. He tried gymnastics but promptly fell on his head.
Going back to Plan A, Gina says, "we thought ice hockey. I got on
EBay and got him a $10 pair of figure skates and a pair of hockey
skates and put him on the ice. The first time he tried the figure
skates, he said, 'Oh, I like these better.' "</TE>
<TE>   She had certain reservations. First, it is expensive. And "Grisha
is a guy. You know the stereotypes about male skaters--'Men in
Tights.' " She worried that he'd be teased at school. But, she says,
he's pretty popular at Caryn Elementary in Rancho Cucamonga and just
tells schoolmates that a skater must be strong and athletic.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Grisha was spotted by veteran coach Joan Heasley, whose
daughter Vicki was a world-class pairs skater in the late '70s. Joan
Heasley and partner Brian Tuck, who in 1956 represented Great Britain
in the Olympics, asked last December to coach him.</TE>
<TE>   Heasley says it's been 20 years since she coached a skater with
such potential. "He's exceptionally gifted. He doesn't sulk or
complain." Since Heasley and Tuck have been coaching him, she says,
he's progressed "more than the average child in three years. This kid
has not only talent but drive, determination and good attitude. He
crashes and never minds falling. The most dedicated skater we've ever
worked with."</TE>
<TE>   Grisha's enjoying it while it lasts. "I mostly like performing,"
Grisha says, fixing listeners with his big brown eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of like to know that somebody's watching." He smiles,
revealing a mouthful of braces, and says, "I fall down a lot. If you
don't fall down a lot, it means you're not trying hard enough. It's
no good if you just do tiny jumps" and stay on your feet.</TE>
<TE>   He has no interest in pairs skating. "When you get a medal, you
want to know that you did it all by yourself. Nobody was out there to
help you."</TE>
<TE>   Asked which is his most difficult jump, Grisha asks, "That I can
land?" That would be the axel, the one he flubbed in the recent
competition, even though he went on to best three other young skaters
and take first place.</TE>
<TE>   "He really poured it on with his footwork" to erase judges'
memories of the tumble, Gina says. Grisha is into fancy footwork, for
which Russian skaters are noted, and he sometimes explains, "Mom, I'm
Russian."</TE>
<TE>   He knows that he "kind of started skating a little behind time"
for an Olympic hopeful and has some catching up to do. Commonly,
skaters begin at 7 or 8, some even earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Heasley says their goal, which she acknowledges is very ambitious,
is for Grisha to compete in the juvenile division by the end of next
year. That's three levels up from pre-preliminary, his current
division. If he does that and is one of the top four juvenile boys in
the Southwest, he'll get to go to the U.S. figure-skating
championships. "If ever anybody could do it, it's Grisha," Heasley
says.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a long and expensive road to the Olympics. And there are
limits to what Gina, who works part time from home writing proposals
for a government agency career center, and Mike, a cost accountant
with Cytec, an Anaheim-based aerospace materials manufacturer, can
afford.</TE>
<TE>   Heasley and Tuck are giving them a break on coaching, for which
fees can run $80 to $100 an hour and average $1,500 a month. In
addition, ice time is $8 an hour, and Grisha practices 90 minutes at
least six days a week. Acting lessons, ballet lessons, a
choreographer and a costumer will be part of the mix. And he just got
his first pair of new skates: $500.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like anything you go into," Gina says. "You start out
thinking, 'Oh, this is fun,' and you end up getting sucked in by the
sport and your kid's success and the joy he has in doing it. It
started so small, a lesson here, a lesson there, and it just took
off. It gave him so much self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   Susha, a pretty blond with deep dimples, expressed little interest
in skating but is usually there to cheer for Grisha. "She's very
protective of her brother, very supportive," Gina says. "She sees
he's got talent. There's no jealousy. Her talent is different, not so
flashy." A freshman at Rancho Cucamonga High School, she is a top
student and, her mother says, her goal is to get a fully paid
scholarship to a four-year college.</TE>
<TE>   Although focused on skating, Grisha still likes baseball. He also
likes to "collect stuff like remote control cars." And, he grins,
trophies.</TE>

<LD>Archie and Pa were in the kitchen sanding a bench Pa had made. Ma sat
mending socks.</LD>
<LD>   "Last winter was a harsh one," Pa sighed. "There'll be plenty of
work to get the farm back into shape."</LD>
<LD>   Archie understood that he would have to work from dawn until dusk.
The family would probably even have to miss some Sunday mornings in
church.</LD>
<TE>   Tilling the soil, planting and harvesting, and tending the
livestock were hard enough. But being at the mercy of wild winds and
damaging hailstorms could make any farmer's life awfully
discouraging.</TE>
<TE>   Ma put down her mending and looked up at Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, go ahead and tell Archie what we've been discussing," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," Archie said. "I'll be working long, hard hours alongside
Pa, isn't that right?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ahem," Pa cleared his throat.</TE>
<TE>   "Go on now," Ma urged.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thinking of</TE>

<TE>   with us," Pa said.</TE>
<TE>   "What?" Archie</TE>
<TE>   asked.</TE>
<TE>   "An orphan train is coming through Red Rock next week," Pa
continued. "It's coming from New York and carrying children who have
no ma or pa or whose folks are too sick to care for them...."</TE>
<TE>   "An orphan?" Archie cried. "You're going to adopt a stranger from
an orphanage?"</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know about adoption just yet," Ma said. "We can take in
a boy for the harvest. He can help out and at the same time get away
from the crowded city and breathe fresh country air."</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't make any moves without talking it over with you
first, Son," Pa said.</TE>

<HD>Emmys Too Hot a Ticket for Fan of 'West Wing'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn rooted for his favorite television
show, "West Wing," to do well at the Emmy Awards last week, but he
ended up doing so from his home in San Pedro instead of an orchestra
seat at the Shrine Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's office said before last week's Emmy Awards that the mayor
would attend. And then, hours later, came word that he would not
attend after all.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out the first notice was sent out to the press before the
Los Angeles Ethics Commission had a chance to weigh in on the issue.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's staff advised Hahn at the 11th hour that he could not
accept free tickets from the Emmy Awards because he had recently
signed a $40,000 waiver of city fees for the show.</TE>
<TE>   City law prohibits receiving gifts worth more than $100 from a
restricted source, which is someone materially benefiting from an
action taken by the official in the previous nine months.</TE>
<TE>   With Emmy tickets valued at $400 to $1,700, Hahn could have gone
only if he had paid the difference between the fair market value and
the $100 limitation, said LeeAnn Pelham, executive director of the
Ethics Commission.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why Hahn decided not to attend, a spokeswoman cited
illness in the family.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was an allergic reaction to paying $1,600 for a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Gives Reporters a 'West Wing' Break</TE>
<TE>   As the annual Sacramento bill-signing frenzy draws to a close,
Gov. Gray Davis, his staff and the Capitol press corps are growing
weary.</TE>
<TE>   So one day last week, administration officials promised reporters
a treat: an early exit, no late bombshells landing right at deadline.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail, press secretary Steve Maviglio revealed a second
purpose behind his thoughtful gesture: to allow reporters to get
"ready for the season premiere of 'The West Wing.' "</TE>
<TE>   First Lady Sharon Davis no doubt endorsed the move. The NBC drama
is her favorite show. Because her husband hopes to wind up there?</TE>
<TE>   No. Because it's "inspiring" and "captures the conflicts that
arise in decision-making."</TE>
<TE>   Aides say the guv's a fan too.</TE>
<TE>   Cry in San Francisco: 'Reelect Gore'</TE>
<TE>   It's been two years since George W. Bush was declared the victor
over Al Gore in a trouble-plagued election, but Gore's supporters in
California are not letting the controversy rest.</TE>
<TE>   That was clear when Gore spoke last week in San Francisco, a
staunchly Democratic city in this strongly Democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived, a group in the fourth row took up an a cappella
chorus of "Hail to the Chief." Gore smiled then, clowning around,
threw back his arms with an expression on his face like, "What are ya
gonna do?"</TE>
<TE>   A voice in the crowd called out, "Who is that idiot and what is he
doing in Al Gore's house?" The ex-veep threw back his head with an
expression of mock shock as if to say, "Yikes!"</TE>
<TE>   After he finished, the session was thrown open for questions. One
of the audience members began, "Had you been elected president ..."
at which point someone shouted out, "He was!"</TE>
<TE>   The audience erupted into cheers and applause and many in the
crowd took up the chant, "He was! He was! He was!" Another voice
shouted, "Reelect Gore!"</TE>
<TE>   "I love this group!" Gore exclaimed. "It's great to be back in
California."</TE>
<TE>   California Party Fun Includes Air Guitar</TE>
<TE>   About 500 wistful Californians and Golden State wannabes swarmed
Washington's Capitol Hill Club last week for the annual "California
Party," hosted by Reps. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach and
David Dreier of San Dimas.</TE>
<TE>   Entertaining amid inflatable palm trees, beach balls and cacti
were Dean Torrence, half of the twosome Jan &amp; Dean; guitarist
extraordinaire Jeff "Skunk" Baxter, and members of the original Beach
Boys' backup band.</TE>
<TE>   On the menu was sushi, Mexican food and aged agave tequila.
Rohrabacher's wife, Rhonda, DJ'd for dancers downstairs while
Australian Ambassador Michael Thawley judged an air-guitar contest
upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   The winner: Rohrabacher spokesman Aaron Lewis, who gyrated to
Baxter's rendition of "Johnny B. Goode."</TE>
<TE>   Secession Leader Was Improperly Registered</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, the leader of the Hollywood secession campaign,
was improperly registered to vote for a decade at the address of a
disco he owns in Hollywood rather than at his residence, which is
required by law.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, who has given $1.4 million to the secession effort so
far and hopes to be Hollywood's first mayor, says he was told by a
private attorney, who has since died, that registering to vote at a
business office is allowable in cases where personal security is at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992 there was a series of violent robberies of Hollywood
nightclub owners, including an incident in which a neighbor of La
Pietra was taken to the club by a robber while an acquaintance held
the owner's family hostage, La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose to register at my place of employment," La Pietra said,
referring to the address for Circus Disco.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said the police urged him to change all his public
records to remove his residential address, and an attorney confirmed
that the action was legal.</TE>
<TE>   Bad advice, says Kris Heffron of the Los Angeles County
registrar-recorder's office, who said voters are required by law to
register to vote with the residential address.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't allow a registration from a business address," Heffron
said.</TE>
<TE>   If a voter has personal safety concerns, he or she should request
that the residential address be kept confidential, not register at a
business address, Heffron said. In running for Hollywood City
Council, he re-registered to vote using his residential address on
July 24.</TE>
<TE>   Heffron said it is unlikely that her office would act because La
Pietra is complying with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Glazier of the anti-secession group HALO said it was a sign
of La Pietra's arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's politics as usual. He thinks he is above the law," Glazier
said.</TE>
<TE>   Underwear Auction to Fuel Campaign</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood City Council candidate Angelyne, whose curvaceous figure
adorns billboards all over Los Angeles, has come across a potentially
effective way to finance her campaign: She plans to auction off her
underwear.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Angelyne said sales are "great." But she
wouldn't say how much the campaign had raised, responding only: "It's
sort of a gauche subject for me. I don't think it's good luck to
tabulate...."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what size an autographed Angelyne bra is, she said she had
them specially made because her waist and torso are so small and her
bosom, well, isn't.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what you should do? You should buy one and measure!" she
added.</TE>
<TE>   Points taken:</TE>
<TE>   * An Orange County judge ruled that a Huntington Beach city
attorney candidate left the most important word off her campaign
literature: for. The signs for Jennifer McGrath simply said her name
and the office she's seeking. Leaving out "for" between the two was
deceptive, ruled Superior Court Judge James P. Gray. Plenty of other
candidates use sparse campaign verbiage (Seen those Bill
Simon/governor signs?). But McGrath, a deputy city attorney who has
her boss' endorsement, didn't appeal the decision lest a higher court
agree, creating a new rule for candidates statewide.</TE>
<TE>   * Missouri may be the "show me" state, but politicians there
apparently see California as the "show me the money" state. Some
weeks after Missouri Republican senatorial candidate Jim Talent came
west for a fund-raiser, his Democratic opponent, Sen. Jean Carnahan,
will be here this week. Carnahan's reelection campaign is benefiting
from a fund-raiser to be hosted in Los Angeles by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
(D-N.Y.). The Oct. 5 event at a private home is expected to draw a
large Hollywood crowd.</TE>
<TE>   * The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has ordered the
registrar to hold mock elections to work out any kinks that might
exist in the county's touch screen voting system. The decision came
after such problems plagued Florida's Democratic primary Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   * Downtown Los Angeles developer Ira Yellin recently died, but his
name will live on in a very public way if Councilwoman Jan Perry has
her way. Perry has asked the council to name the intersection of 3rd
Street and Broadway as "Ira Yellin Square."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "It may well be that they are sensing that this isn't going to win
and they prefer not to have this loss on their resume."</TE>

<HD>Disney Picks Paris Veteran to Run Parks</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Naming of Euro Disney's James Rasulo
surprises many who expected Walt Disney World's president to take
over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner on Sunday turned to an
American in Paris, plucking a 17-year company veteran to head one of
highest-profile--and economically challenged--divisions of the
lumbering entertainment giant.</LD>
<LD>   Crossing the Atlantic to silence naysayers who question the depth
of his management ranks, Eisner moved quickly to to fill the hole
created by the departure Friday of respected theme parks president
Paul Pressler and appointed Euro Disney chief James A. Rasulo to be
president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of the 46-year-old New Yorker was a surprise as
many within and outside the company expected Walt Disney World
President Al Weiss to replace Pressler, who announced his resignation
Thursday to become chief executive of retailer Gap Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The resignation of one of Eisner's most loyal lieutenants dealt an
unexpected blow to Eisner, who has been feeling the heat from
influential board members and investors to improve the company's
earnings and stock price. Eisner also has been under pressure to
articulate a succession plan. Although Rasulo has the trust and
respect of Eisner's inner circle of top executives, he was not
recruited as a potential successor, a source close to the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Weiss spent his entire 30-year career at Walt Disney
World and heads the world's largest theme park resort, he lacked the
international experience that Disney executives singled out in their
hiring of Rasulo.</TE>
<TE>   The urbane executive, who is fluent in French and a wine
connoisseur, is known as a provocative and passionate leader who
understands the cultural nuances of foreign markets, which Disney has
come to appreciate after some hard lessons in France. Rasulo is
credited with helping transform Disneyland Paris, a onetime financial
disaster that was branded a "cultural Chernobyl" by the French elite,
into one of Europe's busiest tourist destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Executives with "global" on their resumes are in big demand as
Disney is discovering that it's indeed a small world after all.</TE>
<TE>   The company is shifting its attention overseas as domestic markets
mature. Last spring Disney opened a second theme park at Disneyland
Paris and added another theme park in Tokyo. The company also is
building a theme park in Hong Kong, set to open in 2006, and has
plans for another in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   "Jay has been instrumental in making Disneyland Resort Paris the
most popular tourist destination in Europe," Eisner said in a
statement. "His vision and extensive experience in the international
arena will be invaluable as we continue to grow the business
globally."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner is counting on Rasulo to carry out a daunting task: to help
ride the company's core division through an economic storm. Disney's
theme parks, once the company's breadwinner, have taken a beating in
the last year as the soft economy and last year's terrorist attacks
have pushed vacation bookings down 10%.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Disney's 10 theme parks, Rasulo also will oversee
the Disney Cruise Line, Disney Regional Entertainment, Walt Disney
Imagineering and Anaheim Sports Inc., which oversees the Anaheim
Angels baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Rasulo said he intends to draw on his background
in international marketing to help alleviate the falloff in foreign
travel that has hurt Disney's domestic theme parks, especially in
Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most exciting challenges of my 17 years with
Disney," Rasulo said..</TE>
<TE>   However, Rasulo downplayed expectations of a quick turnaround in
the theme park business. "I'm certainly not going to be able to turn
around a fundamental world trend."</TE>
<TE>   He said he would continue to streamline the division while
balancing the needs to invest in future projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we tilted the balance a little bit toward seeking
efficiencies and cost reductions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney parks and resorts are fixtures of the landscape, and they
certainly depend on the quality of the execution of the Disney
brand," he said. "We're not going to compromise on that."</TE>
<TE>   Rasulo said the issue of whether he might be considered a
successor to Eisner did not come up in his conversations with Eisner
this weekend, nor was that a factor in his decision, he said. After
two years as a manager at Marriott Corp., Rasulo joined Disney in
1986 and has held a range of positions in the company. He was head of
the Corporate Alliances division from 1993 to 1995 and later became
senior vice president of Disney Regional Entertainment, where he had
some misfires. He was involved in the development of the Club Disney
entertainment centers, which were shuttered in 1999 because of weak
sales.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Rasulo, who is married and has three children, moved to
Paris to become executive vice president of Euro Disney, the holding
company for Disneyland Paris, and became the resort's chairman and
CEO two years later.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure there, Rasulo oversaw a period of massive real
estate development and signed four major hotel deals with European
operators and hotel chains for the construction of 2,000 rooms on the
Euro Disney property and surrounding area. This year he opened a
second theme park in Paris, called Walt Disney Studios, where he took
great pains to avoid the cultural faux pas of his predecessors. The
new studio, for example, prominently includes heroes of French as
well as American cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always better off when you listen to the customer and
listen to what they want and continue to evolve and adapt your
product constantly," Rasulo said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a lesson his predecessors learned the hard way after
Disneyland Paris (then Euro Disney) nearly went under after its
opening in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In a rescue plan, Disney restructured the park's $3-billion debt,
reduced its equity to 39% and postponed royalty and management fees
for several years. Park officials also cut ticket prices and
introduced alcoholic drinks and a broader range of food concessions
and attractions. The strategy worked, and by 1995 Euro Disney had
recorded its first annual operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rasulo joined Euro Disney several years after the
restructuring was underway, he has played an important role in its
ongoing turnaround, analyst say.</TE>
<TE>   "Jay's a smart guy," said Steve Baker, an Orlando theme park
consultant and former Walt Disney World executive. "Disney needs a
good manager right now, somebody who knows the busuiness, who can
build a team and get the morale up. Jay can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Former Disney executive John Cooke described Rasulo's appointment
as "very good for Michael [Eisner] because of Jay's experience in
strategic planning and in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Several other Disney executives were considered candidates for
replacing Pressler, including Disney Cruise Line chief Matt Ouimett
and Disneyland President Cynthia Harriss.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great news for our company.... " Weiss said. "We're in
very good hands."</TE>
<TE>   Disney did not name a replacement for Rasulo.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Disney stock closed down 66 cents to $15.24 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>El Paso's Political Strength to Be Tested in Federal Probe</HD>
<DH>Agencies headed by Bush appointees look into possible
illegal energy trading by the company, which gave heavily to the
Republican Party</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>El Paso Corp.'s executives and employees have given more than $2
million to the Republican Party and President Bush in the last 2 1/2
years.</LD>
<LD>   Whether they will get a return on their investment remains to be
seen.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, a federal regulatory judge ruled that El Paso, North
America's biggest natural-gas pipeline owner, illegally manipulated
the California market during the energy crisis and drove up prices by
withholding supplies, costing California more than $3 billion.</LD>
<TE>   El Paso denies any wrongdoing in California and is fighting the
judge's ruling. In the meantime, the Houston-based company faces
investigations of its trading practices by the Justice Department,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission -- agencies all headed by Bush appointees.</TE>
<TE>   The company gave more than $500,000 to Bush and his party during
the former Texas governor's presidential bid in 2000, according to
documents on file with the Federal Election Commission. And since
Bush took office in January 2001, El Paso and its employees have
contributed nearly three times that amount to the Republican Party
and its candidates for the upcoming midterm elections Nov. 5. Among
the recipients has been Bush's brother in Florida and his successor
in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It is a political largess that has made El Paso, with 58,000 miles
of natural gas pipelines and 14,000 employees, America's biggest
oil-and-gas political donor in the election cycle that began in
January 2001, according to FEC documents.</TE>
<TE>   An El Paso spokesman last week said the company's political giving
is in line with its meteoric growth during the last five years but
declined to elaborate on the contributions. The company said it is
cooperating with the investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Several industry analysts also said El Paso's donations appear to
be consistent with other large energy companies, which traditionally
rank among America's top political money givers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spending Reflects Rise</TE>
<TE>   The timing of El Paso's soaring political spending parallels not
only the company's rapid rise from a stodgy Texas pipeline company
into a nationwide energy powerhouse, but also its emergence as a
target of various agency probes in Washington, California and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2001, the company has contributed $1.4 million, the
overwhelming majority of it going to the Republican National
Committee, its Senate and House fund-raising subcommittees and key
congressional candidates, according to FEC documents and company
filings with the SEC. El Paso's largest individual recipient during
the last three years was Bush himself, FEC records show.</TE>
<TE>   Those contributions came on top of large lobbying expenditures by
El Paso. During the first half of this year, the company spent
$290,000 lobbying Congress on a wide range of issues, according to
disclosures filed with the U.S. Senate. And the company reported it
spent more than $1.3 million lobbying the House and Senate last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giving Akin to Enron's</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's political spending is reminiscent of that of another
Houston-based energy company, Enron Corp., although there are key
differences.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's political committee has overwhelmingly favored
Republicans, whereas Enron gave sizable contributions to Democrats
and Republicans alike. El Paso's FEC filings also show that its
campaign contributions have increased exponentially since the Bush
administration took office, while Enron's political war chest
remained largely the same from year to year until it started to
collapse last year.</TE>
<TE>   As with Enron, most of the company's political money has flowed
through its Washington-based political action committee, or PAC,
which has given more than $400,000 to the Republican Party's national
committees this year alone. But thousands of dollars more have come
directly from William A. Wise, the company's president and chief
executive who also was the largest individual contributor to the
company's PAC.</TE>
<TE>   Wise and the company also have contributed heavily this year to
Republican candidates for state office in Florida and Texas--mainly
to the Republican gubernatorial reelection campaigns in both states.
In Florida, El Paso has given more than $60,000 to the Republican
Party, which is trying to reelect Jeb Bush. And in Texas, Wise has
given $75,000 to Gov. Rick Perry, state ethics commission records
show.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has campaigned for both his brother and his
successor in those races, which have generated near-record amounts of
corporate and special-interest money.</TE>
<TE>   But it is in Washington and Houston that El Paso's contributions
could well become a factor in the future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grand Jury Probe</TE>
<TE>   In July, the company reported to shareholders that it is among the
corporate targets of a federal grand jury investigation into possible
illegal energy-trading practices, which it has denied.</TE>
<TE>   That probe is led by the U.S. attorney's office in Houston, a
division of the Justice Department, which is headed by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft. El Paso donated $2,000 to Ashcroft's 2000 Senate
reelection campaign in Missouri, which he lost. Bush subsequently
named him America's law-enforcement chief.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is independently investigating El Paso's energy trading
practices, as well as transactions with affiliated companies that
industry analysts have said appear to be similar to those of Enron's.
The SEC is headed by a Bush appointee, Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating El
Paso's natural-gas trading and transporting practices in California
during the state's energy crisis that could become the most dramatic
backdrop for the company's political spending.</TE>
<TE>   The quasi-independent commission, part of the Energy Department,
has two Republican and two Democratic commissioners. It is headed by
a Republican Bush appointee, Texas energy lawyer Patrick Henry Wood
III.</TE>
<TE>   As Texas governor, Bush appointed Wood to head the state's Public
Utility Commission. And now, as FERC chairman, Wood has broad powers
in determining how--or whether--El Paso should be punished for its
business practices in California.</TE>
<TE>   If El Paso is looking for favors from the Bush appointee, though,
the company has yet to see them. In fact, the 40-year-old Wood took
office last year pledging to put an end to the California energy
crisis and thoroughly investigate its causes. He told his staff that
during his tenure FERC would be "the cop on the beat" policing the
energy industry. And the commission has appeared dogged in its
pursuit of El Paso in the California natural-gas case.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the commission's administrative law judge, Curtis L.
Wagner Jr., stunned the company and sent its stock plummeting when he
ruled that El Paso had illegally manipulated the California market by
deliberately withholding an average of 345 million cubic feet of gas
a day from California customers, who then were forced to pay inflated
prices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California Strategy</TE>
<TE>   Judge Wagner's ruling was based partly on extensive testimony last
year from the company's top executives, including Wise, that traced
El Paso's energy policies in California to a Valentine's Day meeting
in 2000 in Texas, where Wise signed off on a strategy that allegedly
cost California more than $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Wise blasted Wagner's decision. He asserted that it
was "inappropriate and without precedent to second-guess a pipeline's
day-to-day operations." The El Paso chief added: "We are confident in
the strength of our position and believe that we will ultimately
obtain a favorable ruling."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's stock Friday closed at $8 on the New York Stock Exchange
after hitting a 52-week low of $5.30 Tuesday after Wagner's ruling.
The stock has fallen 82% this year.</TE>

<HD>Did Enron Trading Ploys Cross Line?</HD>
<DH>Probe: A federal grand jury tries to determine whether the
company violated any laws by manipulating markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. traders were skilled at making money by exploiting
weaknesses in California's energy markets. But did they cross the
line and do anything illegal?</LD>
<LD>   That's the question a newly impaneled federal grand jury in San
Francisco is weighing, and experts are divided over the issue. Where
some see fraud and additional high crimes, others see traders simply
doing their jobs by playing one market off another or by outsmarting
badly designed market rules.</LD>
<LD>   Grand juries operate in secret and their thinking becomes public
only if indictments are handed up.</LD>
<TE>   But a trail of subpoenas and interviews indicates that the federal
grand jury, aided by the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI, is
examining trading ploys used to create electron traffic jams on
California's high-voltage transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the top electricity traders who once worked for Enron have
been contacted by investigators and are attempting to work out
agreements to cooperate with the many interlocking inquiries into
market manipulation in California and other Western states.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined comment, but
sources familiar with the grand jury investigation said they believe
it is being steered by Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick D. Robbins in San
Francisco, who was named chief of the office's securities-fraud
section a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins has subpoenaed trading records from the California
Independent System Operator, which runs the transmission grid for
most of the state. The subpoena, the contents of which were outlined
in a Cal-ISO notice to market participants, seeks electricity
forecasts filed by power sellers with the grid operator; the records
of actual electricity flows; and any payments made to traders under a
complex system to relieve congestion on the transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of federal and state laws that traders may
well have violated and that any grand jury is going to take a very
close look at," said Robert Berliner, a Washington energy lawyer who
represents Los Angeles County before state and federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that these people were doing things they shouldn't
have done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorful Nicknames</TE>
<TE>   Berliner pointed, for instance, to evidence produced recently by
federal energy regulators that Enron may have illegally traded with
its own subsidiary Portland General Electric Co. to evade
California's price caps on electricity generated within the state.</TE>
<TE>   These trading ploys took on colorful nicknames such as Fat Boy,
Death Star and Get Shorty. The monikers, one Enron lawyer noted in a
December 2000 memo, were dreamed up to aid communication with energy
traders at other companies.</TE>
<TE>   But many market experts cast doubt on whether the trading
practices by Enron and other companies crossed the blurry line into
criminal territory.</TE>
<TE>   Some, such as the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in
Washington, contend that a few of the byzantine trading strategies
actually benefited California consumers by bringing extra power into
the state--albeit on a last-minute basis at higher cost.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Enron's trading strategies are "pure arbitrage," said Gary
Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an
electricity industry group. Arbitrage is the practice of profiting
from price differences by buying low in one market and selling high
in another.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly tough to prove, according to Ackerman, will be that
Enron or any other traders purposely defrauded California consumers.
Submitting inaccurate forecasts to California market operators of
power sales or power purchases for the next day does not constitute
fraud, he said, because Cal-ISO has never defined what it considers
to be an acceptable scheduling error.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an amazingly high standard to get a conviction on something
like this," Ackerman said. "They're going to have to ... prove that"
certain practices "weren't allowed--and also demonstrate intent."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the subpoena received by Cal-ISO sheds some light on
which way the federal investigation is headed: It demands records
from Dec. 1, 2000, through March 1, 2001, some of the darkest days of
California's energy crisis. In addition, the subpoena seeks documents
for May 25, 1999, a day when Enron has admitted it scheduled nearly
2,900 megawatts over a transmission line capable of carrying only 15
megawatts.</TE>
<TE>   The power, of course, never materialized, resulting in higher
prices and a minor power shortage. That event is known in energy
circles as "the Silver Peak incident"--named for the transmission
line involved--and is widely viewed as one of Enron's earliest
attempts to profit by causing congestion on power lines.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was fined $25,000 by California authorities, and the head of
its trading division at the time, Lawrence "Greg" Whalley, agreed
never to "substantially repeat" such maneuvers. Whalley went on to
become Enron's president, briefly filling the post after Jeffrey K.
Skilling resigned from the jobs of chief executive and president in
August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, investigators have contacted some of the top
traders who bought and sold electricity at Enron's around-the-clock
power-trading business in Portland, Ore., according to sources
familiar with the inquiry. These traders, though, have not yet been
called before the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top Traders Contacted</TE>
<TE>   Included are Tim Belden, who ran the Portland operation and is
believed to have developed many of the questionable trading ploys,
and John Forney, a key Belden lieutenant, who named one of the
schemes after himself. It was called Forney's Perpetual Loop and was
another variation on Enron's so-called congestion games.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Belden and his lawyers were unsuccessful.
Forney's attorney declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Enron sold its energy-trading operation to the UBS Warburg
investment banking firm shortly after it filed for bankruptcy
protection last December.</TE>
<TE>   Forney, who now works as a trader for AEP Corp. in Columbus, Ohio,
said in a deposition last month that he is attempting to cooperate
with several federal and state investigations. The deposition was
taken in a civil complaint against several power sellers filed with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Belden, employed by the energy-trading arm of UBS Warburg in
Houston, invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination
during an August deposition related to the same FERC complaint.</TE>
<TE>   But a letter sent to one of Belden's lawyers, a copy of which was
obtained by The Times, noted Belden's apparent attempt to work out a
deal with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "Given time, Mr. Belden might make arrangements with various
federal and state entities that would permit him to respond to
questions posed during a deposition," said the letter from Philip L.
Chabot Jr., a lawyer representing the city of Tacoma, Wash., which is
among those seeking electricity refunds in the FERC case.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Callous Disregard'</TE>
<TE>   FERC itself hasn't minced words regarding Enron's conduct. In an
interim report issued last month, the agency maintained that Enron
may have been trying to manipulate prices using trading ploys that
involved outright deception.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron's corporate culture, which permeated all of its affiliated
companies... fostered a callous disregard for the American energy
customer," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In the ploy dubbed Fat Boy, internal Enron documents show, the
company submitted an exaggerated estimate of the power its customers
would need the next day so it could reap extra payments when the
state demanded more power to the grid.</TE>
<TE>   In the Death Star maneuver, Enron would schedule phantom
electricity running in the opposite direction to relieve congestion
on the grid but would never supply the power. Enron then would be
paid without actually doing anything.</TE>
<TE>   Enron assistant general counsel Richard Sanders testified before
Congress that he ordered a halt to such questionable trading
practices shortly after he learned of them in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Haunting Words</TE>
<TE>   If Enron or any of its employees are convicted in the
market-manipulation case, words from the company's own attorneys may
come back to haunt them.</TE>
<TE>   An eight-page memo, written in October 2000 by outside lawyers for
Enron, details legal theories that might be used against the
Houston-based company to bring criminal or civil charges such as wire
fraud, racketeering, price fixing and unfair competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it is imperative that Enron understands in detail what
evidence exists with respect to its conduct in the California
electricity market as soon as possible," said the previously reported
memo, written by lawyers Gary Fergus and Peter Meringolo, who then
worked for Brobeck, Phelger &amp; Harrison in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Both have since left that firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the legal theories ... are dependent upon the intent of
the participants and whether there were any redeeming purposes for
the conduct in question," the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the passage of time it may be difficult for Enron to
establish the state of mind at the time of the conduct."</TE>
<TE>   The memo centered on what it characterized as "conduct in the
market that is deemed to be deceptive, fraudulent or have improperly
influenced the price of electricity."</TE>
<TE>   One of the specific areas addressed in Brobeck Phelger's research
was antitrust.</TE>
<TE>   "If the attorney general were able to prove that Enron traders in
their discussion with other traders were in some fashion signaling
steps that Enron was taking in response to market conditions," the
memo said, "that might give rise to a price-fixing allegation,
especially if the steps taken were of 'no apparent redeeming value.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials have characterized the Brobeck Phelger memo as a
broad exploration of legal theories--not a commentary on specific
Enron actions.</TE>

<HD>October May Bring Bear Market's End</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The month historically has been a turning
point. But stocks may have to go lower before they can rebound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>October will get a chance to live up to its historical reputation as
a "bear killer" on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   But stock prices, reeling for the last five weeks, may have to go
lower before they go higher, many analysts warn.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index
hit four- and six-year lows early last week, respectively, before
bouncing at midweek, then selling off sharply again on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   A rising tide of corporate earnings warnings and growing fears
about a war with Iraq have weighed heavily on stocks this month, and
October might not see much improvement early on, as third-quarter
profit reports arrive and war concerns remain, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   But optimists are comforted by October's historical role as a
month in which major bear markets have finally expired.</TE>
<TE>   Steep market slides in 1990 and 1998 ended in October, for
example. That also was true of several other declines since World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   The worst of the selling in the 1987 market crash occurred over
several days in October of that year, though some key indexes did not
reach their final lows until December.</TE>
<TE>   The current bear market, at 30 months old the longest in a
generation, is proving hard to slay. The market's three main
gauges--the Dow, the Nasdaq composite and the Standard &amp; Poor's
500--last week posted their fifth straight weekly declines, a streak
not seen since the five weeks ended June 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow lost 3.6% for the week to end Friday at 7,701.45. The
Nasdaq index fell 1.8% for the week to 1,199.16 and the S&amp;P 500 lost
2.1% to 827.37.</TE>
<TE>   At present levels, September's trading, which finishes today,
would mark the worst monthly decline this year for major indexes. The
S&amp;P 500 is down 9.7% so far this month and down 28% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow is down 23.2% for the year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is
down 38.5%.</TE>
<TE>   The month's performance is true to September's historical form: On
average, it has been the year's worst month for stocks since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, whose confidence was shaken by the mid-summer market
plunge blamed at least in part on the rash of corporate financial
scandals, lately have been spooked by a steady stream of profit
warnings from big-name companies.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings suggest that the economic recovery is not translating
well to many firms' bottom lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of negative news with the earnings
preannouncements. The question now is whether the preannouncements
are accurate or not," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at
brokerage Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week alone, companies including tobacco and food giant
Philip Morris, drug firm Wyeth, Delta Air Lines and
telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks lowered their
profit outlooks.</TE>
<TE>   Investor sentiment also has been hit by deepening fears of war
with Iraq. The Federal Reserve last Tuesday cited "geopolitical
risks," such as war, as a factor threatening the economy. The Fed
kept its key short-term interest rate steady at a 40-year low of
1.75% but signaled that it stands ready to reduce rates further if
warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not a set of numbers and statistics, it's made of
people like you and me," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist
at brokerage Edward Jones in St. Louis. "People act on how they feel.
And by and large, investors feel pretty anxious."</TE>
<TE>   Given the dimming outlook for corporate profits and the potential
for a war with Iraq, any new shock in October could hit stocks hard,
experts warn. But then, "perhaps that's what will give us a bottom in
the market," Dickson said.</TE>

<HD>Water as Business Taps Into Fears</HD>
<DH>Environment: Concern over possession of a natural resource
as a commodity and the possibility of firms' taking treatment
shortcuts hamper deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The apparent breakdown of a deal between private Cadiz Inc. and the
public Metropolitan Water District to build a $150-million water
storage facility in the Mojave Desert raises an issue that may become
more relevant to the state's water future: What role is there for
private enterprise in supplying water to the California public?</LD>
<LD>   The question evokes fears of the kind of corporate profiteering
and market manipulation alleged in the wake of energy deregulation in
the state. If anything, privatizing water may be an even more
sensitive issue, given its stature as a natural resource essential
for physical, as well as economic, health.</LD>
<LD>   In part because of the dangers of cutting corners on water
treatment and system maintenance, public-interest advocates have long
been wary of efforts to turn over public water supplies or systems to
private enterprise.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the things we learned in the energy deregulation debacle
is not to give private companies a free hand in the management of a
natural resource," said Peter H. Gleick, president of Oakland-based
Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and
Security and coauthor of a study critical of global water
privatization. "Water is too important to be left solely in private
hands."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many private entities are active in the water trade
throughout the state--and some are planning to become more deeply
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are owners of water rights in the river-rich north who
deliver supplies to the parched south. Others are small-scale farmers
who agree to fallow acreage during droughts in order to divert
irrigation water to cities and suburbs. And some view the state's
geographic imbalance of supply and demand as a long-term commercial
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, for example, a real estate
venture between two life insurance companies--Zurich Financial
Services and Kemper Insurance Cos.--is proposing to build reservoirs
on two marshy islands to hold surplus floodwater for release during
dry periods. Layne Christensen Co., a Mission Woods, Kan.-based
mineral, energy and water company, is expanding water storage
facilities in Kern County that already are under contract to provide
dry-year supply to the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   But many other private entities have been lured by visions of
riches to be made in the business of moving around water supplies
within the state--only to be crushed in a bureaucratic and political
wringer.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies trying to move water across the delta have not
been successful because it's complicated," said Jerry Johns, water
transfer chief for the California Resources Agency. "It requires a
lot of overhead. The physical issues are hard. Water rights are
complicated. If your business plan is moving water from north to
south, you should be prepared to spend a lot of time working out how
that's done."</TE>
<TE>   As a commodity, water is protected by a shield of regulation,
tradition and emotion that can turn even the determination of who
owns the right to use water under what conditions into a forbiddingly
complex task. These complexities have blindsided some of the
country's most sophisticated private investors, leading to some
spectacular missteps in recent California history.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the wealthy Bass brothers of Texas bought up
30,000 acres of farmland in the Imperial Valley, hoping to profit
from the spread between the $12.50-per-acre-foot price they paid for
Colorado River water as farmers and the $250 that San Diego would pay
them to divert it as urban supply. Too late, the Bass family
discovered that the water rights did not belong to them as landowners
but in trust to the Imperial Irrigation District, which opposed the
Bass sale. (The Bass family still made a profit in the Imperial
Valley. Meanwhile, the district moved to strike its own deal--still
under negotiation--with San Diego.)</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago Azurix, a water-trading subsidiary of Enron Corp.,
paid $31 million for a 13,000-acre ranch in Madera County, in the
heart of the San Joaquin Valley farming region. The idea was to allow
customers to store as much as 400,000 acre-feet of water in an
aquifer under the ranch, extracting it in dry periods as needed.
Local farmers viewed the proposal as a pretext for stealing their
natural water supply. (An acre-foot is about 325,000 gallons--enough
water to meet the needs of two average households for a year.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Azurix project was perceived as a threat, as a means of
taking our water and sending it away to the highest bidder," recalled
Kole Upton, a pistachio and almond farmer who headed a local water
users' group opposed to the project. The Madera County Board of
Supervisors eventually passed an ordinance requiring their consent to
any water transfers out of the district. Azurix later disintegrated
in the Enron bankruptcy. A unit of Layne Christensen has since taken
over the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement to treat water as a commodity is always resented in
agricultural communities," Upton said, "because we farmers can't
afford to pay what the MWD can."</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz also ran afoul of bureaucratic obstacles and changing
hydrological conditions in its campaign to build a $150-million
facility to store surplus Colorado River water under company-owned
land in the Mojave Desert in partnership with the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   The company's plan to extract as much as 1.5 million acre-feet of
water from a natural aquifer provoked environmentalists, who
contended that extraction on that scale would threaten the desert
ecosystem. At the same time, drought on the Colorado made the
availability of water to fill the storage site doubtful. And the high
profile of Cadiz Chairman and Chief Executive Keith Brackpool, a
confidant of Gov. Gray Davis, placed the entire project under the
political spotlight. Last week, MWD officials said they would advise
the district board to defer the project indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters of large-scale water deals know that public passions and
political scrutiny come with the territory.</TE>
<TE>   "Opposition to water transfers is extraordinarily emotional, and
it evolves into a theological issue," said Ric Davidge, head of World
Water, an Alaska company proposing to tap two Northern California
rivers and ship the water to Southern California in enormous floating
plastic bags. "Interest groups that take exception to 'privatizing'
water as a commodity are misinformed. Water has been a commodity
since water and money existed. What's new is the emergence of public
entities in control of it as a resource and a commodity."</TE>
<TE>   Some would-be marketers of water say those public agencies exploit
local resentments to maintain their political stranglehold on the
state's most valuable resource.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who wish to maintain control of water prey on fears of
transfers," said Michael P. George, chairman and chief executive of
Point Richmond, Calif.-based Western Water Co., which has been trying
for years to find a way to profitably sell to the south some 200,000
acre-feet of Northern California water to which it holds historical
rights. George says he has faced relentless resistance from public
water agencies reluctant to give up what he characterizes as
subsidized monopolies.</TE>
<TE>   "Our efforts to organize efficient, cost-effective transfers have
been stymied by the fact that there is no process by which you can
gain approval for a transfer," he said. "There are myriad processes
by which you can be told no, asked for more information or asked to
provide money for studies, but no way you can get to a yes."</TE>
<TE>   George has been battling the MWD over differing interpretations of
the "fair compensation" that state law says he must pay the district
for sending water south via its pipelines and aqueducts. He argues
that because the transmission capacity he would use would be
otherwise idle, the MWD should charge him only a nominal rate. The
MWD, for its part, argues that Western Water should pay the same
transmission rate of $154 per acre-foot charged to all its other
customers, which include member water agencies. With that fee added
to its own costs, Western Water would be hard-pressed to turn a
profit.</TE>
<TE>   MWD officials say that's as it should be, in part because the
district has an obligation to provide guaranteed supply to the 17
million residents within its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD's traditional sources of water, such as the Colorado River
system, are relatively cheap, largely because the MWD and its member
districts helped finance the construction of Hoover Dam more than 70
years ago. They would be reluctant to cede the financial benefits of
their claim to the cheap water by selling their capacity to Western
Water at a preferred rate, says MWD Chief Executive Ronald R.
Gastelum.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Gastelum acknowledges, the water scene will change. As
demand in Southern California grows, the MWD will be forced to turn
to more costly supplies--desalinated water, for example, or supplies
purchased on the spot market. Such conditions, which are imminent,
will give independent suppliers such as Western Water a window to
undercut the huge district's embedded costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they can compete with us by trying to meet our
existing demand," Gastelum said. "But as we develop new supplies,
they will be able to compete."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, however, the market's outside suppliers will continue
to face daunting obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael George's business plan is premised on an economic theory
that doesn't account for the political reality that no one wants to
let him have a cheap ride for his private interest," Gastelum said.</TE>

<HD>AMD Taking Gamble With 64-Bit Processor</HD>
<DH>Technology: Big businesses have shown a need for such
powerful chips, but consumer demand may be weaker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For much of its 33-year history, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
prospered by making cheaper, sometimes faster versions of
microprocessors pioneered by Intel Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Now, AMD is planning its biggest launch ever--and it's no Intel
knockoff. The new processors share some of the same elements found in
powerful servers but will also target personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   It's a big financial and technological gamble for the world's No.
2 microprocessor maker.</LD>
<TE>   So far, AMD has failed to make much headway in the server market
and has been struggling more than usual lately getting into personal
computers because of stiff competition and weak demand.</TE>
<TE>   If it succeeds with the new chips, developed not coincidentally
under the code name "Hammer," AMD could become the microprocessor
industry's powerhouse, setting the pace for computing for years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   But if AMD stumbles, Hammer will join a growing list of powerful
chips nobody wants.</TE>
<TE>   "We've established something that still needs to prove itself by
getting into the market and succeeding," said Fred Weber, chief
technology officer of AMD's Computation Products Group.</TE>
<TE>   An Athlon-branded desktop version is scheduled for release early
next year, several months late because of production delays. Chips
for servers, branded Opteron, will follow later in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer chips process data in 64-bit chunks rather than 32-bit
chunks, as is the case with today's Intel Pentium or AMD Athlon
chips. Currently, only high-end servers and workstations use 64-bit
processors.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in the number of bits is similar to widening a
freeway, allowing a higher volume of data traffic inside the
processor and to memory. Still, a computer's operating system and
other programs must be optimized to take advantage of a 64-bit
processor.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike today's 64-bit chips, the Hammer chips speak the same
language--the x86 instruction set--as today's 32-bit chips as well as
yesterday's 16-bit and 8-bit chips.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to be able to run their existing code," Weber said.
"There are a lot of applications that don't need to move to 64 bits
ever."</TE>
<TE>   Intel's 64-bit offering, Itanium, abandoned the x86 instruction
set in favor of Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing. Intel says
it was designed for high-end computing needs. Though Itanium can run
32-bit code, it loses performance.</TE>
<TE>   AMD maintains that its Hammer technology will give users more
options, particularly businesses that want to run 64-bit programs
alongside existing 32-bit software without side effects.</TE>
<TE>   But although big businesses have shown a need for such powerful
chips with resource-intensive simulation and database programs, it's
not so clear that ordinary consumers need them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the types of work people do, if you look at the
data sizes in which they operate, 32 bits is where the desktop's at,"
said Louis Burns, general manager of Intel's Desktop Platform Group.</TE>
<TE>   AMD concedes as much.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it took a decade to switch from 16-bit to 32-bit
computing. By the end, the PC world moved from text-only interfaces
of MS-DOS to the graphics of Windows 95.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Hammer won't have a native, 64-bit Windows operating
system. Until Microsoft Corp. develops one, as promised, users will
have to run the 32-bit version.</TE>
<TE>   AMD maintains that the Hammer chips will still have a performance
advantage, even running 32-bit code, because they incorporate some
functions typically performed by chips outside the processor. The
result is a 10% to 15% improvement in speed over comparable 32-bit
processors, said John Crank, AMD's senior branding manager.</TE>
<TE>   AMD has yet to release key details, including clock speeds and
their true performance compared with existing 32-bit chips. Nor has
it released exact pricing, though it is expected to be in line with
Intel's top chips.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic AMD strategy of trying to find the transition
point between product introductions for Intel ... and introduce
products that fit right into those holes," said Eric Ross, an analyst
at Investec Inc.</TE>

<LD>China Airlines Co., Taiwan's biggest carrier, will order as many as
10 Boeing Co. 747 jetliners and up to 12 Airbus A330 aircraft, the
Asian Wall Street Journal reported.</LD>
<LD>   China Airlines will pay more than $4 billion for the aircraft, the
paper reported, without citing anyone. The report didn't give
delivery dates. Boeing couldn't confirm whether an agreement has been
reached.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been having discussions for quite a few months," said
Boeing spokesman Mark Hooper in Hong Kong, adding that 747s were
included in the talks. Airbus officials weren't immediately available
for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The orders may make it easier for Boeing, Southern California's
largest private employer, to meet its delivery target of 300 planes
in 2003. Losses at airlines worldwide may reach $18 billion in 2002
on lower travel demand and higher insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   Japan Airlines Co., which will merge with Japan Air System Co. on
Wednesday, said last week it would buy two 747-400 freighters,
changing an earlier order for five 777-200 planes to two 777-200s and
three larger 777-300s.</TE>
<TE>   China Airlines, about 71% owned by a state aviation foundation,
said in June it would order new aircraft in the second half of this
year to modernize its fleet, replacing aging Airbus A300-600Rs.</TE>
<TE>   China Airlines has had five fatal crashes in the last 11 years.
The most recent was in May, when a 747-200 plane broke up in flight,
killing all 225 people on board.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares fell 5.1% to $34.70 on the New York Stock Exchange
on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Countrywide Buys Thousand Oaks Office Building</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The rapidly growing mortgage firm pays Adler
Realty $29 million for the property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the mortgage-lending boom continues at a rapid pace, industry
giant Countrywide Home Loans continues to acquire office space near
its Calabasas headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   The latest transaction is its $29-million purchase of a Thousand
Oaks office building built in 1983 to be the headquarters of Exxon
Corp.'s domestic oil and gas unit. The new building is about 15 miles
west of Countrywide's Calabasas campus.</LD>
<LD>   The Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. subsidiary bought the
157,000-square-foot building known as Thousand Oaks Corporate Centre
from Adler Realty Investments of Woodland Hills. Adler bought the
property on West Hillcrest Drive in late 2000 for $24.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   The five-story building near the Oaks and Janss Marketplace
shopping centers sits on a 12.5-acre site that can accommodate
additional development.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide Executive Vice President Patrick Benton said company
operations including Countrywide Bank will take over offices as the
leases of existing tenants expire--or sooner if certain tenants agree
to vacate.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants include Homestore Inc., Digital Island and the
headquarters of the Baja Fresh restaurant chain.</TE>
<TE>   The building's quality and proximity to Countrywide's headquarters
and other nearby operations were strong attractions for a company
growing at an "exorbitant" pace, Benton said. Travers Realty
negotiated the transaction on behalf of Countrywide.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide purchased two former Litton Industries office
buildings totaling 160,500 square feet in nearby Agoura Hills in July
at an estimated price of about $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to occupy a portion of that complex by the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide now occupies three office buildings in the Calabasas
area and owns and leases additional office space in Simi Valley,
Moorpark and West Hills. The company grew from 17,300 employees to
nearly 24,000 employees in a 12-month period ending in August.</TE>
<TE>   With mortgage rates approaching record lows, Countrywide's
mortgage-loan "pipeline" reached a record $42.1 billion in August--
35% higher than the July level and 121% higher than in August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide stock closed down $1.03 Friday at $47.41 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Patent Holder Suing EBay</HD>
<DH>Courts: Tom Woolston contends he holds rights to online
auctioning. The company says the initial application was revised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB PORTERFIELD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a typically sultry summer afternoon in the nation's capital, EBay
Inc. attorney Andrew Kumamoto walked into a conference room to talk
patents with a Virginia inventor.</LD>
<LD>   That discussion, held to gauge EBay's interest in acquiring
patents held by Tom Woolston and his company, MercExchange, has led
to a David-and-Goliath confrontation that some consider nothing more
than an attempt to pick EBay's pocket.</LD>
<LD>   But if Woolston wins in court, the inventor just might change how
the online auctioneer does business.</LD>
<TE>   Woolston believes that the patents cover nearly every aspect of
EBay's operations, including the very procedure millions of people
use to buy and sell everything from stuffed bears to aircraft. The
technology has quickly made EBay, on paper at least, one of the
Internet's great success stories.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based EBay believes that Woolston revised his initial
claim after seeing EBay's success, so that his patent would cover
what EBay was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Woolston denies any such manipulation. An electrical engineer with
years of experience in the military and the CIA, he says he came up
with his online auction concept while a law student, long before
Pierre Omidyar, EBay's founder, began seriously thinking about
auctions and the online community.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there with the technical know-how and ability to see it
first," he said bluntly. "We won't be bullied."</TE>
<TE>   The legal drama may ultimately play out before a federal jury in
Virginia, but the pretrial script already includes bitter arguments
over intellectual property law, with millions of dollars at risk for
EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of online commerce has spawned dozens of lawsuits over
intellectual property. One highly publicized case involved online
bookseller Amazon.com, which was granted a patent for the process
that allows customers to complete purchases with a single mouse
click.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon sued, forcing competitor Barnesandnoble.com to add a second
step--a confirmation page requiring a second click to complete online
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Woolston and Kumamoto discussed his patents' value that afternoon
in June 2000. What EBay thought they were worth is unknown, and the
dollar amounts they debated have not been revealed, but Woolston says
EBay suggested a price in the $100-million range.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of selling the patents, Woolston says, had commenced several
weeks earlier, when he was approached by EBay's Washington lobbyist,
who inquired about obtaining them.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew exactly what those patents were," said Woolston, who
says he gave EBay a detailed description of his invention during the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   EBay officials recall the events differently.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were any dollar figures mentioned they didn't come from
us," said Jay Monahan, EBay's associate general counsel. He says
Woolston's patents weren't valid, so there was nothing to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said Woolston approached EBay first, offering his patents
as a potential legal weapon against Bidders Edge, a company EBay
alleged was trespassing into EBay's database.</TE>
<TE>   "There definitely were some discussions," Monahan said, "but any
suggestion we approached him and offered to buy his patents,
particularly the auction patent, is not true."</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said EBay officials discussed Woolston's offer in detail
and ultimately told him they weren't interested.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the meeting, Woolston said, there were a few
letters and telephone calls. Then silence.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Woolston's company sued EBay and two subsidiaries,
alleging willful patent infringement. He seeks royalties, treble
damages and a permanent injunction. The trial, scheduled to begin
Nov. 12, has been postponed to an unspecified date.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the dispute is one of three patents issued to
Woolston in 2000 and 2001 that were spawned from an original, or
"parent," application he filed in April 1995.</TE>
<TE>   That filing was several months before Omidyar launched the auction
site using a combination of his own programming and software obtained
for free over the Internet. Omidyar envisioned a "perfect
marketplace" where fair and proper prices would be established for
anything people wanted to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the need to have publicized the idea before anyone
else, all patent applications must have two critical elements:
"specifications"--a summary of what the invention is supposed to
do--and "claims"--detailed descriptions of how the invention works.</TE>
<TE>   Where multiple patents result from an original application, the
law allows claims to be revised while the approval process is
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Woolston's key patent, the last of the three, was issued March 13,
2001, covering a complex process for conducting computerized Internet
auctions, virtually identical to that used by EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The fight between Woolston and EBay, however, centers on whether
Woolston's patent claims were adequately described in the original
application or were revised in subsequent filings.</TE>
<TE>   EBay concedes the descriptions in all three patents are identical
but argues that the inventor's claims in the March 2001 patent were
not contained in the original application but were added later
through revisions. This is a critical distinction because an inventor
who has the idea first has the strongest patent claim.</TE>
<TE>   If Woolston had the idea first, EBay says, the claims contained in
the 2001 patent should have been disclosed publicly in the original
1995 application. EBay said it first became aware of the patent when
it was approached by Woolston.</TE>
<TE>   The legal skirmishing has been intense. Attempts by EBay to move
the case to California were denied, and Woolston has so far fended
off EBay's requests to have the case dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   There are two remaining EBay motions to dismiss the case. One
challenges Woolston's patent by arguing that a similar auction
process was described in detail by Choy Heng-Wah of Digital Equipment
Corp. in a stamp-collecting newsgroup in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   EBay is in this fight to win, Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a risk in any trial in any jurisdiction, and some
companies might settle because of the cost and the risk, but we
believe our defenses are very strong," Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   For EBay, the potential cost of defeat is enormous, both in terms
of money and its ability to remain the world's No. 1 online auction
house.</TE>
<TE>   EBay acknowledges this, telling stockholders in its 2001 annual
report and subsequent regulatory filings that losing could cost
dearly and "materially harm our business."</TE>
<TE>   Woolston says he just wants "reasonable" royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that amount turns out to be, it could be substantial for
EBay and could put a dent in earnings that have so far made Wall
Street drool.</TE>
<TE>   For the six months ended June 30, EBay earned $101.8 million on
revenue of $511.3 million, more than the $90.4 million it made in all
of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   David Pressman, a San Francisco lawyer and co-author of "Patent It
Yourself," a laymen's guide to patent law published by Nolo Press in
nearby Berkeley, said it's hard to establish royalties and licensing
fees in intellectual property cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen rates from 5% to 20%," he said. "It's whatever you can
get."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts don't seem to be taking the case very seriously. Several
said they hadn't even been following the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a significant issue," said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst
with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "In my discussions with the company,
it hasn't come up as a major factor."</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're going to settle. I don't think EBay will let this
go to court," said Rosalinda Baldwin, chief executive of the Auction
Guild, a New York company that monitors the online auction industry
and has been an EBay critic.</TE>
<TE>   "Reading over the patents Tom has, there might be some argument in
EBay's favor, but he's definitely covered everything EBay is doing,"
she said. "I think he might win. Who knows what the courts will do."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp;
Sciences is expected today to name Neil Portnow as the group's
president.</LD>
<LD>   Portnow, an executive with Jive Records, was one of five finalists
under review by the board, which voted Sunday, sources said. The
Santa Monica-based academy is in charge of the Grammy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   He would replace longtime Grammy chief C. Michael Greene, who
stepped down in April after an ugly in-house battle and accusations
of sexual harassment.</LD>
<TE>   Greene quit at an emergency meeting of Grammy trustees in which a
report was presented on those accusations, although the academy then
released a statement saying an internal investigation had cleared
Greene of any misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Greene had vast authority and served both as chairman and
president of the organization. But under revamped guidelines, the new
president will report to the board and have reduced authority.</TE>
<TE>   Portnow is senior vice president of West Coast operations for
Zomba Group, which is the home of Jive Records.</TE>

<HD>Tech Recovery Slow in Coming, Intel CEO Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DUBAI</DL>
<LD>The information technology industry is experiencing the deepest
recession in three decades because the world's developed economies
slowed at the same time, said Craig Barrett, chief executive of Intel
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "It's probably the most dramatic recession I've seen for the last
30 years for the high-technology industry" as the economies of the
U.S., Japan and Europe have slowed simultaneously, Barrett said at a
news conference in Dubai. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel is the
world's largest maker of computer chips.</LD>
<LD>   Too much earlier investment in the telecommunications industry and
bankruptcies among dot-com companies also are contributing to what
will be the longest-lasting recession since 1974, Barrett said.</LD>
<TE>   Intel chopped $200 million off the top of its earlier
third-quarter sales forecast Sept. 5 as demand for microprocessors
declined. Sales will be $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, President Paul
Otellini said. Intel in July predicted sales of $6.3 billion to $6.9
billion. The company had sales of $6.55 billion in the year-ago
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are unlikely to climb until well after economic growth in
developed countries accelerates, Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect us to be at the tail end of the recovery when it
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Only when consumer demand boosts company profits will those firms
then invest in more high-technology products, Barrett said.</TE>

<HD>Giant IPO Suit Hinges on Defense Motion</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge's decision on how the case proceeds is
expected to have a major effect during settlement negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAKE KEAVENY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A mountainous lawsuit claiming that Wall Street brokerages and their
corporate clients rigged hundreds of initial public stock offerings
has hardly begun, but the most important arguments may have already
been made.</LD>
<LD>   Friday was the deadline for the final documents in a motion to
throw the case out. The motion was made by defendants including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston and once-hot
companies including now-defunct EToys Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The motion is a standard defense tool, but lawyers on both sides
say that expanding government investigations into IPO practices, the
breadth of litigants and the sheer size of a potential settlement
make this ruling particularly critical.</LD>
<TE>   Barring an outright dismissal, U.S. District Judge Shira
Scheindlin has an array of options in deciding how the case proceeds.
Because both sides are expected to be more interested in settling
than going to trial, the judge's decision will have a major effect on
each side's position of strength during settlement negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is especially important," said Melvyn Weiss, managing
partner at Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach and co-chair of
the executive committee representing plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will tell "not only which parties are in the case but
which claims are viable, and that will give lawyers more ability to
guard their clients in settlement talks," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling itself could take months because it requires reviewing
all 308 IPOs implicated--many of which are technology companies--and
addressing issues for dismissal that are common to each.</TE>
<TE>   But Scheindlin, who presides in the Southern District of New York,
has a reputation for setting an aggressive schedule. She refused
requests from both sides to extend the period for the last motion.</TE>
<TE>   The final response by the issuers in the dismissal process was due
Friday, but the judge is believed to have been reviewing the
documents since initial motions were presented July 3.</TE>
<TE>   The motion and opposing responses also have been pored over by a
platinum list of litigation firms. Securities lawyers representing 55
underwriting investment banks and the 308 issuer companies have tried
to punch holes in the range of complaints with six motions to
dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, led by class-action attorneys, allege that there was
industrywide misconduct to artificially boost demand and the price of
IPO shares during the bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Among the complaints: that brokerage analysts manipulated the
market with overly optimistic research; that investment banks charged
buyers excessive commissions in exchange for access to IPO shares;
and that investors who received IPOs were required to buy shares in
the after-market in a practice known as "tie-ins."</TE>
<TE>   A key defense argument is that allegations have been made with too
broad a brush, and do not provide the detailed support required to
bring claims of fraud. In the tie-in arguments, for instance, the
complaints lack specific instances for each investment bank, defense
lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just say there's fraud; you need to set forth detailed
allegations. You need some meat on the bone," said Joseph De Simone,
an attorney at Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw, which represents GigaMedia
Inc. and several other issuer defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the allegations are true, there is no evidence to show a
related cause of investors' losses, defense attorneys say. During the
euphoria of the late 1990s, demand for IPOs would have been high
under any circumstances, and investors would have lost money in the
market downturn regardless, they argue.</TE>
<TE>   The group of attorneys representing banks, which are the primary
target, include Gandolfo DiBlasi from New York-based Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell, the lead counsel for Goldman Sachs and the liaison for the
entire group.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB, an investment bank owned by Credit Suisse Group, is being
represented by Robert McCaw from Washington-based Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering, who represented the bank's Swiss parent in litigation over
the assets of Holocaust victims. Neither DiBlasi or McCaw could be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But the argument that no legal lines were crossed has become more
difficult amid a steady stream of headlines from government
investigations into alleged fraud by investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   Among the probes is an extensive review by the House Financial
Services Committee into the IPO allocations and research practices of
Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, as well as into practices
of Goldman Sachs and CSFB.</TE>
<TE>   New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and other state securities
regulators are conducting their own probes into brokerage conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Driven by a flow of new evidence, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is expected soon to announce a set of new regulations
governing investment banks, which could include a complete divorce
between investment banking operations and sell-side research
departments.</TE>
<TE>   Bad press can be a powerful incentive to settle legal suits and
bring closure, said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke
University and a member of the New York Stock Exchange legal advisory
committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Press reports can substantiate claims," Cox said. "These
government investigations have brought a lot of things to light."</TE>
<TE>   All of that could put pressure on the defendants to settle if the
plaintiffs' case emerges from the dismissal motion on strong footing.
The alternative of bringing the case to trial could take years and
cost millions in legal fees. Many experts believe a trial is highly
unlikely.</TE>

<HD>Reports to Give Clues on Possible 'Double Dip'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The barrage of economic reports due this week is likely to steal the
spotlight as investors search for signs that the dreaded "double
dip," when the economy falls back into recession for a second time in
quick succession, is at bay.</LD>
<LD>   The head of an elite panel that decides U.S. business cycles said
the recession may have ended as early as last November, but his group
won't formally declare it over until it rules out a renewed slump.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not ready to do that," Robert Hall, chairman of the
National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating
Committee, said at a meeting of business economists.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot will depend on the [payroll] number that comes out on
Friday. If it's negative, that's definitely going to cause us to
pause," Hall said. The Labor Department on Friday will report
employment data for September. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect
on average payrolls to have edged ahead by 5,000; the unemployment
rate is seen rising to 5.9% from 5.7% in August.</TE>
<TE>   The economists who make up the Business Cycle Dating Committee
often wait many months before pegging peaks and troughs in the
economy. The group, widely regarded as authoritative, held off until
December 1992 to declare that March 1991 marked the end of the
1990-91 recession, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said if payroll growth was very strong for two more months,
then that might give the panel a basis for calling an end to the
recession.</TE>
<TE>   "November is probably the earliest date we'd pick and March is the
latest date," he said of the recession's end, assuming the U.S.
economy continues growing from here.</TE>
<TE>   He said one cloud over the process is the as-yet-unanswered
question of whether the U.S. economy might slip back into a renewed
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, the panel would have to decide if such a renewed
downturn would mark a separate recession or would be considered part
of the contraction that began in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, the Institute for Supply Management's closely
watched manufacturing sector report for September, due on Tuesday, is
expected to show expansion, albeit sluggish, in the sector. The
forecast: The index will rise to 50.8 in September from 50.5 in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Personal income and spending data, coming today, may offer clues
to whether the American consumer, whose spending drives two-thirds of
U.S. growth, will continue to underpin the economy. Data on
construction spending, car sales and factory orders also will catch
investors' attention.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday may
show factory orders fell 0.3% in August, the second decline in the
last three months, after rising 4.7% in July.</TE>
<TE>   As manufacturing slows, construction is slumping. Spending on all
construction probably fell 0.2% in August, the fourth straight month
without an increase, a Commerce Department report Tuesday is expected
to show. The drop was probably led by declines in office and factory
construction only partly offset by increases in spending on housing.</TE>

<HD>Pact Averts Strike at Auto-Parts Maker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delphi Corp., the largest auto-parts maker, reached a tentative
contract agreement with the union at an Ohio suspension-systems plant
to avert a strike that had been set for tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The company reached an agreement with the International Union of
Electronic Workers-Communications Workers of America Local 755, said
Cheryl Kilborn, a Delphi spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   The union represents about 2,000 workers at the Kettering, Ohio,
factory. It had set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. local time
tonight if the two sides couldn't reach an agreement, after the
company received a letter on Sept. 23 warning of a work stoppage. A
previous strike deadline of Sept. 16 passed without an agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Union local Chairman Dave Heizer said at that time the union and
Delphi were "so close that it was unreasonable to stop negotiating
for a walkout."</TE>
<TE>   Heizer said the union's "competitive hire" workers won
"significant" pay raises in the new agreement and senior members are
getting some raises and increases in benefits. He declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   He said the union was able to win the raises after coming to an
agreement with Delphi on the sourcing of a "more profitable mix" of
products at the Kettering factory.</TE>
<TE>   The union also pledged to improve productivity through more
flexible work rules, Heizer said.</TE>

<HD>P&amp;G May Bid for Owner of Nivea Brand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Chief Executive A.G. Lafley would accelerate
growth at his company, the largest U.S. consumer-products maker, by
acquiring German firm Beiersdorf, whose sales are rising three times
as fast because of demand for its Nivea skin-care products, investors
and analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Procter &amp; Gamble might bid as much as $11 billion for Beiersdorf,
mainly to get Nivea, the world's biggest skin-cream brand, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Times Deutschland reported last week that Procter &amp;
Gamble plans to bid for German insurer Allianz's 43.6% stake in
Beiersdorf, citing unidentified people.</LD>
<TE>   Lafley, who formerly headed the beauty business, has said he wants
to expand more profitable cosmetics and health-care lines, whose
sales are rising more rapidly than staples such as Pampers diapers
and Charmin tissue. In two years as chief executive, he has winnowed
Procter &amp; Gamble's more than 250 brands by selling declining
businesses such as Comet cleaner and Crisco shortening.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Ulrey, a spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble,
declined to comment on the takeover speculation. Allianz spokesman
Stefan Denig declined to comment on potential bids.</TE>
<TE>   Procter &amp; Gamble's sales have risen 2.4% a year the last five
years, compared with 9% annual gains for Hamburg-based Beiersdorf.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition would boost Procter &amp; Gamble's beauty business to
about 23% of its sales from 20%, estimated Carol Wilke, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., who doesn't own the stock.</TE>

<HD>History, Hip-Hop Part Ways in 'Barbershop'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD BOYD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some may remember a Coca-Cola television commercial from a few years
back that showcased an African American father listening to the music
of Motown, while his son, downstairs, was listening to hip-hop. They
were both drinking Coke, and the implication was--in spite of their
differences in music and in generation--they were united, father and
son, by sharing the common soft drink. In TV commercials, soft drinks
can unite generations. Real life is another story.</LD>
<LD>   As the controversy surrounding the film "Barbershop" has revealed,
there is no unifying force when it comes to bridging the generation
gap between those of the civil rights era and those of the hip-hop
generation.</LD>
<LD>   Old-school civil rights figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton
contend that the sacred cows of their time, namely Martin Luther King
Jr. and Rosa Parks, are above criticism and should be regarded as
something akin to deities. The new-school hip-hop generation exists
with a mandate to "keep it real"; this has to do with embracing a
hard-nosed truth about the world and letting the chips fall where
they may.</LD>
<TE>   There is now a generation of black people in America who find the
ways of their parents and grandparents to be completely inapplicable
to their own lives. At the core of the civil rights movement was a
push to integrate an otherwise segregated society. The obvious result
of this integration was assimilation into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop, however, having come about in the aftermath of civil
rights, sees this assimilation as being akin to selling one's soul to
the mainstream devil. What has always been interesting about hip-hop
is that it has never attempted to assimilate. Instead, through a
strong sense of defiance and self-determination, the hip-hop
generation chooses to do things its own way. As the rapper Jay-Z has
said: "We didn't cross over, we brought the suburbs to the 'hood." In
other words, hip-hop never went mainstream, the mainstream came to
hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   This hip-hop generation has defined its own agenda, and that
includes selecting its own icons. In this regard, Notorious B.I.G.
and Tupac Shakur are deemed more relevant and occupy more of a martyr
status than does King, who was dead long before those in the hip-hop
generation were born.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights, for many, is now a 12-part PBS miniseries. A short
time ago, King's family sold his image to Alcatel, a French company,
to use in its ads. It should not be surprising then that the current
generation finds King's image to be less than sacred. King, to the
hip-hop generation, is simply another media image, not unlike Michael
Jordan or Tiger Woods. Add to this the various allegations that have
surfaced that paint King in the same light as many rappers, that of a
"playa" who loved "girls, girls, girls," and you find an image
regarded as human, more so than one that is considered divine.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the civil rights generation found its calling in politics
and the pursuit of political institutions, this hip-hop generation
has contempt for these institutions and finds culture to be the
primary means of expression. The civil rights movement produced an
increase in the number of black elected officials. The hip-hop
generation has produced several black figures on Fortune magazine's
list of the richest people under 40.</TE>
<TE>   The individuals most empowered now are entertainment figures, not
political activists. Thurgood Marshall, Medgar Evers, James Meredith
and Fannie Lou Hamer have morphed into Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Russell
Simmons, Master P, Queen Latifah and Missy Elliot. These leaders of
the new school understand that power in this society is consistent
with the size of your bankroll.</TE>
<TE>   The point is, everything evolves. As the late B.I.G. once said:
"Things done changed." Muhammad Ali was once the most hated man in
America, and now he is one of this country's greatest living heroes.
In the same way, Martin Luther King's birthday has become a long
weekend. What was once sacred has become increasingly secular. What
was once revered is now openly rejected. With this in mind, these
old-school civil rights leaders are about as played out as a bulky
eight-track tape machine in a world full of iPods.</TE>

<LD>Workers who lose their jobs typically are eligible for six months of
unemployment compensation benefits paid for by their states. Though
this usually provides enough time for them to find new jobs, that may
not be the case during a recession.</LD>
<LD>   Therefore, Congress usually creates a temporary program during
economic downturns that provides additional weeks of federally funded
benefits until an economic recovery is clearly underway.
Unfortunately, the current program, called Temporary Emergency
Unemployment Compensation, or TEUC, has two glaring weaknesses
compared with the temporary one Congress created in the last
recession: It lasts a much shorter time and provides substantially
fewer weeks of benefits.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, many unemployed workers are exhausting their
temporary benefits before they find work. Before the year ends, more
than 2 million workers will have used up their TEUC benefits,
primarily because fewer weeks of benefits are provided than in the
previous program.</LD>
<TE>   Congress created the TEUC program in March as part of its economic
stimulus package. It expires at the end of the year. In contrast,
during the recession of the early 1990s, Congress acted five times to
extend the program, compared with the single 9 1/2-month term of the
current program should Congress fail to act. A bipartisan group of
senators introduced a bill last week to provide additional weeks of
benefits and to extend the life of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing the TEUC program to die before the employment picture
improves would be a serious mistake. Unemployment is as high now as
it was when Congress created the program. And the Congressional
Budget Office predicts that unemployment will remain at about this
level until the second half of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Congress' reluctance to extend TEUC may reflect the belief that
the current recession is a fairly mild one. Unemployment has been
hovering at about 6%, well below the peak of the last recession, and
it even fell slightly last month. In addition, until this summer, the
economy seemed poised for recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these arguments now seems very convincing. The current
recession is really no milder than the last one. In each case, the
unemployment rate rose by about 2 percentage points during the first
18 months of the downturn. Unemployment is lower now than during the
last recession only because the rate just before the recession
started was much lower than in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   By some measures, this recession appears worse than the last one
in about three-quarters of the states. Among workers who qualify for
unemployment insurance, unemployment rates have risen more during
this recession than during the last one. In addition, workers are
spending longer periods of time unemployed and therefore are
exhausting regular benefits at greater rates than before.</TE>
<TE>   Further, recovery in employment usually lags behind economic
output as employers squeeze extra production out of existing workers
before hiring new ones. This seems to be the pattern, as
private-sector employment growth has been tepid all year and shows
little sign of improving soon. In fact, first-time claims for
unemployment benefits have risen.</TE>
<TE>   Congress therefore should extend the TEUC program for an
additional six months, as well as increase the number of weeks of
benefits, particularly in states with higher unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Because TEUC is (and would remain) a temporary program, extending
it won't create long-term budget problems. In contrast, the permanent
tax cuts that have been proposed would have adverse effects for
decades. Extending unemployment benefits would help the workers and
families who have most been hurt by the recession and would provide
additional stimulus to the economy at modest cost.</TE>

<HD>The Cries That Bind</HD>
<DH>In their pain, Americans must not turn away from the rest
of humanity's suffering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. THATAMANIL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The events of the last year have enabled many Americans to comprehend
both the disfiguring pain and the redemptive power of vulnerability.
Unfortunately, it seems now that some remember only the pain. Our
collective national energies are being marshaled on our behalf, if
not at our behest, in a quixotic pursuit of absolute invulnerability
and total security.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps we are a people incapable of sustaining an appreciation
for the inevitable fragility of human life. We refuse to learn the
one irrevocable lesson of the Sept. 11 attacks: Our nation,
regardless of its might, is not and never can be exempt from the
atrocious evil and suffering that regularly visits so many who live
outside our borders. As we ready for war with Iraq, we may soon
discover that our inability to learn this lesson will carry a toll
beyond our reckoning.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Americans experienced a deep sense of solidarity and
kinship in the midst of our grieving and our loss. The enormity of
the wound we suffered gave us no other option. New Yorkers in
particular gave up the routine, pleasurable anonymity of being part
of a frenetic, thriving urban populace and began to look one another
in the eye. David Letterman and Dan Rather wept on TV. Politicians
engaged with civility.</LD>
<TE>   All this transpired because we realized that we are all citizens
of the republic of the wounded and the vulnerable. For a moment, we
understood that the borders of that republic cannot be patrolled and
that no missile shield can cover it. It is blind to race, creed,
ethnicity, gender, nationality. The boundary lines present in our
cartography are absent from the geography. Such wounds as we suffered
are not sought out, but when they come, they have can bring about
powerful and redemptive transformations. The tremendous international
outpouring of sympathy came with a fragile faith that Americans might
understand better the needs and sufferings of the global community.</TE>
<TE>   Those hopes seem to have been misplaced. On the domestic front, we
pursue invulnerability at the expense of the freedoms we cherish. We
seem willing to deprive ourselves and those we view as threatening of
fundamental rights, including the right to due process. On the
international front, we refuse to be constrained by the power of
international bodies, such as the United Nations, and we ignore our
allies. Our reaction to our injuries has led us not into communion
but isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging our own vulnerability does not mean that we should
be cavalier about our national security and abandon vigorous efforts
to protect ourselves and our loved ones. That would be foolish, even
suicidal. Nevertheless, we cannot let our fear drive us into a
practically impossible and morally problematic quest to go it alone.
Nor can we act in ways that suggest invulnerability is a legitimate
and realistic goal.</TE>
<TE>   We must not repress the ugly truth that only a box cutter may
stand between us and the horror.</TE>
<TE>   Though our loss leaves us injured, terrified and angered, we must
not refuse the sole, delicate good that pain has bequeathed to our
nation: our kinship with the whole of the human community.</TE>

<LD>Few people can say that when they come to work in the morning they
feel closer to God. In my case, this may have something to do with
the multicolored tattoo of the Virgin Mary that extends from my
secretary's neck to her right elbow.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Kelly's iconic arm could well be an exhibit in a case
before the U.S. Supreme Court. At issue is whether tattooing is a
protected form of religious or political speech under the
Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   It is a case that may trigger as many generational as
constitutional conflicts.</LD>
<TE>   In White vs. South Carolina, the Supreme Court must decide whether
to accept an appeal from a tattoo artist, Ronald White, or allow his
criminal conviction for unlawful tattooing to stand. In a single act
of defiance in 1999, White was transformed from an obscure tattoo
practitioner to the virtual Martin Luther of "body artists." Opposed
to South Carolina's ban on tattooing, he decided to do the modern
equivalent of nailing his grievance to a cathedral door: He tattooed
a man on local TV.</TE>
<TE>   That act cost him a criminal conviction, five years' probation and
a fine.</TE>
<TE>   White has picked up some strange allies along the way, including
former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who joined White as
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Though tattooing has been around for 8,000 years, the popular
acceptance of body art is relatively new to the West. One can only
imagine the reaction of Pope Julius II if Michelangelo suggested his
holy derriere would make a better "canvas" than the Sistine Chapel.
However, the 1st Amendment protects the right of expression and not
the specific forms of expression.</TE>
<TE>   As our artistic and political forms of expression evolve, the
Constitution protects each new medium with the same vigor as the
first. As hard as it may be for some of us to accept, tattooing was
found by one court in Massachusetts to be "the most commonly
purchased form of original artwork in the United States." This is not
the view in South Carolina, or, for that matter, Oklahoma--the only
other state that outlaws the practice.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina state Sen. J.M. Knotts explained that tattoos are
against God's will because "if God wanted you to have a tattoo, he'd
have put your name on you."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that, though a
tattoo might be a form of protected expression, the "process" of
tattooing was not protected. This is akin to treating the Declaration
of Independence as protected speech but not Benjamin Franklin's
printing of the document.</TE>
<TE>   The court based its decision in part on the belief that tattooing
poses a public health danger, a view common in the 1960s after a
hepatitis outbreak linked to a Coney Island tattoo parlor. However,
the Food and Drug Administration has found that it is "not aware of
any immediate hazards to health associated with the use of tattoo
equipment" and that the most common problem is simple customer
dissatisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all states have rescinded or struck down their bans
(including Massachusetts in a judicial decision in 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Any walk along the beach reveals the range of artistic and
political expression found in the rising number of tattoos. Like any
other medium of speech, the quality of tattoo speech ranges from the
profound to the moronic. Just as you will find the ubiquitous Goth
images, you will also find an assortment of political and religious
expressions ranging from the American flag to crosses to, most
recently, the memorial tattoos found on many of the surviving New
York firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Starr may be the ideal individual to show a relatively stodgy
group of justices that a new generation has embraced an ancient form
of expression.</TE>
<TE>   He could have saved much of his argument with a simple quotation
from Marx--Groucho, not Karl. Marx's signature song was about "Lydia
the Tattooed Lady," who was "suited," in today's parlance, with a
full body of images. Marx describes how, with a little movement,
various historical scenes, like Washington crossing the Delaware,
would come to life: "Lydia, oh, Lydia, that encyclopedia, Lydia the
queen of tattoos / On her back is the battle of Waterloo, beside it
the wreck of the Hesperus, too / And proudly above waves the red,
white and blue / You can learn a lot from Lydia."</TE>
<TE>   The only question is whether nine unadulterated justices can learn
a lot from Lydia.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After including North Korea in his controversial "axis of evil,"
President Bush is backing away from his confrontational course and
displaying some welcome flexibility.</LD>
<LD>   Senior State Department official James A. Kelly's trip to North
Korea early next month should offer both sides a chance to ease
tensions. North Korea's economic woes are forcing its leader, Kim
Jong Il, to embrace reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. should seize the opportunity to probe the sincerity of
the rogue regime's commitment to becoming a responsible state.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. shift follows Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's
productive visit to North Korea, which resulted in an agreement to
resume normalization talks in October. Japan is urging the U.S. to
reach out to North Korea, and South Korea is even more eager to see
that happen. South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, has sought to
promote normal relations with the North and reduce political
tensions. With the disappearance of the Berlin Wall, the razor
wire-topped chain-link fence dividing Korea has become a historical
anachronism, an ugly vestige of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's main focus will be slowing North Korean weapons
proliferation and compelling its compliance with an agreement
negotiated by the Clinton administration. That 1994 pact froze North
Korea's nuclear programs in return for desperately needed American
aid.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Kim Jong Il is looking for the U.S. to support the
creation in his country of a trade and investment zone--with Japan,
Russia, China and South Korea as partners. He knows that will happen
only if he gives the U.S. real reasons to stop viewing his nation as
a pariah.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's trip is an encouraging sign. Just because the Clinton
administration tried to reach out to North Korea doesn't mean that
it's a bad idea. The Bush administration is beginning to get this, to
understand that talking to the North is better than dismissing it as
evil and then ignoring it.</TE>

<LD>The California Board of Prison Terms is no nest of bleeding hearts.
The eight men and women appointed by Gov. Gray Davis (one seat is
vacant) will hold some 4,500 hearings this year for murderers,
rapists and kidnappers who have served their minimum terms and have
become eligible for parole.</LD>
<LD>   Board members, many of whom have law enforcement backgrounds, have
no patience with the sob stories told by hardened felons or with
their sniveling promises to live an honest life.</LD>
<LD>   But if a chief aim of prison is to keep society safe, isn't there
a point at which some prisoners deemed by the board to no longer be a
threat can be let go? That is the question the state Supreme Court is
about to decide.</LD>
<TE>   In January, the parole board was persuaded that David Ramos
deserved a new start. Ramos, 40, has been locked up for 21 years for
driving a killer to the scene. During that time he has earned a
college degree, learned a trade and taught more than 1,000 prisoners
to read.</TE>
<TE>   The board also has cleared Mark Smith for release. Smith has
served 17 years behind bars for his part in a murder and now suffers
from AIDS, which renders him costlier to incarcerate as he becomes
sicker and less dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Davis blocked release in each case based on a 1998 law that gives
the governor veto power over paroles.</TE>
<TE>   Davis vowed when he took office that he would release no convicted
murderers. In four years, he has freed only two of the 135 murderers
the board recommended for parole. Both are women who alleged that
they were driven to murder after years of domestic abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos, Smith and a handful of others granted parole and blocked by
Davis have brought suit to win their release.</TE>
<TE>   Two state appeals court panels said Davis lacks the constitutional
power to continue to hold inmates that the parole board has found
suitable for release, but a third court this month upheld the
governor's authority. The state Supreme Court, which takes up this
issue next month, will have the final word.</TE>
<TE>   The state's primary responsibility is to protect people from
killers and rapists by keeping them locked up.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the state also has an obligation to try to rehabilitate these
men and women for a productive life after they've served their time.
And it must allow for the release of those who it judges do not pose
a threat.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the gangbangers and thugs in California's prisons
don't begin to rise to this challenge. But for those few who do,
parole should remain more than a theoretical option, and the high
court should say so.</TE>

<DH>In expanding the bioterrorism act, the government must be
sensitive to the divide between national security and academic
freedom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a hearing two months after 9/11, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
asked FBI Assistant Director James T. Caruso a simple question: "How
many labs handle anthrax in the United States?" Caruso's reply was,
"We don't know that at this time." We still don't know.</LD>
<LD>   Universities were supposed to comply with the first provision of
the new Bioterrorism Preparedness Act--notifying federal authorities
if they possess Ebola, anthrax or 34 other dangerous biological
agents--on Sept. 10. Many haven't done it. Schools that object should
read an editorial in this week's Science, an influential academic
magazine, chiding scientists for not taking national security
seriously enough: "Those working in sensitive areas must ...
emphasize the positive role of science and technology in addressing
human needs and the immorality of their use to cause mass casualties
and human suffering."</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't mean scientists should go along with whatever the
government wants, in the name of security. Knee-jerk reactions on
either side are dangerous.</LD>
<TE>   In a ham-handed gesture, President Bush this year proposed to
transfer oversight of bioterror research from the Centers for Disease
Control and the Department of Health and Human Services, which
understand science, to the Department of Homeland Security, which
doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Now the administration is considering expanding the bioterrorism
act in clumsy ways. The act already allows the toughest federal
scrutiny of universities' visa requests involving students from
Libya, Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Cuba, the nations
that the U.S. designates as incubators of terrorism. Homeland
Security chief Tom Ridge also has asked for tighter checks of
students coming from other countries, especially China. Ridge's
agency is right to scrutinize certain applicants, since the 9/11
hijackers made such efficient use of student visas. But it should be
sensitive to universities' mission, too.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's science advisor, John Marburger, recently
cautioned politicians about restricting science. Few state and
federal elected officials, Marburger said, "appreciate the delicate
complexity of academic life, or its dependence on openness, its
insistence on individual responsibility and its critical need for
freedom in its intellectual pursuits." That includes freedom to
nurture new scientists like Daniel Tsui, a Nobel laureate at
Princeton who won the 1998 prize in chemistry after emigrating from
China as a foreign-exchange student.</TE>
<TE>   Other new proposals would create a not-quite-classified
"sensitive-information" category for government-owned research.
Resident-alien scientists, for instance, wouldn't be allowed to store
cell biology diagrams on laptops they could take home, because such
equations theoretically could be used to make bioweapons.</TE>
<TE>   As the American Society for Microbiology recently warned, the
government could slow the very research that is underway to develop
countermeasures to such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Government and universities have never had an easy coexistence.
Less defensive communication on both sides could prevent damaging
mistakes.</TE>

<LD>Re "Piracy May Keep the Beat From Going On," Commentary, Sept. 25: A
message to Diane Warren concerning the downloading of music: The dike
has sprung millions of leaks and it will soon collapse. Stop telling
people to put their fingers in the holes. Technology has unlocked the
doors to the record store, and those doors are never going to be
locked again. It's up to the music business to invent a music
distribution process that will become the new standard.</LD>
<LD>   You can't bar a door that isn't there, so stop blaming the very
consumer you've been gouging for so long for taking advantage of your
uncreative shortsightedness. Learn to use technology for your own
benefit and stop whining about what can't be undone. Inventive,
creative thinking will unearth a gold mine for writers, artists,
producers, publishers and record companies. This gold mine has never
before been tapped, but it will soon enrich the music business
because of the ease of availability of product for the average
consumer, who has rarely stepped foot in a record store and never
will. Welcome to the new world. Be part of the solution.</LD>

<TE>   Amen! Warren's commentary took the resulting loss to the personal
level to reveal that digital piracy is not victimless--and it is a
crime. I can't believe the number of otherwise honest friends who
speak about software they use and add proudly that "I never paid for
any of it," like that was totally OK. I have heard all the arguments:
Music is too expensive, record companies make enough, how do I know I
will like it, I only wanted one song, etc. They all boil down to a
rationalization for stealing. Try the same arguments for stealing a
box of crackers and see if it passes your personal "smell test."</TE>
<TE>   Joel Garfield</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With poetic justice, the same technology that enabled the music
industry to multiply its profits--CDs cost less to produce but
consumers were/are charged more--came 'round to bite it right on the
rear. No one dreamed that the Internet would come along and make
digital data such an unstoppably shareable resource. Oops!</TE>
<TE>   The margins necessary to sustain the music industry (as it is
today) require producing extremely profitable "hits" on a regular
basis, so we are blessed with 'N Sync, Britney Spears and all of the
other wonderfully talented "artists" who fill the airwaves. Now there
is fear that the machinery churning out this dreck is going to grind
to a halt because of online sharing? Doubtful. But if that is the
case, so be it. Warren herself describes what she does as "craft."
This approach to songwriting is painfully obvious to anyone who
bothers to listen to most of today's mass-produced music. No doubt,
what Warren does takes talent, drive, inspiration and intelligence;
my question is whether there should even be such a thing as a
"professional" songwriter. I'm curious: What kind of music gets
created without the promise of a paycheck?</TE>

<TE>   The book publishing industry survived the invention of the free
public library, and the film industry survived the invention of
television and home VCRs. The recording industry won't survive file
sharing because music fans are fed up with paying the record
companies up to $18.98 for a CD that costs them around a dollar to
manufacture.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Battle to Win Hearts and Minds Has to Begin at Home,"
Commentary, Sept. 26: How often must we go down this road? The U.S.
has been educating its citizens in colleges and universities for how
long? And how many of these deluded and leftist graduates are aligned
with our enemies? Really, Norah Vincent and Lynne Cheney are a hoot.
Apparently, I and my neighbors were able to withstand the insidious
indoctrination and get good corporate jobs, start businesses and
achieve positions in the professions. Additionally, we are mortgaged
to the eyeballs while trying earnestly to pay for our kids' college
educations. We buy computers and cars and shop, shop, shop. I'm
scratching my head as I look around and try to figure out who among
us are the moles these dear ladies seem to fear.</LD>
<TE>   I always thought colleges and universities crowded out stuff like
U.S. history to make room for business courses. Did it occur to the
dear ladies that if the curriculum should suddenly reaccommodate the
history department, just maybe the outcome would be something other
than what they envision? Or will history professors have to pass
muster with the ministry of truth? Sounds like that is the agenda if
Lynne Cheney gets her way. I think most of us aspire to the American
dream, and once we are out of school and making our way in the very
conservative world of the middle class it is good to know that there
was a time in our lives when we could explore the alternatives. Hands
off, ladies.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Mueller</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What is most disturbing about Vincent's commentary is not its
tacit endorsement of another round of McCarthyite witch hunts of
college faculty, but rather her assumption that college students are
docile, blank slates waiting to be "indoctrinated" by their
professors. I taught college for several years, and I can assure
Vincent that my students, from Indiana to California to New York
City, tended to be far more conservative than I am. It's telling that
Vincent gives statistics on the political leanings of faculty but not
students. If students are being indoctrinated by leftist professors,
where are all these brainwashed college graduates who hate America?</TE>
<TE>   Students take courses in college to learn about the subject
matter. They are perfectly capable of recognizing that a professor,
say, of physics, has no particular expertise in politics, and they
are able to disregard any political comments that instructor might
make. Vincent's contempt for young people, under the paternalistic
guise of "protecting" them, is stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Brewer</TE>
<TE>   Goleta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent is agitated because a very high percentage of the
professors in our best universities are liberals. She should think
again about what her data are telling her. If highly educated,
well-informed people are rejecting libertarian conservatism, Vincent
should ask herself: "What is wrong with conservatism that such
learned people reject it?" Self-analysis can be more useful than
criticism.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a business owner in California, I can understand why companies
will leave California at an even faster rate ("Davis OKs Paid Family
Leave Bill," Sept. 24). Under the administration of Gov. Gray Davis I
have seen my electricity bill triple (Enron dealings), my worker's
comp and medical insurance payments increase by at least 50% and
workers who get unemployment even though they quit. Now I have to pay
[to replace] employees when they are not at work if they must take
care of a so-called sick one. The problem is all the fraud that will
occur from this new law, drastically hurting business.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Simon is no angel, but he at least has enough sense not to
hurt business (which is a major job provider) or make the mistakes
the Davis administration has made--not to mention the smear campaign
undertaken by the Davis campaign and the botched computer
modernization, canceled when halfway done.</LD>
<LD>   I think the family leave law is the last straw, and I will move my
company--which employs 30 people, with at least three to five family
members per employee who are being supported by us, so they will have
to move or lose their jobs--to Nevada.</LD>

<LD>I hope Erwin Chemerinsky checks out his facts better when he teaches
at Duke Law School than he did for his Sept. 26 commentary, "We Might
Get More Bang With Our Bucks." President Kennedy was ready with
forces to back up his other efforts to get the missiles out of Cuba.
I know; I was one of the many thousands of military personnel on
alert, and I was just off the coast of Cuba ready to take part in a
landing on the beaches.</LD>
<LD>   Saddam Hussein is into power, not money; he has already bled
Iraq's treasury for many billions, I'm sure. Do we want to set the
example that tyrants can do what they want and we will punish them by
buying them out? That's smart--and will really be a deterrent to the
next tyrant in the world. Even if the scientists left, what about the
weapons Iraq already has? Cost is not the only consideration when
facing people like Hussein. Why do "peace at any price-niks" persist
in their pipe dreams?</LD>

<TE>   At last, someone says something rational and sensible about the
possible Iraq war. Chemerinsky proposes just a few of the cheaper,
less destructive and more creative possible responses to
Hussein--well beyond the limited imagination demonstrated to date by
our leaders.</TE>

<LD>What an amazing survivor, this Richard Van Pham ("Boater Drifts 4

any of the TV "Survivor" shows to shame, both in the categories of
ingenuity and perseverance. What is truly tragic and hidden in this
story is that this man had lost everything he had worked so hard for
because of his medical expenses. Certainly this great nation of ours
should be able to find a way to provide a health-care safety net for
all its citizens. On the bright side, this is truly an inspiring
tale, given the daily media bombardment of war talk, tumbling stock
values and corporate executive scandals.</LD>

<HD>Liability for Gun Makers a Dangerous Precedent</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Signs More Curbs on Gun Makers," Sept. 26:</LD>
<LD>   So, gun manufacturers can now be held liable for the misuse of
their product. Is anyone concerned about the precedent that this
sets? Or is it simply an act to increase lawyers' income? Should we
worry that individuals, with each new law, seem to have less
responsibility for their actions?</LD>
<LD>   A study concluded that each 100-pound decrease in the weight of
sport utility vehicles would save 40 lives and result in 600 fewer
serious injuries. So, should the manufacturers of SUVs be held liable
for every accident involving an SUV in which a person is injured?
After all, if they didn't build such large vehicles, fewer deaths and
injuries would occur.</LD>
<TE>   A study found that a person on a cell phone has a reaction time
24% slower than normal. Other studies have found that a person
driving while talking on a cell phone is as impaired as a person with
a blood-alcohol content of 0.1%. So, should the manufacturers of cell
phones be held liable for accidents when the driver is talking on a
cell phone? After all, the technology exists to disable the phone in
a moving vehicle, so the manufacturer must clearly be negligent by
not providing it.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Kane, 103; Author Dug for Forgotten Facts and
History</HD>

<LD>Jack Webb would have loved him.</LD>
<LD>   With his refusal to accept any historical factoid without proof,
he had to be the original advocate of Sgt. Joe Friday's polite plea
for "just the facts, Ma'am," which was immortalized by Webb's
"Dragnet."</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Nathan Kane, national repository of provable trivia from
America's last four centuries or so and author of the five editions
of "Famous First Facts," has died. He was 103.</LD>
<TE>   Kane, who had suffered a broken hip six years ago and had been
confined to a wheelchair due to Parkinson's disease, died Sept. 22 of
causes associated with age in West Palm Beach, Fla. He had moved
there a few years ago to share the condo of his only survivor, his
sister, Ann Madier.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in 1999 at the celebration of his 100th birthday what he
owed his long life to, the blunt-spoken Kane said simply: "I did
nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Born on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the bachelor Kane lived there
most of his life.</TE>
<TE>   For many decades, he occupied a garret two flights up from where
the elevator stopped, an apartment stuffed with his meticulous,
perfectly organized reference books and index cards.</TE>
<TE>   Kane shared his carefully collected facts with a fascinated public
in 52 books, beginning in 1933 with "Famous First Facts: A Record of
First Happenings, Discoveries, and Inventions in the United States"
and ending in 1997 with "Necessity's Child: The Story of Walter Hunt,
America's Forgotten Inventor." Hunt, Kane discovered, was the
inventor of the sewing machine, the safety pin, the fountain pen and
the heat-radiating stove, but either sold the patents or never
obtained them and never learned the art of self-promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Eldest of three children of a fur importer and the grandson of a
composer, young Kane learned to play the mandolin, violin and banjo.
But asking questions intrigued him far more than music.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever a teacher declared some accepted point in history, the
upstart boy asked, "How do you know?" It was a question he asked
throughout his long life. He explained to an Associated Press writer
in 1988, when he was 89, "I'm stupid enough to not believe anything
until I see the proof."</TE>
<TE>   Kane graduated from Columbia University and planned to serve in
World War I until he fell ill in the influenza epidemic of 1918.
Fluent in French, German and Spanish, he went to work for the
confectioner D. Auerbach &amp; Sons and was soon running its export
business.</TE>
<TE>   That led him into writing--initially articles about the export
business for trade journals. He went on to write for such
publications as Advertising Age, Printers' Ink and Nation's Business.
Over the years, he published more than 1,000 newspaper articles.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated with historical facts, Kane decided in the 1920s to
write a book about the inventors and other achievers that history
either had forgotten or never recognized.</TE>
<TE>   From 1922 to 1932, according to the preface of the most recent
edition of "Famous First Facts," published in 1997, Kane spent much
of each year traveling the country, visiting libraries and museums
and talking to inventors or their descendants, examining newspaper
clippings and records and sorting out conflicting patents. His
intent, he said in his reference masterpiece's first preface, was not
"to remold public conceptions, but merely to present impartial facts
... [and] replace romantic history with commonplace truth."</TE>
<TE>   After 11 rejections from publishers, Kane asked librarians he met
around the country to write letters about the need for such a book.
In 1933, Halsey W. Wilson, who had founded H.W. Wilson Co. in 1898,
agreed to publish "Famous First Facts" and then asked for several
more books.</TE>
<TE>   Kane produced such works as "Facts About the Presidents," which
noted that James Madison had been the shortest, at 5 feet, 4 inches,
and that Grover Cleveland had the most nicknames--20--including Dumb
Prophet, Buffalo Hangman and Grover the Good.</TE>
<TE>   Kane also wrote "The American Counties: A Record of the Origin of
the Names of 3,067 Counties, Dates of Creation and Organization,
Area, Population, Historical Data, etc." which took him on a personal
odyssey to every county courthouse (or jail if that was where the
records were kept) in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his books were easily forgotten, even though
comprehensive. "What Dog Is That?" was a 1944 compendium of the 122
pure breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.</TE>
<TE>   But the "Famous First Facts" books were so popular they led to a
secondary career with radio and then television quiz shows. In 1938
and 1939, Kane was host for a radio program, "Famous First Facts,"
and in the 1940s and 1950s, he wrote questions for such shows as
"Break the Bank," "Double or Nothing" and "The $64,000 Question."</TE>
<TE>   Among Kane's arcane factoids likely to stump contestants were such
seemingly simple queries as who was first president of the U.S., who
built the first commercial American automobile or who flew the first
airplane. The answers, Kane said, were not George Washington, Henry
Ford or Wilbur and Orville Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Washington was the first president elected under the U.S.
Constitution in 1788, Kane would explain, but Thomas McKean of
Delaware was the first president of the United States in Congress
assembled under the Articles of Confederation in 1781.</TE>
<TE>   "Over 50 people have told me their father invented the
automobile," he said in 1988. "When I start verifying claims, I find
that someone's father may have invented the fourth knob on the fifth
spark plug on the sixth day at 7 o'clock. But he didn't invent the
automobile." The man who built the first commercial American one,
Kane said, was Charles Edgar Duryea who opened the Duryea Motor Wagon
Co. in Springfield, Mass., in 1895. He started building his
automobile in 1891 and first drove it on April 19, 1892.</TE>
<TE>   And the first airplane, Kane determined, was flown more than two
years before the Wright Brothers lifted off from Kitty Hawk, N.C.
Gustave Whitehead flew on April 14, 1901, near Bridgeport, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Kane, who could also report with confidence that the first sheep
had been brought to the U.S. in 1609 and the first camels in 1721,
kept a few inventions along with his myriad facts about them. One was
the first fountain pen invented in America, and another was Walter
Hunt's patent model for the first American safety pin, created in
1849.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Granger, 99, who held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for
a record 76 years, died Friday of natural causes in Manhattan's Mary
Manning Walsh Home.</LD>
<LD>   A Yale graduate who studied at Cambridge University in England, he
joined his father's Wall Street firm, Sulzbacher, Granger &amp; Co. (now
a part of Ingalls &amp; Snyder), when he was 23.</LD>
<LD>   He did so well as a conservative investor that he bought his seat
on the stock exchange later that same year, 1926, for $143,000.</LD>
<TE>   Through the 1929 crash, the Depression and many market ups and
downs, the steadfast optimist and student of history remained
confident that the world and the stock exchange would always get
better.</TE>
<TE>   Granger was on the four-man bobsled team that won a silver medal
in the 1928 Olympics at St. Moritz, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army during World War II, rising to the rank of
major and earning the Order of the British Empire for helping supply
Britain with war planes.</TE>
<TE>   Although badly injured by a terrorist bomb while dining above
Fraunces Tavern in 1975, Granger remained a lifelong booster of New
York City. He served on the board of the Museum of the City of New
York and as a trustee of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.</TE>
<TE>   Granger also was a director of the English-Speaking Union, which
promotes education around the world.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Glen Rounds, 96, an author and illustrator who described life in his
home state of Montana through stories and drawings, died Friday of
natural causes in Pinehurst, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   A character in his own life, Rounds was born in a South Dakota sod
house, moved to Montana as an infant in a covered wagon, and in his
youth worked as mule skinner, cowboy and carnival medicine man.</LD>
<LD>   He grew up drawing the animals and people on ranches, and attended
Kansas City Art Institute and night classes at the Art Students
League in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Once he succeeded in having a few illustrations published in the
early 1930s, Rounds found steady work and produced dozens of books.</TE>
<TE>   Written for children, his tall tales and stories of Paul Bunyan
and loggers, cowboys and animals appealed to adults as well.</TE>
<TE>   His first book, "Ol' Paul, the Mighty Logger," was published in
1936 and is still in print.</TE>
<TE>   When severe arthritis in his right hand curtailed his drawing in
1989, Rounds learned to draw with his left, in his words, "rather
than take up horseshoeing."</TE>
<TE>   His most recent books were "Sod Houses on the Great Plains" in
1995 and "Beaver" in 1999.</TE>

<LD>Edith Weiss, 90, a Democratic Party fund-raiser and organizer who
served on the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, died

<LD>   Long the public relations director for the Los Angeles
International Music Festival at UCLA, Weiss was appointed to the Los
Angeles County Music Commission in 1959 by Supervisor Ernest E. Debs.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss moved to Los Angeles in 1938 and, as she told The Times 20
years ago, "it never occurred to me to look for a job anywhere except
in the film industry. I couldn't type--still can't--but I got a job
doing PR or publicity ... and I've been at it ever since."</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, Weiss arranged events and handled publicity for
such Hollywood stars as Greta Garbo and for political candidates
including John F. Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey and Edmund G. "Pat" Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Her clients also included the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and
its Modern and Contemporary Art Council.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY: Part two of a six-part series</SE>
<AU>Sonia Nazario</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experiences in Las Anonas: written from interviews with Sirenio Gomez
Fuentes; Mayor Carlos Carrasco; Carrasco's mother, Lesbia Sibaja; San
Pedro Tapanatepec Mayor Adan Diaz Ruiz; resident Beatriz Carrasco
Gomez; and other villagers. Nazario visited the Gomez home, the Las
Anonas church and the mango tree where Enrique collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Enrique's requests to Gomez for water and pants: from Gomez and
Enrique.</LD>
<LD>   Exchange between Mayor Carrasco and Enrique about whether he fell
from the train: from Carrasco and Enrique. Carrasco's shout to his
mother: from Carrasco and his mother.</LD>
<TE>   Questions Gloria Luis asks Enrique: from Luis. Enrique recalled
that one of the townspeople asked these questions. His response that
he was going to find his mother: from Enrique, confirmed by Luis and
Mayor Carrasco.</TE>
<TE>   Comments by Mayor Diaz criticizing Central American immigrants and
their governments: from Mayor Carrasco, confirmed by Diaz. Diaz's
debate with himself about helping Enrique: from Diaz, corroborated by
Carrasco, who said Diaz voiced some of these concerns to him.
Statement by Diaz to Enrique that he would help him: from Enrique,
confirmed by Diaz and Carrasco.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's remark to Ricardo Diaz Aguilar, the mayor's driver, that
he thought he would die: from the driver, confirmed by Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   Ride to the doctor and encounter with the judicial police officer
who Enrique says robbed him: from interviews with Enrique and Ricardo
Diaz Aguilar, who took him to the clinic. Manuel de Jesus Molina, who
in 2000 served as assistant to the mayor of Ixtepec, a nearby town,
says Enrique's experience with the judicial police was common in the
area. The denial that judicial police rob people is from Sixto
Juarez, chief of the Agencia Federal de Investigacion in Arriaga,
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   First six attempts: from interviews with Enrique and from
Nazario's observations of other immigrants along the same route. She
visited the spot near Medias Aguas where Enrique was stung by bees.
She went to the Tapachula cemetery and the mausoleum where Enrique
slept. Cemetery caretaker Miguel Angel Perez Hernandez and Mario
Campos Gutierrez, a supervisory agent with the government migrant
rights group Grupo Beta Sur, provided information about recent
violence in the graveyard. The annual number of deportees from Mexico
is from the National Migration Institute of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Beating on the train: from interviews with Enrique and residents
of Las Anonas and San Pedro Tapanatepec. Robberies in which
immigrants are stripped and hurled from trains are commonplace,
according to: rights group Grupo Beta Sur, whose officers
occasionally patrol the trains; Father Flor Maria Rigoni, a Catholic
priest at the Albergue Belen migrant shelter in Tapachula, Chiapas
state; Baltasar Soriano Peraza, a caseworker at the shelter; and
other immigrants who have been robbed on the trains by street
gangsters. Railroad personnel and Mayor Carrasco estimated how fast
the trains travel in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's plea to gangsters: from Enrique, who recalled his words
six weeks later. Suggestion by a gangster that Enrique be thrown off
the train: from Enrique. His prayer that he be spared so he could see
his mother again and his worry over how his family would know his
fate: from Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   Medical condition and treatment: from interviews with Enrique and
Dr. Guillermo Toledo Montes, who treated him. Mayor Diaz provided the
doctor's receipt detailing Enrique's treatment. Nazario visited the
clinic and the police command post where Enrique slept. Words spoken
between Enrique and Toledo: from the doctor and Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   Money from sympathetic strangers in San Pedro Tapanatepec: from
Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   Exchange between Enrique and the driver he flagged down for a
ride: from Enrique. Statement from immigration agents telling Enrique
he couldn't keep going north: from Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   The bus ride to Guatemala: from interviews with Enrique;
immigrants on the bus; and Nazario's observations riding the bus to
El Carmen, Guatemala, where the trip ends. How street gangsters rob
riders is from Baltasar Soriano Peraza, the caseworker at the
Albergue Belen shelter; Mexican immigration agent Fernando Armento
Juan, who accompanies migrants on the bus; and migrants, including
Carlos Sandoval, a Salvadoran, who said he was accosted by gangsters
with ice picks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COMING WEDNESDAY: CHAPTER THREE</TE>
<TE>   By his eighth attempt to reach the U.S., Enrique knows to steel
himself for the dangers of "the beast": Mexico's Chiapas state.</TE>
<TE>   COMING FRIDAY: CHAPTER FOUR</TE>
<TE>   In Veracruz state, Enrique expects the worst. Instead he finds a
wellspring of kindness: dozens of poor people, rushing toward the
train with gifts.</TE>

<HD>Serb Presidential Election Heading to a Runoff Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Vojislav Kostunica on Sunday won the initial round of Serbia's first
presidential election since Slobodan Milosevic's ouster and will face
a pro-Western candidate in a runoff, according to unofficial results.</LD>
<LD>   Kostunica, Yugoslavia's president, had 31% support, followed by
pro-Western Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus with 28%,
the results showed. Because neither appeared to get more than the 50%
needed for an outright win, they will face each other in a runoff.</LD>
<LD>   The unofficial results were released by the Center for Free
Elections and Democracy, an independent watchdog group that had
observers at all 8,615 polling stations and monitored the official
count. The center's results have proved reliable in the past.</LD>
<TE>   Official results were not expected before today.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica is losing his job as Yugoslavia's president next year
under constitutional changes aimed at transforming the country into a
loose union of its two republics, Serbia and Montenegro.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica, a moderate nationalist, is widely favored to win over
Labus in the final round, to be held in two weeks.</TE>

<HD>How Jorge Mendoza and His Gang Ruled the Train Tops</HD>

<LD>"We ask for money to take people to the U.S. on top of our trains,"
says Jorge Mauricio Mendoza Pineda, 24, describing what he and his
Mara Salvatrucha gang do in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
"They give me their money. If people treat me well, I treat them
well. If they don't, I don't.... If someone says, 'Please don't kill
me,' I won't listen."</LD>
<LD>   Mendoza helped the MS gain control of the tops of freight trains
operating north of the Rio Suchiate, where many immigrants going to
the United States begin their trek through Mexico. He was interviewed
on Aug. 11, 2000, in a Chiapas jail, where he was serving time for
robbing and assaulting three Central American migrants with a
machete.</LD>
<LD>   Until his 1999 arrest, Mendoza says, he commanded 40 gangsters on
two-day train rides. Workers at shelters say his group robbed
migrants of money and shoes. Migrants, in Mexico illegally and often
afraid to press charges, make ideal victims.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 street gangsters in Chiapas engage in the rolling
criminal enterprise. Father Flor Maria Rigoni, a priest at the
Albergue Belen immigrant shelter, counts 19 groups. Each, Mendoza
explains, controls a specific part of the train route and certain
stations. Periodically, the groups meet to decide who gets what.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, whose career included being shot in the arm during a
robbery and knifed in the belly by a prostitute, joined MS, one of
Los Angeles' most powerful street gangs, in Chiapas. There, he says,
the police were more forgiving than at home in El Salvador. Many MS
gangsters settle in Chiapas after committing crimes in the United
States and being expelled to their home countries.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza was released from the Chiapas jail last April. Seven days
later, he was killed in a shooting in El Salvador.</TE>

<HD>How Victor and Other Small Children Fell by the Wayside</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some who journey north are very young.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Flores, 4 years old, maybe 5, was abandoned on a bus by a
female smuggler. He carries no identification, no telephone number.</LD>
<LD>   He ends up at Casa Pamar, a foster home in Tapachula, Mexico, just
north of the Guatemalan border. The home shelters immigrant children
whom authorities find abandoned in airports, bus stations and on the
streets. It broadcasts their pictures on Central American television
so family members might rescue them.</LD>
<TE>   The boy gives his name to Sara Isela Hernandez Herrera, a
coordinator at the home, but says he does not know how old he is or
where he is from. He says his mother has gone to the United States.
He holds Hernandez's hand with all his might and will not leave her
side. He asks for hugs. Within hours, he begins calling her Mama.</TE>
<TE>   When she leaves work every afternoon, he pleads, in a tiny voice,
for her to stay--or at least to take him with her.</TE>
<TE>   She gives him a jar of strawberry marmalade and strokes his hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a family," he says, sadly. "They are far away."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Ivan Contreras, 12, is from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and
hoping to reach his mother in San Diego. He is like many of the
younger kids on the journey: fearlessly reckless.</TE>
<TE>   Being brave and small can help. Begging, for instance, is easier,
more successful. To Dennis, riding a freight train is like playing on
a jungle gym. Dodging authorities is like a game of cops and robbers.</TE>
<TE>   As his train pulls out of Mapastepec, Mexico, he teaches Jose
Padilla Guerra, 13, a Honduran trying to find his mother in New York,
how to leap between the moving cars. Dennis steps back for a running
start. Then he sprints. Raising his arms like a bird spreading its
wings, he pushes off the end of one of the cars.</TE>
<TE>   He spreads his tiny legs. He flies four feet and lands. Then he
kneels, patting the spot where Jose should land too.</TE>
<TE>   The train shakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't look down," Dennis says. "Never look down. Only look to
where your foot must land. Just look here. Nowhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Jose, a gangly, chatty boy, is too scared.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," Dennis says. "Jump! Jump! It's OK. Stand back and run."</TE>
<TE>   "Wait till it stops shaking so much," Jose says.</TE>
<TE>   The train slows, then creeps to a stop. Now Jose launches, landing
easily.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Gaspar, 12, from Concepcion Huixtla in Guatemala, is
terrified. He sits in a hallway at a Mexican immigration holding tank
in Tapachula.</TE>
<TE>   With a corner of his Charlie Brown T-shirt, he dabs at
tears running down his chin. He is waiting to be deported. His smuggler
left him behind at Tepic, in the western coastal state of Nayarit.
"He didn't see that I hadn't gotten on the train," Francisco says,
between sobs. His short legs kept him from scrambling aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration agents caught him and bused him to Tapachula.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco left Guatemala after his parents died. He pulls a tiny
scrap of paper from a pants pocket with the telephone number of his
Uncle Marcos in Florida. "I was going to the U.S. to harvest chiles,"
he says. "Please help me! Please help me!"</TE>
<TE>   Clutching a handmade cross of plastic beads on a string around his
neck, he leaves his chair and moves frantically from one stranger to
another in the hallway. His tiny chest heaves. His face contorts in
agony. He is crying so hard that he struggles for breath.</TE>
<TE>   He asks each of the other immigrants to help him get back to his
smuggler in Tepic. He touches their hands. "Please take me back to
Tepic! Please! Please!"</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DIYARBAKIR, Turkey</DL>
<LD>A Turkish police official said Sunday that the amount of uranium
seized by officers the day before was about 5 ounces, not 33 pounds
as initially reported.</LD>
<LD>   The state-run Anatolian news agency reported Saturday that
paramilitary police in the southern province of Sanliurfa detained
two men after discovering the uranium in a lead container hidden
beneath a seat in a taxi.</LD>
<LD>   But the amount initially reported had included the weight of the
container, a Sanliurfa police official said. The International Atomic
Energy Agency in Vienna had been skeptical of the amount previously
reported, as it would have been enough to make a nuclear bomb,
spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The Turkish official said the weapons-grade uranium was seized
Friday after police stopped the vehicle in the province, which
borders Syria. The incident comes at a time of heightened tension
between the United States and Iraq--also a neighbor of Turkey.
Washington accuses Baghdad of developing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<HD>Pioneering Law Allowed Filing of Priest Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The 1994 state statute extends time limits for
serious molestation cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In opening criminal cases against four former and retired Roman
Catholic priests last week, Southern California prosecutors are
relying on a 1994 California law that has become a national model for
overcoming legal time limits on decades-old child molestation cases.</LD>
<LD>   Without the law, which was upheld by a sharply divided state
Supreme Court in 1999, the cases against the priests almost certainly
would not have proceeded, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   After the California law was enacted, 40 other states passed
extended time limits to bring charges in cases of sexual abuse of
children. Some of those states now say they did not go far enough and
are seeking even tougher laws to help them prosecute more clergy
abuse cases.</LD>
<TE>   That is most notably true in Massachusetts, where the Boston
archdiocese has been the center of the priest sex abuse scandal. The
California law retroactively lifted the statute of limitations for
cases of serious child molestation. Under the law, prosecutors are
allowed to file criminal charges up to one year after a victim first
reports the abuse to police, regardless of how long ago the crime
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been incredibly useful and very important," said Irene
Wakabayashi, assistant head deputy of the Los Angeles district
attorney's sex crimes division. "Certainly the priest cases we
wouldn't have been able to file without the extended statute of
limitations."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, prosecutors in Los Angeles and Orange counties filed
their first criminal charges against former priests since the sex
scandal broke nine months ago. In Los Angeles, prosecutors charged
Michael Stephen Baker, 54, with 29 counts of molestation, including
oral copulation, against a boy between 1976 and 1985. Baker has not
entered a plea.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged Carlos Rene Rodriguez, 46, with eight counts
of committing lewd acts with a child under age 14 between 1986 and
1987. He has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   A third former Los Angeles priest, G. Neville Rucker, has been
charged with 23 counts of child molestation between 1947 and 1976.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Gerald John Plesetz, 59, was charged with three
counts of oral copulation with a minor under age 16 between 1972 and
1974.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 law shaped the nature of the charges against the former
priests and sets the parameters for their trials.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, prosecutors face three major legal hurdles:</TE>
<TE>   Did they file within one year of the first report to authorities?
Did the alleged acts constitute "substantial sexual conduct"? And is
there "independent evidence that clearly and convincingly
corroborates" the victim's allegations? The corroboration requirement
is intended to eliminate the possibility that a conviction would rest
only on a victim's memory of long-ago events.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Steier, Baker's attorney, has scoffed at the charges
against his client as "creative writing." Among other things, he
said, there is evidence that police had been alerted to Baker's
alleged acts in the late 1980s. That, Steier said, could cause the
case to run afoul of the one-year filing rule.</TE>
<TE>   The question of what constitutes "substantial sexual conduct" is
relatively clear: The law defines it as sodomy, rape, oral copulation
and other acts of penetration. In 1999, it was found to apply to
cases of one person masturbating another, settling a highly disputed
area. The law, however, does not allow prosecution in cases of
statutory rape--that is, cases where the sexual acts would be
considered consensual but for the fact that one party is a minor.</TE>
<TE>   The most heavily challenged area, prosecutors said, has been the
question of corroborating the claims with "clear and convincing"
independent evidence. Photographs, confessions or eyewitness
testimony by someone other than the victim have met that standard of
proof but are not always easy to come by.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, a court ruled that statements by other victims
reporting child molestation by the same perpetrator constituted
sufficient corroboration, Wakabayashi said. As a result, many of the
first criminal cases going forward involve defendants accused by
multiple victims.</TE>
<TE>   Wakabayashi would not comment on whether church officials would be
called to testify. But at least in Baker's case, Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony could be asked to take the stand. Baker told Mahony in 1986
that he had molested boys. Mahony has no shield against testifying
because Baker's statements were not made in a confessional.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, authorities often did not bring criminal cases
against priests, said Larry Drivon, a Fresno attorney who is involved
in more than 150 civil abuse cases spanning every diocese in
California. Officials were often willing to let church officials
handle any problems, believing assurances that the offender would be
removed from children and treated.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think the children will be protected, why would you want
to irritate half the Catholics in town and launch a gigantic mess?"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, the climate has radically changed. As more victims
step forward, the demand to crack down on priestly abusers has
risen--one national poll found that 80% of Americans favored criminal
charges not only against abusive priests, but also bishops who
covered up the crimes. District attorneys in Los Angeles, San
Francisco and many other cities have assigned investigators to work
exclusively on clergy sex abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   California's law gives prosecutors a powerful tool. By contrast,
prosecutors said they are severely hampered in states that did not go
as far as California. In Boston, for instance, Suffolk County
prosecutors have said that they will not be able to prosecute more
than 30 of 50 cases under investigation because the abuse happened
too long ago. Prosecutors there are now calling for the removal of
the statute of limitations for child rape.</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, prosecutors have investigated more than 100 priests
but, according to local news reports, do not expect to be able to
pursue most of the allegations. A 1999 law in Ohio that extended the
statute of limitations from six years to 20 for child molestation
cases was not made retroactive, as the California law was.</TE>
<TE>   California's law grew out of an explosion of public awareness
about sexual abuse that began in the early 1980s, said Nancy
O'Malley, an Alameda County chief assistant district attorney who
chairs the sexual assault committee of the California District
Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that decade, prosecutors had begun to realize that
in many cases, victims were coming forward to report sexual abuse
that happened too long ago to allow prosecution. They lobbied to
change the statute of limitations, O'Malley said, and in the early
1990s, the Legislature agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers "recognized that children don't often come forward with
reports of being abused until much later, either because they're
embarrassed or they don't really realize it was wrong or because they
were threatened by the perpetrator," said Janet Gaard, the special
assistant attorney general who successfully defended the law before
the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The measure sailed through the Legislature but was challenged by
defense lawyers whenever it was used, often on the grounds that it
impermissibly altered the definition of a crime and increased its
punishment after the fact. Because of the challenges, many
prosecutors held off on cases until the state Supreme Court could
give clear guidance, O'Malley said.</TE>
<TE>   The court's 4-3 ruling in 1999 made California the nation's first
jurisdiction to uphold the constitutionality of an extended
statute-of-limitations law.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to several favorable court rulings, Wakabayashi said, the
sharpest areas of dispute over the law now have been "pretty much"
settled. But Steier hinted that he would challenge several as-yet
unexamined aspects of the law, as applied to such areas as evidence
and jury instructions.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole area of law is relatively new," he said.</TE>

<HD>Drug Ballads Hit Sour Notes</HD>
<DH>Music: Officials are trying to ban the Mexican equivalent
of gangsta rap, saying it is a bad influence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be the day the music died.</LD>
<LD>   In an elegant hotel salon, the governor of Baja California
gathered with guests of honor to witness a solemn promise to purge
the state's radio airwaves of "narco-ballads"--songs about narcotics
traffickers--a genre as popular, gory, and hard to banish as gangsta
rap.</LD>
<LD>   "Narco-ballads set a bad example for the younger generation," said
Mario Enrique Mayans Concha, the sober, suited president of the Baja
California chapter of Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television
Industry, who has presided over the 2-month-old ban.</LD>
<TE>   But on a recent night at a crowded Avenida Revolucion hangout, men
in 10-gallon hats, leather dusters and cowboy boots were stamping
their feet and singing along to a narcocorrido about a death match
between a drug lord and a cop.</TE>
<TE>   This is Mexico's latest culture war, unfolding on its newest
front: the cradle of the Tijuana drug cartel.</TE>
<TE>   For the establishment, the enemy is narcocultura, the pop culture
fascination with Mexico's gangster underworld and its overlords.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are tired of seeing reliquaries of the so-called
narco-saint, Jesus Malverde, sold on the steps of the downtown
cathedral. They're tired of seeing the accused Tijuana drug lord
Eduardo Arellano, as photogenic with his tousled good looks as a
jeans model, smiling jauntily back at them from a "Most Wanted"
poster at the U.S. border crossing.</TE>
<TE>   They're irritated that a growing number of young people seem to
know by heart the lyrics of a tune that boasts that "the little
Colombian rock is making me famous."</TE>
<TE>   But can Mexico, a U.S.-certified partner in the war on drugs,
quell a popular regional musical genre with an official scolding?
When senior clergymen called for a government ban this summer on a
Mexican movie about a carnally passionate priest, the film became a
runaway hit.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican regional music, which includes narcocorridos, already
claims slightly more than half of the $600 million a year in U.S.
sales of Latin music--and Los Angeles is a major market.</TE>
<TE>   "Ballads are a tradition in Mexican music, it's true--but ballads
about the heroics of the Mexican Revolution, and other historic
moments," said Mayans, of the radio trade association. "The
narco-ballad is not a tradition."</TE>
<TE>   But narcocorridos are a modern manifestation of a musical
tradition that is as old as Mexico itself. Around the campfires of
the Mexican Revolution, troubadours rallied illiterate soldiers and
peasants with songs about battlefield victories. During Prohibition,
they sang of rum-runners. In modern times, they celebrated heroes
like Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Today they sing of drug lords, with such faithful attention to
headlines that one Tijuana television journalist used a narco-ballad
as the mock narration for news footage of a splashy murder.</TE>
<TE>   It was a particularly grisly drug killing that provided the
catalyst for the movement to ban the ballads, some say.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, masked men with automatic weapons lined up 12
boys and men and gunned them down in El Limoncito, a tiny village in
the Pacific Coast state of Sinaloa--a massacre attributed to a drug
turf war.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, at a broadcasters' convention in Sinaloa, the
birthplace of Mexico's most famous traffickers, radio owners
announced they would no longer play narcocorridos in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "If they could do it there," Mayans reasoned, "there was no reason
we couldn't do it in Baja California."</TE>
<TE>   Last December, the Mexican Senate exhorted states to restrict
narcocorridos, saying the songs "create a virtual justification for
drug traffickers."</TE>
<TE>   Influence on Teens</TE>
<TE>   In January, Chihuahua legislators adopted a nonbinding resolution
asking radio stations not to play the songs, calling them a siren
call to a life of "violence, criminality and drug trafficking" that
"teenagers imitate to the detriment of society."</TE>
<TE>   Consensus in Baja California jelled in July. Broadcasters gathered
in a tastefully understated salon of the Hotel Lucerna and signed the
pact.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an obligation or a censorship. It's voluntary," Mayans
said.</TE>
<TE>   Programmers agreed to support Mexican traditions, and "the
narcocorrido is not a Mexican tradition," he said. "The narcocorrido
is an apology for violence."</TE>
<TE>   But the lingering mystique of the narco-pose was all too evident
on a recent night at the "Cowboy Bar" on Avenida Revolucion in
Tijuana. Onstage, the dashing, mustachioed Roman Coronado sang about
a Mexican federal policeman who defected to work for the drug cartel.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me a line of coke," Coronado sang. "I was once a federal
agent, but it did me no good, because the Mafia was too numerous, and
the police too few."</TE>
<TE>   When four glowering young men swept into the bar, patrons got out
of their way. Waiters tripped over themselves to provide the sullen
quartet with Remy Martin. Women whispered: Who are they?</TE>
<TE>   "It's narco-fashion," acknowledged one of the mystery men, Luis
Esquivel, 23, resplendent in canary yellow ostrich skin boots and a
red leather coat, while his three companions sported black leather
and enough gold jewelry to reduce the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about trying to act like narcos, drug dealers, to get
respect," said Esquivel. "I like to give that impression. You get the
girls' attention right away."</TE>
<TE>   The real life of this electric cowboy is more banal: Esquivel is a
San Diego community college student.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more the younger generation that likes narcocorridos,"
Esquivel said. "It's like rap and hip-hop. A lot of the corridos are
associated with drugs and Mafia in Tijuana ... They see big-time
Mafiosos living a fantasy, doing whatever they want."</TE>
<TE>   Another musician at the bar, Abel Guzman, sings a favorite
narcocorrido, about a drug cartel gunman who is called before his
godfather boss to sputter out his denial of involvement in the
notorious torture-murder of a U.S. anti-drug agent.</TE>
<TE>   "The death of Enrique Camarena is a legend, so it became a
corrido," Guzman explained. "If someone is killed, people write a
corrido about it, and his death becomes history. That's why people
love corridos."</TE>
<TE>   For hard-core fans, paramilitary kitsch seems part of the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The album cover of "Mi Oficio es Matar"--"Killing is My
Business"--shows singer Jesus Palma with a bazooka. Fabian
Ortega--"the Falcon of the Sierra"--dressed up his album cover cowboy
look with an AK47 assault rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Narcocorridos eschew the crowing roosters and barnyard sounds of
ranchera music for more urban atmospherics--sirens, gunfire and
helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Art, Life Intersect</TE>
<TE>   The industry is rife with rumors of relationships between
musicians and traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   Some balladeers have stumbled over the line between art and life,
and become the victims of the violence they portray.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalino Sanchez, a poor Mexican immigrant in Los Angeles, rose to
fame as a narcocorrido star--"Chalino"--whose street "cred" was
enhanced by the pistol he wore in his belt and the gunman who wounded
him onstage near Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, when the 31-year-old singer returned to his home state of
Sinaloa, he disappeared after a concert. His bullet-riddled body
turned up later on a roadside.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later the genre exploded into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, the composers of some of the most memorable
narco-ballads, Los Tucanes of Tijuana, had more hits on the Latin
Billboard chart at the same time than any artist since Selena.
Reviews of Tucanes videos of that era described scenes of a policeman
being shot and another being tortured--presumably by drug
traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   Tucanes' lead singer, Mario Quintero, said the narcocorrido radio
blackout "is not the solution."</TE>
<TE>   "The movie 'Traffic' is like a corrido made into a film, but
obviously you can't prohibit a movie," he said in an e-mail from
Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   "Prohibiting narcocorridos will not solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   But in Baja California, "the problem" is a particularly touchy
subject.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone in high-end Tijuana knows someone with onetime
links to the Arellano Felix crime family.</TE>
<TE>   Priests baptized their children. Businessmen "borrowed" money from
them. Public officials sold land to them. Local families intermarried
with them. And radio stations played songs about their exploits.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems hypocritical that the people who created the market for
narcocorridos, who popularized them, now want people to stop
listening to them," said Victor Clark, the respected director of
Tijuana's private Binational Center for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Prohibiting them will just turn them into the forbidden fruit,"
he said. "Narcocorridos are deeply established now in the popular
culture of northern Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Yet radio stations have gone along with the ban. Some listeners
call in to register their disappointment--but others just tune in to
narcocorridos broadcast from stations north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of stations in Southern California that play
[narcocorridos], and they are high-powered enough to be heard in
Tijuana," lamented Gloria Enciso, of Tijuana's Radio Enciso. "They
should ban narcocorridos from the recording studios."</TE>
<TE>   There's no sign officials will try to remove the forbidden music
from the honky-tonks where it first emerged.</TE>
<TE>   City patriarchs might publicly support the radio initiative, but
more than a few of them own nightclubs where narcocorridos are still
popular--and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Patrons like them. They request them," shrugged Manuel Rodriguez,
30, a waiter at the Cowboy Bar. "It's not the ballads' fault there's
so much drug violence."</TE>

<LD>Authorities on Sunday afternoon evacuated a busy terminal at Los
Angeles International Airport for two hours after an unidentified man
skirted a security checkpoint, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The man went the wrong way through a checkpoint at Terminal 4
about 11:48 a.m. and disappeared into the crowd, prompting officers
to clear the terminal and search it for suspicious activity. The man
was not found, LAPD Officer Jack Richter said.</LD>
<LD>   "They searched and determined there was no threat," Richter said.
The terminal, which serves flights for American and American Eagle
airlines, reopened at 1:50 p.m. Only outbound flights were affected,
an airport spokesman said.</LD>

<HD>Child Center Born on Campus</HD>
<DH>Education: Two student moms attending Cal State Channel
Islands start a day-care program, a proud CSU tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By any measure, on any college campus, this would qualify as a full
load.</LD>
<LD>   In between classes at Cal State Channel Islands, when other
students are hitting the books or snacking on brain food, Christine
Rodrigues and Nicole Manzano chase after children--their own and
those of fellow students.</LD>
<LD>   The young mothers, founders of the Baby Dolphin Childcare Co-op,
take turns feeding the youngsters, changing diapers and putting them
down for naps. They lead them on excursions across the recently
opened campus and ply them with cheese crackers and vanilla wafers to
get them through the day.</LD>
<TE>   And, when they get a minute to breathe, they plot a strategy for
turning the fledgling cooperative into a model child-care center like
those on other college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want this to be something that will be around long after we're
gone," said Manzano, a 22-year-old business major who brings her
1-year-old son, Sebastian, to school with her each day. "It's going
to take a lot of work, but we know we can do it."</TE>
<TE>   They know they can because it has been done on college campuses
across California.</TE>
<TE>   From San Diego to Sonoma, each of the 22 other campuses in the Cal
State University system has a child-care center of some kind, many
launched by parents in the same grass-roots fashion as the one slowly
emerging at the system's newest campus near Camarillo. Those programs
are among approximately 1,800 child-care centers at private and
public colleges nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Within the Cal State system, many of the centers are subsidized in
part by the CSU general fund, Associated Students groups and a mix of
state and federal child-care dollars.</TE>
<TE>   And many have developed reciprocal relationships with teacher
preparation and childhood education programs: The academic programs
provide a steady stream of interns for the centers while giving
students a chance to apply in the real world what they're learning in
class.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, center directors say the campus programs fill a
pressing need for college students, many of whom might veer off track
in their pursuit of higher learning if there weren't someone
available to watch their kids.</TE>
<TE>   "On many of our campuses, our students are nontraditional. They
are older, they work, they've got families and they go to school,"
said Pamela Kisor, director of the child-care center at Cal State Los
Angeles. "Many are also lower-income, so they are struggling with a
lot of pressures. These centers are profoundly important because they
improve access to higher education."</TE>
<TE>   Kisor, who is on the board of the National Coalition for Campus
Children's Centers and serves on a Cal State consortium of child-care
providers, said the need at her center is evidenced by the yearlong
waiting list, which can swell to as many as 100 families.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal State L.A. center was founded in 1968 and is the oldest in
the CSU system. It has the capacity to care for 62 children. But
after a 10-year fund-raising effort, Kisor said capacity is set to
more than double in March when the center unveils a new wing.</TE>
<TE>   The program has come a long way since a handful of student parents
launched the effort to meet their own child-care needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they can do it," Kisor said of the Channel Islands effort,
"because it was done here."</TE>
<TE>   It happened almost by accident at Cal State Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rodrigues and Manzano attended Oxnard College before
transferring to the Camarillo campus, they didn't meet until this
summer, when they attended orientation together. They separately
asked university officials whether child care would be available at
the new campus.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing a potential opportunity, officials put the two women
together and asked them to make their best pitch.</TE>
<TE>   By the start of the school year last month, university officials
had found a room to house the day-care program. The student
development office found a rug to cover the bare floor and provided a
phone. The Associated Students loaned a television and VCR, and has
pledged to funnel some of the proceeds from an upcoming fund-raiser
to the day-care program.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what you're seeing is a genuine effort on the part of the
university to pare down any barriers to education," said Trae Cotton,
director of the university's office of student development. "We don't
want to have a situation where someone says they can't go to school
because they don't have anyone to watch their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as child-care centers go, this one is pretty bare.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigues and Manzano have brought toys, blankets and a video
collection that ranges from the "Best of Sesame Street" to "How the
Grinch Stole Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   And parent Nanette Tobin, a 24-year-old aspiring teacher, dug into
her own pocket to supply the center with nursery rhyme posters and
paper cutouts of whales, octopuses and dolphins, the latter in honor
of the Channel Islands mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not an ideal place for kids, so we had to do something
so they weren't staring at blank walls," said Tobin, who spends every
spare minute she can at the campus with her 7-month-old daughter,
Madison.</TE>
<TE>   Like the handful of other students who take advantage of the
child-care program, Tobin volunteers to staff the center about as
many hours each week as she spends in class and needs someone to
watch her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   But like the other parents, she envisions a day when the program
will be fully funded and staffed full time by child-care providers,
trained to give the best of care to the children of university
students and faculty. And she's glad to be in on the ground floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nice to have her here with me on campus," she said of her
daughter, who is just starting to talk and getting ready to take her
first steps. "I have a two-hour gap between some of my classes.
Instead of just hanging out, I get to come in here, feed her, have
lunch with her and change her diaper. I get to spend real quality
time."</TE>

into a hangar at Hawthorne Municipal Airport on Sunday while taxiing
for takeoff, officials said. One passenger was hospitalized in

<HD>Cap of Silt Seals DDT on Sea Floor</HD>
<DH>Environment: Test sites off Palos Verdes show that burying
portions of a decades-old pesticide dump has worked. EPA looks to
expand project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unprecedented experiment to entomb a giant underwater deposit of
DDT off the Palos Verdes Peninsula under tons of clean sand appears
to be working, according to a study to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the best solution to the continuing DDT pollution in the
region may be to bury more of the decades-old pesticide dump, the
report concludes.</LD>
<LD>   "We are thinking about laying down a layer a foot to a foot and a
half thick," said Frederick K. Schauffler, an environmental engineer
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "This report clearly
shows that, from a technical standpoint, this kind of cap is
feasible."</LD>
<TE>   From 1947 to 1971, Montrose Chemical Corp., near Torrance, which
manufactured DDT, routinely discharged the pesticide into sewers that
flowed into the ocean. Government officials estimate that about 1,800
tons of DDT settled on the sea floor over 17 square miles, fanning
out from White's Point off the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   DDT was widely used as a pesticide to kill mosquitoes until three
decades ago, when it was banned in the United States because of its
destructive effect on birds. DDT causes birds to lay eggs with thin
shells that crack when the birds sit on them to incubate them. Many
birds, including bald eagles, peregrine falcons and pelicans, nearly
became extinct in the 1960s because of the pesticide's long-lasting
effects.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the EPA declared the huge deposit off Palos Verdes a
Superfund site, ranking it among the most hazardous places in the
United States. The area also is contaminated with polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials and others have long hoped that burying the problem
might end its continuing contamination of the Southern California
environment. The pesticide still kills chicks of bald eagles and is
contaminating white croaker and other fish consumed by some families
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the EPA dumped thousands of tons of silt over four
small test areas to see if that could effectively seal the tainted
sediments with a thick layer of mud.</TE>
<TE>   Federal contractors set down a relatively even layer on the ocean
bottom and did so without stirring up much of the hazardous sediment,
the report on the test shows. Aside from a bit of mixing at the
bottom of the dumped silt, the blanket of new material has remained
largely free of DDT residue, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The silt drifted down 140 to 200 feet, landed on the targeted area
and remained in place without drifting off with currents, according
to the report written by 13 engineers for the EPA and U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials now expect to make a formal proposal in mid-2003 to
cover about three square miles of sea floor with clean sediment
dredged from the nearby harbor, Schauffler said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did a foot-and-a-half cap, over three square miles, the
construction cost would be $55 million, based on earlier estimates,"
Schauffler said. "If it is a foot thick, [the cost] would be $37
million."</TE>
<TE>   In a series of legal settlements, Montrose and two other companies
paid about $140 million to help repair Southern California's marine
environment. The money is spread among a number of agencies,
including the EPA, for cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA studies the site to learn what happens to fish, worms, sea
urchins, shrimp and other bottom-dwelling sea creatures buried
beneath tons of silt.</TE>
<TE>   Most become entombed under the silt, creating a temporary oceanic
desert until sea creatures recolonize the area, Schauffler said. A
few sea creatures on the edges of the cap may be able to burrow to
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Such an effect on marine life remains a concern, said Mark Gold,
executive director of the environmental group Heal the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "As this report demonstrates, capping has some promise to reduce
... ecological risks posed by DDT," Gold said. "But there are many
questions left to be answered: What portion of the bottom gets
covered? What happens when you smother local marine life?"</TE>
<TE>   For now, EPA officials are considering blanketing only the 3
square miles of contaminated area on the relatively shallow
continental shelf. This area, from 120 to 300 feet below the surface,
has the heaviest concentration of DDT. Moreover, it is relatively
flat, so it can hold freshly imported silt.</TE>
<TE>   The other 14 square miles of contaminated sediment are on the
deeper continental slope. Engineers believe the slope is too steep
for silt or sand to remain in place, and thus recommend against
trying the technique.</TE>
<TE>   Still, scientists and engineers believe that covering the
3-square-mile shelf could seal off most of the stubborn DDT compounds
that persist in the environment.</TE>
<TE>   If such a cap of silt doesn't work, experts don't know how else to
protect the environment and public health, because dredging up the
sediments could create more problems than it would solve.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the problem," Gold said. "I don't know if it is possible
to dig up sediment at that depth.</TE>
<TE>   "But the risk of bringing up all of those contaminants would allow
DDT to spill out into the environment all over again."</TE>

<HD>Eastsiders Think Valley's Grass Is Already Greener</HD>
<DH>Secession: Many residents of poor part of L.A. don't
support a split, fearing it would further marginalize their
neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To many residents of Los Angeles neighborhoods east of downtown, the
San Fernando Valley already is Camelot, a proposed name for a new
municipality north of Mulholland Drive. So is Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish I could afford to live in those communities," said Martha
Garcia, a 32-year-old mother in El Sereno who was bused from the
Eastside to attend school in the Valley. "They have a right to
improve their communities, but I think they're already nice,
especially compared to here."</LD>
<LD>   Eastside sympathy exists for Valley and Hollywood secession bids
on the Nov. 5 ballot. But for those living in places such as El
Sereno, Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights, their needs come first.</LD>
<TE>   "The city ignores our community," said Hugo Garcia (no relation to
Martha Garcia), 47, an L.A. native who will vote against secession.
"We have to look after ourselves because the city doesn't do a good
job."</TE>
<TE>   The Eastside is home to mostly Latinos, a group viewed by both
sides in the breakaway campaign as a swing vote. Secessionists claim
that splitting Los Angeles into three cities and bringing government
closer to neighborhoods would give Latinos more clout in each of the
municipalities. Opponents, however, say secession could cause
financial strains that would rob Latinos of essential services.</TE>
<TE>   Many Eastsiders said they hadn't heard of the cityhood
initiatives. Nor is the breakup campaign a priority, they added.</TE>
<TE>   "[We] struggle for basic services," Hugo Garcia said. "And
respect."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the El Sereno Recreation Center, he said. The park's tidy
patch of grass for baseball and football games is tiny compared with
the open spaces at other city parks, including those in the Valley.
The sprawling Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park, for example, boasts
separate fields for baseball, Little League and soccer, as well as
basketball courts and picnic areas. Parents say El Sereno's park is
so cramped that children get hurt bumping into each other.</TE>
<TE>   Because there are few benches at the park, Hugo Garcia brought a
blue portable chair so he could watch his teenage daughter jump, flip
and clap during a cheering squad practice on a hot autumn night. He
leaped out of the chair in a huff and pointed to the sloping dirt
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I mean," he said. "We've been trying for years--for
years--to get the city to pave it."</TE>
<TE>   The untamed lot is on a long list of problems cited by Eastsiders.
Graffiti defaces stores, homes and bus stops. Tattered sofas and
soiled mattresses line sidewalks. Gangs run rampant. Poverty deflates
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a community where families stay for generations, in
charming bungalows on tree-lined streets graced with children's
laughter. Statues of the Virgin Mary adorn lawns. Neighbors not only
know each other, they often celebrate life's milestones together, as
if they were an extended family.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Valley secessionists have complained that the city
allocates funds to impoverished neighborhoods on the Eastside and in
South Los Angeles at the expense of the blighted northeast Valley,
one of the poorest communities in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Now they argue that a smaller Los Angeles would benefit needy
neighborhoods across the city, by making government smaller and more
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "People could take better control of City Hall," said Richard
Close, a Sherman Oaks homeowner and chairman of Valley VOTE, the
group spearheading Valley secession. "They'd have more contact with
council members."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists plan to hold forums in East Los Angeles, but Close
said the campaign's emphasis will be on communities with high voter
turnout. Traditionally, Eastside turnout is lower than in other parts
of L.A., city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The secession measures need citywide majorities to win.</TE>
<TE>   Breakaway proponents expressed optimism that all of L.A.'s Latino
communities will show their support on election day, especially since
Latinos are running for council offices in the proposed cities. Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante's endorsement of an independent Hollywood also
helped, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "East Los Angeles understands," said Gene La Pietra, founder of
the Hollywood secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos make up 49% of Hollywood's residents and would wield more
power if the area became its own city, La Pietra said. "That
translates into the Eastside's support."</TE>
<TE>   The Eastside has one staunch breakup supporter: Don Levy, 65, a
white lifelong L.A. resident who lives in an arts colony complex in
Lincoln Heights. The Web designer said the city's bureaucrats ignore
the housing and business needs of the artistic community.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe City Hall can be fixed," Levy said. "I have yet
to be convinced that [officials] can get rid of their old habits."</TE>
<TE>   Other Eastsiders, however, fear the secession movement is being
led by wealthy whites who have no interest in less-affluent
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "[Secessionists] say it has nothing to do with race or class,"
said Martha Garcia, who will vote against secession. "But I think it
does. A lot of us do."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's recent move to El Sereno was a big step up from the
"ghetto lifestyle" she and her two children endured while living near
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   But already the L.A. native dreams of leaving the Eastside,
perhaps for the nearby San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The city doesn't care about us," Garcia said. "I don't like this
area anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Maldonado, relaxing with friends at El Sereno park on a
Thursday evening, also wants out of the Eastside. She's 52 and has
lived in the area since she was born.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the fact that the city hasn't paved the parking lot shows
that they don't care as much here as they do in, say, the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado wondered why anyone in her community would vote for
secession. She believes a split would leave less city money for the
Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just going to hurt us more," Maldonado said.</TE>

<HD>Blaze Still Keeps Many From Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Williams fire in Angeles National Forest continued to fade under
soggy skies Sunday, but hundreds of Mount Baldy Village residents
remained off the mountain as fire officials warned of possible
flare-ups.</LD>
<LD>   The wildfire, which has burned 36,160 acres and led to the park's
temporary closure, was 80% contained by Sunday evening. Once burning
on three fronts, the weeklong blaze has been reduced to one fire head
about 1 1/2 miles west of the village.</LD>
<LD>   That front smoldered Sunday under a low pressure system that
brought drizzle and high humidity. Firefighters, meanwhile, continued
working on a fire break to protect the town in case the flames
continued to advance.</LD>
<TE>   Fire officials said the blaze may be fully contained by Tuesday,
but added that conditions are still volatile. More than 2,000
firefighters remain in the forest, and officials said it was too
early to lift the evacuation order for the town's estimated 900
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be lulled into complacency," San Bernardino County Fire
Capt. James Wilkins said. "The threat is not imminent, but the
weather could change."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze began Sept. 22 near Williams Canyon in the San Gabriel
Mountains and quickly spread south and east, at one point stretching
11 miles across the forest's steep canyons and dense woods. The cause
of the blaze is still unknown, though investigators have ruled out
campfires and barbecues as a source. The injury toll reached seven on
Sunday, but no injury was life threatening.</TE>
<TE>   In Mount Baldy Village, the evacuation has prompted complaints
from many residents who have been unable to return to their homes
since being told to leave Tuesday night. Many say the evacuation
order has been enforced unevenly, with some being allowed to stay in
the village.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said about 100 people have stayed behind, vowing to
protect their homes themselves. In such cases, there is little that
law enforcement can do, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't slap cuffs on people and drag folks from their homes.
That's not what the Forest Service is about," said Jonetta Holt, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Pediatric Health Programs to Get $28 Million of
County's Prop. 10 Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than $28 million in tobacco tax money has been earmarked for
local pediatric health programs that will be administered jointly by
UCI Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The money from the Childrens and Families Commission of Orange
County will target prenatal care and the health of children 5 and
younger. The funds will be used in a variety of ways--from community
clinics to efforts to diagnose and treat autism, asthma and metabolic
disorders.</LD>
<LD>   ''Our mission is to ensure that children are healthy and ready to
learn when they start school,'' said Mike Ruane, executive director
of the commission, which is responsible for allocating revenue
generated by Proposition 10 throughout Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The 1998 state ballot measure added a 50-cent sales tax to tobacco
products, with the money to be used to promote early childhood
development.</TE>
<TE>   Since February 2000, the commission has given nearly $67 million
to programs dealing with families and children in Orange County. The
$28.5 million that will flow to the UCI-CHOC nonprofit partnership is
part of $81 million that will be allocated over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing pediatric experts from the two institutions together is
in itself a huge step, commission officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The effort will funnel $3 million to allow expansion of UCI's
autism clinic; $3.7 million to helping children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder; $2.8 million for a center to treat
asthma and chronic lung disease; and $8.7 million to expand pediatric
clinics run by both hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The programs are ''in some cases embryonic, in some cases doing
OK, and in some cases already good,'' said Dr. Stanley Pappelbaum, a
consultant for the commission. ''This [money] takes it to a different
level.''</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $2 million will go to develop a program to diagnose and
treat metabolic disorders--complex genetic abnormalities that can
cause disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   An early diagnosis of a chronic health problem will help schools,
where health issues often become serious learning issues.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, with asthma, if it's not managed and diagnosed
properly, the child will not be able to concentrate in class at all,"
Ruane said.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are expected to know more ... than they were just a
couple of years ago," he said. "There's an enormous need to improve
the health care system to achieve the kind of school performance that
the public expects from the educational system."</TE>

<LD>Educational psychologist Jessica Revill loves teaching at Cal State
Los Angeles, inspired by the chance to help struggling students,
often the first in their families to attend college.</LD>
<LD>   But the California State University system, she says, doesn't love
her back.</LD>
<LD>   Revill was rehired to teach three courses this fall quarter. But
on the basis of her experience over the last two years, she doubts
she'll get her own computer or even a listing in the online campus
phone directory. As for faculty meetings, forget it--she's never been
invited.</LD>
<TE>   Revill belongs to the growing, and increasingly testy, tier of
perkless PhDs and other teachers known as lecturers. They are the
teaching workhorses of the university world who often don't receive
the pay, benefits, security or prestige of tenured or tenure-track
faculty.</TE>
<TE>   In California, their long-held grievances have broken into the
open.</TE>
<TE>   Unionized lecturers staged a one-day strike last month at UC
Berkeley, and two-day walkouts are planned for Riverside, San Diego,
Santa Cruz, Davis and possibly other UC campuses on Oct. 14 and 15.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 23-campus California State University system
released a plan this month to reverse a lecturer-hiring binge and
instead bring more faculty members into the tenure pipeline. The
plan, initiated by the California Faculty Assn., reflects the rising
clout of lecturers in the union, which represents both tenure-track
and non-tenure-track teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-education experts say the lecturers' struggle for greater
status has major implications, because lecturers often teach
students' introductory courses--the students' first taste of college
and unfamiliar fields of knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   If teaching jobs increasingly are treated by colleges as temporary
employment, "we really run the risk of creating a pipeline problem
that discourages people from entering the profession," said Ronald G.
Ehrenberg, director of Cornell University's Higher Education Research
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time, non-tenure-track faculty--almost non-existent 30 years
ago--accounted for 54.1% of new full-time hires at two- and four-year
schools in 1999, according to research by Jack Schuster, a professor
of education and public policy at Claremont Graduate University.</TE>
<TE>   These types of appointments are everywhere, "at public and private
and all types of institutions," Schuster said. "The high-end,
high-quality institutions are by no means immune."</TE>
<TE>   Flexibility and Diversity</TE>
<TE>   College administrators say lecturers give them flexibility and
bring diverse backgrounds and teaching skills that enrich academia.</TE>
<TE>   "The teaching provided by lecturers is very high quality," said
Jackie R. McClain, a CSU vice chancellor for human resources, and
they give campuses the ability to add extra class sections "at the
last minute when we have enrollment surges."</TE>
<TE>   Both universities and tenured faculty also like lecturers because
they free up professors to do research--bringing money and prestige
to the individuals and the institutions.</TE>
<TE>   And lecturers cost less. At the University of California, for
example, tenured or tenure-track professors last year made an average
of $93,754, versus $45,519 for lecturers, including some who have
taught for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, tenure-track professors often have vastly different
qualifications. Top researchers with degrees from elite universities
find it far easier to land tenure-track jobs than do
teaching-oriented PhDs from less-acclaimed institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very limited market for great teachers, but there is a
national market for great researchers," Ehrenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some lecturers aren't looking for tenure or even full-time
employment. They do the work for a little extra income, the love of
teaching or to gain experience.</TE>
<TE>   The more fortunate win titles such as "senior lecturer" and
receive better benefits and longer-term contracts, though nothing
like the career-long security of a tenured position.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they are interested in tenure or not, they often see
themselves as the educational underclass.</TE>
<TE>   "The academic life is as carefully ranked as military life," said
essayist Joseph Epstein, who for 23 years was editor of the American
Scholar, a quarterly journal published by the Phi Beta Kappa Society.
"The lecturer is comparable in some ways to the warrant officer. He's
a little bit out of the chain of command."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, himself a part-time lecturer at Northwestern University
since 1973 and author of the recently published book "Snobbery: The
American Version," said he never has pursued a tenured job. "I've had
a base salary, benefits, and I could get a lot of writing done," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he couldn't help noticing lecturers' second-tier status,
especially the way they are saddled with introductory and low-level
courses that some professors disdain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of anyone saying, 'This table is for full professors
only,' " Epstein said, but tenured professors nonetheless sometimes
regard lecturers with "mild contempt."</TE>
<TE>   "The more 'academic' a person is, the more quietly disdainful that
person is likely to be about lecturers who are not at the top of this
greasy pole."</TE>
<TE>   Revill, 39, as a part-time lecturer, is near the bottom of the
pole, despite her PhD from UCLA. Etched in her memory is a comment
from a tenured professor who absent-mindedly told her that, if
academics don't have full-time jobs within a couple of years of
finishing graduate school, "you know they're just no good."</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of have to take those comments on the chin," Revill
said.</TE>
<TE>   'Kiss of Death'</TE>
<TE>   The longer a lecturer remains in a non-tenure-track job, the
harder it can be to move up. If you want tenure, "it's the kiss of
death if you're a lecturer, and it's worse the longer you stay," said
Robert A. Hennig, a full-time lecturer beginning his sixth year
teaching at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Hennig said his colleagues in the political science department
treat him cordially, and recognize that no one else on campus shares
his specialty on the American judicial system.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, he often feels isolated from the campus'
intellectual life. If he wants to attend professional conferences, he
pays his own way, unlike tenured professors and even graduate
students, who sometimes get travel money from the university.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a hired employee, not really a colleague," Hennig said.</TE>
<TE>   This after years of training. Hennig has PhDs in both
jurisprudence and social policy and a law degree from UC Berkeley's
prestigious Boalt Hall.</TE>
<TE>   To supplement his salary of $48,000 a year from UCLA, Hennig has
tended bar to help pay off his college loans.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after five years of giving lectures to 1,000 or more students
a year, he is tired and unsure he even wants to wage the battle for
tenure. He's thinking about leaving academia.</TE>
<TE>   The lecturers' plight is evident even at Ivy League universities
such as Cornell.</TE>
<TE>   "In a research university, all of the status goes to the
tenure-track faculty, and everybody else are peons," said Rita Calvo,
who holds a PhD in microbiology from Cornell and has taught as a
part-time lecturer at the Ithaca, N.Y., university for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When you do a good job ... and the university gives lip service
to teaching undergraduates, it's a little insulting to be treated
like a peon when you get to my age."</TE>
<TE>   The winner of a national teaching award and another from Cornell,
the 60-year-old Calvo said she "fell into teaching, because it worked
with my kids' schedule, and I found that I really liked it and that
I'm good at it ... [but] I would have never gotten a tenure-track job
at Cornell because research isn't my particular thing."</TE>
<TE>   Insecurity is part of the package, even for Calvo, who had enjoyed
a series of five-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   She was told last year that she would not get another five-year
deal and that, after next year, she would no longer have a teaching
position. Though initially stung by the decision, she now accepts it
philosophically.</TE>
<TE>   In private industry, "almost nobody has job security," she said.
"It's only an issue [on campus] because tenured faculty have job
security, no matter how good or bad a job they do after they've
gotten tenure. A lecturer, no matter how good a job she does, may or
may not continue to be retained."</TE>
<TE>   The underlying grievances in an ongoing labor dispute within the
UC system are this lack of job security and, to a lesser extent, pay.
Lecturers have been working without a new union contract for more
than two years and negotiations have bogged down.</TE>
<TE>   UC lecturers typically work on one-year or one-term contracts
until they have six years of experience. If they pass the six-year
mark, they are entitled to three-year contracts, but the union
complains that many lecturers are let go just before reaching that
threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Lecturers with CSU campuses have had similar complaints, but a
contract approved this spring boosted the chances of moving into jobs
with three-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   CSU also has pledged to seek state funding to boost the ratio of
tenure-track faculty. The  plan unveiled this month would, over eight
years, boost the share of teaching jobs filled by tenure-track
faculty to 75%, up from 63.8% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Experts such as Schuster are worried that, along with deterring
the most talented candidates from going into academia, the increased
reliance on lecturers also inhibits academic freedom. They question
whether lecturers hired on a contract basis are as likely to speak
freely about sensitive social issues.</TE>
<TE>   Although many students don't recognize the difference between
tenured professors and lecturers, some say the disparity affects
their college experience.</TE>
<TE>   John C. Williams, a 32-year-old psychology student at Cal State
Los Angeles, said he appreciates lecturers because "sometimes they're
a little more enthusiastic, less dogmatic." But Williams said it
often is difficult to develop strong relationships with non-tenured
lecturers because they spend less time on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenure-track professors seem to be around all of the time,
whereas it's kind of hard to get a hold of non-tenured people," he
said. "They seem to shuffle around."</TE>

<HD>Praise for a Worthy Pioneer</HD>
<DH>Medals: Jean Garr is honored for her role in two
battles--one against cancer, the other as a WAVE in WWII.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While keeping bedside vigil after his mother's third cancer surgery
last spring, Bill Garr just kept thinking to himself: "This woman
deserves a medal."</LD>
<LD>   Turns out 80-year-old Jean Claire Garr deserved two medals and a
pin.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by a circle of family and friends, standing proud
before Navy Lt. Darriel Groen, Garr received the three military
honors she never collected after World War II: The Victory Medal, a
medal for Distinguished Service in the American Campaign and an
Honorable Service lapel pin.</LD>
<TE>   "On behalf of the U.S. Navy, it is my honor to award these honors
to Yeoman 1st Class Jean Garr," Groen announced as Garr teared up and
her husband of 58 years said, "She's one tough cookie, isn't she?"</TE>
<TE>   The medals that were pinned to Garr on Saturday night at a
celebration in Sierra Madre were given to every World War II
serviceman with an honorable discharge.</TE>
<TE>   But Garr was no serviceman. She was member of a small but bold
corps of women who responded to emergency legislation in 1942 signed
by President Franklin Roosevelt, allowing women to enlist in the
Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the WAVES, short for Women Accepted for Voluntary
Emergency Service, Garr was one of about 86,000 women who held an
array of jobs in the States, mainly clerical positions, but some
worked as control tower operators, postal clerks, mechanics,
draftsmen and intelligence analysts. They filled posts normally held
by sailors who were needed overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just one of the girls who went to work at a desk so that a
man could be freed up to fight," Garr said, recalling her three years
of service as a secretary to a Navy captain and a commander based at
Treasure Island in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, she is surprised that her son and daughter would be
interested enough in her service record to find her discharge papers
in the family safe deposit box and contact Rep. David Dreier (R-San
Dimas) to help collect her medals.</TE>
<TE>   Medals were something "you just didn't think about" after the war,
she said, adding that she never bothered to collect hers. Her
children's only piece of memorabilia has been an 8-by-10 grainy
reprint of Garr's smiling military photograph, a black-and-white
portrait of a 22-year-old woman in a blue uniform jacket, light brown
hair pinned back, a thick cascade of chin-length curls in the back.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it would be a good opportunity to learn and
travel," she said. "We all knew that something had to be done, and
this is what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Garr's is a story that is common among this group of World War II
women, who six decades later Naval historians and others call the
pioneers for enlisted women today.</TE>
<TE>   "Those women of World War II, they just don't feel that what they
did was any big deal," said Barb Turner, president of the National
WAVES organization. She estimates there are 10,000 World War II WAVES
still alive, and her organization is working to collect their oral
histories.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no idea that what they did back then paved the way for
all who followed," said Turner, who served in the Navy from 1975 to
1996.</TE>
<TE>   It was the WAVES' work at 900 Navy installations in the United
States that gave women their first entry into military work apart
from nursing.</TE>
<TE>   Garr recalled boarding a train alone for a Naval training school
in Milledgeville, Ga., where the Navy had set up a yeoman school at
the former Georgia State College for Women. "We could take one
suitcase, but that's all we needed. They gave us our uniforms and
everything else," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers the women's version of boot camp: up at predawn
hours, perfectly made beds, and uniform and dormitory inspections.
She learned to march, salute and how to address higher-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Then she was off to Hunter College in New York for more training.
"They taught us all about ships, the port, the starboard. We had to
know all about the Navy and all their terminology for our work."</TE>
<TE>   She remembers the last name of the commander she worked for, but
can't remember how to spell it. But she can tell you how to properly
align carbon paper so that it doesn't slip in the typewriter.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the World War II WAVES made up 55% of the Navy staff
in Washington, D.C., 75% of personnel at the Navy's Washington
communication center and handled 80% of the service's mail, said
Capt. John Pruitt, commanding officer of the Naval Air Station at
Pensacola, Fla., during a recent speech at a WAVES convention.</TE>
<TE>   "Joining the Navy was a very socially daring thing for a woman to
do at the time, even as a WAVE," said Jack Green, historian and
curator at the Naval Historical Center.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sight of Jean Smith in her perfect Navy blue uniform
stepping off the train in San Fransico that caught the eye of Bill
Garr.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very strong-willed girl. Period," said Bill Garr, who
worked at a San Francisco-area shipyard during the war. "We didn't
want to wait," he said. They married in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Garr became a horse-racing radio announcer, working the Santa
Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar circuits. Jean became, as Bill
said, "The Queen of Bradbury," establishing her own real estate
brokerage company in the town of Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Sierra Madre, the Garr kids, Bill Jr. and Jeannie,
always knew there was something military about their mom. Jean had to
fold her bedsheets in right angles. Bill remembers breakfast being
served promptly at 7:30 a.m. The car departed for school at exactly 8
a.m. He remembers his mom coaching him during track meets to fight
and never give up.</TE>
<TE>   Bill said his wife found it easy to navigate the business of real
estate in the 1970s, feeling confident working mainly among men.</TE>
<TE>   Garr received one other medal Saturday, this made for her by Dr.
Richard Nalick for "Victory Over Cancer, Strength and Courage." He
placed it around her neck like an Olympian. Two years ago, Garr was
told she had six months to live.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think the military gave her a certain strength and
constitution, a will to live," said her husband, who deep in his
wallet still carries the original snapshot of his bride in uniform,
the family' keepsake of their World War II WAVE.</TE>
<TE>   "To my sweet husband, with all my love," she wrote in 1944.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Holds Hollywood Attention at Gala</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Democratic leaders and their Hollywood allies gathered for a
gala fund-raiser Sunday night to finance their party's efforts to
take back the House of Representatives, an event that also
highlighted consternation among Democrats about the Bush
administration's push for a war against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The reception and concert at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, which
raised $6 million for key congressional races, was punctuated with
references to the possibility of military action.</LD>
<LD>   As donors milled around the ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland
complex, many said they were not convinced that the United States
should go to war.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm afraid of Saddam Hussein. I think he's a very dangerous man,"
said actress Lesley Ann Warren. "And yet I am very concerned about
our country initiating war in the face of a lot of the rest of the
world not aligning with us."</TE>
<TE>   The topic has fueled debate among Democrats in the last several
weeks, with leaders expressing various degrees of caution about
attacking Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, former Vice President Al Gore opposed unilateral
military action. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle accused President
Bush of politicizing the debate.</TE>
<TE>   The split among Democrats about how to respond to Bush's call for
action against Hussein was on display at the gala, which featured
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt and a performance by Barbra
Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Streisand sent Gephardt a memo urging the Democratic
leadership to "go on the offensive" and to strongly question the Bush
administration's motives for military action.</TE>
<TE>   "I find bringing the country to the brink of war unilaterally five
weeks before an election questionable and very frightening,"
Streisand said during a pause in a song, drawing wild applause from
the audience of 3,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt, who spoke after her, called Streisand a "good citizen"
and said he wished everyone was as "patriotic and well meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Before the concert, Gephardt said Democratic leaders had been
speaking out every day about Iraq, and would be increasingly vocal in
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been particularly destructive for the president to
say that the Democrats are not interested in national security," he
added. "That is dragging politics into security issues, and I think
it's immoral."</TE>
<TE>   Several present said they hoped Gephardt and other Democratic
leaders would voice more opposition to a war.</TE>
<TE>   Donor Janina Pawlowski said she believed Bush does not have the
country's best interests at heart in advocating military action.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democratic leaders fear to question the president's
motives, she added. "Anyone who has, up to this point, has been
viewed or criticized as being anti-American. So it's a tough period."</TE>
<TE>   Some donors, however, said Hussein might be too great a threat to
ignore.</TE>
<TE>   "Just imagine," said scientist Marek Konopanicki, "what would have
happened if somebody had the guts to stop Hitler before he became too
strong."</TE>

Los Angeles Police Department, he will send that man into an agency
beset by issues as straightforward as rising crime and as persistent
as a disciplinary system that officers dismiss as capricious and
unfair.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, three civilian monitors have been sent to study
the LAPD--Michael Cherkasky, who analyzes the department's compliance
with a federal consent decree; Jeffrey Eglash, who serves as
inspector general to the Police Commission; and Merrick Bobb, who has
been tapped for special projects by the commission. All three have
gained access to LAPD officers and records often denied to outsiders;
as such, they have a more complete view than most civilians ever
receive of the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   In interviews and in recent reports, the three have detailed a web
of issues confronting the LAPD that will greet the department's next
chief. Their comments go well beyond Hahn's concerns--the mayor has
identified crime, community policing, compliance with federally
mandated reforms, morale, recruitment and retention as the
department's principal issues--and suggest that pockets of resistance
to change within the LAPD will confront the new chief's efforts to
turn around the department.</LD>
<TE>   All three department watchdogs identify similar problems: The gang
units are in disarray at a time when violence is skyrocketing;
efforts to identify and track problem officers are bogged down in
bureaucratic indecision; and dozens of court-mandated reforms are
being dismissed by some officers as frivolous and unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Those and other observations culled from the recent work of the
civilian monitors lend credence to the conclusions of Hahn and his
Police Commission that the LAPD is deeply troubled, not merely
suffering from a temporary loss of leadership. They also underscore
why Hahn and others have identified the selection of the next chief
as the most important decision that Hahn will have made since taking
office last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a culture of the department that needs to be addressed
by the new chief," Eglash said. "We want to see a department that is
more open, that works well with other parts of government, that is
more responsive to civilian leadership and is community-oriented."</TE>
<TE>   But achieving reform will not be easy, Bobb said.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD, to a large degree, is a broken and demoralized
organization," said Bobb, who was a lawyer for the Christopher
Commission, which recommended widespread changes in the LAPD after
the 1991 Rodney King beating. "The next chief needs to reverse the
long-standing culture at the top of the LAPD that has kept senior
management insular, aloof, arrogant and uninterested or belittling of
what anyone outside the LAPD thinks or does."</TE>
<TE>   Department Grumbling</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has been less specific in his charge for his new chief, but
the mayor, who served for 16 years as city attorney before being
elected to the city's top office in 2001, has repeatedly said that he
sees the need to implement the requirements of the federal consent
decree and the need to fight crime as consistent goals.</TE>
<TE>   That is a notion that is privately disputed within some quarters
of the LAPD, where officers have grumbled that so much attention is
placed on rooting out problems in the department that it distracts
from the mission of reducing crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor recognizes that we have to have leadership that does
not see reform as independent but as a step toward improving public
safety," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook, Hahn's spokesman. "They
go hand in hand."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn spent the weekend weighing whether to give the job to former
New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, former
Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney or Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said that in interviews last week the finalists outlined very
different approaches to achieve his goals. He said all three are
"outstanding" individuals--each possessing the skills necessary to
address the department's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky, Bobb and Eglash echo Hahn's concerns that the
department needs to do a better job of fighting crime and improving
morale. In interviews and in their reports, all three also place
great emphasis on the need to change the culture of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three department watchdogs, Bobb has been tracking the LAPD
problems the longest. He was the deputy general counsel to a
commission--headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher--that recommended sweeping reforms in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Bobb has worked on a number of specific projects for
the department, including conducting a study on the department's
progress five years after the Christopher Commission released its
recommendations. His work at the LAPD and the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department has helped create the field of civilian police
monitoring, and Bobb now consults with agencies throughout the nation
and even in some foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   'The Blue Curtain'</TE>
<TE>   Bobb said the next chief must help officers understand that
fighting crime and providing "effective and respectful" policing go
hand in hand. He also wants the department to "drop the blue curtain
so that the LAPD becomes transparent and subject to better informed
critique and evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   "The games of 'cat and mouse,' 'hide the ball,' and 'don't give
out information unless as a last resort' must end," Bobb said.</TE>
<TE>   Eglash, who has in the past struggled to obtain access to
information needed for his audits of the department, agreed that the
department must become more open. Eglash has frequently criticized
disciplinary findings and processes at the LAPD, concluding that the
department has mishandled some recent cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a chief who is skilled in community relations and in
labor relations--who can forge constructive relations with the
league, the command staff, the Police Commission, other components of
city government and the public," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky, who was appointed by a federal judge more than a year
ago to track the LAPD's compliance with the federal consent decree,
declined to comment on the challenges facing the new chief. Bratton
was a member of Cherkasky's monitoring team until he announced that
he was interested in becoming chief. However, Cherkasky has issued
several reports detailing the department's challenges.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent study, Cherkasky found that the department was having
difficulty identifying problem officers because it was missing
"significant red flags" due to understaffing of internal affairs
units and a serious backlog of uncompleted audits.</TE>
<TE>   He also said LAPD officials have failed to analyze data collected
on pedestrian and motor vehicle stops to determine whether the LAPD
engages in "racial profiling." Meantime, the department produced
audits on excessive force and other topics that the monitor concluded
were "seriously flawed."</TE>
<TE>   The area that may pose the deepest challenge for the new chief,
however, emerges from Cherkasky's analysis of the LAPD's
receptiveness to change. Even now, almost two years since the city
entered into an agreement with the federal government to make
sweeping changes in the ways the Police Department operates, some
high-ranking members of the department continue to belittle that
effort, Cherkasky recently concluded.</TE>
<TE>   While on one level that is personally insulting to Cherkasky, it
also, he argues, reflects a deeper resistance to change and to
civilian control of the city's police force--a resistance that he
contends extends to the highest ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that greater commitment, accountability and leadership
are required to achieve the reforms called for by the consent
decree," Cherkasky wrote in a report issued last month. "This must
begin with the command staff and filter down to supervisors and
ultimately to the officers on the street."</TE>

<HD>Church Starts Building, With Blessing</HD>
<DH>Growth: Congregation persuades neighbors to allow
construction on site where other developers failed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every Sunday morning for a decade, Glenn Kirby has preached in
a rented elementary school auditorium and exhorted worshipers to
believe that one day they would raise an edifice of their own.</LD>
<LD>   That vision appeared to come into sharp focus Sunday as Kirby's
400-member congregation broke ground for the $10-million West Valley
Christian Church and Schools at the former site of the Trafficanda
Egg Ranch in West Hills.</LD>
<LD>   While neighbors of the ranch on Sherman Way at Shoup Avenue fought
other development plans for the site--including a self-storage
facility, an apartment complex and two-story townhomes--they gave the
church and school project their blessing.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbors said that's because the church involved residents in the
planning process long before it purchased the property or requested
land-use permits from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle," said Kirby, the senior minister of the West
Hills congregation. "This is a cooperative effort between the seller,
neighbors, city officials and the church and school."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes were high for everyone involved. Residents opposed any
development that would bring traffic and noise to their neighborhood.
West Valley Christian was forced to find a new home for its church
and schools after the Los Angeles Unified School District announced
in January that it would not renew the church's leases at the former
Enadia Way and Highlander Road elementary schools in West Hills. And
Trafficanda Egg Ranch was desperate for a buyer after three previous
deals collapsed because of neighborhood opposition.</TE>
<TE>   For the Trafficandas, the property has been a family heirloom for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Joe and Marie Trafficanda began the ranch, which featured
clucking chickens that laid eggs right before customers' eyes.
Profits from egg sales helped the Trafficandas raise four children,
who became equal partners in the business after their parents died.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the chickens are gone and the operation has moved to Van
Nuys, where other ranchers drop off their eggs for the Trafficandas
to distribute to retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   The younger generation put the 2.5-acre property on the market
more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For area residents, the proposals that came in to build
multifamily housing and storage facilities only meant adding more
brick and mortar to an area that was once the province of horse
ranches, dairy farms and citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread throughout the community in July 2000 that the
Trafficandas were seeking a variance to build a 1,200-unit storage
facility on the parcel, which is zoned for agricultural use, a
loosely organized group of homeowners banded together to fight that
plan and later ones.</TE>
<TE>   "The developers' way of doing things is that they come in and tell
you what they have to have," said Ray Price, a leader of the
homeowners' group. "Then they get their high-powered attorneys to
tell you, 'This is the way we are going to do it.' It's a David and
Goliath case from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   For West Valley Christian, the reality that the congregation could
be without a home when the church's leases expired on July 1, 2003,
lit a fire under a group that had been looking for a permanent
facility off and on for 10 years, Kirby said.</TE>
<TE>   West Valley Christian had considered a 2.5-acre property owned by
another church next to the egg ranch, Kirby said, but dropped out of
escrow when West Valley Christian leaders agreed that the property
was too small to meet their needs.</TE>
<TE>   The Trafficandas then acquired the church property next to their
ranch and put the entire 5-acre parcel on the market last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the neighbors told us about the 5 acres that were
available and that we should try to get them," Kirby said.</TE>
<TE>   But before approaching the Trafficandas, Kirby said, a church
committee met with neighborhood leaders, who then endorsed the
preliminary plan. They continued to meet regularly throughout the 10
months it took to close the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "The big difference is that Glenn came into our neighborhood with
an open mind and a willingness to compromise," Price said. "His
attitude was, 'How can we make this project neighborhood-friendly?'
This was a textbook case of how a developer should come into a
neighborhood and work with everyone."</TE>
<TE>   The Trafficandas said they were pleased with the sale. "It's a
good outcome," said Paul Trafficanda, a family spokesman. "The church
and school will be good for the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kirby and his congregation, they have been rejoicing since
late last week when the sale cleared escrow. The project, to be built
in three phases, will include a 500-seat sanctuary, administrative
offices, a gymnasium and classroom buildings for 500 students in
preschool through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase--which will include construction of a
20,000-square-foot education building with classrooms, offices and
restrooms and the remodeling of an existing 200-seat church--is
expected to be completed by July 1.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Looks to Renovate Complex</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Council considers a $3.58-million subsidy to
get Phillips Hutton Building reoccupied in a public- private
partnership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its newest effort to bolster business downtown, Santa Ana's City
Council will consider one of its biggest redevelopment projects: a
$3.58-million subsidy to three businesses that would occupy a trio of
vacant buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, which goes before the council in four to six
weeks, the city would spend $2.3 million to renovate the buildings,
at 4th Street and Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   Known collectively as the Phillips Hutton Building, the small
complex was bought by the city in the mid-1980s for $1.28 million.
City officials said they are not worth much more today because of the
millions in improvements needed before they could be occupied.</LD>
<TE>   Three companies--Nestor Gaffney Architects, Griffin Realty and
redevelopment consulting agency Rosenow Spevacek Group--will take
ownership of one building each, provided they spend about $500,000
each on improvements, said John Reekstin, the city redevelopment
director.</TE>
<TE>   Two are destined to become office buildings, while the third will
house offices and a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very significant project," Reekstin said. "It's part of
a continuing effort to draw people into the downtown."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jose Solorio said he appreciates the project
because it involves renovating historic buildings. "Private-public
partnerships will help make the area stronger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The makeover of the three buildings would be one of the most
costly in the history of Santa Ana's redevelopment authority, which
has underwritten about $20 million worth of such projects over the
past 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The city is working to fuse a nascent Artists Village--with
studios, shops and eateries attractive to middle-class
consumers--with a bustling Latino shopping area that serves as a
magnet for immigrants living in the area.</TE>
<TE>   In the past five years, Reekstin said, the city has offered a
range of subsidies to companies willing to move into downtown Santa
Ana, including:</TE>
<TE>   A loan of $450,000 to a partnership headed by developer Mike
Harrah, as well as a loan of $30,000 to one of his tenants, the
Memphis Cafe &amp; Bar, to pay for improvements to the Southern-style
eatery in the Santora Building. The loans need not be repaid if a
restaurant continues operating on the same scale for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of land to the Olson Co. for $1.2 million less than its
market value. The company is building 86 lofts on three blocks
between Main, Bush, Sycamore and 2nd streets.</TE>
<TE>   A grant of $400,000 to the Gypsy Den restaurant for improvements
to the building. The restaurant opened three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A loan of $70,000 to Tangata, a restaurant at the Bowers Museum of
Cultural Art.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the city spent $6.5 million to renovate the
1924-vintage Grand Central Art Center, a complex of galleries and
studios that also houses a small theater. An additional $350,000 went
to convert a former auto repair shop into the Orange County Center
for Contemporary Art, and $1.7 million in seed money went to help the
acclaimed High School of the Arts establish itself in a downtown
high-rise after years in a more suburban setting in Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "The point has been to create cornerstone projects that spur
private developer interest, and that is happening," Reekstin said.
Luring Memphis downtown "was very important, because we wanted a
first-class restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bradley, one of the two Memphis owners, said he was attracted
to the proposal because of "the level of commitment to the arts, the
Artists Village and to the area. The city was so eager to have us."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, who has one other Memphis restaurant, in Costa Mesa, said
that without the subsidy, which covered a kitchen installation, "it
would have been cost-prohibitive. We would not have been able to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Even though business has not been booming, Bradley said he is
hopeful. "We knew the [initial] numbers would not be outrageous, but
we're looking ahead to a brighter future."</TE>
<TE>   City officials laud businessmen like Bradley as pioneers, but some
Latino merchants see such businesses as a foreboding sign of their
own extinction.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz heard in taquerias and travel agencies is often about
what the city is doing not for the Latino merchants but for
businesses that cater to other types of customers.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Pena, owner of insurance agency Manuel Pena Consulting,
said the city's incentives are a great way to encourage business
downtown, apart from the equity issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not upset me that they do these things, but they should
do it equally with everyone," Pena said. "Instead of sticking with a
known factor, a downtown, an old-fashioned one, and using it, and
relying on the Hispanic influence here, they are worried Santa Ana is
too Hispanic. They want change. But these people are not going home."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Alberta Christy said the initial subsidies may
seem large, but the city benefits in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   "The returns that are going to be generated there over the years
are more than the incentive," she said. "We get business license fees
and support for the community. It's a lot of things that businesses
do."</TE>

<CX>   City Subsidy--A Sept. 30 article in some editions of the California
section about downtown Santa Ana redevelopment incorrectly said the
Gypsy Den restaurant received a $400,000 subsidy from the city. In
fact, the city paid $6.8 million to renovate the old Grand Central
building, which is leased to Cal State Fullerton. Redevelopment
Director John Reekstin now says it is impossible to determine how
much of that went for improvements to the portion sublet by the
restaurant. He said the Gypsy Den paid for additional tenant
renovations.</CX>

<HD>Man Held on Airport Weapon Charge</HD>
<DH>Arrest: New Jersey authorities say the Bulgarian student
had two box cutters, scissors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A Bulgarian national was arrested Sunday at Atlantic City
International Airport after federal screeners found a pair of
scissors embedded in a bar of soap and two box cutters in a lotion
bottle in his backpack.</LD>
<LD>   Nikolay Volodicv Dzhonev, 21, was charged with possession of a
prohibited weapon. Egg Harbor Township police said Dzhonev was being
held on $100,000 bail. An arraignment was set for today.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the man was a student from Bulgaria with a summer
visa allowing him to work at an Atlantic City-area convenience store.</LD>
<TE>   He was the last passenger to pass through screening Sunday for a
flight from Atlantic City to Myrtle Beach, S.C., Transportation
Security Administration spokesman Robert Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   When his backpack went through the X-ray machine, screeners
spotted the scissors and pulled him aside, Johnson said. A search of
the backpack turned up the scissors, embedded in a bar of soap, and
the box cutters hidden in a lotion bottle, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern was there may have been some effort to conceal them,"
Johnson said. He said the fact that the man's one-way ticket was
purchased on the Internet in August also raised suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   The man told authorities he packed the items that way to keep them
from damaging anything else in his backpack, Johnson said. He said he
bought the Spirit Airlines ticket so he could visit a friend in South
Carolina before returning to Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proud of the fact that our screeners caught it," Johnson
said. "Here's an example of the federal screeners doing their job
keeping these items off the plane, giving law enforcement a chance to
sort through it."</TE>
<TE>   Spirit Airlines spokeswoman Laura Bennett said that the flight
carrying 84 passengers departed on time, and that the arrest did not
affect operations.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers were relieved a suspect had been caught, but said the
incident wasn't unduly disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to gamble and I play the odds," said Hunter Boylan, 56,
of Boone, N.C., who was visiting Atlantic City for the weekend.</TE>

<HD>No Money Missing After Deadly Bank Holdup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Neb.</DL>
<LD>The suspects in the holdup of a northeastern Nebraska bank where five
people were killed last week apparently did not get away with any
money, officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The police have reported that there was no money missing," said
Madison County Atty. Joe Smith.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday afternoon, residents attended visitation services for
two of the victims, bank employees Lola Elwood and Lisa Bryant, on
the eve of their funerals.</LD>
<TE>   Four men remained jailed on murder charges in Thursday's shootings
at the U.S. Bank branch.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Bill Mizner said Sunday that while no money appeared
to be missing, a bank audit was being performed.</TE>
<TE>   "With all four of the suspects--there was no money recovered from
any of those apprehensions," Mizner said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Sandoval, 23, of Norfolk; and Jorge Galindo, 21; Erick
Fernando Vela, 21; and Gabriel Rodriguez, 26, all of Madison, have
each been charged with five counts of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the men planned for at least two weeks to hold up the
bank. Sandoval, Galindo and Vela were arrested about three hours
after the shootings, and Rodriguez was arrested early Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance tapes showed the men broke into the bank and shot six
people within 40 seconds, according to Capt. Steve Hecker, who
testified at a bond hearing for the suspects last week. They were
scheduled to appear in court again this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bank employees Elwood, 43; Bryant, 29; Samuel Sun, 50; Jo
Mausbach, 42; and customer Evonne Tuttle, 37, were killed. Another
customer was injured.</TE>
<TE>   The community was dealt another blow when a distraught state
trooper, Mark Zach, 35, fatally shot himself with his service
revolver the day after the robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Zach had stopped Vela less than a week before the robbery and
ticketed him for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon. But Zach
transposed two digits when entering the gun's serial number into a
police computer, preventing him from learning that the gun had been
stolen.</TE>
<TE>   The gun was confiscated by authorities and not used in the holdup.
However, Zach apparently felt responsible for not getting the suspect
jailed on a more serious stolen weapon charge.</TE>
<TE>   His funeral will be Wednesday. Funerals for the three other bank
victims were scheduled Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Mystery Lingers After Bingo Suicide</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: After software engineer Brett Keeton learned
gaming officials suspected he was a cheat, he drove to the Golden
Gate Bridge and jumped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Investigators wanted to interview Brett Keeton, to figure out how he
was able to rig his company's electronic score-keeping devices to
give him an unfair edge in bingo parlors.</LD>
<LD>   They had never seen it before, this way of cheating at bingo. It
was intriguing, cloaked in the arcane language of computer code. And
Keeton was something of a genius, one of the few employees at the
company who could have pulled it off.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators also would have liked to ask him why. It didn't
appear he was motivated to get rich quick. You don't do that playing
bingo, winning a few hundred dollars here and there. More likely, it
was the thrill of the deceit.</LD>
<TE>   All his wife would like, for now, is to read his last words, the
note he left in his car. They might bring some consolation as she is
left to raise the couple's two young boys.</TE>
<TE>   For investigators, and for Hilary Keeton, there are no immediate
answers.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after learning that he was under investigation--that
detectives for the Nevada Gaming Control Board had shown up at his
Reno office Sept. 20--Keeton, 38, a University of Oklahoma computer
science graduate of superb intelligence, parked his car next to a
tollbooth on the Golden Gate Bridge, walked toward the middle span,
climbed over a guardrail and, facing the lights of San Francisco,
jumped to his death.</TE>
<TE>   A Coast Guard boat gunned to about 40 knots racing toward the
bridge, chasing a flare tossed by a bridge worker to help locate
where he had landed. Within minutes, his body was found in the
reflections of the floodlit water, and a paramedic pronounced him
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Just 24 hours earlier, Keeton had been playing bingo in a suburban
Las Vegas casino. Something about his behavior--investigators won't
say what it was--concerned casino officials. State agents were called
that night, and they reviewed a surveillance tape from an overhead
camera. In the highly regulated world of the Nevada gambling
industry, the player was recognized as Keeton, a senior software
engineer for GameTech International Inc., a Reno-based bingo
accessories manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   While there are many variations, the basic bingo game involves
numbered balls being selected randomly, and players marking their
cards if one of the 25 squares has the same number. Five marked
squares in a row--vertically, diagonally or horizontally--constitutes
a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Because the play cards are printed with different combinations of
numbers, a player's chances of winning increase with the more cards
played.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo players traditionally use fat felt pens, called daubers, to
mark the cards.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran bingo players may play 20, 30 or even more bingo cards per
game, quickly scanning each one to mark any successful "hits" before
the next number is announced.</TE>
<TE>   GameTech manufactures electronic tallying devices that allow a
player to track as many as 64 electronic bingo cards at a time. Using
a hand-held device, the player punches in the number called, and the
device instantly searches and marks any winning hits among the cards.
Casinos charge players about $1 to use the devices.</TE>
<TE>   In a fancier desktop model that's wired to a central bingo
console, the winning numbers automatically are fed into the device
and recorded. Some players like these devices because they come with
small, built-in television screens for simultaneous entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 19, Keeton was playing on the desktop devices and
apparently was winning disproportionately often compared with other
players. Perplexed casino officials called state investigators, who
are accustomed to dealing with cheaters trying to manipulate slot
machines by using slugs, strings, wires and light beams to confuse
the machine's internal hardware. But discovering a cheater using
proprietary software programming knowledge is rare.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaming Control Board wasted no time in identifying Keeton, and
investigators went to his office the next morning--but Keeton didn't
show up. Based on the concerns expressed by the gaming agents, the
company immediately fired him.</TE>
<TE>   Word reached Keeton and his wife, and that afternoon they hired an
attorney. The lawyer never had a chance to meet his client.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Neilander, chairman of the Gaming Control Board, said
investigators are in the midst of their probe and won't discuss
details.</TE>
<TE>   But this much is believed, he said: Keeton had somehow manipulated
several machines to play many more bingo cards than the maximum
allowed for any single bingo session. He had no control over the
bingo balls, no way of generating specific numbers. But with far more
cards than others, Keeton's chances of winning were improved.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known how long Keeton had been playing this way, or how
much money he collected. He apparently ignored jackpots that paid
more than $1,200, because he would have had to complete Internal
Revenue Service paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't known whether Keeton compromised the machines with
corrupt software while they were being manufactured, or simply knew
how to capitalize on a vulnerability after they were installed at a
casino.</TE>
<TE>   By reverse engineering--taking the machines apart and examining
the computer codes--investigators hope to unravel his trick. "We're
making progress," Neilander said Friday. "But we're still not sure
how he did this." Until the mystery is solved, all of the nearly 300
desktop devices used in Nevada have been shut down by gaming
officials, but the hand-held devices remain in operation. The company
also voluntarily shut down its desktop machines in Texas and
Mississippi, pending the results of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The other mystery, Neilander said, is Keeton's motive. "My
experience in situations like this is, it's the thrill of trying to
defeat the system. But in this case, we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials likewise were wondering. "By all accounts, he
had been an exemplary employee, and we can only speculate regarding
what caused him to do this," GameTech Chief Executive Clarence H.
Thiesen said.</TE>
<TE>   Reno attorney David Houston said Hilary Keeton has been given no
evidence to support the allegations against her husband, and she is
concerned that his reputation is being wrongfully tarnished.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good father, a wonderful husband and an exemplary
employee," Houston said. Nothing of the family's lifestyle, he said,
indicated that they were living beyond the means of Keeton's salary
of about $80,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Keeton may have committed suicide, Houston said, not out of guilt
but because he was "so adversely impacted with the specter of an
investigation. We haven't yet been able to see the suicide note, so
we're all at a loss."</TE>
<TE>   GameTech executives declined to offer access to Keeton's
co-workers. And his neighbors knew little of the man.</TE>
<TE>   "They were private people who stayed to themselves," said Jena
Iverson, who for the last year has lived a few houses from the
Keetons.</TE>
<TE>   The Keetons moved to Reno in October from the Denver suburb of
Thornton. Former neighbor Paula Burton said she and her husband moved
into their Thornton home within a day of the Keetons, about seven
years ago, and that Brett Keeton made an immediate impression.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband and he were putting up the new mailboxes, side by
side, and my husband introduced himself, and Brett never said a
word," Burton said. "In the six years we lived next to each
other--and we don't even have a fence separating the backyards--I
don't think Brett Keeton said two words to us."</TE>
<TE>   Keeton was silent to the end. California Highway Patrol officer
Julio Bandoni had bridge duty that Friday night and was dispatched
after a motorist reported seeing a man climbing over a rail and onto
the outer side of the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   The moment Bandoni's flashlight illuminated Keeton, he jumped. "He
didn't give us a chance to even talk to him," the officer said. "I
can only speculate that he had been waiting until he knew he had been
seen so his body could be recovered. As soon as my light hit him, he
jumped and screamed."</TE>

<HD>Shuttle Camera to Offer New View of Launch</HD>

<LD>When the space shuttle Atlantis lifts off this week, a camera mounted
atop the large, orange fuel tank will beam back a shuttle's eye view
of a launch for the first time. Not even the astronauts, restricted
to small windows on one of two crew decks used during liftoff, will
have such a panoramic view of the 8 1/2-minute climb into orbit--with
Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral receding into the distance
and the surface of the Earth appearing more curved by the minute.
Liftoff is scheduled for Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of the camera is rooted less in science than in what one
NASA official described as "the 'wow!' factor."</LD>
<LD>   "There may be some engineering value," said Phil Engelauf,
Atlantis' lead flight director, but the real motivation "is largely
just for the cool video."</LD>

<LD>Tropical Storm Lili churned toward the Gulf of Mexico and could
strike the Gulf Coast by the end of the week, forecasters said. It
was too early to predict where Lili would come ashore, but coastal
residents from Texas to Florida should be on the alert for a direct
hit as early as Friday, said Stacy Stewart of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Lili could start affecting the Florida Keys by today or Tuesday,
with minor rainfall and wind gusts under tropical storm strength.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday evening, Lili was about 15 miles east-northeast of Montego
Bay, Jamaica, and had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, below the 74
mph minimum for a hurricane. The storm has caused extensive flooding
in Jamaica and Haiti.</LD>

<HD>A Long Road to Court After 1977 Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Fascination with the case of Ira Einhorn, accused of
killing his girlfriend, has waned. Opening arguments in his trial
begin today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>When Ira Einhorn was arrested in 1979 on charges that he had killed
his former girlfriend, the headlines in Philadelphia rivaled those
for coverage of the nuclear crisis then occurring at Three Mile
Island.</LD>
<LD>   As the onetime counterculture guru and fugitive finally entered
court last week to stand trial on murder charges, it was clear that
eras have changed and public fascination with the case has ebbed.</LD>
<LD>   The now gray-haired defendant--who once sought to imitate, if not
exceed, the flamboyant lifestyle of '60s radicals Jerry Rubin and
Abbie Hoffman--wore a decidedly conservative tan jacket, green tie
and neatly pressed pants.</LD>
<TE>   Jury selection was completed in just two days, with only a handful
of spectators present in the courtroom. The Philadelphia Inquirer
tucked its story on the panel's formation on Page 5 of a back
section. Outside the courthouse, some people said the trial was not a
big deal--an observation that likely would have angered Einhorn
mightily in the past, and perhaps even now.</TE>
<TE>   All that could change when prosecutors and defense attorneys
deliver opening arguments scheduled to begin today--especially if
Einhorn, 62, takes the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Einhorn's defense: The CIA or some other intelligence
service planted Helen "Holly" Maddux's body inside a trunk in his
closet because of his knowledge of psychic phenomena and government
mind-control experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Heady stuff, although William Cannon, Einhorn's court-appointed
lawyer, has said he will focus on more mundane matters: witnesses who
allegedly saw Maddux alive after the time prosecutors allege Einhorn
bludgeoned her to death.</TE>
<TE>   For Maddux's family, the trial--Einhorn's third (he was convicted
in absentia of first-degree murder after he fled to Europe and was
found guilty in a civil action designed to deny him any
royalties)--represents the culmination of a long journey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very rough," said Meg Wakeman, the victim's oldest
sister. "His behavior is that of a bully, and who wants to deal with
a bully for 20 years?"</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn met Maddux in 1972 at Philadelphia's La Terrasse bistro, a
spot popular with students. The willowy blond who had studied ballet
had come north from her home in Tyler, Texas, to attend Bryn Mawr
College.</TE>
<TE>   Within two weeks, she had moved into Einhorn's apartment near the
University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The New Age philosopher was a bear of a man, adept in promoting
himself and winning a coterie of admirers. The story is told that he
once disrobed completely and danced around during a class he taught
at his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   He also claimed to have founded and organized Philadelphia's
highly successful Earth Day celebration--where an estimated 70,000
people gathered in Fairmount Park on April 22, 1970. The event
brought society matrons from garden clubs together with hippies, and
Einhorn used it as a springboard to court the establishment and sell
himself as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no role whatsoever," said Edward W. Furia, now chairman
and chief executive of AFS Trinity Power Corp. in Seattle, who as a
28-year-old graduate student was Earth Day's executive director. "He
would come to our meetings and politely be asked to leave."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the rally, Furia recalled, Einhorn commandeered the
stage. "Einhorn said, 'If you want me off, you will have to remove me
and I will cause a riot,' " Furia said. Eventually Einhorn retreated,
but a photograph taken of him onstage served him well.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Earth Day was so successful," Furia said, "he went to
corporations and got himself hired ... to interpret the younger
generation."</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, 1979, police armed with a search warrant knocked on
Einhorn's apartment door. Inside a locked closet detectives found
cardboard boxes filled with Maddux's belongings--including a
pocketbook with her Social Security and library cards. In a steamer
trunk packed with plastic bags and newspapers dated around the time
of her 1977 disappearance, police found Maddux's body.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned to [Einhorn] and said: 'It looks like we found Holly,' "
recalled former Philadelphia Det. Michael Chitwood, now chief of
police in Portland, Maine. "He shrugged his shoulders and said, 'You
found what you found.' I took off the rubber gloves and called the
medical examiner."</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn's lawyer at his bail hearing was Arlen Specter, the former
Philadelphia district attorney and now Republican senator from
Pennsylvania. Einhorn was released on $40,000 bail and, shortly
before his January 1981 trial, he fled. The frustrating search for
Einhorn came to an end in 1997 in a farmhouse in the Bordeaux region
of France.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, the legal fight with France to extradite Einhorn
took four years.</TE>
<TE>   The Pennsylvania Legislature had to pass a law in 1998 permitting
a new trial to get Einhorn returned to Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Maddux's family are expected to be in court today.</TE>
<TE>   "He just used her, and it was a very cruel manipulation," Wakeman
said. "I hope it's going to be a victory for all victims."</TE>

<HD>Rhetoric, but Few Solutions to Ending Worldwide Poverty</HD>
<DH>Debt: Finance leaders vow globalization will aid needy, but
they offer no major new initiatives. A bankruptcy tribunal will be
considered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>World finance leaders wrapped up their fall meetings Sunday with
bold, rhetorical promises to make globalization work for the poor,
but with few new resources to ensure that the job gets done.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of launching big poverty-reduction initiatives or
substantially expanding existing ones, members of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund endorsed more modest changes,
tweaking here and there. They cited the need to honor ambitious
commitments already on their agendas.</LD>
<LD>   "The era of promises must be replaced by the era of
implementation," declared Gordon Brown, British chancellor of the
Exchequer.</LD>
<TE>   The most dramatic departure was a decision to consider creating a
bankruptcy tribunal for insolvent governments. But that would address
sudden financial crises in middle-income countries such as Brazil or
Argentina, not the chronic, intractable poverty of sub-Saharan
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other wealthy nations promised to pay an
additional $1 billion into a trust fund for Third World debt relief.
But they were following through on a previous pledge and did not
consider proposals that would have expanded the program to provide
greater debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite a lot of goodwill and the right rhetoric, the donor
community has not found a way to come up with the resources to put
countries that are very poor but well-managed back on track," said
Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a
public policy organization in Washington that deals with issues of
world poverty and inequality.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of focusing their energy on the largely ceremonial
gatherings of the IMF and the World Bank, globalization protesters
"should hold them accountable after the meetings for what they've
said they would do," Birdsall said.</TE>
<TE>   If words could do the job, the work would be half done. One after
another, representatives of the 184 member nations of the IMF and the
World Bank stepped up to the lectern at Sunday's concluding session
and endorsed the need to harness the forces of globalization to serve
the interests of the world's least-developed countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Should the rich become richer and the poor poorer as a result of
globalization, the resulting unfairness must be addressed," said Dai
Xianglong, head of the People's Bank of China.</TE>
<TE>   World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn said old dichotomies
disappeared after last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not two worlds, rich and poor; there is only one,"
Wolfensohn said. "We are linked by finance, trade, migration,
communication, environment, communicable disease, crime, drugs and
certainly by terror. More and more people are saying poverty anywhere
is poverty everywhere, and their voices are getting louder."</TE>
<TE>   IMF and World Bank officials cited the $1-billion debt-relief
pledge as evidence of the shared commitment to helping the world's
poor. But they acknowledged that it was a reaffirmation of past
pledges by wealthy nations, not a significant expansion of the
program launched six years ago to reduce the big debt payments that
consume resources that would be better spent on health and education
in poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said proposals to expand the program have been opposed
by members of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, particularly the
United States and Britain, because of concerns that the money might
be misspent in countries where corruption has been a problem.</TE>
<TE>   A number of mainstream advocacy groups and development scholars
have concluded that the debt-relief program should be expanded. Only
six countries have completed the program, which does not eliminate
debt, but reduces it to "sustainable" levels based on estimates of
economic growth, commodity prices and other factors. Some of those
countries are having problems making their reduced payments because
of depressed commodity prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was pushing debt on them 20 years ago," said Peter
Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland and a
former U.S. trade official. "For the poorest of the poor, if we can
just wipe it out and give them a chance to start over, it's not a lot
of money in the grand scheme of things."</TE>
<TE>   Morici and other authorities said the proposal to establish a
bankruptcy process for countries with big sovereign debt obligations
represents a more substantial policy initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Finance officials directed the IMF staff to spend six months
developing a detailed plan for setting up an arbitration process to
restructure the debts of insolvent countries such as Argentina, which
has defaulted on its foreign debt.</TE>
<TE>   The directive is surprising in part because it had been opposed by
big banks and other creditors that might recover less of their money
by participating in a restructuring process than by suing in court.
Until recently, the Bush administration showed little enthusiasm for
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to move forward on the proposal was even
characterized as a sign of slight progress by one of the organizers
of the previous day's anti-globalization protests outside the IMF and
World Bank buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have demanded that there be a procedure for declaring these
debts illegitimate," said Soren Ambrose, policy analyst for 50 Years
Is Enough, a Washington-based coalition of groups advocating change
in the two financial institutions. "This is not quite that. But it is
an acknowledgment that this problem exists, and that we have to come
to a more definitive solution of the debt."</TE>
<TE>   In most other respects, the fall meetings of the two institutions
appeared to break little new ground or address trouble spots such as
Brazil's collapsing currency or Japan's economic paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   "There was really no change in terms of the management of the
world economy, including how to handle the immediate crisis in
Brazil. I don't get the sense that anybody is happier with Japan than
they were before, or less worried about what would happen if there's
a war with Iraq," said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the
Institute for International Economics and a former World Bank
economist. "There usually isn't an enormous amount decided at these
meetings, so I would say this is about par for the course."</TE>

<LD>When it comes to the economy, the Bush family is on an
intergenerational losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly halfway through his term, President Bush's economic record
is beginning to look a lot like that of his father, former President
George Bush. That isn't good news for the younger Bush. Or for the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Most key measures of economic well-being for average families
declined under the first President Bush. Then, after an unsteady
start, almost all of those same measures improved during Bill
Clinton's eight years in the White House.</LD>
<TE>   Now, under the second President Bush, the trend lines are pointing
down again.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern was dramatically underscored last week when the Census
Bureau released its annual reports on income and poverty in America.
Together, these two studies provide the most comprehensive snapshot
of the economic well-being of American families. On both fronts, the
news was grim--and a throwback to the economy's performance under the
first President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   From 1989 through 1992, when the elder Bush held the presidency,
the number of Americans in poverty increased by 6.5 million,
according to Census Bureau figures. That was the largest increase in
poverty under any president in the last 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The new census figures showed that the ranks of the poor increased
by an additional 1.3 million during George W. Bush's first year in
office. So, in five years combined under the Bushes, the number of
Americans in poverty has swelled by 7.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, during Clinton's eight years, the number of Americans
in poverty declined by 7.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The same trends held on the median income, the best measure of how
much money the average family earns. Under the first President Bush,
the median income fell by 4.9%, from nearly $40,000 in 1989 to less
than $38,000 in 1992. Then, during Clinton's two terms, the median
income increased 14.5%, to an all-time high of $43,162. That
represented the largest, and most broadly shared, increase in living
standards since the 1960s, according to Census figures.</TE>
<TE>   Now the trend is pointing down again. The Census Bureau reported
last week that in 2001 the median income fell 2.2%, meaning that
President Bush has presided over the first significant decline in
income for average families since ... 1991, when his father sat in
the big chair.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern doesn't stop there. Consider job growth and
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   In four years, under the first President Bush, the economy created
about 2.3 million new jobs. Under the second President Bush, the
economy has lost roughly 1.5 million jobs through August, the latest
month for which figures are available. That means the economy has
created only 733,000 total jobs in the 68 months that the Bushes,
father and son, have held the White House. That averages out to
10,779 new jobs per month under the Bushes.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, under Clinton, the economy created an average of
236,635 jobs per month--for a total of nearly 23 million new jobs
during his eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment tells a similar story. When Bush's father took office
in January 1989, the unemployment rate stood at 5.4%. When he left in
January 1993, it had jumped to 7.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Over Clinton's eight years, the unemployment rate dropped--to the
point where it stood at 4.2% when the younger Bush took the oath in
January 2001. That needle has reversed too. Unemployment now stands
at 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider the federal government's finances. When President
Reagan left office in 1988, Washington's annual deficit stood at $155
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Under the elder Bush, the deficit steadily grew, peaking in 1992
at $290 billion-- Washington's biggest ever. Under Clinton, the
government's fiscal position improved every year; by 2000, in
Clinton's final budget, Washington enjoyed its largest surplus ever:
$236 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under pressure from war, recession and the cost of Bush's tax
cut, these numbers have reversed. In the 2002 fiscal year that ends
today, the government is expected to run a deficit of about $160
billion--the first shortfall since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Health care has moved in the same direction, if less dramatically.
Under the first Bush, the share of Americans without health insurance
jumped from 13.6% to 15%. Under Clinton, the percentage fell to
14.2%, according to revised census figures released today. But in
2001, under Bush II the share of Americans lacking health insurance
ticked back to 14.6%, with 1.4 million people losing coverage, the
census found.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Bush fans are undoubtedly howling that presidents
shouldn't receive all the blame or credit for economic trends under
their watch. That's fair enough. Economic cycles don't necessarily
respect the electoral calendar; the economy already was improving
when the elder Bush left office, and slowing when the younger Bush
arrived. And sometimes the decisions presidents make aren't fully
felt until after they're gone--like the 1990 Bush deficit reduction
package that provided a foundation for Clinton's efforts to eliminate
the red ink.</TE>
<TE>   But the choices presidents make matter too. The first Bush chose
to stand pat as the economy stumbled and unemployment rose in his
last two years; his son chose to put all his chips on a huge tax cut
that blew a hole in the federal surplus, may increase upward pressure
on long-term interest rates and has severely crimped his ability to
aim targeted initiatives at such problems as the increase in poverty
or the decline in health-care coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, while arguments about blame may be intellectually
intriguing, ultimately they are politically irrelevant. Every
president eventually owns his economy. The buck really does stop in
the Oval Office, especially when Americans have fewer of them in
their wallet.</TE>
<TE>   This Bush will benefit for a long time from the judgment among
voters that he's effectively handling national security and the
threat of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But unless these economic trends reverse direction, sooner or
later Bush may find himself vulnerable to the gibe that Al Gore aimed
at his father in 1992: "Everything that should be going up is going
down, and everything that should be going down is going up." That's
one bit of family history Bush would probably rather not relive.</TE>

<HD>'Inspections, Not War': 2,500 Rally in Washington</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Claiming that President Bush is more interested in grabbing Saddam
Hussein's oil resources than his weapons of mass destruction, several
thousand demonstrators marched through the nation's capital Sunday to
protest a potential attack on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "The message is: No war in Iraq. We need inspections, not war;
disarmament, not overthrow of the Iraqi regime," said Phyllis Bennis
of the Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington public-policy
group.</LD>
<LD>   A strike against Iraq "will bring on more terrorism, the deaths of
who knows how many Americans and the deaths of hundreds of thousands
of Iraqi citizens," said Al Fischman, 74, a retiree from Michigan.</LD>
<TE>   "It will accomplish absolutely nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The protest came as U.S. lawmakers continued their debate over how
much latitude to give Bush in pursuing military action against Iraq,
and as U.N. weapon inspectors prepared to meet with Iraqi officials
today to lay down demands for their return.</TE>
<TE>   The march, which was peaceful, took demonstrators up Washington's
Embassy Row. It paused briefly at the embassies of countries on the
U.N. Security Council, a symbolic plea for them to guide the United
States away from war, and ended with a rally outside the residence of
Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   "No blood for oil," the protesters yelled. "One, two, three, four,
we don't want your oil war."</TE>
<TE>   Police estimated that about 2,500 people participated.</TE>
<TE>   The protest marked the third day of demonstrations in Washington
against U.S. foreign policy, coinciding with annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters blame the two international finance agencies for
setting out loan terms for indigent nations that harm the poor and
the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had prepared for as many as 20,000 protesters over the
weekend, but far fewer appeared.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the protesters included church groups, suburban
families and college students--a more diverse crowd than had appeared
at rowdier demonstrations on Friday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Those had been dominated by college-age protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary folks are opposing the war, not just the rabble-rousing
kids," said Dave Bort, a 51-year-old electrical engineer from
Maryland who wore a three-piece suit.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of strong opposition in the suburban neighborhoods
to any more killing," said Mike Hanna, 38, an environmental engineer
who turned out with fellow parishioners from his Roman Catholic
church in Virginia. They included a lawyer, an occupational therapist
and a college professor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been enough killing in the past year. Killing a bunch of
Iraqis won't help anything."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Amundson of Hartville, Mo., said he was attending on behalf
of 50 people who lost relatives in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
"It's very upsetting to see Sept. 11 used to justify this war with
Iraq," said Amundson, whose brother, Craig, 27, died at the Pentagon,
where he was working as a multimedia illustrator for the Army.</TE>
<TE>   "We know many innocent people will die in a war, and we think that
will bring more insecurity than peace. We don't want anyone,
anywhere, to have to go through what we went through."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the protesters said they feared that Bush was using Iraq's
suspected weapon programs as an excuse to gain control of Iraqi oil,
or to avenge a suspected 1993 assassination plot against former
President Bush, the current president's father.</TE>
<TE>   They also said the president had made the world less secure by
asserting, in a new foreign policy doctrine, that the United States
may strike first against hostile states developing weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "If we've been attacked, then we should defend ourselves," said
Medea Benjamin of the group Global Exchange, which helped organize
the protest.</TE>
<TE>   "But we can't have a world run by preemptive strikes. That would
indeed be a world of perpetual war."</TE>

<HD>Davis Submits New Rules on Nurse Staffing</HD>
<DH>Politics: Proposal to set minimum per-patient ratios is
part of package to ease nursing shortage. Measure signed to help
braceros recover wages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS and JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>After a two-year delay, Gov. Gray Davis proposed regulations Sunday
that would make California the first state to limit the number of
patients who could be assigned to each hospital nurse.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the governor approved $21 million in grants as
the initial phase of a $52-million, three-year effort to ease the
state's acute nursing shortage by financing the training of at least
5,000 new nurses.</LD>
<LD>   In a third action involving nurses, Davis signed legislation,
Assembly Bill 2314 by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), designed
to speed up the education of nursing students at California community
colleges and state universities.</LD>
<TE>   "These moves make California a national leader in nursing and
patient care," Davis said. "They address the quality of patient care
and help meet the nursing work-force needs of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has until midnight to sign or veto the remaining pile of
bills sent to him by the Legislature, which ended its session Aug.
31.</TE>
<TE>   Still awaiting action are several politically sensitive measures,
including one that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain
California driver's licenses, another to give farm workers the right
to get third-party mediation during contract negotiations and a third
that would let Indian tribes have greater say over areas they
consider sacred sites.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision to begin establishing regulations requiring
hospitals to comply with specific nurse-patient ratios was a triumph
for the California Nurses Assn. and the Service Employees
International Union, labor organizations that represent nurses and
have contributed heavily to Davis' campaign. The regulations were
opposed by California hospital officials, who predict that they will
increase costs and force cutbacks elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the ratios would vary according to the level
of care required by each type of patient. In trauma units, the ratio
would be as high as one nurse for each patient, but in
medical-surgical units it would be one nurse for every six patients.
After a year, those units would have one nurse for every five
patients.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Davis signed legislation requiring him to set
nurse-patient ratios effective Jan. 1, 2001. A year later, another
bill changed that date to Jan. 1, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Davis provided a preview of what the regulations would
require, but it wasn't until Sunday that he announced the proposal
was being forwarded for approval to the state's administrative law
judges.</TE>
<TE>   A series of public hearings will be held across the state,
including one in Los Angeles on Nov. 15. If approved, the regulations
will go into effect in January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The two unions said the new ratios will help ease the nursing
shortage. But the California Healthcare Assn., which represents the
state's hospitals, saw it as a simplistic solution that could have
"unintended consequences."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the ratios are determined to be, hospitals will comply,"
said Jan Emerson, an association vice president. "But to do that, we
may have to shut down beds, we may have to shut down entire units;
emergency room patients may have to wait longer for care."</TE>
<TE>   Even with 5,000 newly trained nurses, she added, California will
still be short about 25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take us years to dig out of that shortage," Emerson
said, "and nursing ratios aren't going to create more nurses
magically overnight."</TE>
<TE>   But Beth Capell, a lobbyist for the Service Employees
International Union, argued that the ratios would improve working
conditions for overworked nurses and make the job more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Sunday, Davis signed a bill to help former
braceros recover millions of dollars in lost wages from work on
American farms and railroads more than 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   From 1942 to 1950, nearly 400,000 Mexican guest workers--known as
braceros--were invited to the United States to relieve a labor
shortage caused by World War II.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the guest worker program, the U.S. and Mexico agreed
that 10% of the workers' wages be withheld as savings and paid to the
braceros upon their return home.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of surviving migrants and their descendants--many of
whom now live in the United States--claim they never received the
money. They have formed a growing reparations movement that has
triggered international protests, a Mexican congressional
investigation and legal action in both countries.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the men, mostly in their 70s and 80s, have filed
federal lawsuits seeking the back wages from the U.S., Mexico and
several banks. In August, a San Francisco judge dismissed one
class-action suit, concluding in part that the statute of limitations
for filing a complaint had expired.</TE>
<TE>   The bill signed Sunday, AB 2913 by Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh
(D-East Los Angeles), would extend the applicable California statute
of limitations, perhaps enabling the plaintiffs to refile.</TE>
<TE>   But even its author admitted that the bill is mostly a symbolic
gesture because it cannot alter federal time limits on the suits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant policy comment by the Legislature and the
governor of this state that we believe the braceros ought to have
their day in court," Firebaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Activists, including Baldomero Capiz of Los Angeles, hailed the
governor's action as a morale boost to the movement.</TE>
<TE>   "We will keep fighting this fight, and the Gray Davis signature
gives us fuel to fight with more confidence," said Capiz, a leader in
the reparations movement whose uncles built rail lines during the
bracero program, and who is a former migrant worker himself. "We hope
the U.S. Congress takes notice."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the United Farm Workers, Marc Grossman, echoed
those sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "We supported this bill because it's about remedying some old
injustices," he said. The braceros "were abused and exploited when
they worked here, and became victims by being defrauded out of their
own wages."</TE>

<HD>Convention Is Full of Land Mines for State GOP</HD>

<DL>GARDEN GROVE</DL>
<LD>The California Republican Party, to put it charitably, is currently
only half the party that Democrats are. Maybe that's why the GOP
thinks it should hold twice as many conventions.</LD>
<LD>   Half as effective, meet twice as much.</LD>
<LD>   This hasn't been working, clearly. Democrats dominate partisan
politics in California, from the governor's office down through the
Legislature and the congressional delegation.</LD>
<TE>   The GOP resists change, however. And while Democratic activists
were out registering voters over the weekend, the Republican hard
core was holding yet another state convention in a Garden Grove
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   California Republicans meet twice each year, in late winter and
early fall. Democrats get by very nicely with one annual convention
in early spring.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we doing here, 39 days before the election, talking to
each other?" asked former Assemblyman Tom Bordonaro, the San Luis
Obispo County GOP chairman who recently was elected county assessor.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be out in the trenches."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans weren't just talking, they were trashing each other in
one stunning incident--and spilling party blood all over a luncheon
originally organized to help unify the convention behind underdog
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday luncheon of the party's executive committee was billed
as an opportunity--for $40--to hear Simon strategists Ed Rollins and
Sal Russo explain how their inexperienced, underfinanced,
trouble-plagued candidate was going to whip Gov. Gray Davis. (Answer:
By reminding voters why they don't like him.)</TE>
<TE>   But first the luncheon crowd had to suffer through party chairman
Shawn Steel's long berating of President Bush's man in California,
investor Gerald L. Parsky.</TE>
<TE>   This was all about petty party turf. Parsky had led a party
overhaul that stripped Steel of some power. Steel, a Palos Verdes
Peninsula lawyer, has been waging a losing guerrilla counterattack.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's going like, 'Whaaaa?,' " said Colusa County party
chairman Jerry Maltby, a cattleman and rice grower. "This isn't why
we're here."</TE>
<TE>   State Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks angrily
walked out.</TE>
<TE>   Simon state chairman John Herrington of Walnut Creek later told
Steel, sarcastically: "Thank you for devoting this meeting to Bill
Simon and the governor's race."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday didn't dawn any brighter for the Simon camp.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the campaign was "jolted
by a tug-of-war between the candidate and his advisors over the
direction and tone of his television ads."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins was so upset that he skipped the convention, although a
car accident Wednesday night left him with a concussion and a valid
excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say that Rollins got mad because Simon--at his wife
Cindy's behest--deleted this line from a new ad: "I'm not perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins and ad-maker Larry McCarthy--two political veterans with
many victories to their credit--theorized that the line would show
Simon's humility and manfully acknowledge past missteps. But Cindy
Simon objected to her husband's conceding any imperfection.</TE>
<TE>   The two gurus and Herrington also got irked at Russo for not
fighting for the ad. But there's much more to it than that. The
episode illustrates a widening rift between Russo and Herrington, who
haven't gotten along in weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, insiders say, Rollins recently replaced Russo as the No.
1 strategist. Russo denies it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever. As one delegate--former Lafayette Mayor Thomas
Cleveland--put it while discussing the party and campaign squabbles:
"This is the kind of intense fighting that losers do--like losing
athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to act like winners."</TE>
<TE>   Stu Spencer--retired guru of gurus--told me last week: "The party
has got to forget this stuff about 'I'd rather be right than win.'
The mind-set has got to be pragmatic."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP does seem to be moving in that direction, slowly.
Increasing numbers of grass-roots activists want to dump the party's
antiabortion platform plank.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a divisive issue that's politicized on both sides," notes
farmer Maltby.</TE>
<TE>   Some GOP leaders, in fact, privately advocate tearing up the state
party platform entirely and never writing another. One national party
platform is enough, they say. The goal should be to elect
Republicans, not impose a religious faith.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many note, rather than pummeling the president's pal, the
state chairman should be drubbing Democrats--especially at a
Republican convention.</TE>
<TE>   But biannual conventions are just wasteful dens of potential
trouble. Democrats long ago figured that out too.</TE>

<HD>Credit Card Thefts at Gyms May Be Part of a Ring</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Federal agents are looking into the incidents at
health clubs in Ventura County, which fit a pattern seen around the
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit card thefts at Ventura County health clubs in the last year
are being investigated by federal authorities for a possible link to
a larger fraud ring targeting gyms nationwide, officials said this
week.</LD>
<LD>   "This has been going on for a long time," said Capt. Frank
O'Hanlon, who heads the Sheriff Department's East County Major Crimes
Unit. "Don't bring your valuables to the club. Don't leave them in
the car. Go with the basic minimum of a driver's license and maybe $5
for some juice."</LD>
<LD>   O'Hanlon said the investigation into the local thefts is being
handled by federal agents.</LD>
<TE>   Health clubs are easy targets for professional thieves, O'Hanlon
said. Many members work out before or after work, so chances are good
they will have cash, credit cards and jewelry with them.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a thief will steal a credit card from a locker by
tripping the latch on the locker door much like opening a car lock,
O'Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   In previous cases, the credit card numbers stolen from clubs are
e-mailed to accomplices on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are punched into stolen blank credit cards. A
transaction is attempted at an automated teller machine to make sure
the card is active. Then the number is forwarded to a Las Vegas
casino where a larger transaction is attempted.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested two West
Hollywood men in connection with a burglary ring targeting several
east county health clubs. They were released on bail but remain the
subject of a federal probe because the alleged thefts involved
interstate transactions, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence, however, has linked the two men to the current wave
of thefts, O'Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   He said some health club officials have been less than fully
cooperative in the probe out of a fear that a negative public
perception would lead to a drop in memberships.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Matevosian said he is convinced that two of his credit card
numbers were stolen from his wallet while he worked out Sept. 11 at a
Thousand Oaks gym.</TE>
<TE>   "I locked up my locker and everything was where I put it," he
said. "That evening, I put the wallet in my pocket and a credit card
company's fraud department called to ask me if I had I tried to
transfer $2,000 in Las Vegas. I told them no."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Matevosian, his credit card company didn't honor the
order and he canceled his credit cards. But others aren't so lucky,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at several Thousand Oaks health clubs said members have
filed reports of thefts from their lockers or cars.</TE>
<TE>   In response, clubs have posted signs at entrances, increased
security patrols in the surrounding parking lots and encouraged
members to leave wallets and purses at home.</TE>
<TE>   At the Spectrum Club Thousand Oaks, spokeswoman Jana Wahlstrom
said officials are aware of the recent thefts and have increased the
monitoring of security cameras at the gym. They also require photo
identification for entry.</TE>
<TE>   At Body Focus Health Spa in Thousand Oaks, general manager Glenda
Zittell said, "We have made every attempt to educate members. We will
go out in the parking lot and if we see a purse in a car, we will
page the member.</TE>
<TE>   "But health clubs aren't the lone rangers here," she said. "It's
anywhere you park your car in Thousand Oaks."</TE>

<HD>Patagonia Is a Winner With Moms</HD>
<DH>Business: For the 13th year, Working Mother magazine puts
the Ventura-based clothing maker on its list of 100 best companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patagonia has done it again.</LD>
<LD>   Months after being named one of the best companies to work for in
America by Fortune magazine, the Ventura-based outdoor clothing maker
has been awarded a similar honor by Working Mother magazine.</LD>
<LD>   For the 13th year, the publication, in its September issue, placed
Patagonia on its annual list of the 100 best companies for working
mothers, citing the company's on-site child-care center, generous
parental leave policy and flexible work schedules that allow parents
to tend to family needs.</LD>
<TE>   The New York-based magazine also cited Patagonia's commitment to
the advancement of its female work force, noting that women comprise
half of the company's executive pool and make up more than half of
its top money earn- ers.</TE>
<TE>   "It really covers all the bases," Working Mother Editor-In-Chief
Jill Kirschenbaum said of the mom-friendly manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   "Patagonia is a very progressive company, so it should not come as
any surprise that the company would continue to make our list."</TE>
<TE>   Patagonia was one of only eight California companies--and the only
one in Ventura County--to make the Working Mother list, which debuted
17 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has 1,000 employees worldwide and last year
rang up sales of $220 million, has long been recognized for its
willingness to blur the lines between work and home life.</TE>
<TE>   Patagonia provides flexible work schedules and gives new mothers
and fathers two months paid leave. It offers yoga classes and surf
lessons and encourages workers, when the waves are good, to grab
their boards and head for the water.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1984, it also has offered low-cost, on-site child care to
its workers, a spinoff of the days when Patagonia founder Yvon
Chouinard and other pioneer employees would bring their children to
work with them.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the child-care center serves nearly 100 youngsters, from
infants to school-age children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually a wonderful reward of working here," said Santa
Barbara resident Julie Ringler, Patagonia's vice president for
production.</TE>
<TE>   Her 4-year-old son, Jackson Powell, has been in the day-care
program since he was 4 months old.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned to work, Ringler said company leaders made it
easy for her to nurse her newborn son and visit with him as often as
she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   That connection continues today, as Ringler routinely visits the
boy on the playground, joins him for a snack and lunch and brings him
up to her office to spend quality time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I could have come back to work if I didn't have this
option available to me," Ringler said. "It's pretty amazing that a
company would do this."</TE>
<TE>   Patagonia Chief Executive Michael Crooke said such programs are
not only good for parents, they make good business sense.</TE>
<TE>   By helping balance work and family life, Crooke said Patagonia
wins the loyalty of valuable employees, creating an environment where
workers perform their best and are eager to see the company succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "Helping all our employees with work-life balance is a critical
component of our success," said Crooke, who has guided the company
for three years.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of national recognition is nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Fortune magazine named Patagonia one of the 100
best companies to work for in America, citing the clothing maker as a
shining example of corporate excellence in times of recession and
layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The company has made Fortune's list each of the five years it has
been published, ranking 41st this year.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Working Mother honorees were noted for their refusal
to roll back benefits during these times of recession and for an
increased emphasis, especially in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, on flexible scheduling and use of family leave for its
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Crooke said it's nice to receive such notice, but it's not what
drives Patagonia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we just started these programs last year to get on
someone's list," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes back to the idea that Patagonia is not just this product
or that product; Patagonia is a community of people woven together
just like our clothing," Crooke said.</TE>

<HD>Time Is Wiping Out Wedge Surf Purists</HD>
<DH>Sports: The ranks of aging bodysurfers who ride giant waves
at the Balboa site are thinning, leaving it to 'lemmings' on
bodyboards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's shortly before 10 a.m., and the Wedge seems to be on steroids.
Hurricane Hernan is sending meaty 6- to 8-foot swells into the
world-famous surf spot on the tip of the Balboa Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   At this freak of physics, the incoming walls of water carom off a
rock jetty and collide with the following swells, morphing them into
giant, triangular waves with vertical faces of 15 to 20 feet.</LD>
<LD>   They break close to shore with explosions of white water,
cavernous tubes and the rumble of a freight train. Their power can
hurl people skyward or drive them mercilessly into the shallow sand
bottom. The beach vibrates.</LD>
<TE>   Near the "Danger: High Surf" sign, a small fraternity of aging
bodysurfers and a few of their young proteges prepare to take on the
mountainous waves with swim fins and scanty Speedos.</TE>
<TE>   They are the venerable Wedge Crew, the Knights Templar for a few
hundred yards of beach and water.</TE>
<TE>   For years, this dedicated band of purists has advanced the
esoteric art of bodysurfing, and for years they have tried to protect
their niche against the onslaught of the bodyboard--a popular,
mass-produced slab of plastic so easy to use that the dead could ride
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a special kind of person to look at a powerful wave and
try to tackle it with no vehicle," said Tom "Cash Box" Kennedy, a
38-year-old Laguna Niguel resident who's been a fixture at the Wedge
for almost 23 years. "There is magic in the combination of you and
the wave and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   Probably no more than 40 people bodysurf the Wedge, and only half
that number brave the water from May through October, when storms in
the Southern Hemisphere churn up the powerful ground swells that make
this place famous.</TE>
<TE>   The following is small--almost cultlike--and seems to be
shrinking. Age, injury and the demands of job and family have thinned
the ranks, and Generation Next seems less willing to conquer a
towering wave with only its hide.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the roster includes a grocer, a biologist, a
holistic-health counselor, a flight instructor, a swim fin
manufacturer, a professional photographer, grandfathers and the
unemployed. With a few exceptions, they are in their late 30s, 40s
and 50s. The youngest is 16. The oldest, at 64, is Fred Simpson, a
pioneering bodysurfer who owns Viper Swim Fins. He started going to
the Wedge in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Some adorn themselves with Wedge tattoos, and virtually all answer
to nicknames: Smoker, Sac, Beets, Potato Head, Tank, Big Daddy,
Pinkie, Dandyman, Daddy-O and Rock.</TE>
<TE>   They have their own daily surf report recorded by Kevin "Mel"
Thoman, 45, of Corona del Mar, a clothing line called Wedge Wear and
a cocktail mixed in their honor--you guessed it, the Wedge--an elixir
of white and gold tequila, mandarine Curacao, Triple Sec and
pineapple-orange drink. The Studio Cafe on Balboa Peninsula serves
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wedge has become so much a part of my life, I lose sleep over
it," said Ron "Romo" Romanosky, a professional photographer who has
chronicled the surf spot since the 1960s. "It is hard to get the
addiction out of your system."</TE>
<TE>   What keeps the brethren coming back year after year, decade after
decade, is the wave--a tricky, unpredictable beast at any size. When
a swell hits, appointments get canceled, trips are rescheduled, sick
days at work are leveraged and family obligations go unfulfilled.
Some members of the crew have been known to wear swim trunks under
their work clothes. Just in case.</TE>
<TE>   On big days, bodysurfers can go from near-standing starts to 30
mph in seconds. The acceleration is so great it feels as if they are
being sprayed with a fire hose and their skin is rolling back.</TE>
<TE>   The ride begins by being sucked up the steep face of an oncoming
wave while swimming forward. Below the flagging crest, a few strong
kicks generally produce enough momentum to get going.</TE>
<TE>   Once the rider is underway, the left arm is angled downward and
the right arm is extended toward the sky. The back is arched and
rotated against the wave's face, while the legs hug the vertical
wall. Water explodes in all directions, and the roar is deafening.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get a perfect Wedge wave, it closes over your head. The
sun goes out," said Simpson, who helped develop modern bodysurfing
techniques. For all the thrills and sense of accomplishment the Wedge
bestows, there are serious risks. Rip currents drag swimmers around
or trap them in front of huge waves that break with such force they
can knock people out.</TE>
<TE>   Water rushing off the steep beach can smack into incoming waves,
tossing surfers into the air. The turbulence can become so severe
that swimmers have a hard time making headway. On the beach, the
tempestuous surge can pluck unwary spectators off the sand and roll
them into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The Wedge remains one of the few beaches, if not the only one, on
the West Coast where lifeguards caution visitors before they put down
their towels.</TE>
<TE>   "Small days can break bones. Big days can drown you," said Matt
Larson, 31, of Irvine, who has bodysurfed the break since he was a
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Compression fractures of vertebrae and wrists are common among the
Wedge crew. So are ruptured discs, torn ligaments and concussions.
One regular, 42-year-old Terry Wade, has smacked the bottom so many
times that the bones in his lower spine are fused and held together
with a titanium brace. He now teaches flying in Bakersfield and
contemplates a return next year. "There are few places where someone
can ride a 30-foot wave bodysurfing. The Wedge is one of them," Wade
said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Works Progress Administration created the wave machine
by accident in the 1930s when it built a jetty at the end of the
Balboa Peninsula to protect the entrance to Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Wedge was first known as the Hook. Surfers considered the
large waves unridable. Then a handful of people started bodysurfing
there after World War II. More ventured in during the '50s and early
'60s, such as Simpson and Romanosky, a knee-boarder who is tight with
the bodysurfers.</TE>
<TE>   The Wedge became so popular in the early 1990s that the small
contingent of bodysurfers felt their art was being squeezed out by a
growing throng of bodyboarders. It was a trend that exploded with the
advent of the Morey Boogie Board, a stubby piece of plastic foam that
made it relatively easy to catch waves. Shrink-wrapped and sold even
in drugstores, the little board opened up wave-riding to the masses.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be a little tightknit group in the 1970s," said
Bill Sharp, 41, a veteran knee-boarder and editor of Surf News
Magazine in Newport Beach. "Now, it's 'Y'all come.' "</TE>
<TE>   The result was tension in the water and frustration for the
outnumbered bodysurfers who had spent years honing their skills. To
their dismay, the flotillas of bodyboarders--known derisively as
"boogers," "spongeheads" and "lemmings"--could catch waves almost
effortlessly on the forgiving slabs of plastic.</TE>
<TE>   The fabled break, Romanosky said, had regressed into "a soulless
mosh pit of surfing."</TE>
<TE>   To save their place in the lineup, Wade, Thoman and Kennedy formed
the Wedge Preservation Society in 1993 and asked the Newport Beach
City Council to ban all boards. A war erupted between the groups of
wave-riders.</TE>
<TE>   In a partial victory for the Wedge Preservation Society, the City
Council agreed to let bodysurfers have the break to themselves from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. May through October, the high season for big waves.
But at times, especially when the lifeguard tower is empty and no
city officials are around to enforce the ban, the battle over the
breakers resumes.</TE>
<TE>   The larger problem for the bodysurfers is attracting fresh blood.
While the Wedge Crew likes its underground status, the core group is
beginning to fade. Wade is on the injured list. Craig "Quebe" Bowman,
48, died a few weeks ago. Simpson has stopped surfing because of a
slipped disc and skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the crew converts a bodyboarder to its religion. But
that remains a hard sell. "Everyone rides a Boogie now," said Thoman,
the unofficial leader of the preservation society. "It takes a lot of
time and energy to be a good bodysurfer. It seems like you're always
paying your dues."</TE>

<HD>Political Donors Shielded by Loophole</HD>
<DH>Election: A corporation whose officers are secret is a
major contributor to California propositions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The name of the mysterious Philadelphia corporation alone makes
campaign finance watchdogs suspicious.</LD>
<LD>   "They call themselves Free Buffet?" asked Kim Alexander, president
of the nonprofit California Voter Foundation, pondering whether that
is a reference to a free buffet of perks and influence at the
statehouse.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it's Freba Fay. Freba Fay LLC.</LD>
<TE>   The out-of-state limited-liability corporation with no known
officers or shareholders has become a leading donor to California
ballot initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Try to find out who this LLC belongs to, and you hit a dead end.</TE>
<TE>   The agent the donor or donors hired to form the corporation--a man
named John Taylor--won't say. Pennsylvania law doesn't require that
the officers' names be disclosed. And groups that have received hefty
contributions from them say they simply don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to play 20 questions with you," Taylor said when
asked who is behind the company. He described the corporate officers
as philanthropists who want to help the environment and who have no
financial interest in the initiative, Proposition 51, which would
fund alternative transportation and open-space projects statewide,
including several that would be a boon to builders.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggest the group is a front for one of the landowners who
could make millions if a November ballot initiative passes.</TE>
<TE>   Freba Fay's latest donation was a $100,000 check made out to
supporters of Proposition 51.</TE>
<TE>   Other private companies making large contributions did so in their
own names. They include mega-developers Newhall Land and Farming,
Tejon Ranch and Sun Ridge, all of which have projects or property
included in the initiative and stand to gain if it is approved.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the measure are betting Freba Fay stands to gain from
the proposition too.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they won't disclose who they are suggests to me
they have some specific goodie in the initiative," said Lenny
Goldberg, campaign director for No on 51.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor insists that is not the case, pointing as evidence to the
one other donation the corporation has made in California: $120,000
to groups fighting Proposition 22, the ballot measure approved in
2000 that prohibits gay marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously that is not the kind of thing a developer would have
obvious pecuniary interest in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So do these philanthropists come from California?</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get into that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The secrecy makes advocates for campaign finance reform uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   Full disclosure of campaign finances in initiative campaigns is
becoming even more important, they say, because of new limits on
contributions in federal elections and the recently adopted caps to
California candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The initiatives have no contribution caps, and officials at the
secretary of state's office say that even though campaign finance
laws are intended to prohibit anonymous donations, the scheme Freba
Fay used is legal.</TE>
<TE>   If the company had been formed in California, the names of its
officers would be on file in Sacramento. But in some other states,
including Pennsylvania, those names needn't be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing more and more of this lately," said Robert Stern,
president of the Center for Governmental Studies, a Los Angeles
nonprofit focused on campaign finance issues.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something the Fair Political Practices Commission should
be interested in."</TE>
<TE>   Commission spokeswoman Sigrid Bathen said disclosure in such cases
has not been a big issue for the FPPC. "There are no specific rules
relating to limited-liability corporations," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Freba Fay's donations follow the pattern of two Seattle
limited-liability corporations called Wild Rose and Rosebud.</TE>
<TE>   Those companies, which gave $1 million to two California park bond
initiatives in 2000, also had no known officers. Their address was a
post office box in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   After state lawmakers began asking questions and calling publicly
for their officers to reveal their identities, oil fortune heiress
and environmental philanthropist Caroline Getty disclosed that she
was the donor behind Wild Rose and Rosebud.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say the shielded donations have exposed a troubling
loophole in the system. An industry could bankroll an entire ballot
initiative without ever revealing any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "When there isn't full disclosure, it raises questions about
whether there is a quid pro quo taking place," Alexander said.
"Voters are entitled to know who you are and what your agenda might
be."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg suggests that if Freba Fay has no financial interest in
Proposition 51, its officers should have no problem revealing who
they are.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an unidentified parcel of land along a tributary of the
Sacramento River that is specifically designated for purchase in the
initiative," Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to figure out who that land is related to.
But whoever it is will get $10 million if it is approved. How do we
know that is not Freba Fay?"</TE>

<HD>Loan Keeps Food on Table</HD>
<DH>Finance: Three million dollars from county agency saves
150 jobs and Valley company that makes frozen pot pies, pizza and
pasta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pietro Vitale slammed his gnarled 84-year-old fist on a table.</LD>
<LD>   "The last two, three years have been tough," said Vitale, owner of
Oh Boy, a San Fernando frozen food plant that has employed thousands
of people and made millions of pizzas over the last 48 years. "But
you never give up! You have to endure."</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Oh Boy was in serious trouble. High-interest loans and
exorbitant energy bills were about to force the closure of the
landmark food corporation, which has 150 employees. But Vitale, the
company's colorful Naples-born owner, wasn't ready to lock up his 1st
Street plant without a fight. Filing for bankruptcy, he decided, was
out of the question.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Vitale was desperate. Not so much for himself--he lives in
upscale Brentwood with his wife Concetta--but for his employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I've enjoyed them for 50 years and I supported them with jobs,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he turned to local government officials for help. Ultimately,
it came in the form of a $3-million loan announced Friday by the Los
Angeles County Float Loan Program, which lends money to cities that
then pass it on to local businesses.</TE>
<TE>   For Vitale and others celebrating the company's survival and its
continuing role as a community institution, the overwhelming
sentiment was that it would not have happened without a team effort.
They recalled the stress and strain of the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The week before Thanksgiving 2001, San Fernando City Administrator
Jose Pulido took a call from Vitale, who was fearful he would have to
close by the end of the year. Pulido, who had been on the job only
two months, contacted the Valley Economic Development Center, a
nonprofit business development corporation based in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Barragan, president of the corporation, checked out Oh Boy
and found the company was burdened with high-interest loans. One
account was calling for an immediate payment of $240,000, which
Barragan's group lent to Vitale. Another $2.4 million in loans owed
by Oh Boy was refinanced Friday by the Float Loan Program.</TE>
<TE>   The new loan has a 6.75% interest rate, down from Vitale's
previous 12%, which will save thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the company had $17 million in gross sales. "We almost
broke even" Vitale said, adding that his goal is to get to $20
million this year and continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   During a tour of his plant, Vitale showed off the meatball room,
the pasta room and the room where the company makes chicken pot pies
for the Claim Jumper restaurant chain.</TE>
<TE>   On the main assembly line, 45 workers prepared packaged dinners of
chicken and rice in cream sauce. There was little noise other than
the rumble of conveyor belts.</TE>
<TE>   Cuta Agugnana, who was spreading sliced mushrooms over a chicken,
smiled when she saw Vitale. "My boss will do anything for me," said
Agugnana, who has been working at Oh Boy for 44 years. "He's the
best."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a white smock, a crisp blue shirt and snazzy yellow tie,
Vitale greeted his workers by name, tenderly patting some of them on
the cheek. Sometimes he called them "sweetie."</TE>
<TE>   Vitale came to America in 1948 to try his luck at importing and
exporting Italian food products. After a few frustrating years, he
decided to produce a line of frozen Italian foods.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming his secret to success is "a little scotch, a little
vino," Vitale said he got the name for his company from American
soldiers in Italy, who said, "Oh boy!" when they saw something they
liked.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly half a century, he has driven to the San Fernando plant
six days a week. His sons, John and Peter, help him run the business.</TE>
<TE>   Both Pulido and Barragan praised Vitale as a pillar of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an incredible gentleman full of life who believed in his
employees," said Barragan. "When we talk about saving jobs, it's
often very cliche. But in this case, we really did save jobs. If we
didn't do this, 150 people, most of them Latino, most of them from
San Fernando, would be unemployed."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Cabinet resigned en masse
today, paving the way for him to name a new lineup in an effort to
shore up his economic reform plans.</LD>
<LD>   The 17 ministers handed in their resignations during a Cabinet
meeting at Koizumi's official residence. Koizumi was to name his new
lineup later today, and they would then be formally approved by
Emperor Akihito.</LD>
<LD>   The shakeup was the first since Koizumi took office in April 2001.
Most of his main ministers were expected to retain their posts, with
the move seen more as a means for his administration to reaffirm its
unity behind his fiscal policies.</LD>

comply with U.N. demands.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three Democratic congressmen urged President Bush on Sunday to mute
his war rhetoric, as Iraqi officials assured them that U.N.
inspectors would have unfettered access to weapons sites.</LD>
<LD>   Reps. Jim McDermott of Washington and David E. Bonior of Michigan,
in Iraq during the weekend to assess the humanitarian situation
there, said Baghdad should be allowed to comply with U.N. demands
without the threat of military action.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi officials "said they would allow us to go look anywhere we
wanted," McDermott said on ABC-TV's "This Week" news program. "And
until they don't do that, there is no need to do this coercive stuff
where you bring in helicopters and armed people and storm buildings."</LD>
<TE>   The two lawmakers and Rep. Mike Thompson of St. Helena, Calif.,
met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri and Deputy Prime Minister
Tarik Aziz.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraq has promised to allow monitors to return, Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Saturday that his nation would not
submit to inspections under any new U.N. resolution that threatens
military action or incorporates demands by the Bush administration to
revise inspection rules.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S.-drafted resolution would require Iraq to fully disclose any
weapons of mass destruction within 30 days of passage or face
military action.</TE>

<HD>300 Cheers for N. Korean Team</HD>
<DH>Sports: In one of several firsts, athletes from the
North--and their pep squad--are taking part as South hosts Asian
Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PUSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>It was the North Korean cheerleaders who stole the show.</LD>
<LD>   At the opening of the 14th Asian Games here Sunday, there were
East Timorese athletes marking their newborn nation's debut in the
tournament and an Afghan delegation that had spent five days
traveling from its ravaged homeland. There were fireworks, lasers,
marching bands and special effects.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing attracted as much attention as a cheering squad of 300
North Koreans, most of them attractive women in their 20s who waved
tiny flags featuring North Korea's red star.</LD>
<TE>   This is the first time that North Korea has participated in an
international sporting event in South Korea. But what is more
remarkable than the northern nation's 184 competing athletes is the
presence of the North Korean fans who have come to cheer them on.</TE>
<TE>   The estranged Koreas have held dozens of joint events over the
last two years, ranging from circuses to family reunions. But this
delegation of more than 600, including coaches and officials, is by
far the largest from North Korea to come south since the end of the
Korean War in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   The historic occasion has spurred the breaking of many taboos.
This is the first time the North Korean flag has been legally
displayed in South Korea. The ferry that brought the fans Saturday
after a 20-hour journey is the first North Korean passenger vessel to
sail through South Korean waters and be moored at a South Korean
port.</TE>
<TE>   Docked on the outskirts of Pusan, the Mangyongbong 92 has quickly
become a major tourist attraction. On Sunday, hundreds of South
Koreans came to pose with babies and elderly parents for photographs
of the vessel, which has a North Korean flag painted on its
smokestack.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy they are here. It is a long time since the war. They
are most welcome," said Byon Oak Su, 74, who wore a traditional
festive gown for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean cheerleaders will take most of their meals and
will sleep on the ferry under heavy security. Unlike other
delegations, they will not tour Pusan or check out its restaurants
and stores--thereby minimizing any chance that they might chat with
ordinary South Koreans or dare to think about defecting.</TE>
<TE>   "Once in a while, they come out and you can see them on the deck.
Sometimes they wave at us," said Kim Kwang Eul, 37, a curiosity
seeker who was with a crowd waiting Sunday for a glimpse of the
elusive North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Kim said he understood why the North Koreans are being kept
separate.</TE>
<TE>   "We have such different lifestyles. If they were all of a sudden
to see how South Koreans live, it might be a shock," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the opening ceremony, the North Koreans were elusive,
seated in a separate section surrounded by beefy black-clad South
Korean security guards who shooed away representatives of the media
and anyone else who came too close. Security has been so tight around
the North Koreans that an official South Korean cheerleading squad
had to cancel plans for joint cheering sessions and rallies.</TE>
<TE>   The security has also reduced the South Korean paparazzi to using
long lenses aimed at the ferry to capture the occasional shot.</TE>
<TE>   The cheerleaders are not like their American counterparts. They
wear modest, flowing silk gowns in the traditional Korean style, wave
flags and sing songs. Some belong to a marching band, while others
are university students or members of a youth movement of the Korean
Workers' Party.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean television has speculated endlessly about the women,
making coy references to the popular belief among South Korean men
that women from the North are more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only me. Everyone in North Korea is pretty," one North Korean
cheerleader said to a South Korean journalist who was able to shout a
question.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the barriers making it difficult for North and South
Koreans to chat, the opening ceremony was replete with symbolic
gestures of togetherness. As the crowd gave a thunderous standing
ovation, northerners and southerners marched together in the
ceremony. In a deft solution to protocol problems, a South Korean
handball player and a North Korean soccer player together carried a
banner known as the "unity flag," which features a pale blue
silhouette of the Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Olympic gold medalist Kye Sun Hui, a judo champion and one
of the best-known female athletes in North Korea, ran around the
track with South Korean judo gold medalist Ha Hyung Ju carrying the
torch to launch the games.</TE>
<TE>   "This torch symbolizes the historic meeting of the Koreas and
tying the first knot toward unification," Ha later told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few northern athletes to talk to the media, the
7-foot-9-inch basketball player Ri Myong Hun echoed that observation,
telling reporters, "North Korea wants reunification very much, and
for that reason, North Korea took part in the Asian Games this time."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of participants, this tournament is the largest ever,
with 44 delegations and 6,700 athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the North Koreans, the most attention has been paid to
the Afghans, who are participating for the first time in nearly 20
years and barely made it because of their difficulty in traveling
outside Afghanistan. They have 25 athletes participating, including a
female taekwondo adept who was banned from the sport under the
now-deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor is the newest nation participating. The Palestinians
also made a stir at the opening ceremony, as the only delegation
carrying a photograph of their leader--Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament runs through Oct. 14.</TE>

<HD>Pemex Oil Workers Agree to 7.3% Raise</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Settlement is seen as a victory for Fox. Meanwhile,
anti-graft efforts win praise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico averted a crippling strike at its state-owned oil monopoly
Sunday as union members agreed to a 7.3% pay increase, a settlement
seen as a victory for President Vicente Fox in his ongoing effort to
curb corruption and the union's political power.</LD>
<LD>   In signing a one-year deal, the Oil Workers Union of Petroleos
Mexicanos, or Pemex, agreed to a pay raise far below the 15% it had
demanded. The union had threatened a strike Tuesday that would have
disrupted oil exports to the United States and thrown Mexico's
oil-dependent economy for a loop.</LD>
<LD>   In challenging the 92,000-member union closely tied to the once
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Fox portrayed the
wage demand as "blackmail" to force his government to withdraw fraud
charges against union leaders in connection with the alleged
diversion of $170 million in Pemex funds to the PRI's 2000
presidential campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fox's efforts on another anti-corruption
fight--homicide charges brought against three high-ranking Mexican
army officers for alleged involvement in the nation's "dirty war"
against dissidents--drew praise over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are the first lodged against army officers in the
disappearance of hundreds of government opponents thought to have
died at the hands of the police and military between the late 1960s
and early 1980s. They came as Fox, who took office nearly two years
ago, is still striving to deliver on a campaign promise to clean up
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The action by a military tribunal last week could also give
"coherence and legitimacy" to Fox's campaign to prosecute the union
leaders and other cases, said Jorge Chabat, a crime and security
expert at the Mexico City-based Center for Economic Research and
Teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly gives Fox more authority with which to apply the law
against civilians, whether in the dirty war or other matters," Chabat
said. "He can now say that not even the military has immunity."</TE>
<TE>   A military tribunal charged two generals, Mario Arturo Acosta
Chaparro and Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo, who have been imprisoned
since 2000 on drug trafficking charges. A third officer, retired Maj.
Francisco Barquin, was arrested in connection with the deaths of 143
people. Relatives and other witnesses testified that the missing
leftists were last seen in the officers' custody.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that there remain questions surrounding the alleged crimes,
Sergio Aguayo, a political science professor at Colegio de Mexico,
said the charges are important because they were brought against
high-ranking players in the "security apparatus created by the state"
to combat government opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation will continue, given that there is a social
grievance that society will continue to insist on pursuing," Aguayo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other observers, however, including political scientist Pamela
Starr of the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, or ITAM,
said the charges might have less to do with Fox than with an effort
by the military to "inoculate itself" against charges of
responsibility for two massacres, in 1968 and 1971, by serving up
"sacrificial victims with little political risk."</TE>
<TE>   "These are generals who already appear to be definitely guilty.
They were implicated in drug trafficking," Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosario Ibarra, president of the Eureka Committee, an advocacy
group for the families of hundreds of "disappeared" from past
decades, said the charges didn't go far enough because they failed to
say who might have ordered the officers to commit murder.</TE>
<TE>   Federico Estevez, also an ITAM professor, added that the Pemex
fraud case is the "acid test" for the Fox government, which swept to
victory in July 2000 on a tide of public optimism that it would fight
corruption, past and present.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fox government found it could no longer slide on its promise
to challenge the powerful remnants of the old system," Estevez said.
"He blows this one and it goes to the heart of his campaign message."</TE>
<TE>   Chabat said: "You cannot legitimize enforcing the law unless you
enforce it for everyone. How can union leaders claim immunity if even
the generals are in jail?"</TE>

<HD>Fear and Loathing in Kuwait</HD>
<DH>Gulf: The emirate expects reprisal from Iraq for any U.S.
strike. Still, there is a desire to topple the 'evil cancer,'
Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>At the Al Walima Coffee Shop in this capital's old downtown, the talk
is all about Saddam Hussein and about President Bush's threat to use
U.S. military power to force a regime change in Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   "America should remove Saddam as quickly as possible. He is a
cancer, an evil, evil cancer," said owner Hassan Abdullah Zackariah,
55.</LD>
<LD>   As the United States and Britain continue their push to get
Hussein to knuckle under to their demands, Zackariah's sentiment is
common among the men who spend their afternoons here drinking tea,
smoking water pipes, discussing politics and watching the Arab news
network Al Jazeera.</LD>
<TE>   But Zackariah and the others also worry that if the U.S. moves to
topple Hussein, Iraq will retaliate by attacking Kuwait, possibly
with missiles carrying chemical or biological weapons or by
sabotaging the oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, who view Kuwait as a launch site for a possible
attack on Iraq, argue that no country in the region would benefit as
much from Hussein's ouster. Maybe so, but no country is more nervous
about suffering collateral damage either.</TE>
<TE>   "The day the U.S. attacks Saddam, he will attack Kuwait, for
sure," said Zackariah, whose establishment was closed and ransacked
by Iraqi soldiers during their brutal seven-month occupation in 1990
and 1991. Abu Muhanned, 50, a retired employee of the Ministry of
Commerce, agreed: "Everybody is afraid for Kuwait. Kuwait suffered
very much."</TE>
<TE>   Arabic- and English-language newspapers here are closely
monitoring the movement of U.S. military personnel and weaponry to
what is called Camp Doha--actually a portion of a Kuwaiti air base
that has been dedicated for use by the U.S. And, while attempting to
avoid an appearance of crisis, the government is announcing new steps
nearly every day to reassure citizens that it is prepared to
withstand an Iraqi attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Health announced last week that it has imported
specially designed tents to withstand chemical or biological warfare
by providing pressured air. The move was made in "the face of
expected 'events' in the region." Half a million gas masks are in
storage.</TE>
<TE>   The government has also declared that it is planning an early
warning system so residents will know if a nuclear, biological or
chemical attack is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, gas masks are also selling briskly, some Kuwaitis are
planning to leave the country if war is declared, and the Kuwait
Stock Exchange is plunging.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are themselves paying $13,000 or more for airtight
tents that promise to protect their families for up to 500 hours from
biological or chemical agents in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. strikes Iraq, Saddam will take his fury out on us,"
said Abdullah Mina, 32, a banker who bought one of the tents.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no indication that the U.S. has even a fraction
of the personnel or equipment at Camp Doha that would be needed to
launch an offensive, each new report in the local press seems to
ratchet up both Kuwaitis' eagerness to be rid of Hussein and their
apprehension about being on the front line.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers last week featured front-page stories about the arrival
of more Patriot missiles, defensive weapons meant to shoot down
incoming Scud missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriot batteries are to be deployed around the Ali al Salem
and Ahmad al Jaber air bases, where the U.S. and British aircraft
that enforce the "no-fly" zone in southern Iraq are stationed. The
presence of the Patriots is both reassuring and unsettling to the
Kuwaitis.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not afraid for myself, but I am afraid of the destruction,"
Hassan Askanani, 51, a pharmacist, said as the image of Condoleezza
Rice, Bush's national security advisor, was being shown on Al
Jazeera.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a massive rebuilding program, the physical and psychic
scars from the Iraqi invasion 12 years ago have yet to heal
completely in this country of 2.2 million that sits atop 9% of the
world's oil.</TE>
<TE>   A study done last year for the World Health Organization concluded
that 20% of ethnic Kuwaitis--who were singled out for particular
brutality by the Iraqis-- suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Land mines still litter the desert and Faylakah island, Kuwait's
main archeological site.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, though, civil defense training--including some conducted
by German and Czech military personnel--has been stepped up, and
school evacuation drills have been ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be safe. Everybody in Kuwait wants to be safe if the
Americans go after Saddam," said Khaled Sabah, 32, an accountant. "My
wife is worried about the children. Everybody is worried about the
children."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say U.S. authorities have inquired about the number of
doctors and the availability of certain medicines.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce announced that it will issue
food rationing cards to non-Kuwaitis in case food supplies are
threatened. Kuwaitis, who are outnumbered by the expatriates, already
have such cards.</TE>
<TE>   With uncertainty in the air, rumors are also taking hold. One was
that the U.S. Embassy had ordered all Americans to leave because a
strike was imminent. The embassy, which received numerous calls,
denied that any such order or advisory had been issued.</TE>
<TE>   To veteran Kuwait watchers, the edginess is not unexpected as the
rhetoric escalates between Washington and Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kuwaitis have an educated opinion about what war is like,"
said Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), one of Congress' leading experts
on the Persian Gulf. "This is a nation that knows what it's like to
be hostages and refugees."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Jabbar al Sabah has said
that while Kuwait would endorse a U.S. strike if it was backed by a
United Nations resolution, it opposes a unilateral strike by the
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Sheik Jabbar Mubarak al Sabah said he has no
doubt Hussein would strike Kuwait, a comment that sent a jolt through
the local populace.</TE>
<TE>   "History has proved that the Iraqi regime has no moral or
political restraint from launching any action against its own people
or neighbors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, U.S. officials insist that support for the U.S. is stronger
here than in any other Persian Gulf nation. Even local Islamic
political figures, who have criticized U.S. policies toward
Afghanistan and Israel, support a tough stand against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Issa said he believes Kuwaitis do not want to be seen as backing
the U.S. unequivocally out of concern that that would be interpreted
as a desire for revenge against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But, he noted, the Kuwaitis have two major grievances against
Hussein, both of which the Bush administration is citing as proof of
the Iraqi leader's treachery: Baghdad's refusal to pay war
reparations to Kuwait and its failure to provide an accounting of
600-plus Kuwaitis who disappeared during the occupation.</TE>
<TE>   In returning from the United Nations last week, the foreign
minister noted with approval that the resolution being sought by the
U.S. and Britain cites the Kuwaiti POW issue as one of the reasons
for a possible strike against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 9,000 U.S. troops are now at Camp Doha, which was
established after the liberation of Kuwait in February 1991. Tanks,
heavy artillery, bombers and C-130 gunships are being repositioned
here from other regional bases, including those in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   A thousand combat Marines from Camp Pendleton arrived last week
for a month of live-fire desert-warfare training with Kuwaiti
soldiers along the Kuwait-Iraq border.</TE>
<TE>   Although the training was scheduled long before the recent crisis,
Marine officials have made clear that it could be put to immediate
use. One training exercise will involve how to continue fighting if
attacked by nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, known in
military jargon as NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping the blade sharp," said Col. Anthony M. Haslam,
commander of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit. "We have to be able
to fight anywhere in the world. It helps when you know the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Bee, a senior analyst with the UC San Diego-based Institute on
Global Conflict and Cooperation, said that despite the government's
seeming reluctance to entirely back the U.S., there is no doubt that
Kuwait would be in America's corner even without a U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Bee noted that Hussein has never renounced his claim that Kuwait
belongs to Iraq. Moreover, many Kuwaitis believe that Iraqi agents
are ever present here.</TE>
<TE>   "Kuwait is a lot like South Korea: Both depend for their security
on the United States, but sometimes our needs and their needs are
different," Bee said. "It can be a kind of split-personality
relationship, but in the end, Kuwait knows its survival is at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Cafe owner Zackariah says much the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "In Kuwait, we have God, the emir and America," he said. "We live
under their umbrella."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Emerge as Israelis Lift Siege</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army pulls back from Arafat's compound without
getting the men it wanted. Officials debate success of the standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>They came out a few at a time at first, then in a stream, jubilant,
smelly and still clutching the Kalashnikov rifles that seem to be an
ever-present talisman for Palestinian militiamen.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 days under siege, the 250 or more Palestinians holed up
in Yasser Arafat's headquarters were granted conditional freedom
Sunday when Israel, under intense international pressure, pulled back
its tanks and soldiers and said everyone in the compound, including
the Palestinian Authority president, was free to leave.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Israeli army said that it was keeping observation
posts around the compound and that it still intended to arrest the
several dozen people it has said are wanted on terrorism-related
charges. Many of those in the compound said they had no intention of
leaving.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat, who appeared briefly before a chanting crowd, beaming and
flashing his familiar V-for-victory sign, denounced the conditional
pullback as "fraud and cheating" but said it could provide an impetus
for a renewed effort at peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli leaders, who had convened a contentious Cabinet meeting
before Prime Minister Ariel Sharon left on a two-day trip to Russia,
bickered about whether the siege had accomplished anything or had
merely boosted Arafat's sagging popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Amos Gilead, the Israeli government coordinator for the
occupied territories, defended both the siege and the decision to end
it. He told Israeli radio that the siege was justified because "there
was need of a sharp response that would deliver the message that
terrorism couldn't continue to exist."</TE>
<TE>   With that goal achieved, he said, it was appropriate to end the
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cabinet meeting, however, a furious Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres declared: "The entire world is against us now."</TE>
<TE>   "It always is," Sharon replied.</TE>
<TE>   Peres also lambasted Sharon for sending assistant Dov Weisglass,
and not himself, to Washington to discuss lifting the siege. That led
to speculation that Peres, who represents the center-left Labor
Party, might quit Sharon's coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had put increasing pressure on Israel to
back off from Arafat's headquarters, known as the Muqata. After
Sunday's withdrawal, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said
President Bush was pleased and was calling on both sides to work
toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed
Israel's decision, which came five days after the U.N. Security
Council approved a resolution demanding an Israeli withdrawal from
the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon ordered the siege Sept. 19, hours after a Palestinian
suicide bomber blew up a bus in Tel Aviv, killing six people and
himself.</TE>
<TE>   For the first several days, Israeli bulldozers and backhoes laid
waste to much of the compound, sparing only the building in which
Arafat and his compatriots were gathered. After that, the siege
became a largely silent waiting game, with Israel demanding that
Arafat turn over the men it described as fugitives and Arafat flatly
refusing.</TE>
<TE>   The siege had two consequences that may have led to the Israeli
decision to withdraw. Not only did it bring international
condemnation, including the Security Council resolution, but it
seemed to give Arafat a new lease on political life. The standoff
prompted large demonstrations by Palestinians and pushed aside, at
least for the moment, talk of reforming his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The scenes from the Muqata ... are a bitter pill for the
government to swallow," Israeli television diplomatic affairs
commentator Leah Zender said. "But they had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   The clear winners, she said, were Arafat and the U.S., which
gained some margin for maneuvering in its pursuit of a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon committed a very, very bad mistake," said Arafat advisor
Bassam abu Sharif, one of the founders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. "Arafat has become more popular and I'm sure will be
reelected by the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat issued a statement through a spokesman in which he called
on Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territory "and go back to the
status we had on Sept. 28, 2000," at the beginning of the latest
Palestinian intifada, or uprising.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he was reiterating his commitment "to a total
cease-fire" and urged Israel to do the same. Israel has maintained
that Arafat's commitment is meaningless because he is unable or
unwilling to restrain the more radical Palestinian factions from
carrying out attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Israel said Arafat was free to leave his compound, aides
said he had no intention of doing so. Israeli radio reported today
that the government believed most of the men on its wanted list were
still inside the compound but that Palestinians said most had fled.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israelis expressed hope that the end of the siege would
provide stimulus to Palestinian reform talks.</TE>
<TE>   "The siege has been like an electric shock for the moderate
Palestinian leaders," said Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the pullback, the Palestinian Legislative Council had
issued a statement Saturday saying it was time to reassess the
intifada, which has proved enormously costly for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The cordon around Arafat's headquarters began lifting about noon
Sunday, when the first of a convoy of Israeli tanks, jeeps, armored
personnel carriers and other vehicles began driving out of the
compound in a vapor of dust.</TE>
<TE>   The retreat was complete in about two hours, at which point a
horde of reporters and camera crews stampeded toward the compound.
The Palestinians inside, realizing what was happening, started to
emerge, grinning wildly, into the afternoon sun.</TE>
<TE>   Some ran around like schoolboys, albeit schoolboys with 10-day-old
beards and Kalashnikovs. In short order, an ice cream vendor arrived,
providing the surreal picture of hardened militia fighters delicately
licking cherry ice pops.</TE>
<TE>   The lifting of the cordon provided the first close-up look at the
inside of the battered compound and Arafat's three-story office
building, where hundreds of people had been squeezed into a warren of
sandbagged rooms and hallways.</TE>
<TE>   A sludge of spilled coffee and cigarette ash covered the floor in
spots where the occupants--mostly military men--had spent their time
sitting and talking. The odor of that detritus, mixed with the smells
of sweat and urine, drifted through the halls of what was once a
British military headquarters. With only one fully functioning
bathroom in the building, some of those inside had resorted to using
buckets.</TE>

<HD>A New Son Is Rising Over Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He is rarely quoted in the newspaper or shown on television. He has
never given an interview and apparently has never delivered a speech
in public. He is said to stutter.</LD>
<LD>   Most Iraqis, it is said, would not recognize the short man with
the thick mustache if they encountered him on the street--though two
who did tried to kill him recently, according to an opposition group.</LD>
<LD>   Qusai Hussein, 36, the younger son of Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein, has emerged as a significant figure in the regime and an
object of growing U.S. concern. He commands key military, security
and intelligence forces and, U.S. officials say, directs lucrative
smuggling networks in violation of United Nations sanctions.</LD>
<TE>   If an invasion killed or dislodged his father, Qusai could well be
left in control of the regime's deadliest weapons.</TE>
<TE>   A British government report revealed last week that the elder
Hussein may have delegated to Qusai authority over Iraq's suspected
arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. The disclosure was the
latest sign that Qusai has eclipsed his infamous older brother, Uday,
as the Iraqi strongman's most trusted aide and heir apparent.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say Qusai's growing power has emerged as a wild
card as U.N. inspectors plan to return to Iraq to search for possible
weapons of mass destruction--and as the Bush administration weighs
how best to topple Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam is knocked out early, and command and control breaks
down, then how do they fire their stuff?" said a senior U.S.
intelligence official who is involved in the planning. "Who's going
to push the button?</TE>
<TE>   "Qusai is someone who, A, would be loyal to his father, and, B, if
he gives the orders, those orders will be followed like his
father's," the official added. "There's contingency planning going
on, and he's a big part of it."</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. and British intelligence, Hussein's regime in
recent years has produced both biological and chemical weapons and
can deliver them with artillery shells, free-fall bombs, sprayers and
ballistic missiles. They could be deployed within 45 minutes,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Would Qusai use them? Former U.N. weapons inspector Terrence
Taylor isn't sure. "These are not Taliban, theologically motivated
people," said Taylor, now president of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies-U.S. "This is a secular ruling clique, a
Mafia-type group. They want to survive. So they're going to try to
strike deals."</TE>
<TE>   Qusai had no known role in his father's past military adventures,
including the war against Iran in the 1980s and the invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 that led to the Persian Gulf War the following year.</TE>
<TE>   But Qusai knows about Iraq's clandestine weapons programs. Iraqi
defectors have told U.S. officials that starting in the mid-1990s, he
headed a special unit of as many as 2,000 men whose job was to hinder
and hamper U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   According to these accounts, one team from Qusai's group would
create traffic jams and other diversions to delay the inspectors,
while another team would rush to move incriminating records,
equipment and other items that the inspectors were seeking.</TE>
<TE>   David Kay, a former U.N. weapons inspector, says Qusai can be seen
"lurking in the background" in photographs of key inspections.
Another former inspector, who asked not to be identified, says Qusai
was part of a high-level Iraqi committee that "decided what to give
up and what to conceal. He was involved up to his eyeballs."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors withdrew from Iraq in frustration in December 1998
and have yet to return.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Qusai's influence has grown dramatically since then,
especially in the military and security structure of the Iraqi police
state. Getting to the top wasn't hard; his father appointed him to
every post.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai oversees the Republican Guard, the best trained and armed
military unit, and the Special Security Organization, which is
entrusted with protecting the president and with hiding any weapons
of mass destruction. The SSO also monitors telecommunications between
Iraq and the outside world, Iraqi exiles say.</TE>
<TE>   The two posts, as well as a recent appointment as head of the
northern army, the force that presumably would defend Baghdad against
an attack from Kurdish areas in the north, give Qusai operational
control over some of the most important units in Iraq's armed
services.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai also helps run the Mukhabarat, Iraq's largest and most
dreaded intelligence and internal security service.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Amnesty International and
other human rights groups have accused the Mukhabarat of torturing
suspected dissidents or their families.</TE>
<TE>   A former Mukhabarat member, Khalid Janabi, told U.N. investigators
last year that members of a special unit, the Technical Operations
Directorate, have raped relatives of suspected opponents and then
used videotape of the assaults to ensure future cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai's public profile increased dramatically in May 2001, when he
was elected in a secret ballot--and his brother was not--to the
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party's leadership council at a party
conference in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was pleased. According to a U.N. report, Iraqi
security forces executed a leading Shiite Muslim cleric, Hussein
Bahar Uloom, for refusing to "publicly express approval" of Qusai's
election. Human rights observers say the killing was part of a
campaign to eliminate Shiite clerics opposed to the secular Baghdad
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the state-run television announcement of Qusai's election
reportedly caught many Iraqis by surprise. He has shunned the
spotlight, remaining a behind-the-scenes player in the daily deadly
intrigue of Iraqi politics.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Yaphe, a former CIA analyst and an Iraq expert, says
Hussein may yet undermine Qusai. "He doesn't want his son to have too
much power and authority because he might think, 'Gee, if I got rid
of Dad ....' If you're Saddam Hussein, you have to think like that,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts say Qusai's rise has fueled feuds among the Iraqi
elite.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 1, two men in an Oldsmobile shot and wounded Qusai in the
arm as he rode in a convoy through Baghdad's Mansour district,
according to the Iraqi National Congress, an opposition group based
in London. The assailants were killed at a military roadblock, the
group says, and their identities remain unknown. The CIA says it
cannot confirm the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a lawyer, Qusai is said to live a quiet life, devoted
to his wife and three sons. One Iraqi defector has said that he is a
heavy drinker, but U.S. officials say the evidence is not clear.</TE>
<TE>   "He's viewed as level headed, restrained, not a wild man," said
Kenneth Katzman, an Iraq expert at the Congressional Research
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seen as stable, low profile, very loyal to his father," said
an intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai is also viewed as a shrewd player in Iraq's $2-billion-plus
black-market economy.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Qusai and the government agencies he runs have taken
control of much of Iraq's illicit sales of crude oil and diesel fuel
to Turkey, Lebanon and especially Syria, according to a report by the
Coalition for International Justice, a Washington-based research
group that has studied Iraq's economy. The sales violate U.N. trade
sanctions imposed after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really become a major player over the last 18 months to two
years," said Susan Blaustein, co-author of the report.</TE>
<TE>   Defectors have said that Qusai's Mukhabarat has set up front
companies in Jordan that re-export goods legally imported into Iraq
for civilian use under the U.N. "oil for food" program--goods such as
medicine, baby food, vehicles, spare parts and electronics. The
intelligence agency also has muscled into the lucrative trade in
black-market cigarettes from Cyprus, the coalition says.</TE>
<TE>   "Qusai is likely able to make good use of the money, not so much
to support a lavish lifestyle as to retain the loyalty of the
thousands of members of his various services," the coalition report
says.</TE>
<TE>   Qusai's rise to power reflects, in part, the decline of his older
brother, Uday. Perhaps the only Iraqi more feared than his father,
Uday was shot and severely injured in a 1996 attempted assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Uday, 38, is Iraq's media baron, a flamboyant figure who races a
red Porsche and controls Iraq's most popular radio and TV stations
and its largest newspaper. He heads student groups, the bar
association and the Iraqi National Olympic Committee. Iraq wants to
bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the U.N. in June approved
spending $20 million generated from legal sales of Iraqi oil to begin
building a 100,000-seat stadium in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Uday also is known for his violent temper. Human rights groups say
Hussein's elder son runs a black-garbed paramilitary force called
Saddam's Martyrs that has torn the tongues out of supposed enemies
and used swords to execute victims outside their homes.</TE>
<TE>   He also allegedly has maintained a private torture chamber, known
as the Red Room, in a building by the Tigris River. He has used
whippings, beatings and immersion in sewage to punish Iraqi athletes
who lose, according to two national team soccer players who defected.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's sons "differ only in that Uday kills people for fun and
Qusai kills people in a very busi- nesslike fashion," said former CIA
chief R. James Woolsey. "If Saddam dropped over of a heart attack
tomorrow and we were dealing with Qusai, we would be no better off."</TE>

<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY: Part two of a six-part series</SE>
<AU>SONIA NAZARIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day's work is done at Las Anonas, a rail-side hamlet of 36
families in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, when a field hand, Sirenio
Gomez Fuentes, sees a startling sight: a battered and bleeding boy,
naked except for his undershorts.</LD>
<LD>   It is Enrique.</LD>
<LD>   He limps forward on bare feet, stumbling one way, then
another. His right shin is gashed. His upper lip is split. The left
side of his face is swollen. He is crying.</LD>
<TE>   Gomez hears him whisper, "Give me water, please."</TE>
<TE>   The knot of apprehension in Sirenio Gomez melts into pity. He runs
into his thatched hut, fills a cup and gives it to Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have a pair of pants?" Enrique asks.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez dashes back inside and fetches some. There are holes in the
crotch and the knees, but they will do. Then, with kindness, Gomez
directs Enrique to Carlos Carrasco, the mayor of Las Anonas. Whatever
has happened, maybe he can help.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique hobbles down a dirt road into the heart of the little
town. He encounters a man on a horse. Could he help him find the
mayor?</TE>
<TE>   "That's me," the man says. He stops and stares. "Did you fall from
the train?"</TE>
<TE>   Again, Enrique begins to cry.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Carrasco dismounts. He takes Enrique's arm and guides him to
his home, next to the town church. "Mom!" he shouts. "There's a poor
kid out here! He's all beaten up." Carrasco drags a wooden pew out of
the church, pulls it into the shade of a tamarind tree and helps
Enrique onto it.</TE>
<TE>   Lesbia Sibaja, the mayor's mother, puts a pot of water on to boil
and sprinkles in salt and herbs to clean his wounds. She brings
Enrique a bowl of hot broth, filled with bits of meat and potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   He spoons the brown liquid into his mouth, careful not to touch
his broken teeth. He cannot chew.</TE>
<TE>   Townspeople come to see. They stand in a circle. "Is he
alive?" asks Gloria Luis, a stout woman with long black hair. "Why don't
you go home? Wouldn't that be better?"</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to find my mom," Enrique says, quietly.</TE>
<TE>   He is 17. It is March 24, 2000. Eleven years before, his mother
had left home in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to work in the United States.
She did not come back, and now he is riding freight trains up through
Mexico to find her.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Luis looks at Enrique and thinks about her own children.
She earns little; most people in Las Anonas make 30 pesos a day,
roughly $3, working the fields. She digs into a pocket and presses 10
pesos into Enrique's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Several other women open his hand, adding 5 or 10 pesos each.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Carrasco gives Enrique a shirt and shoes. He has cared for
injured immigrants before. Some have died. Giving Enrique clothing
will be futile, Carrasco thinks, if he can't find someone with a car
who can get the boy to medical help.</TE>
<TE>   Adan Diaz Ruiz, mayor of San Pedro Tapanatepec, the county seat,
happens by in his pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Carrasco begs a favor: Take this kid to a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz balks. He is miffed. "This is what they get for doing this
journey," he says. Enrique cannot pay for any treatment. Why, Diaz
wonders, do these Central American governments send us all their
problems?</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the small, soft-spoken boy lying on the bench, he
reminds himself that a live migrant is better than a dead one. In 18
months, Diaz has had to bury eight of them, nearly all mutilated by
the trains. Already today, he has been told to expect the body of yet
another, in his late 30s.</TE>
<TE>   Sending this boy to a doctor would cost the county $60.
Burying him in a common grave would cost three times as much. First,
Diaz would have to pay someone to dig the grave, then someone to handle
the paperwork, then someone to stand guard while Enrique's unclaimed
body is displayed on the steamy patio of the San Pedro Tapanatepec
cemetery for 72 hours, as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, people visiting the graves of their loved ones
would complain about the smell of another rotting migrant.</TE>
<TE>   "We will help you," he tells Enrique finally.</TE>
<TE>   He turns him over to his driver, Ricardo Diaz Aguilar. Inside the
mayor's pickup, Enrique sobs, but this time with relief. He says to
the driver, "I thought I was going to die."</TE>
<TE>   An officer of the judicial police approaches in a white pickup.
Enrique cranks down his window. Instantly, he recoils. He recognizes
both the officer and the truck.</TE>
<TE>   The officer, too, seems startled.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, the officer and the mayor's driver discuss the new
dead immigrant. Quickly, the policeman pulls away.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy robbed me yesterday," Enrique says. The policeman and a
partner had taken 100 pesos from him and three other migrants at
gunpoint in Chahuites, about five miles south.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's driver is not surprised. The judicial police, he says,
routinely stop trains to rob and beat immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The judiciales--the Agencia Federal de Investigacion--deny it.</TE>
<TE>   In San Pedro Tapanatepec, the driver finds the last clinic still
open that night.</TE>
<TE>   PERSEVERANCE</TE>
<TE>   When Enrique's mother left, he was a child. Six months ago, the
first time he set out to find her, he was still a callow kid. Now he
is a veteran of what has become a perilous children's pilgrimage to
the north.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, experts say, an estimated 48,000 youngsters like
Enrique from Central America and Mexico enter the United States
illegally and without either of their parents. Many come looking for
their mothers. They travel any way they can, and thousands ride the
tops and sides of freight trains.</TE>
<TE>   They leap on and off rolling train cars. They forage for food and
water. Bandits prey on them. So do street gangsters deported from Los
Angeles, who have made the train tops their new turf. None of the
youngsters have proper papers. Many are caught by the Mexican police
or by la migra, the Mexican immigration authorities, who take them
south to Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   Most try again.</TE>
<TE>   Like many others, Enrique has made several attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The first: He set out from Honduras with a friend, Jose del Carmen
Bustamante. They remember traveling 31 days and about 1,000 miles
through Guatemala into the state of Veracruz in central Mexico, where
la migra captured them on top of a train and sent them back to
Guatemala on what migrants call el bus de lagrimas, the bus of tears.
These buses make as many as eight runs a day, deporting more than
100,000 unhappy passengers every year.</TE>
<TE>   The second: Enrique journeyed by himself. Five days and 150 miles
into Mexico, he committed the mistake of falling asleep on top of a
train with his shoes off. Police stopped the train near the town of
Tonala to hunt for migrants, and Enrique had to jump off. Barefoot,
he could not run far. He hid overnight in some grass, then was
captured and put on the bus back to Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The third: After two days, police surprised him while he was
asleep in an empty house near Chahuites, 190 miles into Mexico. They
robbed him, he says, and then turned him over to la migra, who put
him, once more, on the bus to Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth: After a day and 12 miles, police caught him sleeping
on top of a mausoleum in a graveyard near the depot in Tapachula,
Mexico, known as the place where an immigrant woman had been raped
and, two years before that, another was raped and stoned to death. La
migra took Enrique back to Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth: La migra captured him as he walked along the tracks in
Queretaro, north of Mexico City. Enrique was 838 miles and almost a
week into his journey. He had been stung in the face by a swarm of
bees. For the fifth time, immigration agents shipped him back to
Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth: He nearly succeeded. It took him more than five days.
He crossed 1,564 miles. He reached the Rio Grande and actually saw
the United States. He was eating alone near some railroad tracks when
migra agents grabbed him. They sent him to a detention center, called
El Corralon, or the corral, in Mexico City. The next day they bused
him for 14 hours, all the way back to Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if he had never left.</TE>
<TE>   This is his seventh try, and it is on this attempt that he suffers
the injuries that leave him in the hands of the kind people of Las
Anonas.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what Enrique recalls:</TE>
<TE>   It is night. He is riding on a freight train. A stranger climbs up
the side of his tanker car and asks for a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Trees hide the moon, and Enrique does not see two men who are
behind the stranger, or three more creeping up the other side of the
car. Scores of migrants cling to the train, but no one is within
shouting distance.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men reaches a grate where Enrique is sitting. He grabs
Enrique with both hands.</TE>
<TE>   Someone seizes him from behind. They slam him face down.</TE>
<TE>   All six surround him.</TE>
<TE>   Take off everything, one says.</TE>
<TE>   Another swings a wooden club. It cracks into the back of Enrique's
head.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry, somebody demands. The club smacks his face.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique feels someone yank off his shoes. Hands paw through his
pants pockets. One of the men pulls out a small scrap of paper. It
has his mother's telephone number. Without it, he has no way to
locate her. The man tosses the paper into the air. Enrique sees it
flutter away.</TE>
<TE>   The men pull off his pants. His mother's number is inked inside
the waistband. But there is little money. Enrique has less than 50
pesos on him, only a few coins that he has gathered begging. The men
curse and fling the pants overboard.</TE>
<TE>   The blows land harder.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't kill me," Enrique pleads.</TE>
<TE>   His cap flies away. Someone rips off his shirt. Another blow finds
the left side of his face. It shatters three teeth. They rattle like
broken glass in his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men stands over Enrique, straddling him. He wraps the
sleeve of a jacket around Enrique's neck and starts to twist.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique wheezes, coughs and gasps for air. His hands
move feverishly from his neck to his face as he tries to breathe and
buffer the blows.</TE>
<TE>   "Throw him off the train," one man yells.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique thinks of his mother. He will be buried in an unmarked
grave, and she will never know what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," he asks God, "don't let me die without seeing her
again."</TE>
<TE>   The man with the jacket slips. The noose loosens.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique struggles to his knees. He has been stripped of everything
but his underwear. He manages to stand, and he runs along the top of
the fuel car, desperately trying to balance on the smooth, curved
surface. Loose tracks flail the train from side to side. There are no
lights. He can barely see his feet. He stumbles, then regains his
footing.</TE>
<TE>   In half a dozen strides, he reaches the rear of the car.</TE>
<TE>   The train is rolling at nearly 40 mph. The next car is another
fuel tanker. Leaping from one to the other at such speed would be
suicidal. Enrique knows he could slip, fall between them and be
sucked under.</TE>
<TE>   He hears the men coming. Carefully, he jumps down onto the coupler
that holds the cars together, just inches from the hot, churning
wheels. He hears the muffled pop of gunshots and knows what he must
do. He leaps from the train, flinging himself outward into the black
void.</TE>
<TE>   He hits dirt by the tracks and crumples to the ground. He
crawls 30 feet. His knees throb.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he collapses under a small mango tree.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique cannot see blood, but he senses it everywhere. It runs in
a gooey dribble down his face and out of his ears and nose. It tastes
bitter in his mouth. Still, he feels overwhelming relief: The blows
have stopped.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls sleeping, maybe 12 hours, then stirring and trying to
sit. His mind wanders to his mother, then his family and his
girlfriend, Maria Isabel, who might be pregnant. "How will they know
where I have died?" He falls back to sleep, then wakes again. Slowly,
barefoot and with swollen knees, he hobbles north along the rails. He
grows dizzy and confused. After what seems to be several hours, he is
back again where he began, at the mango tree.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond it, in the opposite direction, is a thatched hut
surrounded by a white fence.</TE>
<TE>   It belongs to field hand Sirenio Gomez Fuentes, who watches as the
bloodied boy walks toward him.</TE>
<TE>   A MISTAKE</TE>
<TE>   At the clinic, Dr. Guillermo Toledo Montes leads Enrique to an
examination table.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's left eye socket has a severe concussion. The eyelid is
injured and might droop forever. His back is covered with bruises. He
has several lesions on his right leg and an open wound hidden under
his hair. Two of his top teeth are broken. So is one on the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Toledo jabs a needle under the skin near Enrique's eye, then
on his forehead. He injects a local anesthetic. He scrubs dirt out of
the wounds and thinks of the immigrants he has treated who have died.
This one is lucky. "You should give thanks you are alive," he says.
"Why don't you go home?"</TE>
<TE>   "No." Enrique shakes his head. "I don't want to go back." Politely
he asks if there is a way that he can pay for his care, as well as
the antibiotics and the anti-inflammatory drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor shakes his head. "What do you plan to do now?"</TE>
<TE>   Catch another freight train, Enrique says. "I want to get to my
family. I am alone in my country. I have to go north."</TE>
<TE>   The police in San Pedro Tapanatepec do not hand him over to la
migra. Instead, he sleeps that night on the concrete floor of their
one-room command post. At dawn, he leaves, hoping to catch a bus back
to the railroad tracks. As he walks, people stare at his injured
face. Without a word, one man hands him 50 pesos. Another gives him
20. He limps on, heading for the outskirts of town.</TE>
<TE>   The pain is too great, so he flags down a car. "Will you give me a
ride?"</TE>
<TE>   "Get in," the driver says.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique does. It is a costly mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The driver is an off-duty immigration officer. He pulls into a
migra checkpoint and turns Enrique over.</TE>
<TE>   You can't keep going north, the agents say.</TE>
<TE>   He is ushered onto a bus, with its smell of sweat and diesel
fumes. He is relieved that there are no Central American gangsters on
board. Sometimes they let themselves be caught by la migra so they
can beat and rob the migrants on the buses. In spite of everything,
Enrique has failed again--he will not reach the United States this
time, either.</TE>
<TE>   He tells himself over and over that he'll just have to try again.</TE>

<HD>Now This Is Bad Publicity</HD>
<DH>Actress Liu Xiaoqing's many incarnations have made her rich
and kept China buzzing. But today she is cast in a new, unsavory
role: tax cheat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>For more than two decades, movie star Liu Xiao- qing has held the
nation spellbound with her Madonna-like ability to reinvent herself
and stay on the cutting edge of China's stunning social
transformations.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it was playing a fresh-faced heroine of the Communist
revolution, or becoming a best-selling author, business tycoon and
self-proclaimed richest woman in China, she reveled in the role of
trailblazer.</LD>
<LD>   This summer, the 51-year-old actress may have landed a new
role--that of the country's most famous tax dodger--and she landed in
jail.</LD>
<TE>   The Chinese call it "killing the chicken to scare the monkey." And
if authorities were looking for a high-profile deterrent to tax
evasion among China's new rich, they couldn't have picked a better
person.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of her arrest in June, at least half a dozen books
about her life hit the shelves. Newspapers and magazines around the
country jumped on the unfolding drama. Fans and foes alike clogged
Internet chat rooms debating the significance of the "Liu Xiaoqing
phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   "She shouldn't have identified herself as a 'billionaire,' " Cao
Xing, a former lawyer, said in one of the new books, "The Tragic
Movie Queen." "Ten billionaires cannot measure up to one acclaim as
'the people's artist.' "</TE>
<TE>   Frightened fledgling capitalists, from entrepreneurs to
entertainers, saw the writing on the wall and raced to pay their
taxes. Overall tax revenue in the first eight months of the year shot
up 11% compared with last year, state media reported. Of that,
personal income revenue soared 24%.</TE>
<TE>   If Liu had anything to do with this new level of awareness, it's
testimony once again to her uncanny ability to stay relevant--for
good and for bad.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in the West, paying taxes in China is still a novel
concept. According to the State Administration of Taxation, personal
income tax last year accounted for only 6.6% of China's overall tax
revenue, many times below the norm in more developed countries. The
bulk of the tax revenue comes from industries and businesses, both
public and private.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, most Chinese were simply too poor. The threshold
is income of about $100 a month, which still exempts the majority of
Chinese. Even relatively well-off urbanites only make on average
about $65 a month. Those wealthy enough to pay speak of a system full
of loopholes and lax enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing gap between China's rich and poor is fast becoming a
potential cause for social instability. Early this summer, Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji decided he'd had enough and ordered a crackdown
against the country's biggest tax cheats.</TE>
<TE>   The scofflaws are legion: Of the 50 richest Chinese picked by
Forbes magazine last year, only four had apparently paid any income
tax. Two years ago, Forbes ranked Liu as China's 45th-wealthiest
person, with assets of about $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   Today she sits in a Beijing detention center for allegedly dodging
$1.2 million in taxes. No trial date has been set pending the outcome
of an ongoing investigation, her lawyer Yao Yanqian said. If
convicted, she could face a maximum of seven years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   'Tragic' Scapegoat</TE>
<TE>   While few Chinese support breaking the law, there's a general
consensus that Liu makes an easy scapegoat. Two businessmen whom
Forbes ranked China's 2nd and 3rd richest reportedly are also under
investigation for tax evasion, but most Chinese wouldn't recognize
their names.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people have gotten away with much more," said Chen Zihan,
an editor of "The Tragic Movie Queen." "Her problem was she dared to
flaunt her wealth and go against the grain of Chinese culture."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever her crime, Liu's plight resonates with her generation.
They shared the same deprivations and longed to make the great leap
forward when the late "paramount leader" Deng Xiaoping said "to get
rich is glorious."</TE>
<TE>   Her twisting fortunes also mirror China's journey from a nation of
the proletariat to a nation increasingly driven by the pursuit of
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of undercover workers for the Communist revolution,
Liu got her first break in 1979 when she was cast as a young
guerrilla leader who risked her life to save a wounded Communist
soldier. Her co-star in "Xiaohua," or "Little Flower," was Joan Chen.
The award-winning movie made the two unknown actresses instant stars
in China.</TE>
<TE>   While Chen chose to leave and go to Hollywood, Liu stayed in the
motherland and rode the wave of economic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late '70s, China's art scene was practically nonexistent,"
said Wang Jianzhong, one of Liu's former business partners. "There
were very few TV channels, and new movies were rarely made. It was
relatively easy to become famous. Today it's quite possible that
someone tells me they've been in 40 movies and TV dramas and I've
never even heard of them."</TE>
<TE>   China was changing fast. Liu quickly came to feel that fame
without fortune was no longer enough.</TE>
<TE>   As a fledgling actress in Beijing, she made only $6 a month. It
was barely enough to buy food. Pretty clothes were the stuff of
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Shame became an incredible motivating force. She never forgot the
moment when fans in Hong Kong asked her for an autograph while she
was rummaging through the discount basket at a cheap street stall.</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed With Money</TE>
<TE>   Her first taste of riches came when someone offered her $400 to
sing on a celebrity tour. She had never seen so much money in her
life. The night she got paid, she counted the wrinkled bills and
dirty coins, again and again, until the sun came up and her fingers
had turned black.</TE>
<TE>   She saw how fame could be parlayed into cash, and she couldn't
help wanting more. Eventually, she used her money to make even more
in real estate, cosmetics, food, advertising and film production.</TE>
<TE>   "Her obsession with making money was a national obsession," said
Hao Jian, a film critic at the Beijing Film Academy. "The Chinese
people were terrified of ever being poor and hungry again."</TE>
<TE>   But unlike most Chinese who shun attention, Liu thrived on public
scrutiny, even negative publicity.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '80s, she shocked the country by publishing the first
of several memoirs. It was something even veteran Chinese artists
didn't dare do at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was revolutionary, especially for a woman," Hao said. "China
had just emerged from the Cultural Revolution, a period of total
suppression against individual expression and personal freedom. Yet
she dared to talk about herself, dared to live the way she wanted to
live."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, she bragged about pulling herself up by her
bootstraps and complained famously: "It's hard to be a human being.
It's harder to be a woman. It's even harder to be a famous woman."</TE>
<TE>   The book instantly drew attacks. How dare she imply it's hard to
be alive when she lives in a socialist country? But the controversy
transformed her from mere actress into cultural icon. Her book was
serialized in newspapers and spawned a whole genre of celebrity
tell-all literature in China.</TE>
<TE>   Legal Woes and Foes</TE>
<TE>   For those who despised her greed, it was inevitable that the money
that lifted her up would also bring her down. In recent years, she
became better known for her various legal troubles than business and
acting successes.</TE>
<TE>   A burgeoning gossip industry couldn't get enough of the courtroom
intrigues--how she sued her second husband for divorce, how she sued
a reporter for defaming her, how a real estate company sued her for
defamation, how a client sued her firm for failure to deliver paid
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "Tax evasion is only the tip of the iceberg," said Wang, the
former business partner, who later sued her and wrote a book about
their falling out. "She doesn't know how to be a decent human being.
So it's no surprise she ended up the way she did."</TE>
<TE>   But Liu seemed oblivious to what was happening and continued to be
scandalous.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when going to court and getting a divorce were still
rare, she offered juicy details about outsize business deals and an
outrageous private life: not one but two divorces, no desire for
children and a hearty appetite for boyfriends, some of them many
years her junior.</TE>
<TE>   "Each case elevated her stature," author Lu Ye wrote in the book
"Investigating Liu Xiaoqing."</TE>
<TE>   "People who hate her are forced to confront her again. People who
forgot her now remembered her. People who like her respected her
more. The few who don't know who she is now do. Not only did the
lawsuits fail to defeat her, they made her more popular. You can't
help but admire her for that."</TE>
<TE>   Then even her biggest fans began to question her judgment.</TE>
<TE>   According to various media accounts, she tore down rural homes to
make way for a movie set and abandoned the project without
compensating the farmers. She talked investors into paying for a new
TV series but gave them no credit when it was done. According to
Wang, the business associate who sued her, she rarely paid for
anything and was fond of walking into a store and simply saying, "I
like it."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps to show off, perhaps to save production costs, she began
casting herself as multiple characters in a single production. Aging
from a 20-year-old maiden to a silver-haired empress, she loved
playing the part of ancient female rulers.</TE>
<TE>   Even in prison, she continues to shock by refusing to bow her head
in remorse and instead dictates the terms of her incarceration. It's
been widely reported that Liu boasted about enjoying three things in
jail: studying English, exercising and reading, unlikely activities
for a Communist prison inmate.</TE>
<TE>   "She's her own worst enemy," said Stanley Rosen, an expert in
Chinese film at USC. "She should be more humble. But she's basically
saying, 'I'm Liu Xiaoqing and you're not.' "</TE>

<HD>West Coast Ports Closed</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Longshore union rejects allegation that slowdown
triggered lockout. Labor dispute could drain billions from the
economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND and RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast cargo ports were shut down indefinitely Sunday night after
a chaotic day on the waterfront that dashed hopes for a truce between
dockworkers and shipping lines, now in their fifth month of troubled
contract talks.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of cargo-laden ships from San Diego to Seattle were
stranded when the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
international shipping lines and U.S.-based terminal operators,
locked out union workers at the start of the 6 p.m. shift.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union
insisted they had done nothing to provoke the action. But the Pacific
Maritime Assn. cited dozens of examples of what it said were
deliberate acts by the union to slow or halt the flow of cargo. Among
them were failures to provide crane operators and the misplacing of
cargo containers in terminal yards.</LD>
<TE>   Association officials said it would cost more to run the ports at
diminished productivity--with union members paid for doing little or
no work--than it would to shut them down.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not pay workers to strike," said Joseph Miniace, president
of the Pacific Maritime Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said the lockout would continue until the union signs a
new contract or agrees to extend its expired contract. Under
contract, any slowdown is subject to arbitration, which could lead to
penalties for the union.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a protracted shutdown, the Bush administration has
indicated that it would consider invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, which
would reopen the ports for an 80-day cooling-off period.</TE>
<TE>   The 29 ports handle about half of the nation's ocean-going cargo,
including imports of cars, electronics, garments, housewares and
sporting goods.</TE>
<TE>   Citing potential damage to the national economy, the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service late Sunday called for both sides
to immediately "stand down their economic pressures" and resume
normal work schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Director Peter J. Hurtgen urged negotiators for the union and the
shipping association to meet in his office in Washington, D.C., on
Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. said it would accept the offer of
mediation. A union spokesman did not return calls seeking comment,
but the union has refused similar offers in recent weeks, saying it
prefers to deal directly with the shipping lines.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have bogged down over the association's desire to
introduce new technology such as scanners, sensors and remote
cameras, which will cost union jobs. In exchange, the union wants to
expand its jurisdiction, set minimum staffing levels, and control the
flow of all information through the terminals.</TE>
<TE>   After a week of sporadic slowdowns, the Pacific Maritime Assn. on
Friday night locked workers out for a 36-hour cooling-off period. But
when the terminals reopened Sunday morning, the association alleged
that slowdowns continued.</TE>
<TE>   When the new lockout was called Sunday night, vessels were already
backed up in harbors and being forced to anchor outside the
breakwaters. Many more ships were due to arrive today, including 23
at Los Angeles-Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bad. Very bad," said Robin Lanier, executive director of
the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents retailers and
manufacturers that use the ports. "We've already got a backed-up
situation, and it's going to get progressively worse. And everybody's
terrified of what this does to the stock market tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Union members were incensed by the Pacific Maritime Assn.'s
decision for another lockout and quickly set up picket lines at
terminals in Los Angeles and Long Beach. "They want to play this
game? They can go ahead and play it," said Ramon Ponce de Leon Jr.,
president of the union's Local 13 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ponce de Leon said he had been on the docks all day Sunday, trying
to ensure that jobs were filled. "There is no slowdown," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He and other union leaders accused the Pacific Maritime Assn. of
instigating a crisis in the hope that it would lead to federal
intervention, which they say would favor the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The mood at Local 13 headquarters was grim as union members
gathered for picket duty. "We're going to have men at the gates,"
Ponce de Leon said. "It's going to get ugly."</TE>
<TE>   At a rally in front of the Longshore Memorial Hall adjacent to Los
Angeles port terminals, ILWU President James Spinosa fired up the
crowd of about 200, telling dockworkers that the union would not be
intimidated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been a responsible union," Spinosa said. "They have been
outsourcing in many directions the work that is rightfully ours. We
embrace technology changes, but let's do it together."</TE>
<TE>   "The union built this waterfront over the past 50 years," added
Spinosa, who was joined at the rally by Miguel Contreras, chief of
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, and other labor leaders.</TE>
<TE>   An extended shutdown of the West Coast ports would be economically
devastating, according to a study conducted for the Pacific Maritime
Assn. by the Martin Associates consulting firm in Lancaster, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   A five-day shutdown would cost the national economy an estimated
$4.7 billion in lost wages and other costs, according to the study.
Exporters of perishable goods would probably have to ship items by
air freight instead of by sea. But the larger effect would be on
retailers, who won't have the same volume of goods to sell, and as a
result won't have as much sales revenue to fund additional purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "The lost sales of the imported commodities will have a ripple
effect throughout the nation's retail support sector, creating
negative impacts in such support activity as local warehousing and
distribution, advertising, wholesale activity and packaging," the
study said.</TE>
<TE>   The costs would snowball, with a 10-day shutdown costing the
economy an estimated $19.4 billion, the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Only a small portion of the cargo arriving on the West Coast could
be diverted to Atlantic ports, according to Martin Associates and
other experts, because most container vessels cannot fit through the
Panama Canal, and East Coast ports are not equipped to handle the
Pacific container ships' size and volume of cargo.</TE>
<TE>   With the stakes high for resolving the dispute, both sides had
said Saturday that they were prepared to put in a normal day when
terminal gates reopened along the coast Sunday morning. But the
situation deteriorated quickly. One hour after the 8 a.m. start time,
many jobs had not been filled.</TE>
<TE>   Cranes that were operated were moving slowly. Truckers, who had
hoped to make up for the previous day's closing, were backed up in
two lanes for more than a quarter of a mile at terminals in Los
Angeles and Long Beach. After waiting several hours, some drivers
made U-turns and left in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   At the new Pier 400 in Los Angeles, the largest container terminal
in the world, a security guard closed the gates and waved truckers
away at 10 a.m., saying crane operators had not arrived. The
announcement was greeted with honking and jeers from drivers, some of
whom had already waited more than two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing money," said one independent trucker, Armen
Chibukhchyan, who is paid by the trip. "I've been waiting here since
7:30. I have another load to take to Rancho Dominguez and, at this
rate, I don't know if we're going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Another trucker, who gave his name as Al, considered himself
lucky. At 2 p.m., he was leaving the Evergreen terminal with his
second haul of the day. Normally he makes seven or eight trips.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this stops soon," he said. "The dockworkers inside are not
working. These slowdowns are very irritating. Sometimes I have to
wait five or six hours to get one container. Making two to three
moves a day is not enough. That's about $120 for me, my family and to
take care of my truck. And that's just not enough."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, productivity was down 54%, although it dropped most
dramatically in Portland, Ore., and Oakland, according to figures
provided by the Pacific Maritime Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increasing volumes of Pacific Rim trade, the shipping
lines and terminal operators that compose the Pacific Maritime Assn.
have been hurt by an excess of shipping capacity, which has forced
them to keep rates low.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU represents 10,500 dockworkers who are among the
highest-paid blue-collar workers, making about $80,000 to $150,000
annually with overtime.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of Americans without health insurance jumped significantly
last year after declining for the previous two years, the Census
Bureau reported today.</LD>
<LD>   The report found a large drop in job-based health insurance, which
analysts said was caused by a combination of rapidly rising
health-care costs and a weak economy. Many employers who just a year
or two ago needed to offer good health benefits to attract workers
now are passing on higher insurance costs to their employees--or
dropping coverage altogether.</LD>
<LD>   "We're getting to the point where uninsurance is not just a poor
people's problem, not just a problem of the down and out, but a
middle-class problem," said Diane Rowland, executive director of the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation is an independent philanthropy focusing on the
major health-care issues facing the nation.</LD>
<TE>   The new figures show that government programs prevented a much
larger increase in the number of very poor Americans without health
insurance. If not for increased enrollment in Medicaid and the State
Children's Health Insurance Program, last year's number of uninsured
Americans would have been much higher.</TE>
<TE>   But 41 states, including California, are planning to limit
Medicaid spending in the coming year. And the outlook for private
insurance is no brighter: Surveys show that more than three-fourths
of employers plan to pass on more health-care costs to their workers,
some of whom no longer will be able to afford their share of
insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is the beginning of bad news, but nowhere near the
end," Rowland said.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the number of Americans who had no health coverage for
any part of the year increased by 1.4 million last year to 41.2
million. The increase in the proportion of uninsured Americans, from
14.2% to 14.6%, was the largest since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen percent of Californians had no health insurance, an
above-average rate that reflects the state's large number of Latino
and foreign-born residents.</TE>
<TE>   The proportion of Americans with employment-related health
insurance dropped a full percentage point, to 62.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "That accounts for most of the change in the uninsured rate," said
Robert J. Mills, a Census Bureau statistician and author of the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Following a Census Bureau report released last week that showed
the number of Americans living in poverty increased last year for the
first time in eight years, today's figures on the uninsured shed new
light on an economy in which more Americans--from a wider range of
ethnic backgrounds, income levels and employment histories--are
having problems making ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   The uninsured rate for Latinos, for example, remained the highest
of any racial or ethnic group at 33.2%. Yet the Latino uninsured rate
held steady, while the proportion of uninsured whites rose from 13.2%
to 13.6%, an increase of more than 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   The proportion of African Americans without health insurance rose
two-tenths of a percentage point to 19%.</TE>
<TE>   And while the proportion of uninsured was highest, at 23.3%, among
households with annual incomes of less than $25,000, the uninsured
rate increased in every income category. The largest jump occurred in
the $75,000-and-up bracket, where 7.7% lacked insurance last year.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, while a job remains the strongest link to health
insurance coverage, the proportion of Americans who were employed and
uninsured last year grew from 16.5% to 17%.</TE>
<TE>   The ranks of the uninsured held steady among workers at larger
firms, but increased at businesses with fewer than 25 employees. At
these small businesses, less than a third of workers had health
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   And the number of those who had health coverage through their own
job or that of a family member dropped by 1.2 million, the first such
decline since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Sullivan, director of health-care policy for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said she was "not terribly surprised" by the large drop
because "something had to give."</TE>
<TE>   Health insurance premiums for small employers have increased
roughly 20% since 1999, Sullivan said, but through 2000, business
owners "had to just suck it up because they really needed the
workers."</TE>
<TE>   They don't anymore. And as employers pass on more health-care
costs to workers, she added, more employees are declining coverage
because they cannot afford to pay their share.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in the joint federal-state Medicaid program grew by
about 7% last year to nearly 32 million people. But despite the
increase in public assistance, an additional 10 million poor people
had no health coverage of any kind last year.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 in 10 children still lacked health coverage, but the
growth of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program
helped hold the number of uninsured children steady at 8.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The census report also highlights the political disagreements over
what, if anything, the government should do about the growth in the
ranks of the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer advocate group
Families USA, said the report "demonstrates that public program
expansions should be enacted to increase health coverage for low-wage
working adults."</TE>
<TE>   The Chamber of Commerce's Sullivan saw new evidence in the report
to support corporate America's view that "Congress should look beyond
simply adding more people to Medicaid or burdening businesses with
more government mandates" that make private coverage more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Within the government, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
G. Thompson called on Congress to pass President Bush's proposals for
tax credits to help poor families buy health insurance and a small
increase in funding for community health centers.</TE>
<TE>   "As this new report shows," Thompson said in a statement, "we
simply cannot afford to wait any longer ... to assist American
families who lack access to health care."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and consumer advocates argue that the president's
proposed tax credits are too small to make health insurance
affordable for low-income families. They are seeking additional
federal funds for cash-strapped Medicaid and children's health
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But the congressional stalemate on virtually all health-care
measures is unlikely to give way soon, officials agree.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has signaled his intention to
pursue replacing the system of largely employment-based health
insurance with a government-based system.</TE>
<TE>   "The large increase in the already unacceptably high number of the
uninsured should be a wake-up call for Congress and the president,"
he said in response to today's report. "Every American deserves
affordable health care."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks clinched home-field advantage for the first
round of the National League playoffs by defeating the Colorado
Rockies, 11-8, Sunday, at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   The NL West champions open the postseason Tuesday night against NL
Central champion St. Louis. Had the Diamondbacks lost, the
best-of-five series would have started at St. Louis. Chad Moeller
homered twice and drove in six runs to lead the Diamondbacks, who
finished 98-64.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Milwaukee 0--The Cardinals received a scare at St.
Louis when pitcher Andy Benes was forced to leave after hurting his
right knee while batting in the fifth inning. It wasn't immediately
clear if the injury would keep him out of the playoff series against
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Pittsburgh 3--Sammy Sosa hit his 49th homer--and No.
499 of his career--and the Cubs gave Bruce Kimm a victory in his
final game as interim manager. Kimm was fired by General Manager Jim
Hendry before the game at Wrigley Field and given the option of
whether the announcement should be made before or after the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, Cincinnati 2--In what might have been their final game
in Montreal, the Expos won their fourth in a row to finish second in
the NL East at 83-79. The Expos drew 812,545 this season. The final
crowd of 25,178 raised their average attendance to 10,031.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Atlanta 1--The Braves were looking to sweep the Mets
in a four-game series for the first time since 1965--when they still
played in Milwaukee--and for the first time at Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 7, Houston 0--Ryan Jensen (13-8) and five relievers
combined on a five-hitter at San Francisco as the Giants extended
their winning streak to eight games. They're 25-8 since Aug. 25, the
best record in the majors over that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Philadelphia 3--The Marlins came from behind twice to
win in 10 innings and also avoided finishing last in the major
leagues in home attendance. The announced crowd of 28,599 allowed
them to overtake Montreal in season attendance. The final attendance
total was 813,118, an average of 10,038.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Texas 7--Barry Zito got his league-leading 23rd win and
Jermaine Dye hit a grand slam at Arlington, Texas, as the AL West
champion Athletics finished 103-59, matching the Yankees for the most
wins in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 11, Tampa Bay 8--Manny Ramirez walked as a pinch-hitter in
his only plate appearance at Boston and won the AL batting title with
a .349 average. Kansas City's Mike Sweeney finished second at .340.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 1, Detroit 0--Roy Halladay (19-7) gave up two hits over
eight innings at Toronto as the Blue Jays ended the season with a
seven-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Chicago 1--Bobby Kielty hit a go-ahead, two-run homer
in the eighth inning for the second consecutive game at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 7, Kansas City 3--The loss at Cleveland enabled the
Royals (62-100) to join Detroit, Tampa Bay and Milwaukee as 100-game
losers in 2002. It's the first time in major league history that four
teams lost 100 games in the same season.</TE>

<KH>BUFFALO 33, CHICAGO 27 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Bledsoe Rules in Overtime</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The Buffalo Bills, who can't seem to win in regulation, certainly
make up for it in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Drew Bledsoe set an NFL record with his fourth career overtime
touchdown pass, a 26-yard play to Travis Henry 1:58 into the extra
period, giving the Bills a 33-27 victory over the Chicago Bears on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Three of Buffalo's first four games have gone into overtime, an
NFL first. The Bills (2-2) won the last two that have gone past
regulation, a big turnaround for a team that was 3-6 last season in
games decided by seven points or less.</LD>
<TE>   "We hope winning these close games is a big building block,"
Bills' Coach Gregg Williams said. "Every week in this league, most
games come down to the wire. Our guys made the plays they needed to
make to win."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Miller completed 19 of 31 passes for 188 yards and two
touchdowns for the Bears (2-2). Chicago hadn't lost two consecutive
games since December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills, meanwhile, are coming off a 3-13 season in which they
didn't record their second victory until their 12th game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're starting to develop and believe in ourselves," said
Bledsoe, who was 28 for 36 for 328 yards and four touchdowns. "We've
got the talent. We've got the ability to play with anybody in the
league."</TE>
<TE>   After the Bears went three-and-out to open overtime, the Bills
took over at their 44 after Brad Maynard's 31-yard punt.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe connected with Eric Moulds for a 32-yard gain along the
left sideline. On the next play, Bledsoe rolled right and, just as he
was being hauled down from behind, found Henry in the flat. Henry did
the rest by running the last 20 yards for the score.</TE>
<TE>   "You can run the ball a couple of times to set up the field goal,
but why not take a couple of shots at the end zone?" Bledsoe said of
his overtime philosophy.</TE>

<LD>Sports historian Tom Ryugo of Berkeley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that Johnny Unitas, besides being an outstanding
quarterback, was also a prankster.</LD>
<LD>   "At the Colts' training camp one year, he set up a booby trap in
the dormitory so that when somebody walked in the front door, several
trash cans would roll down the stairs and run him over.</LD>
<LD>   "Unitas heard the door open and let loose, expecting a few laughs
at the expense of some rookie. The cans rolled down the stairs and
bowled over Coach Don Shula."</LD>
<TE>   Shula is not known for his sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most seasons leading the NFL
in touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky" Luciano? Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "Luciano, the
Chievo's team Brazilian midfielder, has been suspended indefinitely
by the Italian Soccer League for playing under a false name and lying
that he was 23 years old, when he was actually 27.</TE>
<TE>   "The worldwide response was swift. The Bronx Little League,
stunned that someone would think of such a thing, immediately ruled
Luciano eligible to play for the first two weeks of the 2002 season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Perry: "Evansville, the last NCAA Division I basketball team
to wear sleeved jerseys, has announced that it will relent and go
sleeveless this season, ending a tradition that covers 46 of the last
55 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "The Aces, however, did not disclose any plans for replacing their
peach baskets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grow up, kid: Gene Frenette in the Florida Times-Union: "Randy
Moss' reaction to the media frenzy that he created with his DWS
(Driving While Stupid) was another example of a pro athlete carrying
an entitlement attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "The Minnesota Vikings' immature receiver did such a poor job of
showing contrition to the traffic officer that he might as well have
screamed out: 'Hey, I run people over when I want to run people
over.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Same old problem: Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass' career was
stymied by an uncurable bout of wildness. Now a Pittsburgh
broadcaster, he caught a foul ball in the booth in Cincinnati
recently.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to drop the ball to a kid in the stands, but it hit a man
on the head, bounced and hit another kid in the head. Said Blass: "I
still don't have any control."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ugh! Reporters asked Cleveland Browns' Coach Butch Davis to
describe what he was feeling while this team rallied for a dramatic
31-28 victory over the Tennessee Titans.</TE>
<TE>   "You have no idea," Davis said. "I can't begin to tell you. Your
guts are just eaten and you feel like you want to dry heave and gag."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1927, New York Yankee slugger Babe
Ruth broke his own record when he hit home run No. 60 off
Washington's Tom Zachary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Don Hutson of Green Bay, eight, 1935-1938, 1941-44.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Woody Paige in the Denver Post commenting on new
Nugget Coach Jeff Bzdelik: "According to someone close to Bzdelik, he
has the mind for the NBA but doesn't have a clue beyond the court.</TE>
<TE>   "Bzdelik is a gym rat who apparently hasn't gotten out of the
darkness and into the light as an assistant, a scout and a high
school and small college coach."</TE>

<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Keyshawn Johnson was right. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers enjoyed the
NFL's version of a stroll in the park.</LD>
<LD>   There was even time to stop and dance on the patchwork grass.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Johnson threw three touchdown passes as the Buccaneers made
their receiver's brash prediction come true by beating the winless
Cincinnati Bengals, 35-7, Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   In the closing minutes, the few remaining fans got to see
defensive lineman Warren Sapp stop and gyrate on the re-sodded middle
of the field as music played during a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about us," said Sapp, who had two sacks. "If we come out
and play our game, they can't play with us. Even if we give them
seven, they still can't play with us."</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals can't even keep up with themselves much of the time.
They had consecutive delay-of-game penalties before missing a field
goal, and twice had the wrong number of players on the field for
punts.</TE>
<TE>   They're 0-4 for the sixth time during their 12-season reign as the
NFL's worst team.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty-five to seven," said Bengal receiver Chad Johnson, who is
Keyshawn's cousin. "Oh-and-four. Ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Rickey Dudley and Keenan McCardell slipped past confused defenders
for uncontested touchdown catches as Tampa Bay (3-1) got its second
impressive victory in six days. The Buccaneers beat the Rams, 26-14,
Monday night.</TE>

<HD>Shipp Rights Cardinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Arizona Cardinals were supposed to be in trouble at running back,
with no experienced player behind Thomas Jones.</LD>
<LD>   They have some experience now.</LD>
<LD>   Marcel Shipp, who never had an NFL carry before the second game of
this season, ran 10 yards for one fourth-quarter touchdown and caught
a pass from Jake Plummer for another Sunday as the Cardinals (2-2)
beat the New York Giants, 21-7.</LD>
<TE>   "I grew up watching these guys," said Shipp, who's from Paterson,
N.J., "and it just feels great to come out here and play the way I
did."</TE>
<TE>   Shipp, who gained 5,383 yards at Division I-AA Massachusetts but
was not drafted last year, played because Thomas Jones had a sore
left ankle. Shipp ran for 92 yards in 17 carries and caught five
passes for 39 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of motivation for me in the off-season, because
they questioned the backup running back spot," Shipp said. "I had to
prove a lot of people wrong, and I came in today and did that."</TE>
<TE>   "I've got no reservations about Marcel Shipp," Cardinal Coach Dave
McGinnis said. "I felt like that all along, or I wouldn't have kept
him on this team last year."</TE>
<TE>   Shipp sprained his left knee two plays before his touchdown run,
leaving Arizona with "two gimpy backs," McGinnis said.</TE>
<TE>   On their first possession, the Giants (2-2) got a six-yard
touchdown run from Tiki Barber, then they were shut down by their own
miscues and Arizona's young defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense won this game," Plummer said.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Lucas intercepted Kerry Collins' ill-advised sideline pass
and returned it 38 yards for the score-tying touchdown with four
seconds left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief halftime television interview, Giant Coach Jim Fassel
said, "I'll never be that stupid again in my lifetime."</TE>

<KH>KANSAS CITY 48, MIAMI 30</KH>
<HD>Green, Gonzalez Are Too Much for Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>This would be a good week for Trent Green bashers to give it a rest.</LD>
<LD>   With his finest game since 1999, Green threw five touchdown
passes--three to Tony Gonzalez--to lead Kansas City past previously
unbeaten Miami, 48-30, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   He even ran for 48 yards and threw a textbook block on Priest
Holmes' touchdown run.</LD>
<TE>   "It's fun to have a day like that," said Green, who completed 24
of 34 passes for 328 yards. "Throw the block in there and that makes
it that much more enjoyable."</TE>
<TE>   Green also didn't throw an interception. He had an NFL-high 24
interceptions last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs (2-2) scored five touchdowns the previous Sunday
against New England's respected defense and are averaging 35.5
points. In their first three games, the Dolphins had given up an
average of 12.3 points.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Greg Wesley intercepted three of Jay Fiedler's passes in
the final eight minutes, setting up the final 10 points for the
underdog Chiefs, who had lost five in a row to the Dolphins (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a frustrating day and a humbling experience," said
Miami safety Brock Marion, who was draped all over Gonzalez when he
made his third touchdown catch.</TE>
<TE>   Added Dolphin linebacker Zach Thomas: "I didn't expect their
passing game to be that good."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, the All-Pro tight end who missed all of training camp
because of a contract holdout, caught seven passes for 140 yards. He
set the tone early with a 30-yard gain to set up his nine-yard
touchdown reception.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something we saw on film, where the guy covers me
man-to-man and the middle of the field is wide open," he said. "We
saw Zach Thomas isn't that tall [5 feet 11] and I'm able to jump over
him."</TE>
<TE>   Running backs Ricky Williams and Holmes, meanwhile, were almost
relegated to bit players on a day that featured 849 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's Williams rushed for 66 yards, including a three-yard
touchdown. Holmes caught six passes for 63 yards and ran for 52,
including the 25-yard touch- down.</TE>
<TE>   It was the biggest sports day in Kansas City area history, with
NASCAR's Winston Cup race drawing about 80,000 at Kansas Speedway,
along with a paid attendance of 78,178 for the Chiefs game.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Monster Garage"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Discovery Channel, tonight, 8</LD>
<TE>   In this unique new weekly series, a team of specialists turn
ordinary street cars into exotic pieces of equipment. For tonight's
show, the first in the series, a 1996 Chevrolet Impala is converted
to a Zamboni ice-smoothing machine.</TE>
<TE>   It was a cool idea. The end result, however, wasn't so cool.</TE>
<TE>   The host of the show and the lead mechanic is Jesse James, named
after his great-great-great grandfather's infamous cousin. James, 33,
builds customized motorcycles for celebrities at his shop in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Monster Garage" is a spinoff of "Motorcycle Mania," a show James
did for Discovery Channel last year.</TE>
<TE>   In "Monster Garage," James and his crew of specialists have one
week to complete their projects and can't spend more than $3,000 on
parts.</TE>
<TE>   After the Kings' Sept. 19 exhibition opener, James' "Zampala," as
it is called, was to square off against a real Zamboni. Well, things
didn't exactly go as planned. Actually, it was a meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Zampala did fine during two practice sessions. But when it
came time for the real thing, the Zampala got stuck on the ice, its
wheels spinning and its 350-horsepower engine roaring. A water spigot
had been opened too soon and gallons of tepid water poured out on the
ice during 10 minutes of set-up and introductions. The hot water
melted the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Zampala made one trip down the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the troubles, the show is well-produced and worth
watching.</TE>

<KH>DALLAS 13, ST. LOUIS 10</KH>
<HD>Rams Lose Another Game, and Warner Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A bad season just keeps getting worse for the St. Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   The defending NFC champions lost quarterback Kurt Warner before
losing their fourth consecutive game Sunday, 13-10, to the Dallas
Cowboys.</LD>
<LD>   The Rams fell to 0-4 for the first time since 1963, when they
started with five consecutive losses and finished 5-9.</LD>
<TE>   "That's life," Coach Mike Martz said. "You can't sit and stew
about it. That's where we are, and what's important is what we do
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Billy Cundiff kicked a 48-yard field goal as time expired
to win it for the Cowboys (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   The Rams, who went 14-2 last season, must somehow improve quickly
just to get back to .500, and they'll have to do it without Warner,
who has a broken little finger on his throwing hand. The team said
the injury will be evaluated today to determine whether he'll require
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually those things take about a month," Martz said. "But it
could be sooner. Who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Warner broke the same finger in 2000 and it required surgery,
knocking him out for five games. If he's out that long again, there
might be no rush. The only 0-4 team to make the playoffs was the 1992
San Diego Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not believing that one bit," Warner said. "We've got too good
of a team to believe that. I believe I'm going to be back just in
time to take us down that stretch run into the playoffs, and on to
where we want to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams have no relief in sight. They play at San Francisco next,
then play host to Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas quarterback Quincy Carter, who didn't earn a vote of
confidence from owner Jerry Jones after a shaky first three games,
led the Cowboys 41 yards in nine plays in 1:27 to set up the field
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we didn't need a touchdown to win it; we just needed to
keep moving the ball down the field," Carter said. "Everybody really
had to pay attention. I did my part, but also my line did their part,
my receivers, my backs. I just thought, as a collective group, that
we did a great job handling the two-minute drive."</TE>
<TE>   The big play to set up the field goal was a 15-yard pass across
the middle to Michael Wiley that got Dallas to the Ram 35. After
that, Carter hit Ken-Yon Rambo for five yards and then spiked the
ball with one second left.</TE>
<TE>   Carter was 26 for 36 for 204 yards with a touchdown and an
interception.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I thought he grew up today," running back Emmitt Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his pursuit of Walter Payton's career rushing record,
Smith had 58 yards in 13 carries. He needs 304 yards to break
Payton's record of 16,726.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' Marshall Faulk, who suffered a strained neck in a 26-14
loss to Tampa Bay last Monday night, had 73 yards in 18 carries. He
also caught nine passes for 67 yards.</TE>

<HD>One Small Sticking Point: This Is Still the Pac-10</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Pete Carroll has some nerve defying conventional wisdom and
a few accepted axioms.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll, it appears, is attempting to win a Pacific 10 Conference
title with his defense, a textbook, big-hair, throwback, "That '70s
Show" concept that is to be admired for its audacity but almost never
works.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll might have better odds flying a hot-air balloon around the
world.</LD>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong, Pac-10 rules stipulate you must field 11
players on defense--Washington tried 12 against Michigan and it
clearly backfired--yet the idea of riding your inside linebackers to
a Rose Bowl berth is defies reality.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, only Arizona State in 1996 won the conference title
while also leading the Pac-10 in total defense.</TE>
<TE>   If tackling translated to titles, Arizona would be a multiple Rose
Bowl winner instead of the only Pac-10 team never to have played that
game. Dick Tomey's fabled "Desert Swarm" squads at Arizona led the
conference in defense four times in the 1990s, made the cover of
Sports Illustrated once, but never won a title.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, UCLA finished first in defense and 7-4 on the field,
giving the Bruins the opportunity to consider paying its way into the
prestigious Humanitarian Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   We know where Carroll is coming from. He is a defensive guru,
first and foremost, his formative years spent in the NFL trying to
stuff the run on third and two in 16-13 victories.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pac-10 is a different bird--they ought to call it the
Whack-10.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, USC's 22-0 victory against Oregon State on Saturday
was impressive, the Trojans holding the Beavers to 131 yards, but was
it a setup?</TE>
<TE>   How many times does 22 points win for you in the LCL (Left Coast
League)?</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State entered the game with glossy numbers on offense,
largely inflated against non-competitive, nonconference competition.
Beaver quarterback Derek Anderson is a real talent, but also a
sophomore making only his fifth collegiate start.</TE>
<TE>   Big surprise, then, that USC knocked Anderson around like Oscar De
La Hoya knocked around Fernando Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   If you've been around the Pac-10 block, you know it how utterly
confounding its dictates can be. Woody Hayes wouldn't have lasted
three weeks in this pass-happy hub. The Pac-10 has gone completely
"inside-out" in the last decade, with most defenses giving up bulk on
the interior in exchange for quickness in the shell.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to suggest what USC is trying to do on defense can't be
done. In 2000, Oregon State led the conference in defense and
finished 11-1, losing the Pac-10 title in a tiebreaker to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, USC has to know that you need to pitch the ball in this
conference and that most weeks 22 points is a nice total--at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the top three passing performances in the nation were
produced by Cody Pickett, Jason Gesser and Andrew Walter, three
Pac-10 quarterbacks who combined to complete 82 of 125 passes for
1,283 yards and 12 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Like a scientist with his test tube, we'll continue to monitor
USC's grand experiment on defense.</TE>
<TE>   But it has to be said: You don't get Derek Anderson every week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   We're at a loss to explain three weekend losses by three of
college football's greatest programs: Nebraska, Penn State and
Florida State, the fourth, ninth and 11th winningest programs of all
time.</TE>
<TE>   The schools entered the season with a combined all-time record of
1,909-808 and nine national championships, but these are the most
recent images: Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, glasses off, looking
like a drowned rat after his team's rain-soaked, overtime loss
Thursday night to Louisville; 75-year-old Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno sprinting off the field after his team's overtime loss to
Iowa in pursuit of an official; Nebraska Coach Frank Solich's look of
befuddlement in the wake of his team's wipeout defeat at Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   Assessment: Every time Paterno (75) and Bowden (72) lose a game it
is proclaimed by some as the beginning of the end for the two
coaching icons.</TE>
<TE>   Well, is it? It's true Penn State is coming off consecutive losing
seasons and has lost three consecutive Big Ten openers. Also, that
40-7 victory over Nebraska doesn't look so hot now that Nebraska
doesn't look so hot. Penn State (3-1) also plays at Wisconsin, at
Michigan and at Ohio State in the next month. Still, the Nittany
Lions appear good enough to reach eight wins.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden's comment on the Louisville game--"Their senior quarterback
was better than our sophomore"--sums up the Seminoles' plight. For
years, Bowden would only start only redshirt juniors at quarterback,
but has paid the price for playing Chris Rix this year and last. Rix
is getting better on the job, but the wobbly-duck interception he
threw in overtime should never have been thrown.</TE>
<TE>   However, victories against Miami, Notre Dame and Florida will
erase ugly memories of last Thursday's rainy night in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska? The Cornhuskers are in serious trouble, falling to 3-2
after Saturday's loss and out of the national polls for the first
time since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this has been a deconstruction in progress. In their last
four games played away from Lincoln, the Cornhuskers have allowed 62
points (at Colorado), 37 points (to Miami at the Rose Bowl), 40
points (at Penn State this year) and 36 points (at Iowa State).</TE>
<TE>   "As a player, as a captain of this football team, I am
embarrassed," Nebraska rush end Chris Kelsay told the Omaha
World-Herald. "The team is setting all sorts of records, and not
exactly the kind we want to set."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another record to consider: Nebraska has the major college
record with 40 consecutive winning seasons. At 3-2, and remaining
games against Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Kansas State and Colorado, is this
the year the record ends?</TE>
<TE>   As Omaha columnist Tom Shatel put it Sunday, "Looks like an early
winter."</TE>
<TE>   Ray of sunshine report: Nebraska plays host to Division I-AA
McNeese State next week and misses Oklahoma on the Big 12 schedule.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 35, HOUSTON 17</KH>
<HD>Dawkins Hits for Cycle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Brian Dawkins gave teams another reason to fear him.</LD>
<LD>   Dawkins, an All-Pro safety, caught his first career touchdown pass
and had an interception, a sack and a fumble recovery, leading the
Philadelphia Eagles to a 35-17 victory over the expansion Houston
Texans on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   He became the first player in NFL history to get all four in the
same game.</LD>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd get it all the way," Dawkins said of the
touchdown catch. "I just wanted to get the first down."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan McNabb completed 24 of 42 passes for 259 yards and one
touchdown, and Duce Staley had two one-yard touchdown runs as
Philadelphia cruised to its third consecutive double-digit victory.</TE>
<TE>   Since wasting a 14-point halftime lead in a season-opening loss at
Tennessee, the Eagles (3-1) have beaten Washington, Dallas and
Houston by a combined 79 points.</TE>
<TE>   A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Dawkins has earned a reputation for
being a fierce hitter who has a knack for making big plays in the
secondary. Sunday he proved he has some offensive skills too.</TE>
<TE>   "Dawkins has some goods hands," McNabb said. "When you have a guy
who can roam the backfield like that and is a good blitzer, you have
to keep your eyes on him."</TE>
<TE>   David Carr, the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft, completed 16
of 29 passes for 188 yards with two touchdowns to Corey Bradford. The
Texans (1-3) have lost three in a row since beating the Cowboys in
their opener.</TE>

<HD>Record Season Heaven-Sent for the Star-Crossed Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday afternoon, after a regular season of unexpected achievement,
after a glorious send-off from a red-clad sellout crowd of 42,878,
the Angels drove to Long Beach and boarded a charter flight to
Newark, N.J. On Tuesday, they will open the major league baseball
playoffs at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees have won 26 World Series titles. In their 42-year
history, the Angels have never played a single World Series game.
Yankee fans consider it a lost year if there is no World Series
title. Angel fans have known only lost years.</LD>
<LD>   The best-of-five-game playoff series this week will pit the
Yankees, the most revered, copied, hated, loved, envied team in
baseball, against the Angels, a team known less for on-field
achievement than for episodes of human tragedy and laughable,
ludicrous collapses.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess," said bench coach Joe Maddon, "that if we have a
national identity, it would be the so-called jinx."</TE>
<TE>   Maddon has been a member of the Angels as a player, scout or coach
since 1975. "I have some moments," Maddon said, "where I wonder about
that so-called jinx. I don't believe in it. But other people do."</TE>
<TE>   And why not?</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have suffered through epic late-season collapses--in
1995, they blew an 11-game lead in August and lost a one-game playoff
to the Seattle Mariners--and epic playoff collapses. In 1982, they
squandered a 2-0 lead to the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1986, with a 3-1
series lead over the Boston Red Sox, one strike from the World
Series, Donnie Moore gave up a home run to Dave Henderson that turned
around the game and the series.</TE>
<TE>   They have suffered through human tragedies. Moore, the troubled
relief pitcher who threw the fateful pitch to Henderson in Game 5 of
the 1986 American League championship series, committed suicide four
years later and his widow said one reason was that 1986 game.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, outfielder Lyman Bostock, a prized free-agent
acquisition, was killed in Gary, Ind., by a gunshot meant for someone
else. A promising rookie pitcher, Dick Wantz, died in 1965 of a brain
tumor at age 25. In 1968, Minnie Rojas, a talented relief pitcher,
was paralyzed in a car crash that killed his wife and two of his
three children. A rookie relief pitcher, Bruce Heinbechner, was
killed in a 1974 car crash. A shortstop, Mike Miley, was killed in a
1977 car crash.</TE>
<TE>   And they have suffered through absurd accidents.</TE>
<TE>   A 1992 bus crash on the New Jersey turnpike injured 13 members of
the organization and put manager Buck Rodgers in the hospital for
three months. A flying bat broke the orbital bone of their pitching
ace, Chuck Finley, in spring training in 1997. Their starting
shortstop, Gary DiSarcina, stepped into the swing of coach George
Hendrick during practice and had his arm broken in 1999. The same
year, their prized and high-priced free agent, first baseman Mo
Vaughn, took a wrong step into the dugout chasing a pop fly and badly
sprained his ankle. In the first inning of his first game as an
Angel.</TE>
<TE>   "But this has a different feeling," Maddon said. "This team is
different. It is built for the long term. It is built to withstand
injuries and it has a different attitude. It really does."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude showed as the Angels shook off a 6-14 start to win a
team-record 99 games, qualifying for the playoffs as the wild-card
team in the American League. When the Oakland A's threatened to run
away with the West division title by winning 20 consecutive games,
the Angels responded by winning 10 in a row. The A's won the division
title, but not until the final week of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, the 28-year-old ace of the Angel pitching staff
who will start Game 1 Tuesday, said he pays no attention to talk of
jinxes. "What happened here five years ago or 10 years ago, that
doesn't matter to me," he said. "All I'm concerned about is this team
right now, and we don't have jinxes. We're a good young team that has
worked hard and earned what we've gotten. That's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Uhlich, Angel senior vice president of business operations,
says that "baseball, more than any other sport, is entrenched in
history, whether it's good or it's bad. Either way, there's no
getting away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich, 44, was born and reared in Anaheim and has been involved
with the Angels since he became a bat boy when he was 18.</TE>
<TE>   Even while he was insisting the Angels aren't jinxed, Uhlich had
to admit that Angel history was tilted heavily toward the bad.
"Tragedies such as we've had do leave a mark. It hurts an
organization if its defining moments are more negative than positive.
What's happening now is that maybe we haven't had much of a national
identity and we're gaining one."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, there was George Will on a network TV show using
Angel shortstop David Eckstein as an example of the perfect American
success story--the undersized, overlooked, hard-working,
never-give-up optimist who finally gets his big-league chance and
runs with it.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the week when the baseball playoffs are about
to start, it is an Angel being talked about. And it is a successful
Angel involved in a happy story.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home is where you find history's burden.</TE>
<TE>   This is a team that once played its home games at Dodger Stadium,
the home of its local rival. Now it plays at Edison Field in Anaheim,
in a stadium, some say, built on an Indian burial ground, where
then-owner Gene Autry once considered holding an exorcism. On
Thursday, the day the Angels clinched their first playoff berth in 16
years, team President Paul Pressler quit to work for the Gap and the
team's owner, Walt Disney Co., confirmed it had employed the services
of an investment bank to sell the team.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, the Angels' right fielder since 1992, admitted that
last week, when the Angels let four chances to clinch their first
playoff spot since 1986 slip by, his stomach was tied up in knots.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to think of the past," Salmon said, "but the thoughts
creep in. I wasn't here for everything, but I was here in 1995 and
you do start to wonder."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry, widow of Gene, had to stop and think about her most
disappointing Angel memory. It wasn't that she couldn't remember. It
was that there are so many.</TE>
<TE>   Autry, who is honorary president of the American League, finally
decided it was 1982. "Everybody was just so confident," she said,
"and we thought we had such a good team and I must confess that some
of us thought it was a shoo-in after we won the first two games of
that series against Milwaukee."</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't. The Angels went to Milwaukee and lost three in a
row in the best-of-five format.</TE>
<TE>   "And the second-worst moment," Autry said, "was in 1986, of
course. Everybody remembers that. I don't have to recount what
happened, do I?"</TE>
<TE>   Not really. The Angels led the Red Sox, three games to one, in the
best-of-seven American League championship series. They led, 5-2,
going into the top of the ninth inning of Game 5. They led, 5-4, and
relief pitcher Moore had two strikes on Red Sox batter Henderson. One
more strike and the Angels were off to their first World Series. The
strike didn't come. Henderson whacked a home run to put the Red Sox
ahead, 6-5. The Angels tied the score in the bottom of the ninth but
ended up losing, 7-6, in 11 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The shellshocked Angels went back to Boston for the final two
games. "The flight back to Boston was terrible," Jackie Autry said.
"There was no sense," Uhlich says, "that we were going to come back."</TE>
<TE>   And they didn't win again. The Angels lost, 10-4, in Game 6 and
8-1 in Game 7. Roger Clemens, who lost to the Angels in Game 1 and
was the winning pitcher in Game 7, will be the Yankee starter in Game
1 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   History. This game is all about history.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Spiro, 67, of Irvine, a retired sales executive, has been
an Angel season-ticket holder since 1980. He grew up in Brooklyn,
going to games at Ebbets Field, rooting for the Dodgers, the Boys of
Summer.</TE>
<TE>   But when he moved to Orange County 30 years ago, Spiro said, "I
just drifted to the nearest location because I love baseball and
wanted to see baseball games. So I started watching the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never believed in curses or jinxes--well, maybe the 'Curse
of the Bambino,' but that's all. I believe in good teams with good
chemistry and that's what I like about this team. It is a blue-collar
team and I think when the rest of the country sees this team, the
rest of the country will love this team."</TE>

<KH>JACKSONVILLE 29, NEW YORK JETS 3</KH>
<HD>Jets Again Unable to Touch Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The New York Jets have bigger questions to answer than who their
quarterback will be next week.</LD>
<LD>   Like, can they score a touchdown? Can they learn how to tackle
better? And can they figure out how to win another game?</LD>
<LD>   Led by 237 yards from Fred Taylor--142 rushing and 95
receiving--the Jacksonville Jaguars made the Jets look hapless again
Sunday, defeating them 28-3.</LD>
<TE>   "We played like kids out there," Jet running back Curtis Martin
said. "We didn't play like an NFL football team."</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Mack scored three touchdowns for Jacksonville (2-1)-- three
more than New York has scored in the last two weeks. The Jets (1-3)
have been outscored, 102-13, in three consecutive losses, their worst
three-game stretch since 1962, when they were known as the New York
Titans.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets came into the game with Martin limping on an injured
ankle. They finished with Vinny Testaverde on the bench after he took
a hard hit early in the game that left him with a bruised right
shoulder and a pinched nerve.</TE>
<TE>   A quarterback controversy looms, although it's hard to tell if it
matters who lines up under center. Coach Herm Edwards must choose
between Testaverde, who thinks he'll be healthy by next week, and
Chad Pennington, who threw for 281 yards but had no more luck than
Testaverde did last week getting the Jets in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's on his mind right now," Testaverde said,
when asked about Edwards' pending quarterback choice. "He's got other
problems than who the quarterback is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, all is well for Jacksonville, which has a winning
record for the first time in a year.</TE>

<KH>DETROIT 26, NEW ORLEANS 21</KH>
<HD>Harrington Starting to Pay Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Joey Harrington already had the look, the arm and the bank account of
a starting NFL quarterback. Now he has a victory.</LD>
<LD>   The rookie from Oregon threw for 267 yards and a touchdown, and
didn't make any costly mistakes, as the Lions beat New Orleans,
26-21, Sunday to hand the Saints their first loss.</LD>
<LD>   Harrington gave the Lions their first win of the season and only
the third in 20 games for Coach Marty Mornhinweg.</LD>
<TE>   On the possession that put the Lions ahead, 20-0, Harrington
showed why Detroit made him the third pick in the draft and signed
him to a six-year, $36-million contract. He perfectly lofted a pass
over the shoulder of Az-Zahir Hakim for a 40-yard completion. On the
next play, Harrington hit Bill Schroeder in stride for a 38-yard
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the best I got," Harrington said with the smile that
helped sell his "Joey Heisman" campaign at Oregon last season.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington was 25-3 as a starter in college, and the Lions (1-3)
are hoping he's the big-game quarterback they've been longing for.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit hasn't had a quarterback play in the Pro Bowl since Greg
Landry in 1971, and hasn't had long-term stability at the position
since Bobby Layne started from 1951 until Detroit won the NFL
championship in 1957. Since then, the team has used more than 20
starting quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be the quarterback for the ages here," teammate
Todd Lyght said of Harrington. "The kid is a playmaker and is a
natural born leader. I love the way he handles himself."</TE>
<TE>   Harrington completed 20 of 36 passes, didn't get sacked or had a
pass intercepted after having four intercepted in his first start
last week against Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Young quarterbacks go on streaks, and that's what he did today,"
Mornhinweg said. "He'll have down stretches too, but today he was
good."</TE>
<TE>   The Saints (3-1) fell behind, 20-0, for the second consecutive
week, but they couldn't match the comeback they staged against
Chicago, losing receivers Joe Horn (knee) and Donte Stallworth
(hamstring) to injuries in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Need to Be a Money Player</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is easy to understand how the Dodgers might view this as another
winter trapped in a dilemma of dollars and sense.</LD>
<LD>   Money talks, and what it's saying is that any attempt to add the
run-producing hitter the Dodgers desperately needed this season and
the rotation insurance that now seems imperative for 2003 could be
impeded by those inflated, inflexible and seemingly immovable
contracts plaguing the roster.</LD>
<LD>   Money talks, and what it's saying is that with 12 players already
guaranteed $95 million next year, with the Dodgers facing increased
revenue sharing and a possible payroll tax and reluctant to exceed
this year's payroll of $105 million, with the farm system still being
rebuilt, how are they going to bid for a free-agent hitter of the Jim
Thome or Jeff Kent magnitude? And where would they play with first
baseman Eric Karros and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek expensively
under contract for another year and the trade market on both likely
to be about as bullish as the Nasdaq?</LD>
<TE>   Well, yes, the dollars do talk, but the sense of it is that they
can't really afford not to pursue a big-time hitter, and isn't Kent
the most realistic choice?</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers packed Sunday amid the painful images of the
celebrating San Francisco Giants. There was no solace in 92
wins--their most since 1991--or the knowledge that they had proved
again that the games of April are as important as those of September.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers hadn't opened the season with those three straight
losses to the Giants at Dodger Stadium they might have been packing
for a playoff opener in Atlanta instead of making tee times.</TE>
<TE>   It could also be said that if they hadn't competed most of
September with almost a complete rotation--Kevin Brown, Darren
Dreifort, Kazuhisa Ishii and Andy Ashby--sidelined by injury, they
might have survived an offense that provides the biggest if.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers hadn't led the National League in runners left on
base or finished 11th in home runs or eighth in runs or next-to-last
in on-base percentage, they probably would have won the NL West even
with the pitching injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "In this ballpark, in this league, our focus will always be
pitching and defense," General Manager Dan Evans said. "No Dodger
team has ever outslugged anyone in our ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "Having said that, we knew going in that our offense wouldn't be
among the league's strongest, and we know it's something we have to
address."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, of course, would prefer a less expensive route than
free agency, than buying into another multiyear contract, but given
their roster and position and trade limitations, given the absence of
farm help, what choice does Evans have?</TE>
<TE>   With the names of free agents such as Edgardo Alfonzo and Todd
Zeile already floating around Dodger Stadium, Kent's can't be
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff is going to explore the market and would be flattered to be
considered by the Dodgers," said Jeff Klein, his New York-based
agent.</TE>
<TE>   That was as far as Klein would go, considering the second baseman
is still wearing a Giant uniform.</TE>
<TE>   However, a person familiar with Kent and the situation said,
"There's great synergy between the Dodger needs and Jeff's
capability. There's a lot of plusses to it. The Dodgers are committed
to winning and Jeff knows the division and grew up in the area
[attending Huntington Beach Edison High]. In addition, while his
choice would be to remain at second, he has improved significantly at
first base and can also play third."</TE>
<TE>   Those options are important, but it's his bat that's more
attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Kent is the only second baseman in history to have driven in 100
or more runs for six straight seasons, 108 this year. He has emerged
from a big second half with 37 homers and a .313 average entering the
playoffs--and shouldn't the Dodgers salivate at the idea of stripping
the hated Giants of Kent's production and depriving the Braves, who
will be looking for a second baseman, of a shot at him?</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally," said a Dodger official, "we'd like to improve the right
side of the infield, but it's going to be a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard, for example, to see the Dodgers simply releasing
Karros and swallowing the $8 million he is owed next year, and it is
hard to see anyone trading for a soon-to-be 35-year-old first baseman
who will be coming off shoulder surgery, who hit only 13 home runs
and who also could be owed a $9-million option or $1-million buyout
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   It is also hard to see teams jumping at Grudzielanek. In an era of
power-hitting middle infielders, he batted .271 with nine home runs
and 50 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Karros, however, there could be a modest market for
Grudzielanek if the Dodgers pick up some of the $5.5 million he is
owed next year.</TE>
<TE>   The math isn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have $26 million tied up in Brown and Dreifort with no
assurance they will be anything more than relief pitchers next year,
if that.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby is owed $8 million and Ishii $2.2 million, and if there
aren't lingering physical questions with both, neither was a model of
consistency in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Eric Gagne and Dave Roberts are in line for
significant raises, and Odalis Perez and Adrian Beltre are
arbitration-eligible.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the $10 million the Dodgers will save if Omar Daal and
Marquis Grissom leave as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, of course, represents the club's most marketable
commodity, but despite the Dodgers' frustration with his
inconsistency and focus at times, he did hit 21 home runs and drive
in 75 runs, and there is a considerable risk trading a 23-year-old
player with his ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a possibility that the Dodgers will find themselves
with a $9-million windfall next year if Brian Jordan exercises his
right to demand a trade. However, Jordan may decide there is too much
uncertainty in that right, and the Dodgers, impressed by his
leadership and clutch hitting down the stretch, may buy out his trade
rights by guaranteeing his $10.5-million option for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   How would Kent, who made $6 million this year and whom Barry Bonds
recently urged the Giants to re-sign despite their tenuous
relationship, fit into the equation, considering he is likely to seek
a three- or four-year contract at $8 million to $12 million a year?</TE>
<TE>   Well, what price do the Dodgers put on closing that narrow gap
between 92 wins and the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   How can they look at their offensive numbers and not choose to
provide Shawn Green with better protection in a strengthened lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to be creative," said Evans, speaking
generally, "but nobody thought we'd be able to do the amount of
things we did last winter."</TE>
<TE>   Evans basically managed to revise the chemistry and composition in
an executive-of-the-year performance.</TE>
<TE>   Now he needs another hitter and another pitcher, and if he has an
ear cocked to hear how loud money is talking, his other might pick up
the persistent staccato of Jeff Kent's bat.</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 17, CAROLINA 14</KH>
<HD>Packers Cast Fate to Favre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>No matter how many times Brett Favre's supporting cast changes, he
finds a way to get the Green Bay Packers a victory.</LD>
<LD>   With William Henderson out and Terry Glenn in the locker room
because of a migraine headache, Favre found little-known Donald
Driver for a 22-yard touchdown with 4:10 left Sunday, leading the
Packers to a 17-14 victory over the Carolina Panthers.</LD>
<LD>   "It was difficult, but I wasn't really concerned about who was in
and who was out. My focus never changes," Favre said. "We had a lot
of new faces out there, a lot of young faces. A lot of guys stepped
up."</LD>
<TE>   But the Packers still had to sweat it out. Carolina drove to the
Green Bay five, only to have Shayne Graham--signed two days ago as
its third kicker this season--miss a 24-yard field goal with 13
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my job, to go out there and make kicks, and I didn't do
that," said Graham, who made six of eight field goals with Buffalo
last season. "It's probably the worst second in your life when you
pick your head up and you see it sailing wide right."</TE>
<TE>   Favre, who became Green Bay's starting quarterback 10 years ago
this week, completed 18 of 32 passes for 200 yards, with one
interception. He has 3,414 completions, passing Joe Montana for fifth
place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Driver had the first two-touchdown game of his career--scoring the
first one on a pass from tight end Bubba Franks on a trick play in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith filled in nicely for Panther leading receiver Muhsin
Muhammad, catching five passes for 116 yards, and Lamar Smith rushed
for 66 yards and two scores. But it wasn't enough for Carolina (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   "Two turnovers resulted in points off the board or at least
opportunities to kick field goals," Panther Coach John Fox said. "You
don't make mistakes like that against good teams and expect to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers brought the NFL's No. 2 defense to Lambeau Field, and
frustrated the Packers all afternoon. Add in the patchwork lineup,
and Green Bay's offense struggled to get into rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   But Favre is a master of fourth-quarter rallies, and he pulled off
the 25th of his career. "I'd rather be up, sipping Gatorade on the
sidelines," Favre said. "But I think I handle the situation very
well. My team trusts I'll get the job done."</TE>

<HD>Everything's Different This Year</HD>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last eight Septembers, it has been the mundane Sunday
routine: Los Angeles on the sideline, watching while America plays.
You'd have thought we'd have gotten used to it by now, but after this
September, with our NFL past (the Rams) 0-4 and our NFL future (the
Chargers?) 4-0, we don't know if we're coming or going.</LD>
<LD>   We do know this: Tommy Maddox was the best quarterback the last
pro football team in Los Angeles ever had. And if Pittsburgh Steeler
Coach Bill Cowher didn't realize that Maddox was the answer to his
team's out-the-gate troubles, the 37 season-ticket holders of the
late L.A. Xtreme (2001 to 2001, R.I.P.) could have told him.</LD>
<LD>   We know our football here. Or at least we know that on a dry field
in Pittsburgh, with all things being equal, including the score at
the end of regulation, Maddox is far less likely to hurl a
game-losing interception than Kordell Stewart.</LD>
<TE>   What was that? You say Maddox opened Sunday's overtime period
against Cleveland by hooking up with Brown linebacker Andra Davis? On
the very first offensive play of sudden death?</TE>
<TE>   Let me ask you this: Did Pittsburgh lose the game?</TE>
<TE>   Technically speaking, you would have to say no. Although that
one's under review. The Browns are still trying to figure out how
they blocked Todd Peterson's 24-yard field goal, then lost the game
on Peterson's 31-yard field goal on the very next play.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Browns are having the kind of season that makes a city
swear off football. Cleveland tried that for a few years in the late
'90s. Initial civic response: How about spending millions on a new
stadium in order to bring back the NFL? Older, wiser response after
Sunday's 16-13 loss to Pittsburgh: How about seeing if we can fish
out the warranty on this thing?</TE>
<TE>   The Browns began the season by tackling Kansas City's quarterback
on the last play before time expired, with Cleveland leading by two
points. The Browns lost.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, the Browns blocked Pittsburgh's potential
overtime-ending field goal on second down. On third down, the Browns
lost.</TE>
<TE>   Two obscure passages from the NFL rule book separate the 2-2
Browns from 4-0. Against Kansas City, Cleveland linebacker Dwayne
Rudd injured himself while tackling Trent Green as time ran
out--diagnosis: brain cramp--and threw his helmet while a Kansas City
lineman was running with the football. Rudd was penalized for
unsportsmanlike conduct. NFL rules hold that no game can end on a
defensive penalty, so Kansas City was given an out-of-time field-goal
attempt and Cleveland lost, 40-39.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday at Heinz Field, Cleveland's Alvin McKinley broke through
the Pittsburgh line to block a late field goal--only he was guilty of
blocking it too well and too soon. McKinley got all ball, sending the
carom several yards behind the line of scrimmage, where Steeler John
Fiala recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Because the ball had not passed the line of scrimmage, and because
Pittsburgh attempted the field goal on second down, the ball remained
in Pittsburgh's possession, as if the Steelers had simply fallen on a
botched pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   Third down, Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Second chance, Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   This time from 31 yards, Peterson nailed it.</TE>
<TE>   And years from now, Maddox, who replaced the struggling Stewart at
quarterback in the fourth quarter, can tell his grandchildren how he
won the big game over the Browns for the Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Winless, and awful, in their first two games, the Steelers are now
1-2 with a grimy asterisk attached. Cowher, who was credited with his
100th NFL coaching victory, most likely doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   In this league, it's all about winning--and to quote Houston Texan
defensive tackle Seth Payne, who didn't win Sunday in Philadelphia,
"Respect is nice, but wins are a lot better than respect. I'd rather
be disrespected and go 16-0."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, an expansion footballer can dream, can't he? The Texans, on
pace for 16-0 after Week 1, have been badly disrespected ever since,
losing their third straight, the latest by a 35-17 score to the
Eagles, who even dragged out a trick play--fake punt, shovel pass
from Brian Mitchell to Brian Dawkins, 57-yard touchdown--to rub the
Texans' noses in it.</TE>
<TE>   That left the first-year Texans 1-3, which leaves them looking
down at the defending NFC West champion Rams. For the shell-shocked
masses of St. Louis who had taken solace in the notion that things
couldn't possibly get worse after three losses in three starts, well,
the Cardinals open the National League playoffs this week.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the Rams lose, 13-10, at home to the Quincy Carter
Dallas Cowboys, they are now 0-4 for the first time in 40 years and
facing the prospect of playing at least the next four weeks without
Kurt Warner, who broke the pinkie finger on his throwing hand for the
second time in three years. To quote former Angel manager Cookie
Rojas, whose team used to share the same Anaheim address with the
Rams, "You've hit bottom rock!" Be careful what you wish for, Warner
bashers, whose ranks had been swelling during the Rams' 0-3 start.
St. Louis has seen its football future, and its name is Jamie Martin,
who replaced Warner and drove the Rams to all of 10 points against a
Dallas defense that had yielded 44 to Philadelphia the week before.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse: Green, the quarterback formerly employed by
the Rams for emergencies like this, was passing for five touchdowns
across state to lead the Chiefs to a 48-30 upset over the previously
unbeaten Miami Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams haven't been the same since the Super Bowl loss to New
England--and neither, quite frankly, has New England. The Patriots
were 3-0 heading into Sunday's game in San Diego, having convinced
the doubters and the bookmakers that they were for real (give or take
the cyborg who sits in for Bill Belichick during postgame news
conferences).</TE>
<TE>   Thus convinced the Patriots were headed for 4-0, the nation
promptly got burned again--watching the Chargers win instead, 21-14,
to run their record to 4-0 after ending the 2001 season 0-9.</TE>
<TE>   Until any bit of this season starts making sense, please refer to
the Cincinnati Bengals--35-7 losers to Tampa Bay, 0-4 for the sixth
time since 1990--the league's last remaining touchstone.</TE>

<LD>If playoff experience counts for something besides a cliche, the

<LD>   The Angels are justifiably proud of their largely home-grown
roster, but this is the flip side: No one in the Angel lineup for
Tuesday's playoff opener has played in a postseason game.</LD>
<LD>   Based on projected lineups for the first game of the best-of-five
division series against the New York Yankees, the Yankees lead the
Angels, 296-0, in games of playoff experience.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of experience on this side, which means we're
going to be relaxed," Yankee pitcher David Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys are going to be a little tense. It's an advantage for
nerves--not for the game, but for your nerves. We've got that
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   This is not mission impossible for the Angels, but it is mission
improbable. In their first playoff appearance in 16 years, the Angels
aren't only playing against the Yankees. They're playing against
Yankee Stadium too, where unimaginably loud New York fans and an
unimaginably loud sound system combine for nine innings of sonic
assault.</TE>
<TE>   If this series extends to five games, the Yankees play at home
three times.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no place like Yankee Stadium in the postseason," Yankee
reliever Mike Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans are rowdy, and they stay rowdy. That's why home-field
advantage is such a big thing for us. If you let it, it can
definitely be an intimidating place. You've got to walk through all
the monuments to get to the bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   No worries, the Angels vow. Since 1996, the year the Yankees won
the first of four World Series championships in six seasons, the
Angels are 18-17 at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels insist they're not just happy to be here, but the
Yankees were far less thrilled with their division championship than
the Angels were with their wild-card berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels celebrated madly, letting out years of frustration. The
Yankees quietly checked off the first box on their to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sit here and tell you last year was a success,"
Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter said. "We lost."</TE>
<TE>   They did, but not until the last inning of the last game of the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play for second," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bordick, the Baltimore Oriole shortstop, has appeared in 32
playoff games. There is something to all that Yankee experience, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the postseason, it seems, their pitchers gain a couple miles
on their fastball," Bordick said. "They've got so many big-time,
clutch players.</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely the team to beat."</TE>
<TE>   The lone Angel in Tuesday's lineup with big-game experience is
center fielder Darin Erstad, the punter for Nebraska's national
championship football team in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   On the playoff roster, the lone Angel with postseason experience
is pitcher Kevin Appier, who starts Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Appier, who pitched for Oakland in the 2000 postseason, said he
has shared his playoff experience with his teammates. What he
remembers most, he said, is "how normal it feels."</TE>
<TE>   Said Appier: "It's a baseball game. I remember thinking that. I
remember standing in the outfield in the first batting practice of
the postseason and thinking, wow, this seems strangely normal.</TE>
<TE>   "More is riding on the game, but it's still the same thing we're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   That's the mantra, and the Angels will need to repeat it, over and
over, while dealing with long-lost friends clamoring for tickets,
television cameras shoved in their faces and hundreds of reporters
pestering them.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time, it's pretty much a circus," Bordick said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mo Vaughn, whose leadership skills were more hype than
reality during his three injury-plagued years in Anaheim, is willing
to help his old teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I would tell those guys that the most important thing is to get
out on the field as soon as possible," Vaughn told the Newark
Star-Ledger. "All the other stuff that goes on before and after the
game, with the media and the interviews and all the other stuff, can
get to you.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember back in '95 my mind was swirling. I didn't handle it
very well. The next time around, I figured out how to handle that
stuff better."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, his MVP season, he went 0 for 14 with seven strikeouts in
his playoff debut. In 1998, he went seven for 17, driving in seven
runs in four games.</TE>
<TE>   And, although the Oakland Athletics lost to the Yankees in the
division series last year, they did win the first two games at Yankee
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi, the first baseman for Oakland last year and for the
Yankees this year, was asked what the key might be for the Angels to
win a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Why am I going to tell you that?" he said. "I don't want them to
beat us."</TE>

<LD>Francisco Rodriguez, 20 years old, owner of 5 2/3 innings pitched in
the major leagues, was heading to the baseball playoffs and preparing
to face the New York Yankees wasn't the hardest thing he had to do
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was tying his necktie.</LD>
<LD>   As a member of the Angel traveling party, Rodriguez needed to wear
a suit. And tie. Neatly knotted. Rodriguez couldn't do it. He fumbled
with the necktie and then sneaked around a knot of reporters. He
tapped third-string catcher Sal Fasano on the back and whispered to
him. Fasano turned around and tied the tie.</LD>
<TE>   As a father would for a son heading to the prom, Fasano tightened
the silk tie, stood back, looked, then straightened it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do anything for this team," said Fasano, a midseason
acquisition from Milwaukee who was not included on the playoff
roster.</TE>
<TE>   That is what makes this Angel team so special.</TE>
<TE>   Fasano tying the tie. David Eckstein laying down the bunt. Garret
Anderson taking an extra base. Scott Spiezio playing four positions.
Darin Erstad making a diving catch, into the wall, face first. Tim
Salmon never complaining about injuries or losing. Troy Percival
walking two batters in the bottom of the ninth, then striking out
three.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus getting hot, then cold, then hot and driving in 111
runs. The Molina brothers, Bengie and Jose, happily taking care of
the squatting. Adam Kennedy working at finding his batting stroke and
always having his fielding hand. Brad Fullmer becoming a solid
designated hitter, quiet and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Palmeiro coming off the bench and hitting singles. Jarrod
Washburn, Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz and John Lackey melding into a
real starting rotation. Scott Schoeneweis quietly accepting a
demotion from starter to reliever.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it takes. That's what is most impressive about the
Angels. No one cares who gets credit. No one places blame.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cook and Aaron Sele, veteran pitchers, men who have
appeared in playoffs, were left off the roster for the Angel-Yankee
series.</TE>
<TE>   There was no whining. Both have spent quiet minutes with the guys
who are going to New York, telling them what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   "Dennis told me that you should take a step back, don't let the
atmosphere overwhelm you," Eckstein said. "He said he got so caught
up in everything the first time he went to the playoffs that he
didn't enjoy the experience."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon watched Rodriguez get ready for his trip and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   How can Salmon tell the youngster that it might be 10 more years
before he pitches for another playoff team? How can Salmon tell
Rodriguez to enjoy every moment, from wearing the suit on the
airplane to warming up in a Yankee Stadium bullpen while men with
frothy beer mustaches call him obscene names, because there might
never be another moment like it, that Rodriguez is lucky to have this
moment?</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell him that," Salmon said. "I can't because he's not
going to believe me. A lot of the young guys on this team don't have
a sense of Angel history and sometimes being naive is good. Not
knowing all the disappointments here, what this team has gone through
to get to this place, that's great for the young guys. Let them think
the best."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was a rookie in 1995 when the Angels blew an 11-game
August lead and lost a one-game playoff with Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd be back lots of times," Anderson said. "I thought
it was going to be easy. I thought we had a pretty good team and good
things would just keep happening. Unless you're playing for a very
few organizations, it's not that easy. But I can't tell any of our
guys about that experience. It's something they'll find out on their
own."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon played his first major league game at Yankee Stadium and
Salmon doesn't remember much about it. He doesn't remember who won.
"Probably the Yankees," Salmon says. "We were pretty bad." Actually,
it was the Angels, 9-5.</TE>
<TE>   He said he remembered how he did. "I went 0 for 3," Salmon said,
"with a walk." It was 0 for 4, actually. But he did walk.</TE>
<TE>   What is the point of remembering the small details of a single win
for a bad team at what turned out to be the start of a bad decade?</TE>
<TE>   There is the chance now, finally, to make real memories, ones that
would last forever. Since it has taken Salmon 10 years to reach this
moment, he sees no reason for the Angels to look for moral victories.
Winning three games from the Yankees, that would be a memory. Having
the country notice the Angels for something other than ignominy, that
would be a memory.</TE>
<TE>   And if young Rodriguez leaves New York having learned how to tie a
tie and thinking the future will be nothing but more playoffs and
titles and winning, that would be fine too.</TE>

<KH>OAKLAND 52, TENNESSEE 25</KH>
<HD>Rookie Gets Raiders Going</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Phillip Buchanon insists he could have been better in his debut on
defense.</LD>
<LD>   It took less than four minutes for the rookie to show he's ready
to be an NFL starter, perhaps even at three positions. But he felt
robbed in the Oakland Raiders' 52-25 rout of the Tennessee Titans on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Buchanon had an interception on the first play of the game that
was overturned by an instant replay challenge. But he scored on a
punt return and handed off on another punt returned for a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   Then Buchanon, a cornerback by trade, got an interception that
counted in the fourth quarter, leading to the Raiders' final score.</TE>
<TE>   He also finished with seven solo tackles.</TE>
<TE>   He's convinced he picked off Steve McNair on the first play.</TE>
<TE>   "I said 'That's messed up!' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have had it, but I can't change it."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland (3-0) has won in different fashion in each of its games.
Its first victory came behind the running game, the second on a
superb passing performance by Rich Gannon, and this one was
highlighted by stellar special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Woodson had three interceptions, one he returned 82 yards for
a touchdown, making him the NFL's career leader in interception
return yardage with 1,339.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in the right place at the right time, good things
happen to you," Woodson said.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon completed 29 of 39 passes for 381 yards and four
touchdowns, and Jerry Rice had seven catches for 144 yards and a
touchdown. Rice became the NFL's career leader in yards from
scrimmage, passing the late Walter Payton.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who turns 40 on Oct. 13, finished with 151 yards to give him
21,281 for his career, 17 more than Payton. Rice has 20,649 receiving
and 632 rushing in his 18-season career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor to break a record like Walter's," Rice said. "I had
a chance to meet him over the years, and he was a terrific
individual."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders, coming off their open date, beat the Tennessee
franchise for the first time since the Raiders were in Los Angeles
and the Titans (1-3) were the Houston Oilers, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I don't need to recap the entire ballgame," Titan
Coach Jeff Fisher said. "We fell behind because of two plays on
special teams and our inability to make a tackle on their first
offensive play."</TE>
<TE>   McNair was 32 for 46 for a career-high 398 yards and two
touchdowns, but threw four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, the Raiders' top draft pick out of national champion
Miami, was promoted to starter at left cornerback Wednesday to
replace Charles Woodson, who has a broken right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were any questions on Phillip Buchanon's abilities
today, he made a lot of great plays," Raider Coach Bill Callahan
said. "We have a lot of confidence in Phillip."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Singled Out at Belfry</HD>
<DH>Golf: Europe dominates individual match play, supposedly
Americans' strength, and reclaims Ryder Cup, 151/2-121/2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Gentlemen, start your second-guessing. Now that the Ryder Cup is
staying here on the continent, we need answers to a few vital
questions.</LD>
<LD>   For instance ...</LD>
<LD>   How could Phil Mickelson lose to this Phillip Price?</LD>
<TE>   What happened to the singles party the U.S. planned? How could the
U.S. win two, yes, only two singles matches Sunday, with the
identities of those two players being Scott Verplank and David Toms?</TE>
<TE>   Did Sam Torrance outfox Curtis Strange by stacking the top of his
lineup with his best players?</TE>
<TE>   Was Europe's home-cooking show of slowing down the greens,
narrowing the fairways and growing the rough that much of an
advantage, and should the U.S players have adjusted better?</TE>
<TE>   Uh, Paul McGinley?</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes, but that happens when you lose. And lose the U.S.
did, 15 1/2-12 1/2. There will always be a lot more questions about
why you lost than why you won, and so for the time being, it's going
to be open season on the question front, probably until the 2004
Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills in Birmingham, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson's quixotic relationship with big events is a good place
to start.</TE>
<TE>   He's known as the best player never to win a major championship
and now has another unhappy label to wear--the player who couldn't
beat Price with the Ryder Cup on the line.</TE>
<TE>   It's questionable whether the U.S. would have won anyway,
considering that McGinley's putt on the 18th hole clinched the Ryder
Cup with two matches still out on the course, but Sunday at the
Belfry will not rank very high among Mickelson's accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   How exactly does the second-ranked player in the world lose, 3 and
2, to the 119th-ranked player in the world? At least we know how he
felt about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too thrilled," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   That's understandable, but what transpired Sunday in the fourth
Ryder Cup held here in the North Berwickshire countryside actually
deserves to rank high in the thrill department, regardless of the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Europe won four of the first six matches and halved another, then
held on to upset the U.S. and claim the Ryder Cup for the first time
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we saw the draw, we knew we were going to win," Jesper
Parnevik said. "Sam did exactly the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   After Torrance, Europe's captain, swigged from a bottle of
champagne and was thrown into the lake near the 18th green in a
victory celebration, his counterpart admitted the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played well," said Strange, the U.S. captain. "They
just beat us. We got a European butt-whipping today. Sam, I think he
gambled a bit at the start, but it paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "And look at Phillip Price. He beat Phil Mickelson into the
ground. All you can do is congratulate him."</TE>
<TE>   It's unfair to place too much blame on Mickelson, when the
supposedly superior U.S. team won only two of the 12 singles matches
and halved five.</TE>
<TE>   Not even Tiger Woods could do much about the outcome. By the time
Woods reached the first tee, Europe led the first six matches and
seven of the first eight. Woods earned a half-point, conceding a par
putt to Parnevik with the matches already decided.</TE>
<TE>   McGinley had made sure of that. The 35-year-old Ryder Cup rookie
from Dublin watched his eight-foot putt roll straight into the hole
to earn the half-point that made a European victory certain.</TE>
<TE>   Verplank's 2-and-1 victory over Lee Westwood had kept the U.S.
boat afloat, and within two points at 12 1/2-10 1/2, but Mickelson
couldn't keep up with Price and lost for the first time in four
singles matches. While Price was obviously right, with five birdies
and no bogeys, Mickelson wasn't as lucky. He lost two holes with
bogeys and missed a three-foot putt for birdie to drop another.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my match was going to be a critical point and that seemed
to put a little bit of pressure on me to get off to a fast start,"
Mickelson said. "When I didn't, it made it difficult to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson said he had not been overconfident, just beaten by
somebody who had played better.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't be the only U.S. player to take that stand. Except for
David Duval, who earned a difficult half-point in his match against
Darren Clarke, most of the early going was fairly brutal for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie, who went 4-0-1 over the three days, began the
assault with six birdies and a 5-and-4 rout of Scott Hoch. Padraig
Harrington won by the same 5-and-4 score over Mark Calcavecchia, who
had four bogeys and no birdies. When Bernhard Langer finished off Hal
Sutton, 4 and 3, the tone for the day seemed to be established.</TE>
<TE>   Hoch said he thought he was ready for Montgomerie, but
miscalculated.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as good as I've seen anybody play, especially putting,"
Hoch said.</TE>
<TE>   Toms reduced Europe's lead to 11-9 with a 1-up victory over Sergio
Garcia. The match turned when Garcia had a 2-up advantage and tried
to drive the par-four 10th hole. His ball landed in deep rough and he
wound up losing the hole to Toms, who laid up and made a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   After Duval's clutch half-point, Stewart Cink lost to Thomas
Bjorn, 2 and 1, and Europe had 12 1/2 points--two shy of clinching.
Verplank stalled that drive, but when Mickelson fell to Price, Europe
had 13 1/2 points and was only one point short.</TE>
<TE>   It would not come easily, though. Paul Azinger was 2-down to
Niclas Fasth through 13 holes and needed a near-miracle. He got it at
the 18th when he holed a bunker shot to birdie the hole and halve the
match.</TE>
<TE>   "It was lucky," Azinger said. "It went in. It was a great moment
for me. I wish it would be enough."</TE>
<TE>   Now it was 14-11 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S. to win, it needed victories in the three matches left
on the course--McGinley-Furyk, Davis Love III-Pierre Fulke and
Woods-Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the McGinley match would decide it. Furyk was
2-up after three holes and again after 12, but found himself tied
when McGinley birdied the 17th. Both players missed the 18th green
and Furyk nearly duplicated Azinger's feat from the bunker, but just
missed. McGinley chipped out of the rough, made the putt and raised
his arms in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   With 14 1/2 points, it was all over except the final accounting.
Love and Fulke decided to end their match as they stood in the 18th
fairway and Woods halved his match with Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   The 15 1/2-12 1/2 margin of victory was the biggest in 17 years,
since Europe won, 16 1/2-11 1/2, in 1985 at the Belfry.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Belfry, Sutton wryly pointed out that the setup
favored Europe's players.</TE>
<TE>   "Every golf course is set up to benefit a certain style of play,"
Sutton said. "This week, it was stay out of the rough and hit your
putts hard."</TE>
<TE>   It also helps if those putts go in, and the team that won did that
better. And that's how it goes in match play. Its unpredictable
nature is something Mickelson again chose to underscore.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can beat anybody in the world if you only play 18 holes,"
he said. "On paper, you might be favored, but that doesn't mean
anything when you play."</TE>

<HD>Civility Is Not a Casualty</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>It might not have been a good day for the U.S. team, but it clearly
was a good day for the Ryder Cup.</LD>
<LD>   After the unpleasantness at the 1999 Ryder Cup at Brookline,
Mass., civility was in vogue at the Belfry.</LD>
<LD>   As many predicted, nothing happened.</LD>
<TE>   Curtis Strange, the U.S. captain, said the atmosphere was ideal,
even if he could not say the same about the result.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think they played exceptionally well," he said. "We got
beat. That happens. And the fans were fantastic. The atmosphere was
something that we will never forget."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Westwood said the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by far the nicest Ryder Cup I've ever played in,"
Westwood said. "The players were laughing and joking with each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods credited the fans for staying in line.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this Ryder Cup was played in the fashion [it] was
originally designed," he said. "And it was just a beautiful week.
Obviously, we didn't come out on top, but it was the best thing for
golf to have it played this way.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans were [partisan] but they were fair," he said. "And they
were respectful and courteous the entire week. We are certainly
appreciative of that."</TE>
<TE>   Strange said it was something he will not forget.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate that we lost, but it was a hell of an atmosphere to be
part of."</TE>
<TE>   There was one minor exception to the rule. It involved the always
exuberant Sergio Garcia, who ran onto the 18th fairway after Paul
McGinley had made the putt to clinch the Ryder Cup for Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Davis Love III and Pierre Fulke were still playing
their match.</TE>
<TE>   Love said he and Fulke had just agreed to continue playing when
Garcia arrived and kissed Fulke, then lay down in the fairway. Love
said he and Fulke then decided they couldn't go on and agreed to
halve the match.</TE>
<TE>   "They won, it's over, it's hard not to celebrate," Love said. "But
it's just not the way to finish the match."</TE>
<TE>   Love later said it was no big deal and that he had shaken Garcia's
hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not too soon to start speculation about the next U.S. Ryder
Cup captain, who will be selected before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The early forecast centers on Paul Azinger and Hal Sutton, both
part of the 2002 Ryder Cup team and both locks to become captain at
some point.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton will be 46 and Azinger will be 44 at the 35th Ryder Cup in
2004 at Oakland Hills at Birmingham, Mich. Both played in four Ryder
Cups. Azinger was 0-1-1 this week (5-7-3 in his career) and Sutton
was 1-1 (7-5-4).</TE>
<TE>   Because Sutton is older, he is believed to have the edge.</TE>
<TE>   But Strange joked about Azinger's future with the Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's captain, he can do what he wants to," Strange said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The leading point producer for the U.S. team was David Toms, who
put up 3 1/2 points with a 3-1-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had 2 1/2 points in his five matches and was 2-2-1. In three
Ryder Cup appearances, Woods is 5-8-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Something you will never see in the U.S. (and more proof that
anything can happen in match play):</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the European team's press conference Sunday night,
all 12 players stood--led by Bernhard Langer--and toasted the
European media for its coverage and support.</TE>

<HD>Alexander Gets Rolling: Five Touchdowns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Shaun Alexander kept saying Seattle's offense was ready for a big
game, and he wasn't kidding.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander set an NFL record with five first-half touchdowns,
scoring three times within a span of 1:05, and the Seahawks beat the
Minnesota Vikings, 48-23, Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if it was adrenaline," Alexander said. "You know
when everyone's watching, your mom and dad, your friends in high
school who thought they were better than you. You get your chance to
get in the spotlight and shine."</LD>
<TE>   Alexander scored on runs of two, 20, three and 14 yards and took a
screen pass from Trent Dilfer for an 80-yard touchdown, igniting the
offense after the Seahawks (1-3) averaged 54.7 yards rushing in three
losses.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a touchdown machine," Dilfer said. "That's what we've got to
do to be successful, get the ball in his hands."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander missed a chance at the NFL record of six touchdowns in a
game, set by Ernie Nevers in 1929 and matched by Dub Jones in 1951
and Gale Sayers in 1965. He was stopped for a one-yard gain inside
the Viking five-yard line with three minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I had it in my mind," Alexander said. "I knew six was the number,
but I didn't know who it was by. We were just trying to move the ball
and end our drives in the end zone."</TE>
<TE>   After rushing for 36, 37 and 37 yards in Seattle's first three
games, Alexander eclipsed that with a 43-yard run in the first
quarter. He finished with 139 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to feel pretty good about his performance, but running
the football is more than just running," Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren.
"You've got to block, too. I think we just blocked better for him."</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Randy Moss started for the Vikings (0-4) five days after
his arrest and a night in jail. He was charged with pushing a
Minneapolis traffic officer with his car.</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't a factor, with six receptions for 50 yards, and he
dropped four passes in the end zone. The Vikings' 0-4 start is their
worst record since Bud Grant's first season in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   "The balls touched my hands. I really don't have a word," Moss
said. "The balls came off my fingertips. They bounced off my chest. I
think the more I dropped, the more I got down on myself."</TE>
<TE>   Moss was booed all night, and his frustration showed when he
exchanged gestures with Minnesota quarterback Daunte Culpepper after
the Vikings couldn't score on one series in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper, who had a career-high four interceptions against
Carolina last week, was 29 for 53 for 273 yards with two
interceptions.</TE>

<HD>Some Good Things Came From the XFL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tommy Maddox, fittingly enough, signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers
to be an insurance policy if something happened to Kordell Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   Something happened Sunday and, because the Steelers had the
insurance salesman-turned-backup quarterback around, they rallied to
beat Cleveland, 16-13, and avoid a possibly disastrous 0-3 start.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox, the Broncos' first-round draft choice in 1992, left
football to run his Dallas insurance agencies from 1997-99, only to
revive his career in the XFL. He was the MVP of the L.A. Xtreme in
the one and only XFL season.</LD>
<TE>   Maddox then signed with Pittsburgh, but didn't play a meaningful
down all last season as Stewart was the Steelers' MVP during a 13-3
season.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Steelers down 13-6 late in the fourth quarter Sunday,
Coach Bill Cowher turned to Maddox because he runs the no-huddle
spread offense better than Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the offense I've grown up in," Maddox said. "In the XFL, we
had four and five receivers all the time. It spreads the field out
and it gets the defense out of what they want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Maddox needed two minutes to drive the Steelers 77 yards for the
tying touchdown. In overtime, Maddox led another scoring drive that
ended with Todd Peterson's decisive 31-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   What a comeback--but, perhaps one not good enough for Maddox to
replace Stewart as the starter in New Orleans on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm leaning toward starting Kordell," Cowher said. "If we need a
lift, I will go to Tommy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Sherman wants his Green Bay Packers to play with more
passion.</TE>
<TE>   So the usually reserved Sherman showed some fire of his own in a
17-14 win over Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:50 left in the first half and the Packers looking
lethargic, tight end Bubba Franks took a lateral from quarterback
Brett Favre and appeared to throw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Donald
Driver that put Green Bay up, 10-7.</TE>
<TE>   But official Ben Montgomery ruled the play included two forward
passes and denied the touchdown. Sherman went ballistic.</TE>
<TE>   After Sherman threw his headset, waved his arms and drew an
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, the call was reviewed and reversed,
and the touchdown stood.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the guys rallied behind [Sherman] when he did that,"
Favre said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sherman said he was wrong to lose his cool in a key situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I should not have lost my discipline, but I probably would do it
again," he said. "I didn't want the game to go on without that play
being reviewed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Ram quarterback Kurt Warner will be evaluated today to determine
whether he needs surgery on the little finger of his passing hand.
The Rams also lost cornerback Aeneas Williams to an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   * Jet quarterback Vinny Testaverde bruised his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   * The Bears lost linebacker Warrick Holdman, who sprained his
right knee.</TE>
<TE>   * The Saints had to finish their game against the Lions without
receivers Joe Horn (knee) and Donte Stallworth (hamstring).</TE>

<HD>Europe Getting Its Game On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new season in Europe is only a few weeks old, but already there
are promising signs that the 2002-03 campaign will be one to
remember.</LD>
<LD>   Competitive, compelling and controversial. That's the norm when it
comes to the scramble for honors in England, France, Germany, Italy
and Spain--the five major European leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Throw into the mix the only slightly less captivating races in,
say, the Netherlands, Portugal or Turkey, and it's easy to understand
the grip that European soccer has on fans worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   Only a few days ago, in fact, Arsene Wenger, the French coach who
last season masterminded Arsenal's English league and cup double,
said that the time would come when European teams would play some of
their competitive matches in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "I could imagine some day Arsenal playing Real Madrid in Shanghai,
for example," Wenger said in London. "Why not?</TE>
<TE>   "You could imagine that a European league could play not only in
Europe ... the television companies in the Far East want to see the
best in Europe and the market is huge.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest in the English game is also huge. The Premier League
is the best-sold championship [on television] in the Far East.
Playing over there would be a way of generating income."</TE>
<TE>   And if Asia, why not America?</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the top European clubs is growing in the United
States, as evidenced by television coverage on Fox Sports World and
ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   The latter network offers enticing tidbits of the Champions
League, in which 32 teams from 14 countries are involved in the cut
and thrust that eventually will result in two of their number
reaching the final in May.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about ESPN2's coverage of selected games is the
commentary of Mike Hill, far and away the best soccer play-by-play
announcer in the U.S. The most frustrating aspect of the coverage is
the promotion of Champions League games on ESPN International that
are not shown in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "And next, for our international audience only ... " might be the
most despised phrase on the network.</TE>
<TE>   But back to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the domestic leagues and the Champions League, 64
clubs are seeking to win the UEFA Cup, the lesser of Europe's two
continent-wide club competitions.</TE>
<TE>   And when the world's top players are not engaged in domestic or
Europe-wide competition, many are involved in their national teams'
efforts to qualify for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   It all makes for a hectic schedule, during which club loyalties
and nationalistic fervor, mudslinging and mind games, injuries and
intrigue, all serve to keep the pot forever boiling.</TE>
<TE>   Italian fans, for instance, have been encouraged by the strong
start made in the Champions League by AC Milan and Juventus, last
season's Serie A champion.</TE>
<TE>   "With them, the hope of a turning point that leads us out of years
of setbacks, fear and miserable and depressing football is becoming
stronger every minute," Gazzetta dello Sport noted last week after
both teams recorded impressive victories.</TE>
<TE>   Juventus Coach Marcello Lippi, meanwhile, told Corriere dello
Sport, "The process of growth that should bring Juventus to the upper
echelons in Europe is continuing very well."</TE>
<TE>   But it is a steep climb. Bayer Leverkusen Coach Klaus Toppmoeller
described it well when he said, "The Champions League is another
dimension."</TE>
<TE>   In England, the teams leading the upward hike are Arsenal and
Manchester United, despite the personal duel between Wenger and
United Coach Ron Ferguson to see who can complain the loudest and the
most often about allegedly short-sighted referees, perceived league
injustices and the supposedly ugly tactics resorted to by opponents.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it's a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson uttered his most humble comment in some time after an
unexpected loss to Bolton Wanderers when he said: "We have no divine
right to think that, just because we are Manchester United, we can
just walk over teams."</TE>
<TE>   Not in England. Not in Europe, either.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Major League Soccer, where a .500 record is good enough to
make the playoffs, success in Europe's top leagues depends on almost
never losing.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to Manchester midfielder David Beckham after United had
been upset by Bolton: "You can only afford to lose four or five [of
38 Premier League] games in a season, and this is our first loss," he
said. "We can't afford to go through the league losing and drawing
games. We've got to win."</TE>
<TE>   It's the same story elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, fans want to see just how reigning European champion
Real Madrid copes with the temperamental Ronaldo, a $46.3-million buy
from Inter Milan who, because of injury, has yet to play one minute
for Coach Vicente del Bosque.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid has scored 27 goals in seven games in four
competitions this season and teammates have warned the Brazilian
World Cup winner not to expect to waltz into the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Real Madrid is playing very well at the moment and it's going to
be difficult for him to find a way in," midfielder Ivan Helguera
said. "It's not easy for anyone to play here. Tell me, who are you
going to drop to create an opening?"</TE>
<TE>   Spanish champion Valencia and Barcelona, Real Madrid's keenest
rival, are only two of many clubs intent on humbling Ronaldo and
company.</TE>
<TE>   In France, meanwhile, the disappointment of the 2002 World Cup
failure has descended like a wet blanket on the league, which has yet
to produce any fireworks this season.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, there also appears to be a post-World Cup fog
hovering. The only club showing any sign of Bundesliga domination is
Bayern Munich, but Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's team has stumbled twice in
the Champions League and plays host to AC Milan on Tuesday, knowing
that a victory is almost imperative.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen was last year's darling--or at least its
bridesmaid--reaching the Champions League final, the German Cup final
and finishing runner-up to Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga. But
times have changed and Leverkusen is foundering.</TE>
<TE>   "To keep talking about last season is just stupid," midfielder
Bernd Schneider snapped last week. "It's not going to help us now."</TE>
<TE>   A more upbeat note was sounded by teammate Jens Nowotny, who told
Kicker magazine, "Real may have the best side of all time, but they
can be beaten."</TE>
<TE>   The question in Europe this season is: When, and by whom?</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy's younger and deeper midfield was supposed to give it the
edge over the Kansas City Wizards in Major League Soccer's playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   It hasn't happened yet and, as a result, the Galaxy is staring at
elimination.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas City's midfielders, led by 39-year-old Preki, have toyed
with their Los Angeles counterparts in the quarterfinal series, as
evidenced by Saturday night's 4-1 Wizard rout, which evened the
series at three points each and set up a deciding Game 3 Wednesday
night at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "We felt overwhelmed everywhere," said Peter Vagenas, who returned
to the Galaxy lineup after sitting out two games because of a
strained right hamstring. L.A. tied a team record for most goals
allowed in a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out with good energy," Vagenas said. "They came out
with good pressure. They took a chance by throwing a lot of people
forward. Either they were going to get the result they got, or we'd
sneak behind them and get a goal. That's the chance they had to take,
and it obviously paid off for them."</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid was so stunned by Kansas City's success
at midfield that he took out veteran playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos at
the half and replaced him with forward Chris Albright. Midfielder
Simon Elliott acknowledged that his unit was overrun by eighth-seeded
Kansas City and said it had better wake up.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't doing much different from what they did in the first
game," Elliott said. "We just were playing badly. We weren't
communicating. We weren't working. We weren't helping each other."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott said the top-seeded Galaxy's lackadaisical play was
disappointing, especially considering that it had played sluggishly
in Game 1 but escaped with a 3-2 overtime win.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what's so good about this team is that within the ebb and
flow of the game, we can make little adjustments to help us out,"
Elliott said. "We haven't done that in this series at all. Kansas
City has been better than us technically."</TE>
<TE>   Said Vagenas: "But then again, this is why we play the whole
season, to get the deciding game at home. We've been a great team
when it comes to one game that decides the whole series, so hopefully
we can continue that."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy is 4-1-0 all-time in the final game of a three-game
series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Women Prevail</TE>
<TE>   Two goals by Mia Hamm and one apiece by Brandi Chastain, Cindy
Parlow and Aly Wagner earned the United States women's national team
a 5-1 victory over Russia at Uniondale, N.Y., Sunday in the opening
game of the four-nation U.S. Women's Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Natalia Barbachina scored on a penalty kick for Russia in the 84th
minute to deny goalkeeper Briana Scurry a shutout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany Spurns Event</TE>
<TE>   Coach Rudi Voeller said it is unlikely that World Cup runner-up
Germany will take part in the FIFA Confederations Cup in France next
summer because the eight-nation tournament from June 18-29 does not
fit into Germany's calendar.</TE>
<TE>   "I am also against the prospect of sending a reserve team that
would fare poorly, as in 1999," Voeller said in an interview with the
German newspaper Bild.</TE>
<TE>   Germany lost to Brazil and the United States three years ago when
Mexico was host of the tournament. The 2003 Confederations Cup will
feature world champion Brazil and continental champions Cameroon,
Colombia, France, Japan, New Zealand and the U.S., plus one invited
team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Africa Wins Cup</TE>
<TE>   An 89th-minute goal by Benedict Vilakazi gave South Africa a 1-0
victory over Malawi in Durban, South Africa, and a 4-1 aggregate
victory in the two-match Castle Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really fantastic to finally win this trophy and to do it
with home-based players," said South Africa Coach Ephraim Mashaba,
whose team had only two World Cup players.</TE>

<HD>Maddox Sparks Win</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Todd Peterson and Tommy Maddox got second chances in a wild,
unpredictable overtime, and the Cleveland Browns wound up with a
second bizarre loss in a month.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox replaced Kordell Stewart to lead a tying touchdown drive
late in the fourth quarter, then drove Pittsburgh to Peterson's
winning 31-yard field goal and a 16-13 victory Sunday that may have
saved the Steeler season.</LD>
<LD>   The Browns led, 13-6, late in the fourth quarter, then intercepted
a Maddox pass, blocked a Peterson field goal and had a chance to win
it on a Phil Dawson field goal in overtime--and still lost.</LD>
<TE>   The Steelers (1-2) were within a couple of minutes of being 0-3
when Maddox came in to complete 11 of 13 passes for 122 yards on two
scoring drives.</TE>
<TE>   "This was huge for us," linebacker Joey Porter said of the
Steelers, widely regarded as the AFC's preseason favorite. "Maybe we
play better when we're underdogs, because everybody was writing us
off when we were 0-2."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's winner with 7:46 remaining in overtime came one play
after Alvin McKinley blocked his 24-yard attempt. But because it was
only second down and Pittsburgh's John Fiala fell on the bouncing
ball, the Steelers retained possession. Peterson redeemed himself on
the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Cowher asked if I wanted him to run a play so I could get
my bearings back," Peterson said. "I said, no, it's a 31-yarder, I
can make that, so let's kick it and go home."</TE>
<TE>   For Cleveland (2-2), the loss wasn't as devastating as its 40-39
loss to Kansas City in their opener, when Dwayne Rudd's helmet toss
allowed the Chiefs to kick a game-winning field goal. But this also
was a game the Browns seemingly had won.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard. It's tough to come here and lose the way we did," said
Jamel White, who ran for 105 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "But anything can happen in overtime. We pulled out a game at
Tennessee last week in overtime, and it was there for us to win
again."</TE>

<HD>Tomlinson Handles Rush Job for Chargers</HD>
<DH>Football: Running back ties a club single-game record with
217 yards and San Diego beats New England, 21-14.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Asked about the magic of LaDainian Tomlinson, who tied a San Diego
Charger record Sunday with 217 yards rushing, teammate Marcellus
Wiley offered a simple explanation:</LD>
<LD>   "He stood in God's ability line and got an overdose of it."</LD>
<LD>   Who are the New England Patriots to argue? A week after
surrendering 180 yards to Kansas City's Priest Holmes, the Super Bowl
champions were flambeed by Tomlinson, who had touchdown runs of 37
and 58 yards to lift the Chargers to a 21-14 victory in front of a
delirious packed house at Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no doubt in my mind their plan was to stop the run," said
Tomlinson, who matched the club's single-game rushing mark set by
Gary Anderson in 1988. "I thought it was going to be a hard day
running the football because of what Priest did against them last
week, but we had a lot of things working for us."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the Chargers (4-0) end New England's winning streak
at 12, but they kept their own record unblemished, joining Oakland
and Denver as the league's only unbeaten teams. Even better, this
victory is a resounding rebuttal to those who thought San Diego
couldn't beat a good team. The Chargers opened the season by knocking
off Cincinnati, Houston and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us credibility and respect throughout the league,"
cornerback Alex Molden said. "People were talking about our schedule
and how soft it was, but a 'W' is a 'W.' Other teams have great
players, but we find a way to win."</TE>
<TE>   Molden secured Sunday's victory when he recovered a fumble at the
New England 45 with 17 seconds to play, ending the Patriots'
last-gasp possession. It was pandemonium on the San Diego sideline,
where players howled, hugged and even bowled over teammates. Wiley
jerked his neck around like a bobblehead doll, then gleefully pounced
on top of fellow defensive end Raylee Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was going to shake my hand or whatever, but then I
thought, 'You know what, he's gaining speed,' " Johnson said. "Before
I started to brace myself, I was on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego defenders didn't have any such luck with Patriot
quarterback Tom Brady, who completed 36 of 53 passes for 353 yards
and wasn't sacked. In fact, the Chargers barely touched him.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach said to be patient and poised this week, and he said that
because he knew we were going to get frustrated if we were out there
doing well as pass rushers and we weren't getting to him," Wiley
said. "One time, we were lined up over the center--you can't get
there any quicker--and he snapped the ball, the center didn't block,
and already the ball was gone."</TE>
<TE>   But Brady also made some tide-turning mistakes. He had two passes
intercepted in the third quarter, after the Patriots had moved deep
into San Diego territory. Cornerback Ryan McNeil picked off one, and
the other was grabbed by linebacker Donnie Edwards, who gave the
Chargers great field position with a 46-yard return.</TE>
<TE>   But San Diego's offense was unable to build on the 21-14 lead it
established on the second play of the third quarter, when Tomlinson
turned a simple cutback into a 58-yard touchdown. It was up to the
defense to preserve that edge for the remainder of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers made two big defensive plays in the fourth quarter,
both at their 39-yard line. The first came early in the period, when
fullback Marc Edwards was stuffed for no gain on fourth and one. The
second came with 5:21 to play, when Junior Seau tackled running back
Antowain Smith for a two-yard loss on third and 10. The Patriots
punted, and when they finally got the ball back, never got past the
50.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help New England that top receiver Troy Brown was
sidelined because of a knee injury. His backup, Deion Branch, picked
up the slack with 13 catches for 128 yards. Tight end Christian
Fauria caught a touchdown pass, as did linebacker Mike Vrabel, who
lined up at tight end for a play.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, New England, which was averaging 38.3 points this
season, was held to 14 by the league's No. 1 defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're all a little shell-shocked right now," Brady said.
"I don't think any of us anticipated this. Not because they're not a
good team, and not because they didn't go out and beat us. But I
think in a lot of respects we beat ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   But the beat resonating throughout the stadium Sunday was the
chant of "LT, LT, LT," a tribute to Tomlinson, who is making the life
of first-year starting quarterback Drew Brees, well, a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "That kid's the real deal," center Jason Ball said of Tomlinson,
selected No. 5 overall in the 2001 draft. "He's making us look good.
It's a real treat to block for a guy like LaDainian. Once you get him
through that front seven, it could be end of story."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Bruins' Route Is All Laid Out</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can't you just see the exasperated USC fans in v-neck sweaters
rolling their eyes and turning up their noses?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe this time the public school riff-raff will follow our simple
instructions.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time in three weeks, USC has created a detailed
road map on how to reach Victory Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA needs to let the Trojans guide the way.</TE>
<TE>   USC halted Oregon State's four-game winning streak, 22-0,
Saturday. UCLA will visit Oregon State this weekend in the Bruins'
Pacific 10 Conference opener.</TE>
<TE>   A careful study of the game film should tell UCLA coaches all they
need to know about preparing for the Beavers. Oregon State managed 80
yards passing and 51 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins can't let misplaced pride get in the way of becoming
copycats.</TE>
<TE>   That lesson was learned Sept. 21 against Colorado. USC had
trampled the Buffaloes, 40-3, a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   But like a stubborn driver on a family vacation, UCLA forged its
own way, only to get lost--and lose, 31-17.</TE>
<TE>   USC fans couldn't gloat because their team fell to Kansas State
the same day. This time, however, a wrong turn could land UCLA in
Humiliation Alley.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be ready for Oregon State, I know that much," Bruin
receiver Craig Bragg said. "Now the real games start. The conference
is what we've been pointing toward."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (3-1) negotiated a fairly rigorous nonconference
schedule in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   Tackle Mike Saffer (rib) is the only seriously injured starter,
although defensive tackle Rodney Leisle (foot) must be watched
carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches have thrown more than a dozen freshmen into the fire and
four are starting--center Mike McCloskey, linebacker Spencer Havner,
safety Jarrad Page and tackle Ed Blanton, who is spelling Saffer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased with how our young players have responded,"
Coach Bob Toledo said. "This is an interesting football team. There
aren't any superstars, just a lot of guys who contribute."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus has put together three strong performances
in a row. Manuel White is developing into a powerful running back.
Bragg and tight end Mike Seidman are becoming big-play threats.</TE>
<TE>   Middle linebacker Marcus Reese is a solid presence and the
linebackers flanking him--Havner and Brandon Chillar--are constantly
around the ball. The secondary is occasionally leaky but did an
excellent job in the 43-7 victory over San Diego State on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Pressuring the quarterback remains a problem. End Dave Ball puts
on the best rush among the linemen, but otherwise it has taken
blitzes by Havner, Chillar or Matt Ware to crank up the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Bruins should be ready for conference play.</TE>
<TE>   As long as they use USC as Rand McNally.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, following the Trojan lead on anything is distasteful to
any self-respecting Bruin.</TE>
<TE>   The only similarity between USC and UCLA is that the quarterbacks
of both teams go by the initials C.P.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA might feel more comfortable breaking out its own road map, a
38-7 victory at Oregon State last season. The performance turned the
Pac-10 upside down for a stretch, vaulting the Bruins up the rankings
and causing the highly rated Beavers to fall off the map.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA players and coaches have mentioned that Oregon State will be
motivated by vengeance. Now, thanks to USC, the Beavers have another
score to settle.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Colorado did after getting embarrassed by the Trojans.
Made adjustments. Dug deep. Came out snarling.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers undoubtedly will do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dennis Erickson doesn't spend all his time keeping marginal
student-athletes eligible. Good teams bounce back.</TE>

<KH>USC REWIND</KH>
<HD>Defensive Line Draws a Strong Comparison</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, USC unveiled a statue outside Heritage Hall
depicting the Wild Bunch, the 1969 defensive line that many consider
the best in school history.</LD>
<LD>   If the Trojans' current defensive linemen continue to play the way
they did Saturday in a 22-0 victory over Oregon State, the school
might someday build a statue in their honor.</LD>
<LD>   The aggressive play of ends Omar Nazel and Kenechi Udeze and
tackles Mike Patterson and Shaun Cody was rock solid at every level.
They combined for seven tackles for loss, including four sacks; two
pass deflections; a forced fumble and two recovered fumbles; and
helped limit Oregon State to 51 yards rushing in a surprisingly
one-sided Pacific 10 opener.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, middle linebacker Mike Pollard's remark a few weeks ago
that USC has "the best D-line in the country" doesn't sound so
outlandish.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State was averaging a Pac-10-leading 499.75 yards and 47.5
points per game but was limited to 131 yards and eight first downs.
The Beavers didn't play much of a schedule before going belly-up at
the Coliseum, but the previous week they laid a 59-19 pounding on a
Fresno State team that lost on a late field goal to Wisconsin, which
is 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   "The [defensive] front made it an easy game for us," said USC
Coach Pete Carroll, who called the line's performance its best since
a 27-0 victory over UCLA on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Orgeron, USC's defensive line coach, said the key Saturday was
putting pressure on Oregon State quarterback Derek Anderson, who was
battered and sore after the game. "When they couldn't run, we could
tee off on the passer," Orgeron said. "They were double-teaming Cody,
so other guys had one-on-one blocks and took over the game."</TE>
<TE>   Free safety DeShaun Hill agreed, saying the Trojans noticed from
watching film that Anderson had all day to throw in runaway victories
over Eastern Kentucky, Temple, Nevada Las Vegas and Fresno State. "He
had a lot of time back there to pick [those teams] apart," Hill said.
"Our defensive line was getting in there. That was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Udeze, a sophomore from Los Angeles Verbum Dei High, said he was
oblivious to the gaudy numbers Oregon State had put up before playing
USC. "I didn't even know they average so many points," he said. "We
just went out and gave it our all. We're pretty happy with the
turnout."</TE>
<TE>   With Udeze and Nazel swooping in from the outside, and Patterson,
Cody and reserve tackle Bernard Riley burrowing through the middle,
the Trojans seemingly had all the angles covered against a dammed-up
Beaver offense.</TE>
<TE>   "You never really know, but honestly we started feeling at
halftime, 'We can really get these guys,' " Udeze said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the trick is maintaining that effort through the rest of USC's
Pac-10 schedule. Udeze doesn't think that will be a problem. The No.
18-ranked Trojans play at No. 17 Washington State Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the defensive line's success, Udeze said: "We have a
real good nucleus. We're always together. We always go 100% at
practice. We all have the same goal in mind--to be the best."</TE>
<TE>   Call them the Riled Bunch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With USC's offense slow to get going Saturday, the Trojans turned
to kicker Ryan Killeen for their early points. He didn't disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game kicking field goals for USC, Killeen made 43-
and 42-yarders on his first two attempts in the second quarter for a
6-0 lead and added a 32-yarder in the fourth quarter. A 40-yard
attempt in the second quarter bounced off the crossbar after being
partially blocked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best feeling in the world," Killeen said of his first
field goal. "I was excited, and it built my confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Killeen, a sophomore, was recruited out of Mount San Antonio
College for kickoffs. But after David Davis struggled to make field
goals and extra points, Killeen took his spot. Killeen realizes the
job security of any kicker is tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling confident, but the saying here is, 'Special teams
[are] etched in sand,' " he said. "Anything can change on any day. I
just have to keep getting the job done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser, who wore a specially
designed piece of hard plastic to protect a dislocated rib in the
Cougars' 48-38 victory over California on Saturday, will be ready to
play against USC, Coach Mike Price said. "He felt OK," Price said.
"He's not any worse off." Gesser was injured the previous week
against Montana State. He showed no ill effects against Cal, passing
for 431 yards and four touchdowns.... Quarterback Carson Palmer had
229 yards of total offense to move past Rodney Peete and become USC's
career leader with 8,725 yards.... Hill, the Trojans' starting free
safety, is scheduled to have an MRI exam today on the shoulder he
injured against Oregon State, Carroll said.... Left tackle Jacob
Rogers suffered a mild right knee sprain and is probable for the
Washington State game, Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>Angels Close Out Season in Style</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Glaus' grand slam paces 7-6 victory over
Mariners, Anaheim's 99th win of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he finished dressing in the Angel clubhouse at Edison Field on
Sunday, outfielder Tim Salmon turned around to find himself encircled
by media personnel, waiting to ask their questions.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow, what an audience," he said.</LD>
<LD>   If Salmon thinks that is an audience, wait until he gets to Yankee
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels concluded the most successful regular season in their
history Sunday by beating the Seattle Mariners, 7-6, for their 99th
win, seven more than their previous high.</TE>
<TE>   When Brendan Donnelly struck out Mike Cameron for the final out,
the sellout crowd of 42,878 was on its feet, a sea of red waving its
rally sticks in support. When the Angel buses pulled out a little
over an hour later for New York, where the Angels begin a
best-of-five division playoff series against the Yankees on Tuesday,
the fans were lined up, an estimated 5,000 strong, to cheer their
departure.</TE>
<TE>   But Angel Manager Mike Scioscia knows those cheers would last only
as long as it takes the Angels' charter flight to get down the runway
at Long Beach Airport. Scioscia has been to New York for the
postseason as a Dodger catcher, in 1981, when his team beat the
Yankees in the World Series, and in 1988, when the Dodgers beat the
New York Mets to reach the Series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's electric when you play in Yankee Stadium," Scioscia said,
"but especially in the postseason. But once you get on the field, you
realize the ball is still round, the bases are still 90 feet apart
just like they are anyplace else and you get down to playing
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   But, Scioscia conceded, overcoming the mystique of the historic
stadium can be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "There is mystique in Yankee Stadium on a winter day in December
when the place is empty," he said. "It's an incredible place to play.
It's the center of the baseball world."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has ever referred to Edison Field that way. But it was
certainly the center of Angel euphoria Sunday. Especially euphoric
were the following Angels:</TE>
<TE>   * Aaron Sele. The right-hander hadn't been on the mound since
tearing the rotator cuff in his pitching arm Aug. 20. Scioscia had
planned on using Sele for no more than 60 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Those 60 pitches took Sele into the fourth inning. In 4 1/3
innings, he gave up two runs and three hits, impressing Scioscia
enough to at least consider activating Sele for the second round of
the playoffs, should the Angels get that far. Sele did not make the
roster for the Yankee series.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a crisp fastball with a lot of late movement on it,"
Scioscia said, "and a good curve. I was encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   * Troy Glaus. The Angel third baseman had the key hit of the game,
a first-inning grand slam off Seattle starter and loser Ismael
Valdes, the former Dodger and Angel who finished the season 8-12. It
was the second grand slam of Glaus' career and the team's fifth this
season. It was Glaus' 30th home run, marking the third straight
season he has hit at least that many. Salmon is the only other Angel
to have accomplished that feat. Glaus also finished with a
career-high 111 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   * Adam Kennedy and David Eckstein. Although Kennedy was hitless in
two at-bats Sunday, the second baseman ended up with a .312 average,
breaking the club record for second baseman set by Johnny Ray, who
hit .306 in 1988. Eckstein went one for three Sunday, giving him a
.293 average to tie Rick Burleson (1981) for the highest average by
an Angel shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   * Mark Lukasiewicz and Donnelly. Lukasiewicz was the winning
pitcher and Donnelly got his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn had some impressive numbers as
well this season, finishing 18-6. But by the time Sunday's game had
ended, he had already turned the page. He will face Roger Clemens on
Tuesday night in Game 1 of the division series.</TE>
<TE>   "That," Washburn said, "will be bigger than any game I have ever
played."</TE>

<HD>Dodger Forecast: Mostly Cloudy</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After winning 92 games they face a turbulent
off-season, made more so by Karros' impending surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA and JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An already complicated off-season for the Dodgers grew more
problematic Sunday with the revelation that first baseman Eric Karros
has been suffering from a shoulder injury and plans to undergo
surgery as early as Friday, reducing from slim to none any chance the
team had of trading him this winter.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI test last season revealed a torn labrum in Karros' left
(non-throwing) shoulder, and the 11-year veteran will have another
MRI exam to determine the extent of the damage, agent Jeff Moorad
said Sunday. Angel medical director Lewis Yocum is expected to
perform the surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger medical personnel believe the 34-year-old Karros, who
played with a torn lower-back muscle in 2001, should be ready for
spring training.</LD>
<TE>   "We won't really know what we're looking at until we get the MRI,"
Karros said.</TE>
<TE>   Karros sat out Sunday's season-ending 2-0 loss to the San Diego
Padres at Dodger Stadium, as the club finished 92-70 and failed to
qualify for the playoffs for the sixth straight season. He played
well defensively but hit .271 with a career-low 13 homers and had 73
runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric is the last person to use an injury as an excuse, and he
won't, but he was not able to pull through the strike zone because of
his shoulder," Moorad said. "As a result, most of his power was
gone."</TE>
<TE>   Karros made $6.5 million this season and will make $8 million in
2003. The club holds a $9-million option for 2004, which vests if
Karros has 500 plate appearances next season.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm thinking about now is looking forward to getting it
fixed," Karros said. "I wouldn't say I'm scared, I just want to get
it taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   His surgery further clouds the off-season for the Dodgers, whose
bloated payroll and inflexible roster will make it difficult for
General Manager Dan Evans to add the necessary ingredients--another
big bat is the team's most pressing need--to push the Dodgers from
the cusp of the playoffs over that October threshold.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have $95 million in salary committed to 12 players for
2003, and pitcher Odalis Perez and third baseman Adrian Beltre are
expected to receive significant raises in arbitration. The Dodgers
would like to keep their payroll around its current $105-million
range.</TE>
<TE>   With $26 million wrapped up in injury-plagued pitchers Kevin Brown
and Darren Dreifort, it will be difficult to add the rotation
insurance that Omar Daal, who is expected to leave as a free agent,
provided this season.</TE>
<TE>   And with $13.5 million guaranteed to second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek, whose high price tag and limited power make him
difficult to trade, and Karros, it will be tough to find the roster
and payroll space to pursue premier free agents such as Jeff Kent and
Jim Thome.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have as many moves to make this winter, but we
don't have as much flexibility to make them," Evans said. "In order
to do some things, we have to figure out a way to create a position."</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Shawn Green, who hit .285 with 42 homers and 114
RBIs, thinks the Dodger bullpen is as good as any in baseball and the
rotation, when healthy, is solid.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think we need to add a little offense," he said. "There
are some good hitters out there. Obviously, this is a difficult
economic situation. It's a matter of what the organization is willing
to do."</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers can't add a bat, they may need to add some
creativity.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to change our offensive approach, because we're the most
nonaggressive team I've seen in my life, as far as hit-and-runs,
making things happen," left fielder Brian Jordan said. "We're not the
kind of team that can sit back and wait for home runs, so we've got
to be more aggressive. That's something we should have learned this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Dodgers' most glaring questions last spring--Who will
be the closer? Who will bat leadoff? Will Green thrive without Gary
Sheffield in the lineup?--were answered with exclamation points by
Eric Gagne (52 saves), Dave Roberts (.277, 45 stolen bases) and
Green's productive season.</TE>
<TE>   But there are more questions this off-season: What will become of
Jordan, who will undergo major knee surgery Tuesday? Will Marquis
Grissom or Daal be back? Will Brown and Dreifort return to form?</TE>
<TE>   After struggling with his trade from Atlanta and dealing with
numerous injuries, Jordan went on a tear in September, hitting .347
with five home runs and 30 RBIs to boost his season totals to a
respectable .285, 18 homers and 80 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan provided vocal, veteran leadership, was an integral part of
the team's improved chemistry, and likes the direction the Dodgers
seem headed.</TE>
<TE>   But Jordan wasn't a big fan of Los Angeles, and as a player traded
during a multiyear deal, he can demand a trade after the World
Series. If Jordan makes the request and a deal is not made by next
March 15, Jordan can rescind his trade demand or become a free agent,
voiding the final year of his five-year, $40-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to explore my options," Jordan said. "I don't want to
play all the way out here just for one year. I'd rather be closer to
my family [in Atlanta]. I hope to be with a contender on the East
Coast. But I definitely haven't ruled out coming back here."</TE>
<TE>   What if the Dodgers guaranteed Jordan's $10.5-million option for
2004?</TE>
<TE>   "That wouldn't be enough," Jordan said. "I'm just being honest."</TE>
<TE>   What if the Dodgers added two or three more years to his contract?</TE>
<TE>   "That's different," Jordan, 35, said. "That's security, and that
would make it easier on my family."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom also could determine Jordan's fate. Grissom was among the
most valuable Dodgers, hitting .277 with 17 homers and 60 RBIs while
platooning with Roberts in center and spelling Jordan in left. Like
Jordan, Grissom is one of the most respected and well-liked veterans
in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But Grissom, 35, wants to be an everyday player, and with Green
and Roberts returning and Jordan likely back, the Dodgers can't
guarantee him a starting job.</TE>
<TE>   There are risks for Jordan if he asks for a trade; he could be
traded to Milwaukee or Kansas City. And with an uncertain free-agent
market in the wake of the new labor agreement and Jordan coming off
surgery to remove part of his patellar tendon, it's doubtful he'd
receive an offer as good as his current deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger coaching staff--Jim Riggleman (bench), Jim Colborn
(pitching), Jack Clark (hitting), Glenn Hoffman (third base), John
Shelby (first base) and Jim Lett (bullpen)--was invited back for the
2003 season.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Off-Season Wasn't Business as Usual</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank heavens, the preseason.</LD>
<LD>   You'd like to think not much can go wrong in an off-season but
this long summer took Chick Hearn and Bison Dele. Dele actually left
the game a while ago and he was only intermittently interested when
he was playing but there was a nice, fun guy under that tormented
hot-dog exterior.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn was a giant, a partner with Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in
the Laker Trinity of the '60s that established the new team here.
Chick was the Laker face and voice ever since and they will never be
quite the same without him.</LD>
<TE>   Then there were the usual garden-variety embarrassments, with so
many of the guys getting involved with local law enforcement.
Shaquille O'Neal, the noted police enthusiast, was allowed to ride
along with sheriff's deputies on a drug raid in East Baton Rouge,
La., and accused by two men arrested of forcing one man's head into a
toilet, but cleared of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the players who were arrested, themselves.
Commissioner David Stern was like a dad who gets a call in the middle
of the night, telling him to come down and bail out one of his sons,
which he does, only to return home to find the phone ringing again.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the NBA's stirring appearance in the World
Championships when we finally got the answer to the old question: How
long will it take the world to catch up to us?</TE>
<TE>   The answer: 10 years, from the 1992 debut of NBA players in the
Olympics until this summer when we managed to lose games to
Argentina, Yugoslavia and Spain. Now the question is, can we catch up
to South America by 2002 so we can get one of the three spots in the
qualifying tournament we'll have to participate in to play in the
2004 Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   Taking them, one embarrassment at a time ...</TE>
<TE>   The World Championships--Representing the U.S. once looked like a
win-win situation for the NBA, a publicity bonanza with no downside,
but give our guys credit. They found one.</TE>
<TE>   The '92 Dream Team overwhelmed and charmed everyone at Barcelona
but two years later, the NBA's Young Guns taunted opponents and
embarrassed themselves at the World Championships in Toronto so that
several (Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp, Derrick Coleman) were quietly
retired from international participation.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, when the U.S. Olympians survived close calls against
Lithuania and France and were called "whiners" by the host
Australians, it had become lose-lose. If the Americans won, everyone
yawned. It could only be news if they lost.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Indianapolis in 2002, News Central.</TE>
<TE>   First, Coach George Karl, attuned as ever to signs of disrespect,
said the players were upset no one was paying any attention to them.
Then they lost to Argentina, whereupon Reggie Miller told them they
had to play for each other, since everyone (refs, fans, etc.) was
against them. Then they lost to Yugoslavia and stopped saying
anything, before quitting dead and losing to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The country sneered, if it noticed at all. Sports Illustrated's
Steve Rushin said he felt neither "anger nor disgust nor
embarrassment but delight."</TE>
<TE>   Post-mortems pointed to the absence of O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Tracy McGrady, or bad fundamentals, or the lack of a standing
national team, but it's simpler than that: There were too many
self-styled stars, not enough role players, they lacked leaders, they
didn't respect their opponents, didn't play hard until they felt
threatened and didn't get along.</TE>
<TE>   Karl, charged with making them a team, went all sociological ("Is
the money and greed of the NBA having an effect of our competitive
nature? Yeah."), dodging his contribution, which was to get tighter
and tighter, as usual.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, while he was coaching the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA
Finals, one of his players, Frank Brickowski, said his voice was so
high, only dogs could hear him.</TE>
<TE>   Stern insists there's no embarrassment, since the teams that beat
the Americans did it with NBA players.</TE>
<TE>   R-i-g-h-t.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, there was no sense of urgency," said Magic Johnson, who
drove the Dream Team to glory, despite token opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has caught up a little bit but not to where they are
going to beat us in the Olympics if the guys play who are supposed to
play. And if we play the right style of ball and we have to respect
those guys [opponents]."</TE>
<TE>   This is how bad it was: Paul Pierce, thought to embody everything
right about young players, turned prima donna, pouting when he didn't
get the ball, complaining to point guard Andre Miller on the bench
for not giving it to him. To the delight of the rest of the team,
Miller snarled back.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine what was going on behind the scenes by the time
they lost their third game in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, from now on you can't say there won't be any
suspense in these tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that, it was pretty much business as usual:</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson--The latest crisis in his bumper-car-ride of a life
began in an argument with his wife, whom he was alleged to have
thrown out of their house nude. Then he was charged with forcing his
way into a cousin's apartment, looking for her, (Iverson has set up
several friends and relatives from Virginia in houses and apartments
in Philadelphia), carrying a gun.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was accorded Crime of the Century status in
Philadelphia (TV vans camped outside his estate, TV choppers flying
over, etc.) but the cousin refused to testify and the case was
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Boy, I bet AI really learned his lesson this time.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber--Trouble follows this guy around, most of his own
making, but this is too much. Half the NBA got money under the table
in college but it's Webber who's indicted for lying to a grand jury,
nine years after leaving, for denying he took $280,000, which booster
Ed Martin claimed he gave him.</TE>
<TE>   The only dispute is how much Webber took (he says it was a few
bucks here and there) but he's not a hometown guy any more and the
local district attorney is hounding him as if he was looking for tax
problems with Al Capone.</TE>
<TE>   Webber's father, Mayce, and his, aunt, Charlene, have been
indicted, too (seriously). However, unless the prosecution can
produce 280K worth of checks, it looks like Webber's word against
Martin's, and a fool's errand of a case.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo Mourning--Great heart. Bad kidney. He won't play this
season, or perhaps ever again, returning the Heat to square one. Pat
Riley, an obsessively hard-driving veteran's coach, will play kids
and rebuild for the first time. There was already speculation that
Riley wanted out but owner Micky Arison wouldn't let him go.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gaston--The clueless absentee owner, whose family presided
over the demise of the Celtic Dynasty in its 19 years, did the
franchise a favor and sold it for $360 million, realizing a tidy
profit of $350 million. Unfortunately, his people had further
compromised their future, giving up any hope of creating salary cap
room by trading Kenny Anderson, whose big contract was about to run
out, for the scorned Vin Baker, who has four seasons at $50 million
left on his.</TE>
<TE>   James Dolan--Son of Cablevision boss Charles Dolan, he now runs
Madison Square Garden (nice to see talent rewarded, isn't it?) but
the parent company's stock is down from $50 to $10 in a year and the
old free-spending days are over. The Knicks had a chance to get
Dikembe Mutombo but Dolan reportedly turned the deal down. Mutombo
wound up with the arch-rival Nets, who now own New York.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Sterling--He had a chance to change the way he and his
franchise were perceived this summer, by locking up cornerstones
Elton Brand and Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't. He's still our Donald.</TE>

<HD>Reba's Gold Closes Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reba's Gold, who had never run at Fairplex Park, beat a couple of
Pomona veterans Sunday to win the $100,000 Ralph M. Hinds Pomona
Handicap on the closing day of the 17-day marathon meet at the Los
Angeles County Fair.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Alex Trebek of "Jeopardy" fame, Reba's Gold passed
longshot Hook Call in the stretch and then, under jockey David
Flores, easily held off the second- and third-place finishers, Nates
Colony and Sigfreto, for a 3 3/4-length win. Between them, Nates
Colony and Sigfreto had been undefeated in five starts at Fairplex.</LD>
<LD>   Running about 1 1/8 miles in a good time of 1:49 4/5, the Dan
Hendricks-trained Reba's Gold was the high weight at 119 pounds. The
favored winner, a 5-year-old son of Slew o' Gold and Lovely Reba,
paid $5.80 after surviving a foul claim that was lodged by Doug
Peterson, the trainer of Sigfreto. Winning $55,000, to go over
$400,000 in earnings, Reba's Gold has five wins, six seconds and four
thirds in 26 starts.</LD>
<TE>   Business was generally down at a meet that started after the
California Horse Racing Board, in June, had turned down a request to
move the fair dates to Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first weekend, we were down about 20%," said Jim
Henwood, president of the fair. "Tracks all over the country were
registering similar drops. With us, it was partly because we were
comparing figures that related to Sept. 11. We stayed open last year,
and for many days we were the only game in town. But I was proud of
the way we rebounded this year after the slow start.... One thing
we're very much opposed to is splitting up our 17 days among the
other tracks [Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only winning ticket on the Fairplex record pick-six payoff of
$416,435.20 was sold at the state betting hub in Maine. The Fairplex
record of $199,346.60 was set in 1999....Winning his fourth
consecutive Fairplex title, Martin Pedroza totaled 27 wins and
increased his record career total to 349 at Pomona.... Flores, No. 1
on the Pomona stakes victory list, added No. 52.... Doug O'Neil won
the training title with nine wins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running a three-horse entry, trainer Bobby Frankel won the
$750,000 Turf Classic at Belmont Park with Denon, whose nemesis in
the previous two races, With Anticipation, was caught between horses
in the stretch and settled for sixth place. Denon paid $5.10 as the
favorite under jockey Edgar Prado, running 1 1/2 miles on a track
listed as good in 2:28 2/5. Frankel said that Denon would go on to
the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf at Arlington Park on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Another likely Breeders' Cup candidate is Ballingarry, an Aidan
O'Brien-trained colt who won the $1.5-million Canadian International
at Woodbine by about two lengths over Falcon Flight, the 5-2 favorite
ridden by Pat Valenzuela. Ballingarry, ridden by Mick Kinane, paid
$10.20.</TE>

<LD>Fontana Ambassador Christian quarterback Brent Martin suffered the
fourth concussion of his varsity career when his helmet was struck by
two defenders' helmets Thursday against Riverside California School
for the Deaf.</LD>
<LD>   The hard knocks haven't tempered his desire to play, though.</LD>
<LD>   "He was mad at us when we told him he had to stay out at least two
weeks," said Dawg Coach Gary Martin, Brent's father. "He wanted to be
back next week. I told him that wasn't his decision."</LD>
<TE>   Brent Martin suffered two concussions as a sophomore and one as a
junior. He received a CT scan and was held out of competition for two
weeks after each concussion, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   The senior was knocked out of Ambassador Christian's 18-12 victory
on the third play Thursday and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked Long Beach Poly wasn't thrilled about playing only the
second day game in Coach Raul Lara's 13 years with the program, but
the Jackrabbits emerged unscathed after their 34-20 victory over
Harbor City Narbonne.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like a JV game," Lara said.</TE>
<TE>   Poly at times looked like a junior varsity team after coming out
sluggish. The Jackrabbits didn't take control until the final two
minutes of the first half, when quarterback Leon Jackson connected
with Derrick Jones on touchdown plays of 34 and 49 yards to take a
27-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Poly had tried to move the game to Veterans Stadium or Gardena
High so it could be played at night. But Narbonne Coach Manuel
Douglas refused.</TE>
<TE>   "It was our only home game," he said. "Why should we have to move
it?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo struggled so mightily to move the ball through the
air the last two weeks that Friday it turned to junior cornerback
Marty Tadman, whose claim to fame this season had been three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Tadman took over as quarterback in the fourth quarter and led the
No. 4 Diablos to a 10-7 come-from-behind victory over Huntington
Beach Marina. Interestingly, Tadman's biggest play came on the
ground, as he rambled seven yards for the winning score with 4:25
left. He also kept the decisive drive alive by running for a 19-yard
gain on third and three.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo had expected to use the pass to set up the run this
season, but an injury to quarterback Josh Rodarmel in the Diablos'
opener put those plans on hold. Rodarmel is expected back in two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Marina suffered a casualty of its own against Mission Viejo when
senior nose guard Sean Evans was lost for the season because of a
broken right leg and torn ligaments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Canada St. Francis needed points so desperately from its
offense that it utilized the fumblerooski play to register its first
offensive touchdown this season. Guard Will Harrahill ran 43 yards
for the score and the Golden Knights went on to rout Burbank
Burroughs, 37-12.</TE>
<TE>   St. Francis' offense had been shut out in previous games against
Crescenta Valley and Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I'm not proud," St. Francis Coach Jim Bonds said. "We're
going to score anyway we can. It worked perfect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills Taft also used some trickery in its 42-6 victory
over Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 6-0, after turnovers on their first two possessions, the
Toreadors used gimmick plays to score twice in 42 seconds in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Taft first utilized the double pass. Quarterback Cary Dove threw a
lateral to receiver Paul Pratt, who connected with Noah Smith for a
29-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   After the Democrats fumbled on their ensuing possession, Dove
completed a "Statue of Liberty" play, rolling toward the right
sideline and drawing the bulk of the Jefferson defense while Ian Bell
went around left end for a 28-yard score and a 14-6 Taft lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita backup kicker Jason Graban didn't suffer from
nerves as he lined up for a 42-yard field goal in a tight game
against Dorsey, and with good reason.</TE>
<TE>   The junior had tied a school record last season with three field
goals in a game against Anaheim Servite. Graban was listed as the
backup to Will Johnson to start this season but was thrust into the
lineup the last two games after Johnson suffered an adverse reaction
to flu medication.</TE>
<TE>   Graban converted the 42-yarder as time expired in the second
quarter to help Santa Margarita beat Dorsey, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a spark for our team, a big confidence booster going into
halftime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brea Olinda's Matt Votaw connected on a pair of 52-yards field
goals to cut the Wildcats' deficit to 22-19 in the second half of a
32-19 loss to Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   Votaw, however, missed an extra-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A defense designed by Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger and his
brother, defensive coordinator Vonzie Pay- singer, did what neither
of Long Beach Wilson's first two opponents were able to do--contain
their cousin, Bruin receiver Brian Paysinger.</TE>
<TE>   After making 17 catches for 308 yards and four touchdowns in two
games, Brian Paysinger was held to two fourth-quarter catches for 39
yards in Wilson's 27-26 nonleague victory over Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "They doubled me all game long," the senior receiver said after
the Bruins improved to 2-0-1. "They had me on lockdown and they took
away my game pretty good. I was fortunate to have two catches."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Brian Paysinger received more acclaim during track,
finishing fifth in the long jump in the state meet. In football, he
was primarily a blocker as Long Beach Wilson used the run-oriented
double wing-T formation, which first-year Coach Larry Mohr abandoned
in favor of a more conventional offense this season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my year right here," said the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Brian
Paysinger, who said he is being recruited by UCLA, Oregon State,
Washington State and Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Paul McLeod, Eric Sondheimer and Eric
Stephens, and correspondents Steven Herbert and Eric Maddy

<HD>O'Neal, Bryant &amp; Co. Thinking Even Bigger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The significance of four, probably, is simply that it is more than
three, and way more than none, which is what it had become before
Phil Jackson came along, and before Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
hugged and meant it.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have won three consecutive NBA championships, and so
the organization is stout on the floor and turning a massive profit
off it, enough for owner Jerry Buss to permit Devean George an annual
salary of $4.5 million, judicious for the Lakers but a turn-about
sentiment for Buss, who once sermonized on living beneath the luxury
tax for the good of the game.</LD>
<LD>   They are closing in on the Boston Celtics in accumulating banners,
and Jackson is one title away from surpassing Red Auerbach, which
would ruin yet another spring for the smoldering Celtic coach,
architect and smokestack. Bryant, who added perhaps 10 pounds of
muscle this summer and enters the season mulling a change of shoes
and a three-year, $55-million contract extension, has done more by 24
(in August) than most basketball players do in a lifetime, and O'Neal
is close to ending the best-center debates.</LD>
<TE>   There is the slight complication of O'Neal's arthritic toe, the
summer he spent agonizing over its treatment, and the surgery he had
less than three weeks ago. But, it's O'Neal's world and the Lakers
live in it, especially in June and generally without back talk. It is
unlikely his hesitation will sabotage the season if he is playing by
Oct. 29, when the Lakers get their rings and begin defense of their
three-peat (Commissioner David Stern might even attend this time), or
within a week or two of that.</TE>
<TE>   So training camp opens Tuesday with all of the usual faces, though
sadly lacking one very familiar voice.</TE>
<TE>   It opens with the usual questions at power forward, and the usual
subtle turnover on the bench, but nothing that would stress Jackson,
who does placid like George Karl does unfathomable defeat.</TE>
<TE>   It opens three months after the last of the confetti was swept up
along Figueroa Street, nearly four since the 27-free-throw fourth
quarter in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals and the frantic
overtime of Game 7 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, after today's media day--which should put him
in a fine mood--Jackson, coach of nine NBA champions, will open a
side door, look to the gym floor, and find O'Neal and Bryant nearby.
It will please him that his run of fortune has not passed in a summer
spent in Montana and Hawaii, among other paradoxical paradises.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will try for four, and for the first time since he
arrived in Los Angeles, Jackson has only a notion of what he's
getting into. Not even the inarguably great and often condescending
Jackson has won four in a row. Until now, he has won titles in
threes, drifting on once without Michael Jordan, and then without a
job, leaving General Manager Jerry Krause to sort through disaster in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   What's out there are the Sacramento Kings, presumably still
indignant over the officiating in Game 6 and their own free-throw
imprecision in Game 7, the cumulative effect leaving them out of the
NBA Finals and a four-game series against the patsy New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   As O'Neal, sweat rolling from his head, observed at the end of
that 16-day series against the Kings, "They felt it was their time.
It was not their time."</TE>
<TE>   No, it was the Lakers', still, by the breadth of a few in-and-out
free throws, and the usual Laker stuff: O'Neal's force, Bryant's
game, Robert Horry's three-pointer, Jackson's hand ...</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Sacramento still mourns, and the Kings still have only
proven they can play with the Lakers, and not past them.</TE>
<TE>   But, while the Lakers only tinkered--General Manager Mitch Kupchak
added shooter Tracy Murray and rookie Kareem Rush and re-signed
George--King counterpart Geoff Petrie signed Keon Clark, a 6-foot-11
wisp from Toronto. Having Clark would mean someone other than Chris
Webber could defend O'Neal after Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard fouled
out, if nothing else.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings get the Lakers on Oct. 25 in an exhibition game at
Staples Center, but not in the regular season until Christmas Day,
and O'Neal should be hale by the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Until O'Neal is O'Neal again, the Lakers belong to Bryant, and he
apparently took the responsibility into an off-season workout plan
that included martial arts training and bordered on maniacal. Yet, it
was Derek Fisher, on two good feet for the first time in years, who
was the team's most diligent summer worker. Rick Fox also is in
phenomenal condition, and even leaner than he was last season.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing--already basketball minds are looking for the next
Kobe Bryant, when the existing one is barely in his mid-20s. He has
become a moving target too, having integrated his game into Jackson's
vision, having chosen to play alongside O'Neal rather than around
him.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 36 years since an NBA team won more than three titles
in a row, and these Lakers--Jackson, O'Neal, Bryant, Fox, Horry,
Fisher, the key players--have the opportunity, starting in April, to
separate themselves from everyone but the Celtics of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of life left in it too. Jackson has two seasons
left on his contract, O'Neal four on his (with an opt-out in three)
and Bryant three on his (with an opt-out in two). O'Neal got his
extension two years ago. Bryant has a standing offer, and an
extension offer to Jackson, while expensive, can't be far behind.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rubens Barrichello won the United States Grand Prix on Sunday when
Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher slowed on the final lap and
appeared to let him pass at the finish.</LD>
<LD>   It was the opposite of the finish May 12 in Austria, where
Barrichello--obeying team orders--allowed Schumacher to go by on the
final straightaway for the victory. At the time, Schumacher had yet
to clinch his fifth Formula One title.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the two red cars were side by side as they crossed the
yard of bricks that designate the finish line on the oval portion of
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course.</LD>
<TE>   Barrichello led by 0.01 of a second, one of the closest margins in
Formula One history.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who clinched the championship in July, appeared on the
way to an easy victory that would have been his record 11th of the
season. He was four seconds ahead with only four laps remaining and
still led by half a second as they began their final lap.</TE>
<TE>   As they came out of the final turn onto the main straightaway,
Schumacher slowed and Barrichello pulled alongside. They crossed the
finish line with the more than 100,000 fans standing and roaring.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't planned," Barrichello said. "We never said anything at
the beginning of the race. We had a lot of fun in the race trying to
be as fast as the other. At the end, what can I say? I'd like to
thank Michael very much and the support of the whole team."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher played coy when asked if he let Barrichello win.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many records this year," he said. "We have a fantastic
team and have always supported each other. I thought it was a good
opportunity to go equal over the line, and we failed a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello's fourth victory of the season assured him of second
place in the season standings. It was Ferrari's 14th victory in 16
races this season.</TE>
<TE>   David Coulthard ran a strong race in his McLaren-Mercedes but was
unable to get close to the Ferraris and finished third, closing to
within 7.7 seconds at the end.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon ended his recent slump and revived his bid for a fifth
NASCAR Winston Cup title, pulling away from a late red-flag restart
to win the crash-filled Protection One 400 at Kansas City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, who led the last 57 laps, ended a three-week losing streak
in which he finished 40th, 14th and 37th after two consecutive
victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Pedregon raced to his third consecutive funny car victory in
the NHRA Nationals at Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, Ill., winning with
a run of 4.924 seconds at 310.84 mph.</TE>

<TE>   Chad Reed, Craig Anderson and Michael Byrne led Australia to the
victory in the World Cup of Motocross at Glen Helen Raceway.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cincinnati basketball Coach Bob Huggins' condition improved Sunday, a
day after he suffered a heart attack at Pittsburgh International
Airport during a recruiting trip.</LD>
<LD>   Huggins, 49, remained in serious but stable condition at Medical
Center in Beaver, about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, said Tom
Hathaway, Cincinnati's assistant athletic director.</LD>
<LD>   "He continues to make progress and the doctors are happy with the
type of progress he's made this afternoon," Hathaway said.</LD>
<TE>   Athletic Director Bob Goin visited with Huggins before returning
to Cincinnati to meet with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "He was alert," Goin said. "He's talking. He's in pain. He has his
family there and obviously that's a tremendous comfort to him."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors implanted a stent Saturday morning. The tiny, metal mesh
device is designed to keep Huggins' once-clogged artery open.</TE>
<TE>   Hathaway said Huggins could remain in Pennsylvania for several
days and then go to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lynne Wagoner, director of cardiac services at University of
Cincinnati Hospital, said Huggins' doctors will have to determine the
damage to his heart before they decide when he can return to
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins was at the airport for a flight to Milwaukee for a
coaching clinic.</TE>

<HD>Defense Is Anything but Mighty for Anaheim</HD>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks showed that their goal scorers could score in a 7-4
loss to the Kings on Sunday at the Arrowhead Pond. Paul Kariya, Steve
Rucchin and Petr Sykora all had goals. Adam Oates had two assists and
Kariya one.</LD>
<LD>   Four goals would have been plenty a year ago, when the Ducks gave
up the eighth-fewest goals in the NHL. But Sunday the Ducks had
mammoth holes in their defense.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran Jason York did little to help his cause, as he was on the
ice for four King goals.</LD>
<TE>   True, one was Alexander Frolov's empty netter with 10 seconds
left. But York was out of position on two other goals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to evaluate one guy [in a game like that]," Coach Mike
Babcock said when asked about York.</TE>
<TE>   York and left wingers German Titov and Denny Lambert were the
three veterans put on notice early in training camp, as they were
left out of the NHL group for practice after the first week.</TE>
<TE>   Their status remains uncertain, especially with the waiver draft
being held this week. Lambert has played in only two exhibition games
and Titov one.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what Lambert and Teets can do," Babcock said. "I need to
evaluate other guys."</TE>
<TE>   York, owed $4 million over the final two years of his contract,
realizes he is being watched and that he is on the bubble.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about it," York said.
"All I can do is play. I'm just coming to the rink each day and
concentrating on playing well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Mathieu Schneider fired in a one-timer that broke a 4-4
tie at 3:46 of the third period. It came 46 seconds after Rucchin had
tied the score.</TE>
<TE>   Frolov then scored two goals to bury the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty humbling when someone comes into your house and
out-works you," Babcock said. "Sometimes you're the teacher.
Sometimes you're the student. There was no question which one we were
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck defenseman Pavel Trnka was scratched from the lineup because
of a slight groin strain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cammalleri, whom the Kings are hoping will be able to make a
contribution this season, scored his first goal of the exhibition
season Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was only an exhibition game, but Steve Heinze finally scored a
goal. In the second period of the Kings' 5-4 victory over the San
Jose Sharks on Saturday night at San Jose, a shot by winger Jaroslav
Bednar deflected off Heinze's body and into the net for the veteran
winger's first goal since Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, signed as a free agent in July 2001 to a three-year,
$6-million contract, scored 15 goals last season but none in the last
three months, ending the season with a 27-game goal-scoring drought
and a head full of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Retreating to his summer home in Maine, he tried to put the second
half of last season out of his mind while preparing for this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told that I've got to earn a job and that's fine with
me," he said early in training camp. "You should come to camp every
year thinking you've got to earn a job. I just showed up and tried to
show them I deserve a job."</TE>
<TE>   His effort hasn't gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "I give Steve Heinze a lot of credit," Coach Andy Murray said.
"His work ethic in training camp has been stronger than it was last
year. I think he's trying to do everything that the coach has asked
him to do. He's worked very hard."</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, 32, laughed when asked about the challenge of trying to
hold off younger players trying to usurp his position on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had young guys coming in my whole career," said the 11-year
NHL veteran, who broke into the league with the Boston Bruins in the
1991-92 season and assisted on the game-winning goal Sunday night
against the Ducks. "In Boston, it would happen year in and year out.
They'd say this or they'd say that and then all of a sudden I'd still
be there and all those kids would be somewhere else, or in the
minors."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Boxma, a 21-year-old prospect who wasn't expected to play in
any exhibition games, finished up in goal for the Kings Saturday
night after starter Felix Potvin was ejected for fighting Todd Harvey
with 6:23 to play in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   After Harvey skated into the crease and he and Potvin started to
scuffle, Harvey ripped Potvin's mask off and the two exchanged blows.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix is a competitor," Murray said.</TE>

<LD>The New York Yankees clinched the home-field advantage throughout the
American League playoffs, using home runs by Rondell White and Jason
Giambi to beat Baltimore, 6-1, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees' Alfonso Soriano was hitless in five at-bats and
finished with 39 home runs. He was bidding to join Barry Bonds, Jose
Canseco and Alex Rodriguez as the only major league players to have
40 homers and 40 steals in a season.</LD>
<LD>   Soriano set the club record for at-bats in a season (696),
breaking the mark of 692 set by Bobby Richardson in 1962. He also led
the AL in hits (209), steals (41) and runs (128).</LD>
<TE>   The Yankees' fifth consecutive win put them at 103-58--the same
record as Oakland. The Yankees had the tiebreaker because they beat
the Athletics, 5-4, in the season series.</TE>
