<HD>Lessons in Diplomacy at a Historic Dinner Party</HD>
<DH>Californians send off one of their own to become
Afghanistan's ambassador to U.S.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As guests wandered through the door of his palatial home just across
Sunset from the Bel-Air gates, Jim Curley took the clueless and
curious aside. He prepped them discreetly on the guest of honor.
"He's the ambassador from Afghanistan," whispered Curley. "The first
one in 20 years."</LD>
<LD>   "To or from?" asked a guest.</LD>
<LD>   On a luscious Tuesday evening, Curley and his wife, Marcia
Israel-Curley, hosted a tiny dinner party for Ishaq Shahryar, the
first Afghan ambassador to the U.S. in 23 years.</LD>
<TE>   The party was a California send-off for the Afghan-born "sun
king," who left Kabul in 1956 to attend UC Berkeley, became an
American citizen and made a fortune in solar technology. He had not
seen his homeland again until this spring. When he set foot in Kabul
and saw the devastation, he cried for two days. He still chokes up
talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   Shahryar has lived for years in Pacific Palisades with his wife,
Hafiza, and two teenage children. In his new role, he hopes to lure
private investment to his ravaged homeland. Already, the U.S.
Geological Survey is mapping out Afghanistan's extensive natural
resources and so many businessmen are pouring into Kabul it is
reminiscent of the California Gold Rush, Shahryar said.</TE>
<TE>   The dinner was pulled together at the last minute by
philanthropist and Republican Party stalwart Israel-Curley, a former
model and founder of Judy's, a chain of fashion stores that was aimed
at young women.</TE>
<TE>   Buzz Aldrin (second man on the moon) and his wife, Lois, dropped
by for drinks. So did Art Linkletter and his wife, also a Lois.
Dinner guests included the consul-general of Morocco, Abdu Saoud, and
his wife, Frances; actress Ruta Lee and her husband, Webb Lowe;
screen legend Cyd Charisse and her husband, singer Tony Martin;
former governor Pete Wilson and his wife, Gayle; and actor James
Cromwell and his wife, Julie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curley hovered near guests, directing them to cocktails, feeding
them background information, and even offering a befuddled reporter a
tutorial on Afghan pronunciation.</TE>
<TE>   "EEEEE-shock," he said, slowly enunciating the ambassador's first
name. "I used to say, e-sock.... That's right.... Now just add in an
'h.'</TE>
<TE>   "Now, for his wife, just think half-Visa. Good. Faster. Hafiza!
Perfect."</TE>
<TE>   "So, are you a Pashtun, or what's the other one?" asked one
champagne-sipping guest who cornered the ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   "Tajik," the ambassador graciously filled in. "I'm an Afghan. I
made a pledge." He said he, Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zaher
Shah; and Afghan President Hamid Karzai all agreed to put citizenship
above tribalism.</TE>
<TE>   "But are you a Pashtun," another guest persisted.</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador, who is Pashtun, demurred.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Over drinks, Shahryar confessed to Pete Wilson that as a
businessman he was not accustomed to public speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I will just pull out my reading glasses and read," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   No, Wilson told him. Never put on the glasses. Keep it brief. No
one was ever criticized for being too brief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At one end of the table Jim Curley, who played the president in
1993's "In the Line of Fire," sat next to the former governor. At the
other end of the table, Cromwell, who plays the president in "The Sum
of All Fears," sat near the new ambassador. The real ex-governor and
the celluloid presidents chatted animatedly about the real president,
George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Attention was paid to every detail. In the center of the table, a
lavish arrangement of peonies, carnations and roses scented the room.
A tiny American flag stuck out of one end of the arrangement, an
Afghan flag out the other. The guests toasted the hostess, the
arrangement, the flags.</TE>
<TE>   Shahryar smiled politely.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner Shahryar whispered, "That's not our flag, you know
... that's the old flag."</TE>
<TE>   So why didn't he clear that up?</TE>
<TE>   "I am a diplomat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk turned to Osama bin Laden. It was the most fascinating part
of the evening. Unfortunately, the conversation was off the record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I've been to Afghanistan," Cromwell announced over the
salad course. He regaled guests with delightful tales of a
'round-the-world hitchhiking tour. In 1972, he rode across
Afghanistan in the backs of Russian-made jeeps. It was during a
drought so severe that Afghans in the mountains were selling their
daughters for money. One family with nothing shared their last melon.
He was incredibly touched by their kindness.</TE>
<TE>   "Were you a hippie?" the ambassador asked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To become ambassador, Shahryar gave up his U.S. citizenship, sold
his businesses and is uprooting his family to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The day Shahryar presented his credentials to President Bush, a
limousine flying an American flag and (the correct) Afghan flag
pulled up to fetch him. Shahryar said it was one of the most moving
moments of his life.</TE>
<TE>   During their meeting Bush took Shahryar aside and told him, "Thank
you so much for what you are doing for your country." He took him
aside again and reiterated. Then once more. Finally Bush grabbed
Shahryar's arm and whispered in his ear, "You can get your
citizenship back in 10 years if you like."</TE>

<LD>THE CHILDREN OF WILLESDEN LANE</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the Kindertransport: A Memoir of Music, Love, and Survival</LD>
<LD>   By Mona Golabek and Lee Cohen</LD>
<TE>   Warner</TE>
<TE>   272 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Mona Golabek's memoir of her late mother, "The Children of
Willesden Lane," is clearly a labor of love. The book, written with
Los Angeles-based journalist Lee Cohen, details the life of Lisa
Jura, who fled Vienna at 14 from the Nazis and managed to build a new
life for herself in London and later the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Golabek, a well-known concert pianist who lives in Los Angeles,
and Jura, also a pianist, were bound by a strong love of music.
Indeed, the book is subtitled "Beyond the Kindertransport: A Memoir
of Music, Love, and Survival."</TE>
<TE>   We are first introduced to Lisa as she heads to her piano lesson
through the prewar streets of Vienna, visions of performing at the
city's Symphony Hall dancing in her head. The young girl arrives at
the home of her kind, elderly teacher and performs a Beethoven piano
concerto for him, only to have him sadly inform her at the end of
class that he will no longer be allowed to teach her because she is
Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Things only get worse for Lisa and her family. It is 1938. Her
father Abraham, a tailor, is caught in the Kristallnacht riots and
forced by German troops to remove all his clothes and scrub the
street--a scene Lisa witnesses from the family's window. Soon
thereafter, Lisa overhears her parents talking about a neighbor who's
willing to give them one space on the Kindertransport, the train
taking Jewish children to England.</TE>
<TE>   The family's oldest daughter, Rosie, is too old to qualify at 20,
so the wrenching choice comes down to either Lisa or her 12-year-old
sister Sonia. And the next morning, Lisa's mother, Malka--also a
musician--breaks down in tears while informing her middle daughter
that she has been chosen. "You are strong and you have your music to
guide you," Malka says. Abraham promises that the rest of the family
will join her as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The scene at the train station, where Lisa joins a crowd of
children with numbered tags around their necks saying
goodbye--perhaps forever--to their families is only one of many
poignant moments in this book. But Golabek and Cohen prevent Lisa's
story from turning into a melodrama by balancing the tragic moments
with examples of her courage and pluckiness. On the train, while the
other children, afraid of a bomb, back away from a basket left in the
aisle, Lisa approaches, opens the lid--and finds a sleeping baby. She
distracts the German guard so that the baby--who obviously has no
papers and is not on the official Kindertransport list--makes his way
to safety across the border with the other passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arriving in London, Lisa faces a setback when the only
relatives she has in England decline to take her into their crowded
home. She spends several months as a servant in a country house--but
eager to be with others more like herself, she escapes on a bicycle
and ends up back in London in a hostel for refugee children on
Willesden Lane.</TE>
<TE>   The hostel becomes Lisa's new home and the other
residents--including Mrs. Cohen, the hostel manager, and her blind,
music-loving son, Hans--become her new family. She even finds
romance, in the form of a leather-jacketed, rebellious fellow refugee
named Aaron.</TE>
<TE>   And, to her delight, the hostel boasts a piano. Soon, in her free
time from her job in a garment factory, Lisa is performing regularly
for her fellow hostel-dwellers. Mrs. Cohen encourages Lisa to apply
for a scholarship to London's prestigious Royal Academy of Music.</TE>
<TE>   But Lisa's musical and social experiences--in some ways those of a
normal (if gifted) teenager--are set against the backdrop of
England's entrance into the war, the bombings of London and Lisa's
horror at not knowing where her family is. Determined to get her
younger sister Sonia out of Vienna, Lisa befriends a local Quaker
woman, who finds Sonia a sponsor. Sonia arrives on the last
Kindertransport allowed through before England joined the war.</TE>
<TE>   Golabek and Cohen pace their story well, with fluid writing and
affecting dialogue. Golabek based the book--which should appeal to
both adults and younger readers--on her mother's stories combined
with her own research. The result is a portrait of a sweet yet tough
young woman of admirable qualities who survives and even flourishes
under difficult conditions.</TE>
<TE>   One small criticism: Golabek says that Aaron and another
character, Mr. Hardesty, an official at the organization involved in
placing the refugees, actually are composites of several people.
Lisa's story is dramatic enough: Why not stick to the facts? But
overall, "The Children of Willesden Lane" is a welcome addition to
the volumes published on an important subject.</TE>

<DH>Couple behind wooden purses try to expand borders of
fashion by setting up shop in Illinois</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</DL>
<LD>Here in the Land of Lincoln, where corn rows are actually plants, not
a hairstyle, Sheila Holley is living proof that a handbag can change
your life.</LD>
<LD>   The proper bag, every smart dresser knows, has the power to
complete an outfit, add confidence or lend personality. But Holley's
lunch box-size vintage bag inspired her to trade a hectic dot-com
life in Seattle for a new career as a wooden handbag designer, here
in the Illinois state capital, far from the style capitals of the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Working out of a sprawling, three-story, turn-of-the-century house
with her husband and mother, Holley and the Once in a Blue Moon bags
are trying to do the improbable: Give the birthplace of the Cozy Dog
corn dog and the cheese-smoothed horseshoe sandwich its first fashion
connection since Abe Lincoln made top hats cool. Holley's whimsical
little purses are popping up in trendy stores, from Fred Segal in
Santa Monica to Henri Bendel in Manhattan, at a moment when fashion
has reembraced the whimsical handbag and items with folk-art flair.</LD>
<TE>   Unexpectedly lightweight, the Once in a Blue Moon bags are
inspired by the work of Texas bag designer Enid Collins, whose
gem-encrusted wooden boxes became 1960s classics. For most of that
decade, Collins, who died in 1990, also worked her magic outside of
fashion circles. Her son, jewelry designer Jeep Collins, recalled how
neighbors helped make the purses and drove the 13-mile dirt road to
the family ranch and workshop in remote Medina, a village of 400 in
the Texas hill country. Holley and her husband, William Vablais, had
no idea how eerily well they picked their new location: Springfield
happens to be where Enid Collins was born Sept. 1, 1918.</TE>
<TE>   The signed Collins originals are experiencing a comeback and often
command hundreds of dollars on vintage clothing auction Internet
sites. Holley's $120 to $225 alder or basswood bags have similar
floral and nature themes crafted from candy-colored gems and
silk-screened patterns. With a satin-smooth finish, a beveled-lid
mirror and an interior scented with essential oils, the Once in a
Blue Moon purses can be mistaken for some sort of New Age train case.</TE>
<TE>   "As I walk through stores carrying the one that I have, people
stop me," said Tatiana Tomacelli, who has sold several at Tatiana,
her Del Mar boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Holley, a petite 39-year-old former oboist who speaks often of
spirituality, found her life-changing bag four years ago as she
scoured vintage shops here, a few miles from her Shelbyville, Ill.,
hometown. One day in Seattle, where Holley worked as an executive
assistant at Home Grocer.com, she dumped her big leather tote and
tucked a few necessities into the compact Collins purse.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed people were smiling at me, and I felt happy," recalled
Holley. "I carried it from that point onward," she said, convinced
that there was something special about an object that could inspire
joy in others.</TE>
<TE>   When bag designs invaded her dreams and Holley lost her job at
HomeGrocer, suddenly she was free to pursue purses. Though she and
Vablais had always relied on the Internet for nearly everything they
needed, they couldn't find the kind of personalized, handmade
materials that they wanted for their prototypes.</TE>
<TE>   "In Seattle, we were ordering everything off of the Web and
driving hours to find some arty place or another," said Holley.
Seattle's congestion, expense and tech-centric attitudes were choking
their fashion venture. It was time to move. "We could have started a
business anywhere in the country," Vablais said. "It made sense to
look around."</TE>
<TE>   The deciding factor became the proximity to family and friends,
not the factories and fashion showrooms that are a hundred miles
south in St. Louis or farther north in Chicago. Almost on impulse,
they quickly bought the house that is their headquarters as well as a
nearby home. As they spent nearly a year setting up shop, they found
that many of the supplies that seemed so elusive in Seattle were
easily available in this pioneer-spirit town.</TE>
<TE>   "This is craft-store alley," said Holley. What they couldn't buy,
they had made for less money from suppliers who were just minutes
away. They found a silk-screen printer in the Yellow Pages who led
them to a plastic-injection mold company, another printer and even
the home-based expert who cuts the box lids. They convinced a custom
woodworking company, MGM Antonacci, which specialized in gliders and
porch swings, to add hand-finished wooden boxes to their repertoire.
Now three woodworkers handle the nearly 30 steps of box production,
which has taken over a portion of the large workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Vablais created their Web site, a database and came up with
paintings that became bag designs. Holley's mother, Karen, came
aboard as a manager, co-creator and gem gluer. Only the two-tone
leather handles are made out of town--by a New York manufacturer of
deluxe dog collars. "Every piece on the bag has an amazing story,"
said Vablais. "Now the bags are going to amazing places."</TE>
<TE>   After landing their first customer, Bettina Duncan at Fred Segal,
at January's California Gift Show in Los Angeles, the company has had
encouraging orders ranging from Bendel in New York to Sundance, a
metaphysical bookstore here. The bags have been selling across the
country through the company's Web site, www. boxbags.com, and through
tie-ins with the Web site for Artists Against AIDS Worldwide,
www.aaaw.org.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the tempo of Midwestern life required an attitude
adjustment. Vablais, used to international travel, the lifestyle of
an executive and the fast pace of Microsoft, would squirm when locals
would idly chat about the weather or their dogs. "I'd only ever seen
the U.S. from 30,000 feet up in an airplane," said Vablais, 42, who
was raised outside of London.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a really big leap of faith to come here," Holley said.
Their move was daring if only because they stepped outside of their
own careers into another that's notoriously suspicious of anyone
operating outside the usual urban style centers.</TE>
<TE>   "How does a company in the middle of Illi-no-where get to be high
profile?" Vablais mused. "Or even known? There are so many ways you
do it, but they're so expensive." They tell the story of their
Midwestern origins on hangtags that come with the bags. "That really
impresses customers," said Fatima Tirimizi, manager of Bettina
Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   With only 250 bags sold so far, the company is too new to declare
a success. Holley hopes that their Internet presence can bridge the
distance between creators and their customers, allowing the
small-town designers a broader market. The company is also testing
notions that fashion companies need each other in proximity to create
synergy, trends and buzz.</TE>
<TE>   And anyway, Holley has found that she's more creative operating
outside the usual currents of fashion. "I stopped reading Vogue
because I was so busy," she said. Now walks in the park, meditation
or dreams give her ideas, not trend reports or runway reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Though the couple sometimes make trips into Chicago for haircuts
and gourmet food, they're happy with their creative life in central
Illinois. "It's good because it keeps us pure and detached," Holley
said. "The people we meet in New York or L.A. are world-weary and
jaded. It's really refreshing not to have to daily participate in
that."</TE>
<TE>   Vablais said the distance helps them focus on business and on
their new, relaxed life together.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to spend my days with the person I love most--Sheila," said
Vablais, beaming. "And them," he said, as the cat crossed the desk
and the dog snoozed in the hall. "It's a lovely way to spend the
day."</TE>

and the clacking of railroad trains are never completely gone, palm
trees line streets defined by sturdy bungalows and small postwar
homes. It is a place where, despite differences of language and
ethnicity, people come to stay and become friends. It is also a place
where expectations for high-end design aren't normally a part of the
picture, and, as a result, a jumble of zoning ordinances long ago
allowed for some unusual juxtapositions.</LD>
<TE>   Amidst the sameness of the residences here, a plain-Jane
Seventh-day Adventist church attended mostly by Russian immigrants is
neighbor to a produce warehouse. There's also a commercial structure
that nearly two decades ago became the studio and loft-like apartment
of artists Linda Burnham and her husband, Robert Overby, who since
has died. The biggest change to the setting came about a year ago,
when Burnham moved into a striking new Modernist home designed by
Stan Allen, a New York architect best known for designing urban art
galleries and work spaces. Dubbed the LB House and completed last
summer, it is defined by a mix of light gray stucco, corrugated
aluminum and fiberglass exterior surfaces, and it neatly fills the
once-empty western half of her studio's plot. Standing next to the
church at the end of a long street, the LB House punctuates a vista
north toward the hills like a dot on an i.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham, 51, is known for her abstract paintings and as
Distinguished Professor in the painting department at Otis College of
Art and Design, where she recently stepped down from an eight-year
post as chair of the School of Fine Arts. She has a warm, friendly
personality that eschews flashiness. She is a lover of good
design--evident not only in the house, but in every object in it--but
her taste is underlined with a desire for the practical. Nothing is
just for show--what she has, she uses.</TE>
<TE>   After Overby died of Hodgkin's disease in 1993, Burnham made a
decision to take her living quarters as seriously as she had long
taken her careers as teacher and painter (she shows her work
regularly at Fredericks Freiser Gallery in New York). She thought
first about buying something, and her taste for California Modernism
led her to look at existing homes by Richard Neutra and R.M.
Schindler. She found, however, that her strong attachment to the
neighborhood around her studio was a good enough reason to build
something new, and she liked the idea of being an architectural
patron.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham and Allen first met in 1996, when Allen, then a professor
at Columbia, was in Los Angeles for a ceremony honoring Rafael Moneo,
architect of L.A.'s new downtown cathedral and in whose office in
Spain Allen had once worked. Introduced by a mutual artist friend,
Allen visited Burnham in her studio, and the two hit it off
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sensibilities were perfectly in line," Allen says. "I
remember on the table were Eileen Gray books, as well as Mies van der
Rohe and Rem Koolhaas books. I thought this is the kind of thing I'm
interested in. We were right on the same wavelength." Theirs was the
kind of personal chemistry essential for the architect-client
collaboration on a residential project. Still, for Burnham, signing
on with Allen was a leap of faith; she had seen and says she "loved"
the art gallery spaces he had created in New York and was willing to
proceed on that basis, even though hers was to be Allen's first
design for a home. (As it turned out, his second residential design,
for a house in upstate New York, was completed before Burnham's.)</TE>
<TE>   The ordinariness of Burnham's neighborhood, Allen says, was part
of the appeal of the project: "It is a weird, complex mix of stuff
that is not conventionally beautiful, but just the mix adds up to
something interesting." In response, Allen has created a Modernist
structure whose design accommodates the neighbors without
overwhelming. With 1,800 square feet of living space, a
400-square-foot garage and a lap pool and garden at the back, the
house is classical in its simple Modernist clean lines, which mesh
with the now-common use of industrial materials. It also graciously
adds a new generation of architecture to the area, a sign of
stability in a place that could have had the potential for decay.</TE>
<TE>   The house Allen created feels both compact and expansive. Sized to
accommodate a single person's lifestyle, with room to entertain, the
living-dining room extends into an open kitchen with the interruption
only of a workspace for cooking and storage. A wall of windows gives
the home a rich indoor-outdoor feel with a view of the pool and small
desert garden area, landscaped by Pam Burton.</TE>
<TE>   A small guest room and downstairs bath are the only other elements
on the first floor; a semi-enclosed spiral staircase leads to the
upstairs master bedroom, bath and balcony office. The grandness of
the master bathroom, in particular, which has some of the best views
of the hills, stands out for its extravagance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only room that I find myself explaining why it exists,"
Burnham says. "I lived [in my studio] for so many years, with a
little commercial tiny bathroom with no windows, and a little
commercial shower. I remember saying to Stan, 'I want a guest room, I
want a lot of light, and I want a nice bathroom.' And I got all of
that. I got a nice bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, whose firm is called Field Operations, is an established
theorist, teacher and practitioner, and he conveys a determined,
ambitious yet friendly presence. Not as well known on the West Coast
as on the East, his record is nevertheless notable--this spring, he
was named chairman of Princeton University's highly respected
architecture department. His influences range from the work of Moneo
and New York Modernist Richard Meier, whose office he also worked in,
to the French father of Modernism, Le Corbusier.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the two-story living room of the LB House, which is
filled with Burnham's distinctive contemporary furniture and colorful
art collection (all of the work is by other artists; she prefers not
to display her own paintings), it's clear that Allen and Burnham have
become friends as they worked together. They finish one another's
sentences as they speak of their satisfaction with the result of a
process that along the way was somewhat arduous. Getting the plan
approved was the biggest challenge, because Burnham's land had been
zoned commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have built a chemical factory right up to the property
line and gone down and got a permit in two weeks," Allen says with a
laugh. "But to build a house, it took us two years to get a permit."
Burnham found the neighbors to be supportive of the project and says
they petitioned the city to allow her to build the house.</TE>
<TE>   The plan had to be configured to meet strict housing codes. A
carport, for one, was nixed in favor of an enclosed garage, and some
features were put in place to avoid unsightly views, such as of the
church parking lot next door. Each exterior facade is very different,
yet all are integral to the others. With bright white walls
throughout, polished concrete floors on the ground level and bamboo
floors upstairs, the house is low-maintenance, and the attention paid
to small details and flow create a feeling of quality and
spaciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "The wonderful thing with houses for architects is the house has
everything," says Allen, moving into his sartorial mode. "It has
public space, private space, tectonic issues, as well as issues of
light and materials. For architects, the house is a kind of
laboratory, where ideas are tested. Historically, many of the
breakthrough moments were houses, particularly in the Modernist
period."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of complexity in this house," he continues, "but it
doesn't register as extravagant formal complexity. It's really more
internalized. For example, the curve of this wall has everything to
do with coming in a door and being able to look out that window.</TE>
<TE>   "Every move," he says, "has a reason for being the way it is."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maxine Rudoff's students at Roscomare Road Elementary in Los Angeles
like the following rides:</LD>
<LD>   * The bumper cars at Disneyland make me feel excited. They make my
hair blow in the air. (Maysa, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite ride is the water raft at Disneyland. It makes me
feel scared because it's like I'm going to fall off. I like it
because people also squirt water at you. (Jessica, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * The log ride at Knott's Berry Farm makes me feel calm because
after I get splashed, I cool down. (Michael, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite is Jurassic Park at Universal Studios. It sort of
makes me feel scared because there are close-up mechanical dinosaurs
and an 88-foot drop! It looks dangerous, but it's very safe. I also
like it because I like dinosaurs. (Steven, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite is Splash Mountain at Disneyland. If you go on a
summer day and go down the big fall, the water splashes on your face
and cools you off. It makes you feel like there are 60,000
butterflies flying like mad in your stomach. (Maddie, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * The Matterhorn at Disneyland makes me feel like I'm flying all
over the place, gliding up and down suddenly. (Dylan, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * Ghost Rider at Knott's Berry Farm makes me feel cold because it
goes so fast and the wind blows on me. It's kind of scary! (Gracie,
9)</TE>
<TE>   * Cyclone at Six Flags makes me feel excited. I like it because it
has so many loops, goes really fast and high and it's a long ride.

<LD>Quentin hurried to keep up with Glory, juicily chewing his spearmint
gum.</LD>
<LD>   "Mama said she was bringing her sewing basket. Can't we make a big
flag?"</LD>
<LD>   Glory shook her head. "You need lots of cloth for a big flag, and
just the right colors."</LD>
<TE>   They found the picnic table where Mama sat hemming the red sashes
for the Singing Mothers. Glory's costume--red vest, white shirt and
blue skirt--lay there, all finished. She wouldn't need it now.</TE>
<TE>   Glory told Mama the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," Mama said. "I know how much it meant to you."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Quentin jiggled Glory's hand. He pointed to the red
sashes. "Aren't they the right color?"</TE>
<TE>   Glory looked at the sashes. They were the right color, a bright,
true red. They were the right size for flag stripes, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama," Glory began.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Mama said, "the Singing Mothers need these sashes for their
costumes."</TE>
<TE>   "Mama," Glory said, "didn't you ever want to lead a parade?"</TE>
<TE>   Mama thought about it, then began counting sashes. "A flag needs
seven red stripes," she said. "We can hide seven of the Singing
Mothers behind other ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Glory looked quickly around. What about the white? And the blue?</TE>
<TE>   Sugar McCrary's costume was a white sheet. But she'd never give it
up to make a flag for Glory to carry.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Arbuckle has a big, white tablecloth," Glory said. Grabbing
Quentin's hand, she towed him over to Mrs. Arbuckle's table. "Mrs.
Arbuckle," she said, "would you donate your tablecloth to make a big
flag to lead the parade?"</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Arbuckle gasped. "Why, this tablecloth has been in my family
for 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Quentin smiled up at her. "I'll bet your four fathers would be
glad for their tablecloth to be a flag."</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Arbuckle looked at him, then at Glory. She began to take
everything off the tablecloth. "It will make a fine flag," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Glory felt hopeful. They had red and white cloth now. But where
would they get the right shade of blue?</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Can a flag be made in time for Glory to lead the parade?</TE>
<TE>   Lael Littke once got to ride her horse and carry a flag in the
Fourth of July parade in her hometown of Mink Creek, Idaho. This

<LD>The U.S. Flag in Indian Art</LD>
<LD>   Just about everywhere you look these days, you see an American
flag, especially today as we take part in our Fourth of July
celebrations. Did you know that the flag is very special to American
Indians, not just on the Fourth of July, but whenever they hold
formal group meetings? Usually the first thing entering the room is
the American flag, followed by Indian men and women who are veterans
of the U.S. Armed Forces.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1800s, when American Indians were fighting to keep
their land, they captured the American flag as a prize of war. They
understood that the flag was extremely important as a symbol of
power, and they began to use its colors and design on such things as
shields, clothing, moccasins and rugs.</LD>
<TE>   The American flag continues to be used in today's American Indian
designs, especially when honoring family members who are in the
military. It is often seen on the special clothing worn for social
and ceremonial dances.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum has many examples of the American flag in
Indian art. Sioux women, especially between 1880 and 1900, were noted
for their beautiful beadwork in which they often used the flag and
other patriotic symbols. The beadwork on a baby's bonnet at the
museum includes two American flags. Also in the museum's collection
is a beaded Sioux pipe bag, with two American flags on top of a blue
and red triangle. In the example shown here, American flags are
worked into a young man's beaded vest once worn by a Sioux Indian.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about Indian art at the Southwest Museum in Los
Angeles. Its collections represent Native American cultures from
Alaska to South America. For more information, call (323) 221-2164 or
visit www.southwestmu seum.org.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The good news about "Eco Design, the Sourcebook" by Alastair
Fuad-Luke (Chronicle Books, 2002) is there are 700 entries of
ecologically sound items. The bad news is that we're not aware of
many of them, perhaps because so many originated in Europe. Yet this
picture-filled, 352-page paperback is an optimistic catalog of
designs that lead the way to a more Earth-friendly future.</LD>
<LD>   The opening chapter describes the evolution of the ecological
movement, followed by insights into the latest thinking in designing
for a sustainable future. The bulk of the book is a compilation of
illustrated eco-designs with short descriptions, concluding with a
chapter of resources throughout the world. This last section is
particularly invaluable as a who's who in the field. But best of all,
on top of all the useful information, the book is fun just to thumb
through and marvel at how designers have been rethinking our material
lives.</LD>
<LD>   There are classics, like architect Frank Gehry's 1972 Little
Beaver chair, made of layers of thick cardboard glued together, and
funky ideas like the milk-bottle light made from discarded plastic
milk bottles and designed by the Dutch firm Droog Design.</LD>
<TE>   Solar-powered flying machines that explore new ways to aviate
include the human-powered Gossamer Albatross aircraft that crossed
the English Channel in 1979, made by Monrovia-based AeroVironment.
Today, AeroVironment's biggest products are solar-powered systems for
electric vehicles and forklifts, as well as remote-controlled 9-pound
drone airplanes, equipped with cameras, that fly at low altitude for
up to five miles for military use.</TE>
<TE>   Paul McGrady, founder of AeroVironment, says, "We're developing a
better ceiling fan and a natural gas motor that's unusually
efficient. Our development programs will never decrease. We're always
looking to the future."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is too small or too large for a designer not to rethink.
Free-standing lamps have been made from recycled paper, stackable
chairs from veneer-faced plywood. There are solar roof tiles with
photovoltaic cells, Honda's Insight car that gets 83 miles per
gallon, and even coffins made from recycled newsprint.</TE>
<TE>   When author Fuad-Luke, a teacher of green design at Falmouth
College of Arts in England, was asked which products impressed him
most, he replied, "My favorites tend to be those which encourage us
to 'be' rather than 'have.' " He cited Germany's solar-powered ferry,
a chair made from wicker and steel, knitted products that turn into
blankets and wraps, and felt squares backed with Velcro that can be
reconfigured into items of apparel. "You return design democracy to
fashion consumers with that one," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While flipping through the pages, it's impossible not to note that
most items seem to be of European origin. "I think the European
dominance in the book reflects the maturity of the debate around
green design, eco-design and, now, design for sustainability here
compared to other regions around the world," Fuad-Luke says. European
Union legislation has been a driver in focusing manufacturers on
developing environmental policies and, subsequently, corporate
policies for social responsibility and sustainability.</TE>
<TE>   He also points out that there are designer-led not-for-profits and
prestigious awards for ecologically sound designs, and says European
consumers are very aware of the issues, which he says he doesn't see
as a general rule in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   He does have hope, though, and says he believes the public is more
aware of environmental problems today than at any time since he
qualified as an environmental scientist in 1978. "I sense a gentle
breeze of change in Europe and Japan, but not necessarily in the USA,
Southeast Asia, China and India. Still, I believe consumers will
respond to smart 'eco-manufacturers' who deliver the best product on
the market and communicate why it is more sustainable than the
competition."</TE>
<TE>   And this design-filled book may just help all that along.</TE>
<TE>   Robotic Mower Means</TE>
<TE>   Hands-Off Lawn Care</TE>
<TE>   Here's something the Jetsons would love--the 1-foot-tall,
canary-yellow Robomower. Resembling a big, benign bug, this product
of Friendly Robotics mows any lawn that a conventional, walk-behind
mower could--only without the guidance of human hands. This tricky
feat is done through the Roboscan navigational system, whereby the
machine's owner installs an insulated wire in the ground around the
perimeter of the lawn to be mowed, adds a perimeter switch, presses a
"go" button on the machine, and it's off--albeit at half the speed of
a regular mower. The fencing-in feature contains a small signal,
carried through the wire, that the Robomower senses and won't go
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Running on a cordless rechargeable electric-power pack, the mower
has six different blade-height settings and quietly makes a
21-inch-wide cut. When the mower is in action, it can either keep
mowing until it runs out of juice or be timed to run for a limited
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Robomower, designed and manufactured in Israel, is both
aesthetic and functional in its design. Yellow was picked because
it's friendly, says Jeff Stewart, vice president of the Dallas-based
Friendly Robotics, USA. "We are really especially proud of its
mulching ability. Its three small blades spin very fast and chop
grass up into finer pieces than conventional mowers. That's good for
the yard, since nutrients are returned to it." Robomower is the first
robotic machine introduced by Friendly Robotics; early next year, a
robot vacuum cleaner will follow.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the $499.95 price of the mower are the wire, stakes
and switch and an instruction video. Robomower is available at many
local dealers. For information, call (888) 404-7626 or visit the Web
site at www.friendlyrobotics.com.</TE>

<HD>Pricier and More Exotic Soaps Have Buyers in a Lather</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one should be shocked by the price tag because, after all, it's
Barneys New York, but really, $15 for a bar of soap?</LD>
<LD>   Get ready to adjust your shopping budget, because specialty soap
is heading your way--assuming it hasn't already made its way into
your shower, tub or soap dish.</LD>
<LD>   Barneys sells Caudalie Co.'s vine flower for what 30 cakes of Dial
would cost you at Costco. Sephora offers Zirh with kelp for $14.50.
Even bestseller Dove, priced closer to a buck, has upgraded its
Beauty Bar: for 35 cents more, you can lather up with a pretty
pink-and-white Nutrium Skin Nourishing Bar.</LD>
<TE>   Artisanal makers are squeezing vitamins, West African shea butter
(a richer replacement for moisturizing cocoa butter) and additives
for special skin types into round, square and oblong bars that can be
stacked, bundled or showcased in a complementary dish. Some "bars"
are shaped like animals, flowers and sports icons. Geologist Todd
Pink creates "semiprecious" SoapRocks ($15), nuggets of dense
glycerin splintered with golden veins that look more weathered and
realistic with use. Even former Lava users can now chat about pricey
mail orders received from small family-run companies and Old-World
savonneries.</TE>
<TE>   Early true believers of soap's importance continue on their
quests: Home crafters hunt down vintage press stamps to emboss
spheres, moons or logos, and insert toys and jewelry into loaves.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury hotels see soap cakes--wrapped neatly in pleated paper or
banana tree leaves, or tucked into Victorian tins or drawstring
cotton bags--as customer keepsakes. And model-home designers rely on
new marbleized colors and potent fragrances to bring a feeling of
comfort and security to tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Interior designer Rebecca Pelletier was accessorizing so many
baths with bubbles and linens that she opened a store in Tustin last
year, gave it her name and stocked it with $10,000 in French soaps.
One of her most popular is a lavender Rance ($20).</TE>
<TE>   Sales of higher-priced bars have increased, says Tom Branna,
editorial director of Household &amp; Personal Products Industry
magazine, "because when the economy dips, people won't spend
thousands of dollars to buy a new car to feel good, but they will
spend a few more dollars on personal products."</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up: Soap bars, from 30 cents on up, are a
$1.3-billion-a-year business in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Because these gourmet soaps have been promoted as affordable
luxuries, they're also getting their day in print. Home design
magazines sharpen their camera lenses on them, and making soap is the
focus of several magazines, newsletters and Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   An 80-page book, "Soap for Body and Soul," by Lisl and Landt
Dennis (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 2002, $17.95), celebrates--in words
and color photographs--its artistry.</TE>
<TE>   A few decades ago, say experts, most people's view of exotic soap
was Irish Spring and Yardley of London. Then the Body Shop and other
bath-and-beauty companies elevated the industry and the race for
distinction was on.</TE>
<TE>   "Soap has been around for a long time," says June Stahl of Stahl
Soap, a New Jersey manufacturer, "but now everyone wants a bar that
looks different, feels better, smells better and stands apart."</TE>

<LD>Which is the bigger surprise on this week's music charts--that Elvis
Presley is No. 1 or that Eminem is not?</LD>
<LD>   Nielsen SoundScan reports that after five weeks on top, Eminem has
finally slipped to No. 2 on the U.S. album chart, ceding No. 1 to St.
Louis rapper Nelly's "Nellyville," which sold 714,000 copies in its
opening week. Other top debuts this week: rapper N.O.R.E. at No. 3,
singer Truth Hurts at No. 5 and Will Smith at No. 13.</LD>
<LD>   On the singles chart, a remixed version of the relatively obscure
1968 Presley song "A Little Less Conversation" is No. 1, a revival
driven by Nike's use of the song as a centerpiece in its World Cup
advertising campaign.</LD>

<LD>   Will Puffy AmiYumi become Japan's biggest pop export since Kyu
Sakamoto hit No. 1 in the U.S. back in 1963 with "Sukiyaki"? Ami
Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura have generated a buzz stateside since
releasing their first U.S. album, "Spike," last year. Their latest
domestic release, "An Illustrated History," compiles songs from three
(of seven) Japanese albums and coincides with a tour that includes a
stop Friday at Spaceland in addition to the duo's sold-out show
Saturday at the Roxy in West Hollywood. And no, there's no evidence
to suggest that Sean Combs changed his nickname to P. Diddy in
deference to these two.</LD>
<LD>   Puffy AmiYumi, Spaceland, 1717 Silverlake Blvd., L.A. With Irving,
the Blokes. 9 p.m. $12. (323) 661-4380. Also Saturday at the Roxy,
9009 W. Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. Sold out. (310)

<TE>   Director-provocateur James Toback, who took on race in "Black and
White" and sex in "Two Girls and a Guy," goes back to college with
"Harvard Man." Toback, an Ivy Leaguer himself, incorporates some of
his favorite subjects--sex, drugs and high-stakes gambling--into the
story of a basketball-playing undergrad (Adrian Grenier) who digs the
philosophy of Heidegger, has an affair with his kinky professor (Joey
Lauren Adams) and gets involved with a mobster's cheerleader daughter
(Sarah Michelle Gellar). Chaos, alas, ensues.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvard Man," rated R for drug use, language and some strong
sexuality, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   The Mideast conflict comes to life in tales of ordinary people in
extraordinary circumstances in "Stories Under Occupation." The play
was written by the principal players and director Nizar Zubi of the
Al-Kasaba Theatre company, formerly of Jerusalem but now of Ramallah
in the West Bank. The tales--of an old man moving from one personal
disaster to the next, a young couple exchanging tokens of love, a son
calling home, a mother losing her child and others--are woven into a
narrative. The play will be performed one night only at the La Mirada
Theater, in Arabic with English subtitles on a giant screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Stories Under Occupation," La Mirada Theater, 14900 La Mirada
Blvd., La Mirada. 8 p.m. $25. (562) 944-9801.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Comedy</TE>
<TE>   His "inner comedian" sabotaged him on just about every other job
he tried. So it was only a matter of time before Richard Jeni would
discover the world of stand-up comedy. But when this New Yorker
worked his five-minute routine into a class comedy act, there was no
stopping the television shows and specials that would follow. This
weekend, the streetwise comic takes on terrorism and other topics, at
the Ice House in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jeni, the Ice House, 24 N. Mentor Ave., Pasadena. Friday,
8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; Saturday, 7 and 9 p.m. $19.50. (626) 577-1894.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   The man in the slouch hat--singer-songwriter Bobby Caldwell--has
released a dozen CDs during the past two decades. His tunes have also
been recorded by such artists as Boz Scaggs, Chicago, Amy Grant, Neil
Diamond, the Commodores, Vanessa Williams, Al Jarreau, Dave Koz,
Brenda Russell, Richard Elliot and others. On Friday in Newport
Beach, he'll draw upon his own eclectic range, which runs from smooth
jazz to R&amp;B to classic big-band pop standards.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Caldwell, Hyatt Newporter Outdoor Amphitheater, 1107
Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. Friday, 8 p.m. $40 to $65. (949)
729-1234.</TE>

<TE>   8:30pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   The culmination of an intensive, monthlong workshop, the Praxis
Project showcases choreographers in a program of works in progress
titled "Here in the Dark." Participants include Ronald Brown
("Fragile"), Dorcas Roman ("Subtle Fragmentations"), Frit and Frat
Fuller ("The Bored Room"), Janice Garrett ("Ostinato" and excerpts
from "Hither Thither") and Johnny Tu ("Still Standing"). Founded and
directed by Kacy Keys, the project enlists dancers on a volunteer
basis and attempts to give the audience insights into the creative
process--especially how works originate and evolve toward their ideal
shapes. In other words, Praxis makes perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Praxis Project, Watercourt, California Plaza, 350 S. Grand Ave.,
downtown L.A. 8:30 p.m. Also Saturday, 8:30 p.m. Free. (213)
687-2159.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Choreographer Kitty McNamee sees contemporary pop culture too
clearly to be seduced by its lies. Probing it in a series of eerie,
neo-Expressionist dance dramas for her Hysterica Dance Company, she's
found layers of alienation, fear and desperate pretense. Her latest
full-evening creation, "Sticks and Stones," promises another
nonlinear action-painting of a culture in crisis. This time her
collaborators include composer Matthew Sims, master of what he calls
"technosexual noise," and costume design specialists Grant Krajecki
of Grey Ant, and Ryan Heffington and Erin Giraud of Rock 'n Sissy. By
no coincidence whatsoever, Heffington is also a leading dancer in
"Sticks and Stones" and will model his own clothes in the role of the
vulnerable resident Everyman.</TE>
<TE>   Hysterica Dance Company, "Sticks and Stones," John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East, Hollywood. 8 p.m. $12 to $20.

<LD>   Lyle Lovett weathered some emotional lumps during his short-lived
marriage to Julia Roberts, which may have helped him rebound from the
physical ones he got in March after being trampled by a bull on his
uncle's farm in suburban Houston. Bruises physical or emotional are
what Lovett deals with most astutely in his consistently wry and
insightful country-soul music.</LD>

<TE>   Africa and the New World have been tossing rhythms back and forth
for centuries, and the beat goes on at the Hollywood Bowl in "African
Heart/Latin Soul," part of this summer's World Music Series. Hugh
Masekela's soulful trumpet provides the African heart, with pianist
Eddie Palmieri adding the soul via a Nuyorican blend of jazz, pop and
salsa. Ozomatli varies the menu with its eclectic Latin rhythms, and
Yerba Buena tops off the evening with a set of simmering Afro-beat
Cuban pop.</TE>

<TE>   It's been nearly a decade since we last got an album from the
Breeders. During that time, the celebrated alt-rock band fronted by
former Pixies bassist Kim Deal and her twin sister, Kelley, has dealt
with a succession of personnel changes as well as Kelley's time in
drug rehab. The band acknowledges the effect of the various setbacks
in the title of its oft-postponed new album, "Title TK," journalistic
shorthand for "title to come."</TE>

<LD>   It's never too late to learn rap, break-dancing, graffiti art and
the mysteries of the hip-hop DJ, all to be revealed in the
interactive post-performance sessions of "Break It Down," a
comprehensive hip-hop cavalcade presented by members of the JUiCE
(Justice by Uniting in Creative Energy) community center near
downtown L.A. The performance explores the facets of hip-hop culture
through four story lines, a number of contemporary performing
disciplines and the talents of DJ Koolhurst, Stuntman, Felix,
Rawbzilla, Lotuz and others. If you're feeling out of touch with all
the street vitality spilling over into fashion, advertising, pop
music, movies and the graphic arts, this is the place to connect.</LD>

Circus Disco. Beautiful Creatures, Ball, 40 Cycle Hum and others will
play their own songs in the 1,000-capacity Platinum Room, and the
Metallica tribute band Alcoholica will set up in the nearby
400-capacity Silver Room. A free barbecue will start at 6 for those
interested in a semblance of tradition.</TE>

<TE>   It's hard to resist Laguna Beach, with its clean air, beaches and
relaxed arts-community vibe. Beginning today, there's even more to
lure you south as the 70th annual Festival of Arts opens at a
six-acre canyon park near the ocean. This year's juried event will
feature original artworks from the beach communities of Orange County
and will include a junior art exhibition, youth art education days on
Wednesdays, a Thursday night wine-tasting and jazz series and a
Sunday classical music series. Then, on Sunday, the Pageant of the
Masters begins, a show in which performers stand stock-still for 90
seconds in tableaux that imitate such works of art as Leonardo da
Vinci's "The Last Supper." This year's theme is "Heroes and
Heroines." Paging Superman and Frida Kahlo....</TE>
<TE>   Festival of Arts, 650 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Daily, 10

<DH>Janet Klein prefers 'obscure, naughty and lovely' tunes,
many pre-1938</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Janet Klein probably should have been born at the beginning of the
20th century, when the "obscure, naughty and lovely" songs she sings
were popular. It's the era in which she feels most comfortable, and
whose spirit and style she so successfully re-creates with her music.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A.-based singer not only lives in the present day, but is
also recording and performing a vast repertoire of long-forgotten
material--songs from the 1910s, '20s and '30s that few people even
know exist.</LD>
<LD>   Klein, who prefers venues where she can "make a time-warp,"
recently played to a packed house at the Silent Movie Theater in the
Fairfax district with her nine-piece jazz band, the Parlor Boys.
Dressed in a vintage floor-length, black-and-gold gown, she strummed
the ukulele and smiled her way through sweet and sexually suggestive
ditties in a vocal style that was both coy and come-hither. The
Parlor Boys, only seven of whom could fit on stage, backed her up
with a lighthearted liveliness and enthusiasm that can only come from
a true love of the genre.</LD>
<TE>   "People think this music is corny, but it's not.... A lot of it is
really full of life and really bawdy and cool," says Klein, a bobbed
brunet who dresses in period even when she's not on stage. "Some of
it's more frank than stuff today."</TE>
<TE>   Her hourlong set at the Silent Movie Theater included the songs
"Hurry on Down to My House Honey, There Ain't Nobody Home but Me,"
which was banned from radio in the '30s, and "Yiddish Hula Boy,"
about a man who leaves his wife for "a girl with a dress of shredded
wheat ... and doughnuts on her feet."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Klein's material derives from obscure 78 rpm recordings
and sheet music she and her bandmates collect. Some of the songs are
from vaudeville acts that were recorded for film. All of it is
incredibly rare.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe how much material I come across that's just
astoundingly great," says Klein, who gives her age as "around 40."</TE>
<TE>   "The period between the turn of the century and 1938 is an
amazingly fruitful time in American music. It's shocking that it's so
buried."</TE>
<TE>   Klein herself took a long time unearthing the treasures she now
performs. Though attracted to early 20th century aesthetics since she
was a child, it wasn't until the '80s, when she was studying for an
art degree at UCLA, that she haunted the library and began learning
about songwriters and musicians such as Kurt Weill, Lotte Lenya and
Josephine Baker.</TE>
<TE>   After placing an ad in a publication that posts requests for
information on various topics, she started receiving cassettes filled
with everything from ragtime music to tunes by country musician
Charlie Pool and blues singers Georgia White and Edith Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   It was several years before she worked up the nerve to sing them
in public. In the interim, Klein, who is also a poet, read her own
work at poetry readings. Eventually, she wanted to add a musical
component and learned the ukulele.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think small," says Klein. "Ukulele was just kind of a
simple thing. I thought it would be a nice, little, charming
accompaniment and be about the right size for a little poem."</TE>
<TE>   That accompaniment soon grew to include a pianist, bass player and
percussionist, all of whom played with her between poems at various
poetry readings. Then Klein decided to sing the songs she'd been
collecting and the group began performing as a musical act in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Today, six additional musicians have joined the band, including
two members of famed underground cartoonist R. Crumb's Cheap Suit
Serenaders, Tom Marion and Robert Armstrong. Also on board is veteran
musician-author-historian Ian Whitcomb, who preceded Klein as a
champion of the period's music.</TE>
<TE>   Klein's day job is with a commercial printer in Santa Monica,
which is where she prints the fliers, postcards and CD jackets for
her band--all of them based on designs from the first third of the
1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Klein has released two CDs on her own Coeur de Jeanette
Productions label--"Come Into My Parlor" (1998), a solo record on
which Klein sings and plays ukulele, and "Paradise Wobble" (2000),
where Klein performs with her full band. Her next record, "Put a
Flavor to Love," will be released at the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   Klein's music goes beyond entertainment--it's also a history
lesson, a means of keeping old music alive for a new audience, which
encompasses everyone from goth girls and rock fans to people who grew
up with the music.</TE>
<TE>   "This past show, so many people were coming up to me requesting
specific tunes," says Klein. "It gives me such a kick because they
know them through me. Other than that, they've been dead and buried.
Suddenly, people act like it's the latest tune. It's great."</TE>

Theater, 611 N. Fairfax Ave., L.A. 8 p.m. $12. (323) 655-2520.</TE>

<LD>Hermosa Beach is for lovers.</LD>
<LD>   At night, the pretty South Bay city--one of the few beach areas to
upgrade its downtown area without losing its unique style--becomes a
destination for singles looking for love. With so many bars,
restaurants and dance clubs huddled together, it's like Hollywood in
miniature, but with a romantic beach backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   Hermosa Beach hot spots such as Sangria, Cafe Boogaloo and Aloha
Sharkeez are key draws, and each offers an alternative for people
tired of the same old scene. Folks hoping to meet someone have ample
options, given the multitude of bars and clubs within walking
distance. The nightclubs are packed on weekends and will be
particularly crazed for this long weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Hermosa takes the Fourth of July's spirit of independence
seriously, hosting today's wild Ironman competition, which includes
pounding a six-pack, surfing and surviving a mosh pit. This weekend
is also noteworthy because the Strand celebrates another endless
summer with a jillion house parties, like a Mardi Gras for the
beachcombing set.</TE>
<TE>   But don't let the long lines of cars parking in lots adjacent to
the promenade scare you. They move quickly, and it's good to go as
early as possible. On a normal weekend, 10 p.m. is fine. For this
weekend, play it safe and arrive early.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's a spell cast by the ocean air, but the people strolling
around the promenade look healthier and happier than you might find
in Hollywood. Women feel free to rock some belly, and there's plenty
of it to go around. In Hollywood, it seems, you still have to have
Twizzler-size hips, but in Hermosa, you can let your hair down. Good
thing, because there's so much fun to be had. I've been kicking it as
a tourist in Hermosa for about a decade and favor such old-school
haunts as the Mermaid, a beachside piano bar in which time seems to
stand still. But to really assess the state of the scene, I asked
Chris Pike to be my tour guide.</TE>
<TE>   Pike, who owns such South Bay spots as Sangria, the Side Door and
Los Muchachos, grew up in the area and is widely credited with
energizing its nightlife in the last decade. We decide to meet at the
teensy-weensy watering hole the Side Door, a few minutes from Hermosa
in neighboring Manhattan Beach. It's a good launching pad for the
next phase, the trip to downtown Hermosa for a taste of Sangria. The
chic restaurant serves food till 10 p.m., and then it transforms into
a full-blown dance club, with DJs spinning hip-hop and house music.</TE>
<TE>   Pike, who also owns Las Palmas in Hollywood and Joya in Beverly
Hills, says he was an unlikely guy to start an empire. He says he was
a "lazy, surfer, artist punk" until his father's pleas to study
business kicked in. His family had owned the truck fleet Pike Trailer
Co. for 96 years, and Pike ran it for four years after his father
retired. With a degree in business management, he began opening
nightclubs in 1989. When he and partner Kevin Barry opened Sangria in
'95, it was just before an overhaul of Hermosa Beach's downtown,
which resulted in additional parking, a new Beach House hotel and a
walking promenade that extends to the pier. Sangria was an instant
hit, and dozens of places have opened since.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time Sangria opened, the way-cool blues club Cafe
Boogaloo debuted. Its owner, Steve Roberts, is a local legend,
apparently the best bartender around. The down-home cooking and
touring blues acts quickly made it a favorite Hermosa club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After hanging out on Sangria's patio a spell, Pike and I go on a
walking tour of the action.</TE>
<TE>   Sangria's Pier Avenue neighbors include the equally popular Aloha
Sharkeez, a jumpin' spot that, as with Sangria, people start lining
up for by 10 p.m. We walk past the Lighthouse, where a Sublime cover
band is singing "April 29, 1992" to a foot-stomping crowd. Once a
jazz club, the Lighthouse still has a jazz brunch on Sundays and
entertainment nightly, including karaoke on Mondays and reggae on
Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   The nearby bars include Patrick Malloy's and, on the Strand, two
old-school favorites: the Mermaid and the Poop Deck. The Poop Deck is
a dive's dive, and the Mermaid represents old Hermosa. It's been
there 50 years, and little has changed. There are also the Beach
Club, Brewski's, Hennessey's Tavern, Fat Face Fenner's Fishack and
one of Hermosa's fixtures, the Comedy &amp; Magic Club, where Jay Leno
still fine-tunes his act on Sundays. The sushi places get raucous
too; among the favorites are Paradise Sushi, Club Sushi, Sushi Sei
and California Beach Sushi.</TE>
<TE>   We make our way to Cafe Boogaloo just in time to hear Deborah
Coleman sing the blues, and the Virginia singer is as good as they
come. The club is packed with music fans and the smell of Cajun food.
We continue walking down Hermosa Avenue, where we find more locals
hanging at Dano's Beach Grill, Besties, T.J. Charly'z and Ein
Stein's, all revealing Hermosa Beach hasn't lost its edge. The
birthplace of such punk bands as Black Flag, the Circle Jerks and
Pennywise, Hermosa Beach still has plenty of 'tude. If you're looking
for the Dickies-wearing, chain-swinging, tattooed set, you might want
to try Besties on a Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   We amble along Pier Avenue and end up at Los Muchachos, a Mexican
restaurant owned by Pike, Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge and pro
volleyball players Jeff Bellandi and Eric Fonoimoana. The simple
eatery is another reminder of why Hermosa's so cool. It's got a
variety of scenes, and many places don't charge cover fees, so you
can keep cruising till you find the one that suits you.</TE>

<HD>Spam in the Sushi?</HD>
<DH>The menu at Shakas samples some of the distinctive tastes
that Hawaii lends the cuisine of the Pacific Rim</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody ever complains that Hawaiians are too formal. When you eat at
Shakas Hawaiian Food, everything comes in a foam takeout carton, even
if you didn't order it to go.</LD>
<LD>   Shakas actually has a nice little dining room, though. One wall is
attractively covered with woven matting and another features a couple
of ancient Hawaiian-style tchotchkes, such as a spear and a king's
helmet. A third wall is dominated by a panel of empty Spam cans, in
tribute to the 50th state's enduring affection for that convenient
canned pork product.</LD>
<LD>   Shakas provides food for thought about the whole Pacific Rim
concept. At your table, you'll find two kinds of soy sauce, hot
sauces from Mexico, the U.S. and Vietnam, and a shaker of Japanese
hot spices. In your foam carton is Hawaiian Local Food, a
street-level fusion cuisine mixing American, Chinese, Japanese,
Korean and native Hawaiian elements.</LD>
<TE>   The traditional Hawaiian part is represented by lau lau and kalua.
A lau lau is a hunk of pork wrapped in edible greens, then in an
inedible leaf, then steamed. The result is a hearty but rather plain
dish that a lot of Shakas' customers order with a tiny side dish of
raw salmon (lomi) for 60 cents extra. Kalua is much more to a
mainlander's taste. It's pork cooked for six hours and shredded,
coming out meaty and a bit smoky. In fact, it's rather like Southern
pulled pork, except that comes on rice, without barbecue sauce. If
you feel the lack of sauce, order a side of Chinese chicken salad ($1
extra) and mix its dressing--which is not the usual Chinese chicken
salad dressing but the reddish American-style "French" dressing--with
one of the table hot sauces, and you'll have something like barbecue
sauce to put on your pork.</TE>
<TE>   The chicken salad is interesting on its own. It consists of bits
of fried chicken tossed with romaine and sprinkled with toasted
sesame, with wonton chips for croutons, and you can get it as a main
dish if you want. If you don't order the chicken salad as a side,
nearly every dish here comes with a sort of Japanese cabbage salad
(tsukemono) with a hint of fish sauce and a bland, rather oily
macaroni salad, which you might love if you grew up on it.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the menu is largely Japanese, and not the usual sushi
stuff (there's one hand roll here, but it's made with Spam). Sesame
chicken is fried chunks sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Chicken
katsu is fried in a crunchy breadcrumb crust, and you can also get it
with a thick curry sauce--the mild, sweetish Japanese sort of curry,
dominated by the maple-like scent of fenugreek. And then there's
chicken curry, which is stewed in the same sauce with onions and
potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Rather sweet teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef are available too,
as is a classic Hawaiian teri burger with lettuce, tomato and mayo.
Shakas also makes a good, juicy version of kalbi, the Korean grilled
short ribs in a teriyaki-like sauce.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things, loco moco, sounds a little over the
top--it's a big ground beef patty topped with brown gravy and a fried
egg. In fact, it is a little over the top but irresistible. If you
want a kaleidoscopic Hawaiian-type fusion experience, you can order
the Shaka plate: sesame chicken wings, teriyaki beef, Chinese chicken
salad, macaroni and Spam musubi (the aforementioned Spam hand roll).</TE>
<TE>   There are also a couple of rice bowls, including one topped with
fried pork wontons (gyoza), which have their own little cup of spicy
dipping sauce on the side. Noodles (corkscrew saimin, spaghetti-like
udon) come in big porcelain bowls--the only nonplastic food
containers here--in a salty, flavorful bonito broth with various
toppings. Spam, it turns out, becomes rather juicy in soup.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert is shaved ice, piled so high it looks like Don King's
hair. With some of the jollier-colored syrups (say, blue raspberry
and orange-passion fruit--they'll split flavors if you ask), it bears
a haunting resemblance to the rainbow Afro wigs that people wear at
sports events. Shakas' very name has a sporty note of jovial
enthusiasm--it's Hawaiian slang that could be translated, "Way
excellent, dude."</TE>

<HD>As They Liked It</HD>
<DH>The first Shakespeare fans saw his works outdoors. Now's
your chance to see them as intended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILLARY JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four hundred years ago, they were called "groundlings": those who
paid a penny to sit or stand on the bare patch of ground around the
stage in open-air theaters like the Globe, where William
Shakespeare's works were first performed. The groundlings cheered and
jeered, throwing fruit when displeased and hooting at every risque
line, providing a solid laugh track for the amusement of the
better-heeled patrons in the upper galleries.</LD>
<LD>   Incredible as it may seem, the Elizabethan working man's idea of a
good time still plays, and Shakespeare productions are nearly as
common throughout the biosphere as reruns of "I Love Lucy."
Latter-day groundlings can find the same toothsome entertainment our
lowbrow ancestors did at any number of outdoor Shakespeare festivals
around L.A., being produced in much the same spirit as the original.
Productions range from the modern ("All's Well That Ends Well" set to
the music of Kool and the Gang, anyone?) to the "authentic" (read: no
lights, no mikes, and scenery design by Mother Nature).</LD>
<TE>   "The best Shakespeare in Los Angeles has not been the highfalutin,
British-directed productions at the Ahmanson," says Miranda
Johnson-Haddad, a visiting lecturer at UCLA who moved here three
years ago from Washington, D.C., where she was a fellow at the Folger
Shakespeare Library. Instead, she says, it's the smaller companies
whose shoestring efforts come closest to re-creating the Elizabethan
elan. "I saw the best 'As You Like It' I've ever seen at the Actors'
Co-op--and I've seen a lot of them," she says. "But I think to judge
by the sheer variety and number of productions, Southern California
is leading the way. I'm very impressed."</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare by the Sea, for one, has been drawing hundreds to free
outdoor shows around San Pedro for five years. Its simple, low-budget
productions stay true to the tradition of frisky entertainment for
the masses. "A good three-quarters of our audience has never seen
theater before," explains artistic director Lisa Coffi, an energetic
young woman who sounds more like Moon Unit Zappa than Alistair Cooke.
"The most common bit of feedback I get is, 'My friend dragged me down
here. I thought it would be boring, but this is fantastic!' "</TE>
<TE>   The common element among outdoor productions seems to be that in a
relaxed, recreational setting, the line between audience and actors
grows permeable. Whether you're picnicking on the grounds of a winery
in Santa Barbara, or sitting on a chunk of concrete in downtown Los
Angeles, anything can happen.</TE>
<TE>   During one production of "The Taming of the Shrew," for instance,
actress Marika Betz would hum an Elizabethan ditty while moving props
between acts. The stage manager asked her sub in "Happy Birthday" one
night to surprise an audience member picnicking with his extended
family. "The gentleman's party caught on and started to laugh, and
pretty soon the whole audience was in on it," Betz says. She got so
caught up in her goofy performance that at the end of the song,
instead of jumping off stage as planned, she turned and jumped
face-first into a wall. "I tell you, all the acting I did as Lady
Macbeth that season couldn't hold a candle to that one pratfall."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of playful, interactive atmosphere is simply more likely
"when you're lying around on a blanket, eating and drinking wine,"
says Betz, who will play Lady Capulet in Shakespeare Festival/LA's
production of "Romeo and Juliet" in Pershing Square this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Butler, who plays Benvolio in the same production, claims to
have discovered proof that Shakespeare is best performed out of doors
when he was working with an Illinois company that performed either
indoors or out, depending on the weather. "The audience left the
indoor theater saying, 'Well, that was a good play,' but they came
out of the outdoor performance saying, 'Wow, that was a great
experience.' "</TE>
<TE>   There are pitfalls to outdoor performance, to be sure. "Being
dive-bombed on stage by giant beetles" is one experience Butler
lists. Patrons at the Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival in Thousand Oaks
once got doused by sprinklers. But nature can add immeasurable magic
to the experience, as well. Betz remembers a particular "Macbeth"
staged in the Arboretum at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   "First, there's the mythology that the play itself is haunted, and
then there's the imagery of the play, which is full of references to
night birds," she says. "So we're about to do this scene where Lady
Macbeth confronts her husband about his doubts over killing Duncan,
and this huge owl swoops in and lands in a tree right above our heads
and watches us. Lady Macbeth says the line, 'It was the owl that
shrieked, the fatal bellman, which gives the stern'st goodnight.'
Then the owl flies away just as the scene ends." The audience went
crazy over the bird's impromptu--and non-union--performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Only nature is big enough to contain Shakespeare," insists Ellen
Geer, director of Topanga's Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum. The
theater was founded by her late father as an artistic haven for
fellow blacklisted actors, and Ellen Geer literally grew up in it,
steeped in Shakespeare and nature. "Indoors," she says, "the language
is larger than the stage."</TE>
<TE>   In Shakespeare's day, that rich language served a specific
purpose: Without elaborate scenery or lighting, the actors' words had
to create the setting. When Juliet talks about the moon, she's
telling the afternoon audience that the scene is supposed to take
place at night. This ploy still works, making the plays remarkably
portable and easy to put on anywhere, any time, with minimal fuss.</TE>
<TE>   On a warm Sunday afternoon, some 400 years after "The Merchant of
Venice" had its world premiere at the Old Globe Theatre in London,
Geer's company performs an elegantly spare 21st century version. The
theater space is a vernal fairyland, carved out of a steep-sided dell
high in the canyon. Rows of wood and concrete bench seats climb one
hillside, shaded by trees and a mesh canopy, while a wooden stage
nestles into the opposite hillside amid the oaks, ferns and grasses.
Hose-and-doublet-clad actors enter and exit through wooded paths or
the narrow footbridges over a meandering creek bed. Other than the
occasional roar of a jet overhead, you could fancy yourself to be
watching theater in any era of history.</TE>
<TE>   But Geer's version of the age-old conflict between Shylock the
Jewish moneylender and Antonio the Christian merchant speaks bitingly
of contemporary problems: It could be a story about the conflict in
Israel--with Shylock ironically occupying the Palestinians' position
in the drama.</TE>
<TE>   It reminds us that Shakespeare's work remains popular because it
is magnificently durable in every sense. Most of the plays were based
on well-known tales from Chaucer, ancient Greece, Scotland and
medieval Italian folklore. (The history plays are now the least
performed.) His storytelling style, so equally inclusive of the
natural world and the human soul, made each story a perfect microcosm
of the human comedy. "The Merchant of Venice," "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," "The Tempest," "The Taming of the Shrew"--it's these
mythological works that persist most heartily, like flowers growing
through cracks in an urban sidewalk. The comedies, and to a lesser
extent the tragedies--"Hamlet," "Macbeth" and "King Lear"--are the
ones that crop up over and over in summer repertoires, each new shoot
as hearty and eager to succeed as the last.</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare's popular plays have proven so sturdy and pliable a
base that some directors go a bit crazy with high-concept
interpretations--and because Shakespeare himself borrowed freely in
his own work, he would no doubt have approved. Doing Shakespeare in
modern dress has become quite old hat, and the movies abound with
radical reinventions, such as the recent "O" (referring to "Othello,"
not Oprah) set in a high school, or "Scotland, PA," which set Macbeth
in the world of fast food. Taking "concept" Shakespeare to an
irreverent extreme, the Culver City Public Theatre is mounting the
West Coast premiere of "Shakespeare's Skums," the better-known plays
turned into comic one-acts such as a sitcom-styled "Leave It to
Hamlet."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the theatrical spectrum, Shakespeare can also
survive, even thrive, when decked out with more bright lights than a
Las Vegas revue. The Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival in Thousand Oaks
builds an elaborate outdoor thrust stage every season and spares no
effort in putting together a really, really big show. The Kingsmen
rely quite a bit on the visual spectacle of costumes and sets in
mounting Shakespeare's final play, "The Tempest," commissioning an
original score and giving the play a turn-of-the-20th-century
industrial setting.</TE>
<TE>   Mind you, high-production values don't guarantee immunity from the
odd, spontaneous mishap: One night, a Kingsmen production of
"Midsummer Night's Dream" was interrupted by a power outage when a
local transformer blew. "We rustled up as many flashlights and
lanterns as we could find," remembers company co-founder Michael
Arndt, "and the actors finished the play under these eerie, roving
lights. It was an absolutely magical event that people who were there
still talk about."</TE>
<TE>   Which just serves to prove that, whatever happens, groundlings can
still count on the Bard.</TE>

<LD>Whether you're lounging outside a Santa Barbara County vineyard, or
looking around for a newspaper to tuck under you at Pershing Square
in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, there's a plein-air Shakespeare
for nearly everyone. And every budget. Some shows are free; others
cost up to $50. Here's a guide to 10 productions in the coming
months, from Santa Barbara to San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The Globe Theatres</LD>
<TE>   Lowell Davies Festival Theater, Balboa Park, San Diego</TE>
<TE>   (619) 239-2255 www.theglobetheaters.org</TE>
<TE>   Long Tradition</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's Globe Theater hasn't been around quite as long as
London's, which opened in 1599 with "As You Like It" (and you can bet
at least one Elizabethan critic pulled out his quill and wrote: "I
didn't."). Still, with a Shakespeare tradition dating back to 1935,
the Globe is a good bet for solidly professional Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   This year's offerings in the open-air Lowell Davies Festival
Theater are "The Taming of the Shrew" directed by John Rando (Tony
winner for Broadway's "Urinetown" and director of Neil Simon's "The
Dinner Party") and the romantic adventure "Pericles: Prince of Tyre,"
directed by Globe newcomer Darko Presnjac. An Internet search turns
up no information about Presnjac (O what a tangled Web) but a Globe
spokeswoman calls him a bright young talent. If not, let us pray that
the audience does not carry on the tradition of Shakespeare's
original Globe Playhouse and communicate its displeasure by throwing
rotten tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   No nibbles allowed in the theater, but pub grub--soups, light
sandwiches, desserts--and a full bar are available within easy reach
at Lady Carolyn's. Order a picnic in advance, (619) 239-2255.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Metal seats in a three-tier amphitheater formation. Rent you a
blanket to ward off the evening chill for $3. Indoor restrooms with
disabled access. Parking is free in Balboa Park lots; trams shuttle
passengers to the Globe complex.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "The Taming of the Shrew," Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends
Aug. 4. "Pericles," Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., Aug. 25 through
Oct. 6. $15 to $50. Discounts for students, seniors and active
military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   Fess Parker Winery, 6200 Foxen Canyon Road, Los Olivos</TE>
<TE>   (805) 231-5088</TE>
<TE>   www.shakes-sb.com</TE>
<TE>   New Vintage</TE>
<TE>   Another "Midsummer Night's Dream"--well, what were you expecting
in August, "The Winter's Tale"? But you couldn't ask for a more
appropriate setting than a winery near bucolic Santa Barbara for this
oft-performed story of young lovers drunk with passion. Company
artistic director Jennifer Johnson, a native of Northern California
wine country, decided to plant her professional roots in a similarly
intoxicating locale. Check out the Web site; it offers both a cast
list and a wine list.</TE>
<TE>   According to the latter, the 1999 Syrah is savory and flavorful,
with an "open-knit style" and broad appeal. It's less easy to rate
the appeal of this "Dream"--set in a fictional neoclassical
Greece--since the Shakespeare Santa Barbara company has not had time
to age properly; this summer marks the company's first festival. But
with a cast of professional actors and a backdrop of the Santa Ynez
Mountains, 2002 could be a very good year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Bring your own eats (but not your own wine) or pre-order a $21
"Midsummer's Night"-themed dinner at the Web site. Choose among the
Lysander, a grilled sandwich with rosemary-roasted chicken; Titania's
Delight, pan-seared Pacific salmon and grilled asparagus; and Puck's
Garden Supper, a spring vegetable salad with yellow lentils. Wine is
available for purchase, and tours and tastings are available before 5
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Seating is on the lawn, with accommodations for elderly and
disabled patrons. Bring blankets, low chairs and hats to deflect the
late afternoon sun. Indoor restrooms. Free on-site parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Fridays through Sundays, 6 p.m., Aug.
9 through Sept. 1. $20; students and seniors, $15; under 12, $11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troubadour Theater Company</TE>
<TE>   Miles Memorial Playhouse,</TE>
<TE>   Reed Park, 1130 Lincoln Blvd.,</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica, (213) 303-0096</TE>
<TE>   www.troubie.com</TE>
<TE>   Quick and Easy</TE>
<TE>   It ends kool, and it ends fast: Director Matt Walker crashes
through "All's Kool That Ends Kool," a takeoff on the comedy "All's
Well That Ends Well," in a breathtaking 75 minutes--stoking the disco
inferno with classics by Kool and the Gang ("Jungle Boogie,"
"Celebration.") "All's Kool" continues this professional troupe's
tradition of desecrating Shakespeare to contemporary pop music;
previous titles include "Twelfth Dog Night" and "A Midsummer Saturday
Night's Fever Dream." This season's production features big dance
numbers, a big chorus, a five-piece band and wacky eye-candy
costumes. But, says one enthusiastic company member, "Anybody who
honestly wants to hear the real Shakespeare text will not want to see
this show."</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   No food on site, but within a few blocks are Montana Avenue and
the Third Street Promenade. Restaurants also dot Lincoln and Wilshire
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Reed Park has grounds for picnicking under trees, plus
recreational equipment for kids. Theater has restrooms available.
Street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "All's Kool That Ends Kool," Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Aug. 2
through 31. $15; $10 for age 14 and younger. Also at the Ojai
Shakespeare Festival, Aug. 3 and 4 at 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Will Geer Theatricum</TE>
<TE>   Botanicum</TE>
<TE>   1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga Canyon, (310) 455-3723</TE>
<TE>   www.theatricum.com</TE>
<TE>   Faerie Land in Topanga</TE>
<TE>   Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your earmuffs. That is to
say, bring a sweater to the Theatricum Botanicum--which wins the
prize for the most obscure way of saying "outdoor theater"--where
evenings can verychillybecum during five acts of Shakespearicum (and
bring a cushion for your bottomicum). However, for those who are
properly attired, this amphitheater tucked into a rustic glen becomes
a magical, mystical faerie land, especially at night. This summer's
plays are a fast-paced, conversational "The Merchant of Venice,"
directed by Ellen Geer (Will's daughter) and, you guessed it, "A
Midsummer Night's Dream."</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Have an alfresco feast before or after the show at the picnic
tables on the Theatricum property or grab a light snack--salads,
sandwiches, chips--from the Botanicum Cafe. Munching during
performances is verboten, so as not to stir local bees, which have
been known to buzz their way into plays.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Wood benches in the bottom half of the amphitheater and concrete
seats in the upper half, shielded from the sun by a fine mesh canopy.
Dress warmly for evening performances. Indoor restrooms. Parking is
$3 on the grounds, free for seniors and disabled patrons. Ample free
parking on Topanga Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "The Merchant of Venice," Sundays, 4 p.m., now through Sept. 29.
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" opens Sept. 2 at 6 p.m.; Sept. 6, 7, 13,
14, 21 and 28 at 8 p.m. Also Oct. 6, 13 and 20 at 3 p.m. $11-$22. Age
7 to 13, $8; under 6, free.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival</TE>
<TE>   Kingsmen Park, Cal Lutheran</TE>
<TE>   60 W. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   (805) 493-3455 www.kingsmenshakespeare.org</TE>
<TE>   Deal of the Century</TE>
<TE>   How can you not get your money's worth when the performance is
free? And given its positive track record with the critics, the
Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival is the deal of the 17th century.
Started in 1997 and co-produced by the Kingsmen Shakespeare Company
and Cal Lutheran, the festival sets this year's "The Tempest" (circa
1611) in the Industrial Age and its "Much Ado About Nothing" in the
flapper era. Artistic director Michael Arndt has always been fond of
Shakespearean time travel and received positive reviews for such
experiments as 2000's "Romeo and Juliet," set in strife-torn Ireland
in the early 19th century. Actor Lane Davies--former soap opera star
("Santa Barbara") and a company co-founder--will portray Prospero in
"Tempest," reconceived as a reclusive scholar rather than the usual
grandiose magician. Arndt notes, however, that magic will still
pervade this "Tempest" through numerous special effects. Resident
composer Rick Rhodes provides an original score.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Come as early as 5:30 p.m. to feast on Renaissance specialties
like broths, corn on the cob and turkey leg (as well as pizza and
kettle corn. Salads, nonalcoholic beverages and desserts are
available too. If you pack a picnic, remember that alcohol is
prohibited on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Seating is on the lawn of the campus, so bring low-profile lawn
chairs and blankets. Indoor restrooms. Ample free parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "The Tempest" runs Friday through Sunday, and July 19 through 21.
"Much Ado About Nothing" runs July 12 through 14, 26 through 28 and
Aug. 2 through 4. All performances at 8 p.m. $5; under age 18, free.
Seats in regular chairs for $10; reserved 8-foot-square "boxes," $35
to $50.</TE>

<TE>   Shakespeare by the Sea</TE>
<TE>   Fermin Park, 807 Paseo del Mar</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro, (310) 548-7705</TE>
<TE>   www.shakespearebythesea.org</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare Tour '02</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1998, Shakespeare by the Sea, which begins its
repertory season with five weeks at San Pedro's Point Fermin Park,
takes its productions to beachside parks all over the Southland. The
professional company contains both experienced Shakespearean actors
and those just breaking into the Bard business. Because of the park
locations, expect plenty of families, children and even the
occasional dog (out, damned Spot!).</TE>
<TE>   Despite the little ones, this professional troupe doesn't tinker
with Shakespeare, consistently presenting traditional productions,
set in the original time period. And, in selecting the murderous
"Macbeth" for the repertory, Shakespeare by the Sea has definitely
gone PG-13.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Pack a picnic to enjoy alfresco, or hot dogs, nachos, hot
chocolate or coffee at the concession stand.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   A 220-degree view of the ocean and the Point Fermin Lighthouse
serves a backdrop, so wear warm clothing to ward off the nippy ocean
breeze. Bench seating around the open-air band shell is available on
a first-come basis, or bring beach chairs and blankets to lay out on
the surrounding lawn. Indoor restrooms and port-a-potty facilities.
Street parking or lot on Paseo del Mar at Gaffey Street.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "Much Ado About Nothing" runs Friday, July 12, 18, 20 and Aug. 17
at 8 p.m. "Macbeth" runs Saturday, July 11, 13, 19 and Aug.16 at 8
p.m. Shakespeare by the Sea also tours regional parks July 21 through
Aug. 15, performing in Rancho Palos Verdes, Hermosa Beach, Torrance,
Wilmington, Signal Hill, Manhattan Beach and Newport Beach. Free.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Culver City Public Theatre</TE>

Culver City, (310) 712-5482</TE>

<TE>   Grassroots Comedy</TE>
<TE>   This Shakespeare in the park is really Shakespeare in the
park--performed on boards placed directly on the grass, not on a
traditional stage. "We are really channeling the spirit of Mother
Nature," observes Stephen Moore, director of the 4-year-old
theatrical entity peopled with volunteer professionals. The company
concentrates on traditional classical theater--usually. But this
season, among its offerings is the West Coast premiere of
"Shakespeare's Skums," fractured versions of Shakespeare's greatest
hits: "Tag-Team Romeo and Juliet," "Leave It to Hamlet" and "Macbeth
in 20 Minutes or Less." Moore is a member of the original Shakespeare
Scum, an East Coast troupe founded in 1986. Scum artistic director
Carolyn Spedden, who wrote the mini-plays, finally allowed Moore to
license the scripts after years of pleading.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   A good location to spread your picnic wares on the lawn, as the
site has only a minimal concessions stand offering baked goods, soda
and water.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Lawn seating only, in a shaded patch under two Chinese elms. Bring
blankets, lounge chairs and jackets. Outdoor restrooms. Street
parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "Shakespeare's Skums," July 20, 21, 27 and 28, at 2 p.m. Free.</TE>

<TE>   Shakespeare Festival/LA</TE>
<TE>   Pershing Square, 532 S. Olive St., downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   South Coast Botanic Garden, 26300 Crenshaw Blvd.,</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes</TE>

<TE>   www.shakespearefestivalla.org</TE>
<TE>   Love Among the Skyscrapers</TE>
<TE>   (and Succulents)</TE>
<TE>   For this highly regarded professional company, which visits
hard-edged urban settings as often as woodsy idylls, a more apt
descriptive phrase might be "Shakespeare in the parking lot."
Site-specific performances include a 1997 "Julius Caesar" on the
steps of Los Angeles City Hall and last summer's "The Comedy of
Errors" at Pershing Square. And this year, wherefore art Romeo and
Juliet? Back at Pershing Square. In Shakespeare Festival/LA's take on
the tragic love story, the scene is a modern city, with references to
rival record labels in the competitive music industry. The
underground rock band Lava Diva surfaces to provide an original music
score.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Bring your own picnic nibbles to both locations. Candy, soda and
popcorn are sold in Pershing Square; for the Botanic Garden shows,
three dinner specials from Marie Callender's featuring roasted turkey
breast or vegetarian sandwiches, pasta salad, a fruit and a slice of
pie, can be pre-ordered online.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Lawn seating at both locations, so bring chairs, blankets and
jackets. For the Pershing Square performances, reserved seating is
available for patrons who join the Shakespeare Festival/LA Guild in
advance, by logging on to the troupe's Web site. Outdoor restrooms
are available in both locations. Parking beneath Pershing Square, $6.
Free parking at the Botanic Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "Romeo and Juliet" runs Friday through July 20 (except Mondays) at
8 p.m. in Pershing Square. Free with donation of canned food. Also
July 25 through Aug. 4 (except July 29, 30), at 8:15 p.m., at the
South Coast Botanic Garden. $15 in advance; $18 at the door.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ojai Shakespeare Festival</TE>
<TE>   Libbey Bowl, Ojai Avenue at Signal Street, Ojai, (805) 646-9455</TE>
<TE>   www.ojaishakespeare.org</TE>
<TE>   Magic Moments</TE>
<TE>   Watch for the Ojai "pink moment." Locals say that each evening, 10
minutes after the sun sets behind the Topa Topa Mountains, the sky
flashes a heavenly pink glow. Nights are warm in this charming town
of shops and cafes, perfect for strolling before Shakespeare at the
Libbey Bowl, a picturesque amphitheater beneath a spreading canopy of
old oak trees ... heck, who cares if the performance is good?</TE>
<TE>   But this , family-oriented festival is celebrating its 20th
anniversary, so it must be doing something right. This year's plays
are "Twelfth Night" and "The Tempest," paired, in part, because both
stories involve shipwrecks, so no sea change is required of the set.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   Renaissance-style grub--with a choice of vegetarian fare (hail,
Caesar salad), meats and the requisite turkey legs--are available on
weekend afternoons, Aug. 3 through 18.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Wood benches stacked under a canopy of ancient oaks. Bring jackets
and blankets. Seat cushions can be rented at the box office. Indoor
restrooms. Free street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "Twelfth Night" opens July 27 at 8 p.m. and runs July 28, Aug. 2,
3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18. "The Tempest," performed by the
troupe's high school interns, opens Aug. 1 at 8 p.m., and runs Aug.
3, 4, 10, 11 and 17 at 4 p.m. and Aug. 8 and 15 at 8 p.m. $8 to $18.
Discounts available for seniors, students. Age 12 and younger, free.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Shakespeare Festival</TE>
<TE>   Stearns Park, Argonne Avenue at 23rd Street, Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   (562) 997-1494 www.bardintheyard.com</TE>
<TE>   Mixing It Up</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Shakespeare Company (formerly Bard in the Yard) rolls
into Stearns Park on Friday to set up a two-story stage; after Sunday
in the Park With Will, the company tears it all down again. A lot of
work goes into these free performances by a mix of professional and
nonprofessional actors. The 4-year-old Long Beach group offers one
comedy and one tragedy or history each season. This time around the
tragedy is "Othello," with Jonathan Scott in the title role, and the
comedy is "Love's Labour's Lost," featuring Rod Weber, a member of
the national touring company of "The Full Monty." For those who want
to brush up on their Shakespeare prior to the performances, company
members will provide a workshop at Border's Books (2110 Bellflower
Blvd., Long Beach) at 7 p.m. on July 11.</TE>
<TE>   Food</TE>
<TE>   If you fancy more than candy and soda from Costco, which is what
the minimal concessions stand offers, bring a picnic.</TE>
<TE>   Amenities</TE>
<TE>   Lawn seating or bring your own chairs and blankets. Port-a-potties
in the park. Free street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets</TE>
<TE>   "Othello," Saturdays and Sundays, 5 p.m., through July 14; "Love's
Labour's Lost," Saturdays and Sundays, 5 p.m., July 20 through Aug.
4. Free.</TE>

<LD>   On the Way to the Post Office: My life revolves around errands. A
big day out for me is going down to my P.O. box in Boyle Heights.
Sometimes, on the way there, I will get a pan dulce at a bakery in
Pico Rivera. There's La Imperial Tortilleria y Mercado on 1st Street
in Boyle Heights, which has carnitas tacos, which are real big, like
double stuffed. I usually get two tacos and that's enough for two
hungry cholos. And I buy corn tortillas there which are thicker than
78s. Also, around my P.O. box, I go get breakfast at Teresitas Family
Restaurant, which is also on 1st. It's kind of like low-budget,
gourmet food.</LD>
<LD>   Your Own Personal Dinosaur: We are members of the Natural History
Museum, and we have two little kids and my wife is a schoolteacher,
so we are always borrowing artifacts from the lending library.
Members and teachers can borrow stuff and you can keep them for five
days. Last week, we were walking around Exposition Park with a cast
of half of a jaw of a T. rex with giant teeth. They have all kinds of
cool reproductions there and stuffed animals.</LD>
<TE>   Sofa U Love: I like the Groundlings, the late-night shows and the
improv stuff. I took a comedy class there once a few years ago. The
funniest thing I've ever seen there was Chris Kattan doing this skit,
which I later saw on "Saturday Night Live," of a guy making love to a
couch. It was about this guy on a date and at the time, I was on an
extremely awkward date.</TE>
<TE>   Thai Malt Liquor: I go to the Havana House in Uptown Whittier on
Greenleaf all the time to smoke cigars and drink beer. It's
definitely about 80% guys. They have music there, too; I saw a salsa
band that was very good. It's across the street from an excellent
Burmese and Thai restaurant, Golden Triangle. I go there and have the
coconut rice and Singha, the Thai malt liquor.</TE>

<HD>Guitarist Dori Caymmi Displays a Few of His Hyphenated
Skills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Pisano's Tuesday night guitar sessions at Spazio in Sherman Oaks
almost always offer memorable musical moments. But this past
Tuesday's performance, which featured Pisano with Brazilian guitarist
Dori Caymmi, bassist Tom Warrington and drummer Mike Shapiro, was a
particularly special occasion.</LD>
<LD>   What made it so was the presence of Caymmi, who is one of the
Southland's musical treasures. The veteran musician, a true hyphenate
whose various disciplines include superb guitar work, singing,
songwriting, arranging, producing and composing, has lived in Los
Angeles since he moved here from his native Rio in the '80s.</LD>
<LD>   The evening's most entrancing moments arrived when Caymmi took the
stage as a solo artist, spontaneously cruising through a collection
of tunes ranging from familiar Antonio Carlos Jobim items to Cole
Porter's "I've Got You Under My Skin," George Harrison's "Something"
and the Ary Barroso South American classic "Aquarela do Brasil" (the
latter numbers performed with the full ensemble).</LD>
<TE>   His voice is an extraordinarily communicative instrument, filled
with darkly layered textures of sound, pliantly moving across
dramatically timed phrases, interacting with his guitar in a fashion
reminiscent of the remarkable voice and guitar patterns of bossa nova
founder Joao Gilberto.</TE>
<TE>   His guitar work was equally impressive, employing altered string
tunings to produce chords that were voiced in a way that brought a
virtually new identity to the most familiar harmonic patterns. Add to
that his imaginative arranging skill: In "Something," for example, he
virtually deconstructed the song into its component pieces before
reassembling it into a tropical expression that surely would have
fascinated Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in short, yet another marvelous evening in Pisano's
continuing guitar night presentations. It was also a reminder that,
in Caymmi, the Southland has a world-class musical talent--one
deserving of more extensive hearings.</TE>

<LD>   On Approval--Time sure flies when you're having a wry time. "On
Approval," Frederick Lonsdale's breezy, biting comedy about the
English upper classes, was revived by Pacific Resident Theatre in
honor of the play's 75th anniversary. It remains a delicious if
insubstantial confection whipped to a fine froth by director Joe
Olivieri and his deft cast. Like Noel Coward, with whom he is
sometimes compared, Lonsdale wrote about the British aristocracy from
the perspective of a low-born outsider. Wildly popular in their
heyday, Lonsdale's plays are only infrequently produced today, in
contrast to the undiminished run of Coward revivals. Perhaps that's
because Lonsdale's dialogue is less showy than Coward's campy
exchanges. However, with its combination of delicacy and timing, as
in this production, "On Approval" endures, if only as a pleasant and
purely escapist diversion.</LD>

<LD>   Peace in Our Land: Children Celebrating Diversity. Bonny Hull.
Kids Creative Classics/BrassHeart Music. Book and cassette: $11. Ages
5 to 10. www.brassheartmusic.com/ or www.amazon.com/</LD>
<LD>   Singer-songwriter Bunny Hull, whose film and TV credits are
stellar and lengthy, has written for and/or sung with Ricky Martin,
Celine Dion and Quincy Jones, among many others. She has more than 20
gold and platinum albums to her credit, and won the Grammy for her
song "New Attitude," performed by Patti LaBelle. So it's not
surprising that there's not a cutesy lyric or cloying note in her
feel-good album and book for children.</LD>
<TE>   Hull's big, joyful sound infuses this child-centric but
adult-pleasing celebration of peace with a message summed up in the
second track, "A World of Difference": "We are one in a world of
difference; we are one in a world of love."</TE>
<TE>   The cassette is accompanied by a coloring book illustrated by
award-winning artist Synthia Saint James (creator of the Kwanzaa
postal stamp), with activities, song lyrics and Hull's story "The
Truth About Friendship," narrated by actress Elayn J. Taylor.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humor is a funny thing. What sends one person on a laughing jag might
not elicit even the trace of a grin from the person sitting next to
him. Case in point: Martin McDonagh's "The Lonesome West," in its
earnest if less than ideal Los Angeles premiere at An Claidheamh
Soluis/The Celtic Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," "A Skull in Connemara," "The
Lonesome West" and "The Cripple of Inishmaan," McDonagh--the
English-born son of Irish parents--has spun larger-than-life tales in
which fake-rustic Irish characters natter at one another in a
fake-rustic Irish dialect. The work has earned him comparisons to
J.M. Synge and Sean O'Casey, but it has also left a lot of people
scratching their heads.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lonesome West" is set in Leenane, in western Ireland's County
Galway. Several recent deaths there have come violently, at the hands
of family members, causing the parish priest to lament, "It seems
like God has no jurisdiction in this town."</LD>
<TE>   An outward show of religion is made in the Connor household, where
a crucifix hangs above the mantelpiece. So does a shotgun, which, in
the hands of one of the Connor sons, took the life of the family
patriarch. It seems destined for reuse as Father Welsh (Jason McCune)
pays a post-funeral visit to squabbling Coleman (John McKenna) and
Valene (Steve Gunning).</TE>
<TE>   Much of the action is given over to the brothers' bellowed games
of one-upmanship. McDonagh half-heartedly tries to inject some
meaning by having the priest say, "If it's your own brother you can't
get on with, how can we ever hope for peace in the world?" But
mostly, this is just one big joke.</TE>
<TE>   In McCune, the production has an endearingly well-intentioned if
pathetically ineffectual Father Welsh. As the snowy-haired brothers,
however, McKenna and Gunning only intermittently hit the peaks of
rage the script demands of them. Their wrestling matches look
unconvincing, and director Thom MacNamara has yet to coach them past
the hesitancy that hamstrings their rush toward the climactic moment
of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lonesome West," An Claidheamh Soluis/The Celtic Arts Center,
4843 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Valley Village. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.;
Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends July 28. $15. (818) 760-8322. Running time: 2
hours.</TE>

<HD>'Animal Farm' as Petting Zoo</HD>
<DH>In Topanga, Orwell's satire is a family-friendly work,
wittily staged</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Four legs good, two legs bad."</LD>
<LD>   No, it's not the latest PETA campaign slogan. This axiom is the
essential tenet emerging from "Animal Farm," the second offering of
the 2002 summer season at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in
Topanga.</LD>
<LD>   Sir Peter Hall's 1984 National Theatre adaptation, the sole
version sanctioned by George Orwell's estate for live performance,
faithfully adheres to the action of the deathless 1945 allegorical
satire on totalitarianism. This commences with the ousting of
tyrannical farmer Mr. Jones (Thad Geer) by the beasts he has long
overburdened. These barnyard denizens freely verbalize without the
slightest concern about suspension of disbelief, not to mention
Bolshevik analogy, as the Russian Revolution and its aftermath form
the author's original template. Thus, sage pig Old Major (Steve
Matt)--whose expository observations on man's inhumanity to animal
inspire the rebellion that follows his peaceful demise--is Orwell's
Lenin.</LD>
<TE>   His Trotsky is the idealistic pig Snowball (Melora Marshall), who,
along with fellow porcine leaders Squealer (Aaron Hendry) and
Napoleon (Jim LeFebvre), initiates an intentional community based
upon the precepts of "animalism." The boorish boar Napoleon gradually
emerges as despot, his bloody rise to power on the trotters of
propaganda mirroring that of Stalin. By the finale, the formerly
oppressed have become indistinguishable from their former oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   Orwell's vision has never seemed more pertinent, and director
Ellen Geer revels in witty allusions to everything from a chicken's
right to choose to anthropomorphous spin doctors. Her engaging
staging uses every verdant corner of the incomparable venue, aided by
designs recalling summer camp extravaganzas, with Terry Hunter's
costumes utterly (and in the case of the cows, udderly) delightful.
They clothe the deft maneuvers of an able ensemble, occasionally
wavering in voice but consistently invested. Marshall's
gender-switched Snowball lends a wry feminist aspect to the conflict
with LeFebvre's raucous villain, and Hendry's oily yes-pig recalls
countless obsequious turncoats past and present.</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts include the equine contingency of Tom Allard's
priceless Boxer, Ernestine Phillips' heartfelt Clover and Willow
Geer-Alsop's winsome Mollie. Melissa Thatcher's nonstop kinetic
energy enlivens goat Muriel; Jeff Wiesen's droll self-importance
tickles as porker-laureate Minimus; and Justin Doran's gravel-voiced
donkey Benjamin is brilliant, his climactic hysteria producing the
single most chilling moment.</TE>
<TE>   That this unnerving peak is an isolated one seems the production's
chief drawback, the darkness seldom registering as incisively as does
the whimsy. This certainly applies to Richard Peaslee and Adrian
Mitchell's innocuous, tension-diffusing songs, for all of musical
director Louis Durra's expert stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor is the narration by youngsters Kellen McDaniel and
Jessamyn Sheldon (alternating with Ian Durra and Anna Press), whose
erratic miking and singsong delivery soften the impact. Still, though
it is bemusing to witness "Animal Farm" succeed more fully as family
entertainment than unsettling diatribe, given the pleasure this
production generates, it seems swinish to complain.</TE>
<TE>   "Animal Farm," Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd.,
Topanga. Saturdays, 8 p.m., through July 20; Sundays, 7:30 p.m.,
through July 28. Also Sept. 29. Saturdays, 4 p.m., Aug. 3 through

<LD>The summer's most popular movie character, Spider-Man, is packing in
crowds at Universal Studios Hollywood. Unfortunately, the park's
"Spider-Man Rocks!" show doesn't come close to providing the thrills,
drama or entertainment of the hit Sam Raimi film.</LD>
<LD>   Universal bills this as "an explosive rock 'n' roll stunt show."
But the stunts aren't as entertaining as the park's old western show,
nor are the effects as impressive as those at Universal's ongoing
"Water World" spectacular. But it's the rock 'n' roll aspect that is
the most laughable.</LD>
<LD>   Spider-Man aficionados hoping for a live show as engaging as the
movie certainly will leave disappointed, as will theme park visitors
hoping for an experience as breathtaking as Universal's acclaimed
"Spider-Man" ride in Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   Clumsy writing and sophomoric music choices detract from the
appealing tale of Peter Parker and his secret life as a superhero.
Watching Spidey rescue Mary Jane to the tune of "Holding Out for a
Hero" induced a few winces in the crowd during a recent
standing-room-only show. Scoring the climactic battle between
Spider-Man and his nemesis, the Green Goblin, to Queen's moldy anthem
"Another One Bites the Dust" didn't help either.</TE>
<TE>   Licensing issues dictated that the Green Goblin in this production
is the old-school model from the Marvel comic books, not the
high-tech one from the recent film. Too bad. The movie Goblin, along
with selections from Danny Elfman's score, could have made this show
into something far more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   At least the talented six-person cast works hard to salvage some
entertainment value, but the performers' tireless efforts cannot
rescue this production. This musical was designed for the type of
undemanding music fans who eagerly await the Wango Tango concert each
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is somehow appropriate for a superhero who can never
win to be stuck in a theme park revue featuring music from
"Footloose" at the moment of his greatest popularity.</TE>

<LD>SeaWorld shows traditionally feature killer whales, dolphins and
other marine animals you wouldn't normally find roaming your
neighborhood. But the San Diego park's new "Pets Rule!" show turns
the spotlight on dogs, cats and other domesticated animals.</LD>
<LD>   "Pets Rule!" eschews SeaWorld's massive water tanks for a
sun-drenched outdoor set made up to look like a giant backyard. It's
an appropriate setting for this affectionate tribute. But don't
forget to pack the sunscreen. On a cloudless summer day, the aluminum
grandstands can heat this "backyard" to broiling.</LD>
<LD>   Don't expect a polished performance. Yet the unpredictable nature
of watching animals attempt new tricks is half the fun of this
production. The things that went wrong at a recent performance--from
a recalcitrant pig on an obstacle course to a dog that missed
catching his Frisbee--elicited as many chuckles and good-natured
cheers from the crowd as the successful tricks.</LD>
<TE>   SeaWorld's trainers put the show in perspective by mentioning that
some of the animals in the production were adopted from shelters
around the country. "Remember," one trainer told the crowd, "the
fantastic animals you see here today are as close as your local
animal shelter."</TE>
<TE>   And these animals deliver plenty of entertainment during this
20-minute show. Dogs jump and fetch, cats scramble, and pigs strut as
their trainers engage them all in sometimes complex, but always
amusing, choreography.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this being a SeaWorld show, the folks sitting up front
have to get wet. Without Shamu and a big water tank, a runaway hose
does the trick here. It's the climax to a gag where the audience
learns an important "pet rule": Always get the human giving you a
bath wetter than they get you.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, trainers brought many of the animals to the edge
of the stage to meet the audience. Judging from the enthusiasm of the
youngsters who crowded the stage, when it comes to making an
emotional connection to a young audience, pets do indeed rule.</TE>

<LD>Jozu Closes: After six years in business, Jozu suddenly closed its
doors Sunday. Why would such a popular restaurant pull the plug?
"Basically," says owner Andy Nakano, "my sub-lease is coming to an
end, so my partners and I have decided to close. If we were to renew
the sub-lease, it would go up 35%, which is just too much. It's time
to move on." Nakano says he has managed to place most of his
employees with restaurants around town. He's keeping a few people,
including his executive chef, Hisashi Yoshiara, to help run his
catering business. Nakano contacted loyal patrons so that they could
enjoy a last supper at Jozu, but after 8 p.m. he closed the doors to
the public and hosted a private farewell party for staff and friends.
Some people lingered at the bar chatting, while others filed out
giving Nakano long hugs and emotional farewells. Nakano plans to do

<DH>Jerzy Skolimowski's 'Deep End' is a highlight of the Mods &amp;
Rockers Festival at the Cinematheque</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The standout film in the final week of the American Cinematheque's
fourth annual Mods &amp; Rockers Festival is Jerzy Skolimowski's "Deep
End" (1970), which screens at the Egyptian on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and
which warrants extended comment as a major work not as familiar to
audiences as it deserves to be.</LD>
<LD>   Skolimowski will be present to discuss his film after its
screening.</LD>
<LD>   Like the Polish-born director's 1967 Belgian film "Le Depart," in
which Jean-Pierre Leaud discovers cars can be more important than
girls, "Deep End" deals with a youth on the brink of manhood, but
this time the hero's wryly comic encounters move from poignancy and
charm to unexpected darkness. It is a masterpiece, a picture that
freezes the smile on one's face.</LD>
<TE>   When 15-year-old Mike (John Moulder Brown) is hired as an
attendant at a huge and dingy London public bath, his instructor,
Susan (Jane Asher), is a beautiful redhead several years his senior.
Shy and sensitive, Mike is abashed by Susan's warning that the
patrons may want more than just soap and a towel and what's more,
there can be good money in accommodating them. Sure enough, Mike is
almost overwhelmed by a blowsy blond (Diana Dors).</TE>
<TE>   One day, however, Susan, who is alternately cruel and provocative,
discovers Mike is a virgin and makes a teasing pass at him only to
catapult him into a total and helpless love. Mike's passionate
pursuit of Susan is hilarious until there is a final confrontation
between innocence and corruption. For Susan, a resilient young woman
who has been embittered by poverty and indignity, is at once more
cynical and a better person than she realizes. Without uttering a
word of protest as such, Skolimowski has created an impassioned
denunciation of society's evils.</TE>
<TE>   Before its chilling moment of truth, "Deep End" is a very funny
film. The choice of that cavernous public bath, with its huge, indoor
plunge, as the film's principal setting is inspired. It lends the
story a slightly surreal quality that is echoed in Skolimowski's
highly developed sense of the ridiculous. Populated with acutely
observed, beautifully played characters, the deceptively casual "Deep
End" is full of superb comic episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Impassioned yet disciplined, Skolimowski finds the line between
comedy and tragedy very thin indeed. "Deep End" remains a high point
in his career.</TE>
<TE>   The flawed "Lord Love a Duck" (1966), which screens at 6:30
tonight at the Egyptian, is an instance of the large attempt being
worth more than the small success and remains one of the most offbeat
Hollywood movies of the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, George Axelrod had so inspired an idea in adapting Al
Hine's novel to the screen (with Larry H. Johnson) that he should not
have attempted such an ambitious project for his directorial debut.
What makes this teenage movie for adults so ambitious is that while
charting a high school girl's progress toward beach-picture stardom,
it satirizes life as it is lived in Southern California and, by
extension, exposes the crassness and shallowness of the American
dream.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this large territory, Axelrod, whose main concern is the
failure of love, zeros in on such ripe targets as sexual inhibitions
and hypocrisy, the Beverly Hills bourgeoisie, teenage tribal customs,
public school bureaucracy, parlor psychoanalysis, marriage counseling
and drive-in religion.</TE>
<TE>   The heroine is Tuesday Weld, whose every wish is made true by her
Merlin-like mentor, Roddy McDowall. At first, all she wants is a
dozen cashmere sweaters to qualify for membership in a school club
and to go to Balboa over Easter vacation, but soon demands a husband
with money and a Hollywood career.</TE>
<TE>   Using this classic picaresque plot, Axelrod succeeded in creating
wonderfully comic situations that keep snagging the underlying
sadness of the empty lives of his characters. But as a director he is
not a sufficiently experienced stylist to link them smoothly. He is
unable to manage difficult shifts in tone and fails to create enough
striking images to set off his frequently glittering dialogue. The
result is an uneven comedy that is, unfortunately, almost all talk,
with static stretches vitiating the best sequences.</TE>
<TE>   Axelrod's cast, however, is terrific. The relationship between
Weld and her cocktail waitress mother, Lola Albright, suggests the
pathos of the late Flo Aadland with her little girl Beverly, Errol
Flynn's last teenage inamorata. Martin West's unctuous husband (of
Weld) and Ruth Gordon's dragon of a mother-in-law represent the acme
of well-off vulgarity.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the Mod &amp; Rockers' offerings are swinging
London and Cold War spy thrillers. Screening Saturday at 5 p.m. is
"The Ipcress File" (1965), the first-rate film version of Len
Deighton's excellent thriller. As British army intelligence spy Harry
Palmer, Michael Caine marked the beginning of his full-fledged
international stardom. A nearsighted, bookish gourmand, Palmer is
nonetheless so sharp he could teach James Bond a trick or two--even
about women.</TE>
<TE>   Exciting, fast-paced and engrossing, "The Ipcress File" is a hip
fantasy for the entire family. In trouble for making ill-gotten money
while stationed in Berlin, Harry is rescued by Ross of army
intelligence (Guy Doleman), who needs a man of few scruples and a lot
of smarts to stop a brain drain, a series of mysterious
disappearances by top British scientists. In one of his best films,
director Sidney J. Furie develops a bold visual style with which to
express Palmer's sardonic view of the world. At its start, the film
verges on satire with a deadpan take on spying, but subtly shifts to
a more serious tone when ominous things begin to happen. The success
of "The Ipcress File" led to two more spy pictures with Caine:
"Funeral in Berlin" (1966), which screens at 7:30 p.m. and "Billion
Dollar Brain" (1967), noted for the near-surreal vision director Ken
Russell brought to it. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Double Exposure:
Photography, Film and the Cinema series is also presenting a pair of
films from the '60s: William Klein's "Who Are You, Polly Magoo?"
(1966) and "Mister Freedom" (1969), Friday at 7:30 p.m. An American
photographer and documentary and experimental filmmaker, Klein turned
to feature filmmaking in France after working as an artistic
consultant to Louis Malle on his 1960 "Zazie dans le Metro." The
first satirizes the French fashion industry and focuses on a naive
model from Brooklyn; the second is a heavy-handed satire on a freedom
fighter who looks like Superman and talks like a white supremacist
and has been dispatched to France to save the country from communist
infiltrators. Klein's feature documentaries "Muhammad Ali, the
Greatest" (1974) and "The Little Richard Story" (1980) screen
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. (323) 857-6010.</TE>

<TE>   Best left to dedicated Elvira fans: The horror comedy spoof
"Elvira's Haunted Hills" (2001), in which Elvira (Cassandra
Peterson), the poor man's Vampira, departs a Carpathian village back
in 1851 to star in a Paris revue only to be diverted by a Vincent
Price impersonator to a spooky castle, where she discovers she
possesses an exact resemblance to the creepy lord of the manor's
long-dead wife. Friday and Saturday at midnight at the Fairfax. (323)

<HD>Once an Irish Lad, Always an Irish Lad</HD>
<DH>Even after co-starring with Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell sees
no need to change his plain-spoken ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN STEWART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Colin Farrell, the Irish hunk du jour whose half-clad torso currently
graces the cover of Vanity Fair, looks a little out of character
today. The young actor, who's been described as the next Brad Pitt,
is sporting a shaved head that makes him look more like the next
Andre Agassi. And what about those filthy, flapping boots?</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, these are grubbers," says Farrell, 26, as he lovingly strokes
an instep. "I bought them secondhand for $25." A long time ago.</LD>
<LD>   "They've been resoled dozens of times. Now, just because I have
$2.5 million from 'Hart's War' I should buy new shoes?"</LD>
<TE>   Some would. But not Farrell, whose determination to remain a
plain-spoken Dubliner has already attracted attention in Hollywood.
It's not just his work, although he plays confidently with Tom Cruise
in Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report." It's his personality. And,
frankly, his liquid intake.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell sips a beer and laughs. "Everyone's latching onto this
idea that I'm an Oliver Reed in the making. I have two beers at lunch
and all of a sudden it's 'Ooh! You're a bad boy!' "</TE>
<TE>   He's not bad; he's just an Irish lad. The Vanity Fair piece was
basically a Dublin pub crawl with Farrell, marked by its subject's
fondness for a certain Anglo-Saxon word.</TE>
<TE>   "I just read it, and I thought, am I this much of a ... drunk?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, there was that day on the "Minority Report" set when Farrell
had to do 34 takes of one line.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but it wasn't the result of being lazy or lack of
preparation," he says. But he was hung over. It was the day after his
25th birthday. Besides, the line was a bad one. Farrell recites it: "
'I'm sure you understand the fundamental paradox of pre-crime
methodology.' Who is going to understand that?"</TE>
<TE>   Farrell grew up athletic with three siblings in a Dublin suburb,
and horsed around until his brother persuaded him to try drama
school. A part on the "very Oirish" soap "Ballykissangel" followed.
After "Minority Report," in which he plays an ambitious bureaucrat
named Witwer, there are three more movies this year.</TE>
<TE>   But now it's nap time. After the "Minority Report" debut party in
Manhattan, he stayed up in a little cafe to watch the Japan-South
Korea soccer match until 6 a.m. Farrell yawns, and sprawls out on his
hotel room bed, still talking.</TE>
<TE>   About Queen Elizabeth II: "God bless the old bird."</TE>
<TE>   About doing some death scenes: " ... letting death come to you,
finding your way to the stopping of your pulse."</TE>
<TE>   About his workout regimen: "Oh, God, I'd better get me hands on
something."</TE>
<TE>   Something, like Amstel and Camel lights.</TE>

<HD>President Nixon: Film Editor?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Richard Nixon, whose political career was damaged by the
editing of 18 1/2 minutes of tape, also may have been responsible for
editing a chunk out of the 1972 movie "1776."</LD>
<LD>   According to Peter H. Hunt, the director of the film and the Tony
Award-winning Broadway production it was based on, Nixon's objections
may have led producer Jack L. Warner to yank a musical number from
the film.</LD>
<LD>   Columbia TriStar Home Video has unveiled on DVD ($30) the newly
restored version of the movie musical about the founding fathers'
struggle to declare independence from England. This version
reinstates the 25 minutes that were cut.</LD>
<TE>   Some of those edits Hunt made to shorten the film. But
Warner--longtime Warner Bros. studio chief, but at this time an
independent producer--did the lion's share of the cutting. When Hunt
and writer Peter Stone met with Warner before production began, they
noticed that he "had a script that had a lot of paper clips in
it"--each one marking an objection.</TE>
<TE>   "His politics were fairly right-wing and there were things in the
script he felt strayed too far to the left," Hunt said in a recent
interview. "He was also concerned about getting a G rating."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt and Stone fought for their ideas and won most of the battles.
"But," said Hunt, "I noticed he never took the paper clips out of the
script. At the end, he congratulated me on a nice job. I was newly
married and my wife and I went off to Europe on a honeymoon. Then
Jack went in and pulled out some of the things he objected to."</TE>
<TE>   The song, "Cool, Cool, Considerate Men," a sharply written tune
about the desire of conservative Southern members of the Continental
Congress to stay under British rule, fell victim to a collision of
politics and art.</TE>
<TE>   As Hunt tells it, a few weeks before the film's release in
November 1972, Warner took a print of the film to the White House for
Nixon to see. Nixon allegedly objected to the song because it
depicted an acrimonious division in the Continental Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "We were approaching the Bicentennial," said Hunt. "Nixon was
renaming Air Force One the Spirit of '76, and he thought that this
movie could be a very helpful partner to the celebrations. I am not
sure of the whole story, but when Warner returned he told the editor
to remove the number. He also recalled all the trailers and spliced
out any reference to the number."</TE>
<TE>   Warner even ordered the negatives of the outtakes destroyed, said
Hunt, because he didn't want history to second-guess him on his
decision. But Columbia didn't destroy them. For this restoration,
which began 18 months ago, more than 550 cans of negative and audio
outtakes in the Sony vaults were inspected and all the negatives of
the cut footage were found.</TE>
<TE>   "1776" was one of the last films that Warner, who was 80 at the
time, produced. And it seems he eventually second-guessed himself,
said Hunt. "Warner did say to one of his closest friends when he was
quite ill that one of his regrets he had was listening to Nixon and
cutting that number."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Except for the spectacular, 30-minute re-creation of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor, Michael Bay's "Pearl Harbor" (2001) is pretty
much a bust. So one approaches the four-disc special-edition DVD
($40) with much trepidation. Shock of all shocks, the "Vista Series"
edition is a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   The first two discs include the director's cut plus three audio
commentary tracks. Bay and Wesleyan University film professor Jeanine
Basinger supply the main one. Recorded shortly after Sept. 11, the
two discuss those attacks and their comparison to the attack on Pearl
Harbor. Basinger, though, ladles praise on the film a bit too
heavily. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and stars Ben Affleck, Josh
Hartnett and Alec Baldwin supply the second commentary track. Affleck
and Hartnett, who recorded their comments together, are very funny.
At one point, Affleck looks at his high forehead in one scene and
tells Hartnett that it is so pronounced that he has a "six-head." A
third track includes the cinematographer, costume designer and
composer.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the second disc is a documentary on the making of the
film, complete with interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the third disc is an informative production
diary, with optional commentary from Bay dissecting important
scenes--several of which show Bay's temper getting the best of him.
The disc also features very amusing footage from the actors' boot
camp (Affleck's expression while he's eating C-rations is a hoot);
footage of the officers' boot camp Baldwin attended; two History
Channel documentaries on Pearl Harbor; and recollections of a Pearl
Harbor nurse.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth disc features an interactive attack sequence that
allows the viewer to watch the re-creation of that fateful day four
different ways: as it is seen in the film, on the set during
production, storyboard and animatics, and a composite of all those.
Bay and visual effects supervisor Eric Brevig offer on-screen
commentary that deconstructs the special effects of several scenes.
The DVD-ROM feature allows viewers access to several Internet sites
dealing with Pearl Harbor and World War II. Rounding out the final
disc is a historical timeline and still galleries.</TE>

<TE>   One of the greatest sitcoms of all time, "I Love Lucy," finally
enters the digital age this week with the release of two volumes of
episodes from the series' first season (Paramount and CBS Video, $15
each). The first features the original TV pilot, which did not air
until it was discovered in 1990, and the first three episodes of the
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz classic show. The second volume features
episodes 5-8 from the 1951-52 premiere year. Thanks to digital
remastering, the episodes look gorgeous. Each disc features the
original opening of the series, guest star information, flubs, a
behind-the-scenes photo gallery, episodes from Ball's radio series,
"My Favorite Husband," and special prologues filmed for the reruns
aired while Ball was on hiatus from the series after the birth of
Desi Jr.</TE>

<HD>Mancini Alumni Big Band Will Play Holiday Jazz Shindig</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The late songwriter Henry Mancini may be best known for ditties that
have graduated from the screen to the American songbook, with such
themes as "Peter Gunn," "Days of Wine and Roses" and "The Pink
Panther."</LD>
<LD>   But the Mancini touch went beyond just catchy tunes, bridging the
popular and jazz music worlds in a unique way. That spirit of
blending musical sophistication and melodic invention was perpetuated
by the formation of the Henry Mancini Institute, a summer education
program started by Jack Elliott in 1997. The institute is affiliated
with Elliott's American Jazz Philharmonic.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, the Henry Mancini Alumni Big Band, led by the institute's
artistic director, Patrick Williams, makes its Ventura County debut
in Ojai's Libbey Bowl. The holiday concert is being presented by Ojai
Music Festival, which just finished another of its Libbey Bowl
visitations earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   A bounty of jazz talent will be onstage, including guest vocalist
Sue Raney, as well as familiar West Coast jazz heroes such as
saxophonists Pete Christlieb and Gary Foster, trombonist Bill Watrous
and drummer Greg Fields.</TE>
<TE>   * Henry Mancini Alumni Big Band, Libbey Bowl, downtown Ojai, today
at 5:30 p.m. General admission, $15; senior citizens, $12; ages 6 to
17, $5; children 5 and younger, free. (805) 646-2053.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor Shakespeare: This summer, the Bard is coming to a park or
outdoor space near you. (See cover story on Page 6.) Last weekend,
Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival started its summer run on the green at
Cal Lutheran University, and the Ojai Shakespeare Festival begins
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this Saturday, an itinerant production of "Macbeth,"
presented by the Classics in the Park organization, begins its
movable feast to different properties in Ventura County and
southward. This "Macbeth," directed by Irene Silbert and produced by
Michael Jordan reportedly leans toward a setting akin to the
post-apocalyptic landscape of "Road Warrior." Classic 400-year-old
tragedy in park settings: Who could ask for more?</TE>
<TE>   The production's first stop is the Arts Council Center's outdoor
amphitheater in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   * "Macbeth," Arts Council Center, 482 Greenmeadow Ave., Thousand
Oaks, Saturday, 5:30 p.m. Donation. (818) 991-1207.

<TE>   Swing Thing: As it does every year, the Music Under the Stars
concert series at the Olivas Adobe heeds a stylistic agenda with a
strong bent toward Americana of various types. It's an ideally rustic
and historic setting in which to soak up sounds of bluegrass, country
blues, folk, zydeco, rockabilly and the "California rumba" of the
group called Bandidos de Amor on July 13.</TE>
<TE>   This Saturday's concert by Mora's Modern Swingtet, though, is
about the more urbane sound of jazz, circa 1930s swing sounds. Modern
is a highly relative term.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based, swing-obsessed pianist Dean Mora founded the
big band Mora's Modern Rhythmatists in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The six-piece Swingtet, featuring vocalist Kayre Morrison, is a
scaled-down version of the larger ensemble. But the mission remains
the same: preserving swing-era traditions of Goodman, Ellington,
Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, et al., with care and understanding.</TE>
<TE>   * Mora's Modern Swingtet, Olivas Adobe, 4200 Olivas Park Drive,
Ventura, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. General admission, $15; senior citizens
and children 12 and younger, $13. (805) 658-4726.</TE>

<LD>   Osbourne Undergoes Surgery for Cancer</LD>
<LD>   Sharon Osbourne, wife and manager of British metal pioneer Ozzy
Osbourne and star of the MTV reality show "The Osbournes," was
scheduled to undergo surgery Wednesday for a treatable form of
cancer, her publicist said.</LD>
<TE>   Osbourne "is expected to make a full recovery," according to a
news release from Susan Blond Inc. in Los Angeles. "She has the
loving support of her husband and three children, who are by her side
at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Family spokeswoman Lisa Vega would not identify what type of
cancer Osbourne has or where the surgery would take place but said it
would be completed by early evening.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the surgery, the first two dates of Osbourne's Ozzfest
2002 summer music tour, in Bristol, Va., and Pittsburgh, have been
postponed. Ozzfest will now begin July 10 in Scranton, Pa. The two
dates will be rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   TLC Members Return to the Recording Studio</TE>
<TE>   The surviving members of the band TLC--Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins and
Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas--are back at work on the group's fourth album
following the death of Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes in April.</TE>
<TE>   Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds
is working with the pair on the new disc. Edmonds said in a recent
interview that the women have "held up pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be ups and downs throughout," he said of the recording
process. "There will be times when they'll feel it more than others."</TE>
<TE>   The new record is scheduled for release in the fall. Edmonds said
much of it was recorded before Lopes died, so her vocals will be
present.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Cable News Ratings Remain Up; Fox Still #1</TE>
<TE>   Viewing of the cable news networks during the second quarter this
year remained elevated compared with last year, continuing the trend
since the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for April, May and June showed that Fox News Channel is
still the prime-time leader with an average of 1.1 million viewers,
roughly double its average during the corresponding period a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   CNN is up almost 60%, to nearly 900,000 viewers, while sister
channel Headline News rose to 220,000 viewers. Third-place MSNBC is
up a more modest 10%, at 330,000 viewers, and financial news network
CNBC saw ratings tumble by about one-third, to a little more than
225,000 viewers on average.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gains, cable news viewing in prime time is relatively
low--the combined audience for those five channels doesn't equal
viewing of either the UPN or WB networks.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Kandinsky Loot Case Finally Resolved</TE>
<TE>   A Swiss art gallery will be allowed to keep a Kandinsky painting
looted by Nazis after reaching an out-of-court settlement with the
artist's family.</TE>
<TE>   The deal ends the long-running dispute between the Ernst Beyeler
Foundation and the heirs of the artist's widow, Sophie
Lissitzky-Kueppers, over Wassily Kandinsky's "Improvisation Number
10."</TE>
<TE>   The painting had been confiscated by Nazi officials on grounds
that it was degenerate, and it was later sold to Beyeler.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement, Lissitzky-Kueppers' son and Beyeler said the
prominent Russian artist's painting would remain in the possession of
the Beyeler Foundation and its museum. Settlement terms weren't
disclosed.</TE>

<HD>Box Office Could Set Off Fireworks</HD>
<DH>Holiday * July 4th isn't usually a great moviegoing day,
but having it fall on a Thursday--opening a long holiday weekend--may
key bang-up ticket sales.</DH>

<LD>Having the Fourth of July fall on a Thursday could give moviegoing a
big boost this weekend, with school out and many people off work
since some businesses closed as early as Wednesday afternoon and will
not reopen until Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the Fourth fell on a Thursday, says Dan Marks,
executive vice president of the box-office tracking firm Nielsen EDI,
it resulted in a five-day record holiday led by the blockbuster
"Independence Day," back in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The Fourth itself is usually a good but not spectacular day in
terms of box-office receipts as Americans are preoccupied with
barbecues, fireworks and other traditional Independence Day
activities.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that the actual celebration falls on a Thursday is
significant since it's usually the weakest day of the week for ticket
sales. That leaves Friday through Sunday (as well as Wednesday
evening) open for moviegoing, which is one of the reasons Sony
Pictures is launching "Men in Black II" in more than 3,500 theaters
and 6,000 individual screens in hopes of bettering the $84-million,
five-day tally for the debut of the original film, also over the
Fourth of July weekend, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   For families looking for entertainment options for the children
over the next several days, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. are
releasing, respectively, the basketball movie "Like Mike" and the
animated feature film version of "The Powerpuff Girls."</TE>
<TE>   "By Friday, a lot of people will be off from work, which will
increase the box-office capability" for the weekend, says Marks,
making it less like a traditional Independence Day holiday period and
more like the Thanksgiving weekend, one of the two or three best
moviegoing weekends of the year.</TE>

<LD>New this week: "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" is a 10-year-old (voiced
by Debi Derryberry) whose enlarged head is roomy enough to contain an
overactive, overreaching brain and sport a voluminous spit curl that
Ace Ventura would covet. The movie's clatter and whiz-bang suggest
more humor than there actually is, although the tension between Jimmy
and his female bete noire Cindy Vortex (Candi Milo) is thorny enough
to strike some sparks among the pastels. Otherwise, there's barely
more invention in the animation than in the concept. Digitally
animated in the manner of 1950s puppet shows, it was nominated for a
best animated feature Oscar.</LD>

<HD>Graham Center Wins Key Ruling</HD>
<DH>Dance* An appeals court says the center can continue using
the late choreographer's name, despite her heir's objection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Upholding a ruling that allows the Martha Graham Center of
Contemporary Dance to continue using Graham's name and teaching her
modern dance technique at its New York City school, a federal appeals
court affirmed Tuesday what it called "Graham's intention to give her
name to the Center as long as the Center existed."</LD>
<LD>   "We believe this is a very important decision," the dance center's
executive director, Marvin Preston, said by phone on Wednesday. "It
removes any constraints regarding the use of the name regarding
educational, fund-raising and performance purposes."</LD>
<LD>   Graham died in 1991 and designated her assistant Ron Protas as her
heir. But after nearly a decade of increasing hostility between
Protas and the center, he was voted off the board and removed as
artistic director of the Martha Graham Dance Company early in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The center closed the company and school shortly afterward, citing
insurmountable financial difficulties, but it reopened the school
under the Graham name in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Protas then filed a trademark infringement suit against the center
and its newly reconstituted school, saying he had the sole rights to
the name and the Graham technique. U.S. District Judge Miriam
Cedarbaum ruled against Protas in August. Protas appealed that
decision to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Judd Burstein, lawyer for Protas and his Martha
Graham Trust, said the latest decision will be appealed. "We are
asking for a new hearing and going to the Supreme Court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Protas also has another suit against the Martha Graham Center of
Contemporary Dance awaiting a decision from Cedarbaum. In it he
claims that he is sole owner of Graham's choreography. A ruling on
the matter is expected this summer.</TE>

<LD>The flag-waving, barbecue-grilling, fireworks-flashing Fourth of July
holiday is here at last, a day set aside for feasting on all the
traditions Americans hold dear. And for millions of our good
citizens, what would the Fourth be without a gluttonous helping of
vintage TV, with a veritable parade of marathons led by that grand
marshal of the macabre himself, Rod Serling?</LD>
<LD>   "You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only
of sight and sound but of mind; a journey into a wondrous land whose
boundaries are that of the imagination. Next stop: 'The Twilight
Zone.' "</LD>
<LD>   With those words, Serling will kick off a two-day string of some
of the best "Zone" episodes, running from 7 a.m. today to 6 a.m.
Saturday on the Sci Fi Channel. Only an hour of paid programming
Friday around dawn breaks the spell.</LD>
<TE>   The E! Channel has put together a marathon of its own, scheduling
a block of "Saturday Night Live" shows from 9 this morning to 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   But wait, there's more: The Learning Channel airs consecutive
episodes of "Junkyard Wars" from 1 p.m. today to 3 a.m., including
the finale, "Junkyard Wars: Bloopers and Trashy Outtakes." And the
Animal Planet channel has "The Planet's Funniest Animals" episodes
running today from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., capped by a special show
featuring "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Bon appetit.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Specialty Laboratories Inc. said it will report a significant
second-quarter loss because of job cuts and loss of revenue after
federal regulators suspended its right to receive payments from
Medicare or Medicaid.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators charge that the company's laboratory testing was
conducted by unlicensed staff and have fined the company $3,000 a day
since Feb. 22.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based company said it will have $3.5 million to
$3.8 million in second-quarter costs related to the job cuts.
Specialty Laboratories last month fired about 10% of its 800

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. said a federal judge ruled it didn't
infringe Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc.'s patents, the second
such ruling in two weeks over on-screen program guides.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar said U.S. District Judge Lacy H. Thornburg in Asheville,
N.C., ruled that none of its current products infringed three Gemstar
patents for program guide features. He requested more information
before ruling on an EchoStar product that's no longer in production.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena-based Gemstar holds more than 190 patents related to the
software running interactive menus that help TV viewers pick what
show to watch, and has sued EchoStar and other rivals to enforce
them. An attempt to block the import of some set-top boxes was hurt
when an administrative law judge at the U.S. International Trade
Commission issued a preliminary ruling against Gemstar.</LD>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Gemstar shares closed unchanged at $5, while EchoStar
fell 47 cents to $16.04.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Proposal Meets Skeptics</HD>
<DH>Banking: Opponents of firm's CalFed takeover say its
community assistance plan is more show than substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. said Wednesday that it would commit $120 billion in
loans and investments over 10 years to minority and lower-income
customers in California and Nevada, but the plan was greeted with
skepticism by community groups opposing the banking giant's takeover
of California Federal Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup's proposal includes $80 billion in mortgages, $10
billion in small-business loans and $3.5 billion for community
development. Citigroup also pledged $35 million the first year for
"community giving and outreach": charity, financial education,
below-market-rate loans and marketing to minorities.</LD>
<LD>   The commitment is one of the largest made in California to comply
with laws requiring banks to serve all population segments. A
Citigroup news release described it as "meaningful steps to improve
the community" through "a broad array of products and services."</LD>
<TE>   The proposal is part of Citigroup's effort to win regulatory
approval for its purchase of Golden State Bancorp Inc., CalFed's San
Francisco-based parent company. The community groups, lobbying for
greater commitments by Citigroup, have filed objections with
regulators. The groups will air their grievances at a private Bay
Area meeting Monday called by the Office of Thrift Supervision.</TE>
<TE>   The advocacy groups for the poor and minorities said Citigroup's
plan was more show than substance. They accused New York-based
Citigroup of treating California as a "colony" and attacked its
sub-prime finance operations for alleged predatory practices.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gnaizda of San Francisco's Greenlining Coalition said that
as the country's largest financing services company, Citigroup should
have pledged more community lending.</TE>
<TE>   "We think [the commitment] should have been $200 billion," Gnaizda
said. "And it should have been far more specific."</TE>
<TE>   He said the plan didn't specify how loans would be provided to
minorities, made no offer to reduce charges for Latinos who wire
money abroad and failed to adopt measures other banks had taken to
guard against predatory lending.</TE>
<TE>   Another coalition, the California Reinvestment Committee, said it
believed Citigroup units would target needy areas with high-cost
loans and high-interest credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   The CRC complained that "low-cost" checking accounts at
Citigroup's Citibank subsidiary cost 50% more than at other big banks
and that borrowers weren't regularly provided the lowest-interest
loans for which they qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a two-tier approach," CRC President Alan Fisher said. "Good
products for the wealthy and sub-prime for poor folks."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup spokesman Steve Silverman said Citigroup "is proud of
our lending practices" and had "raised the bar" for the industry on
real estate loans. Buying CalFed would allow Citigroup to offer
high-quality prime loans more widely by adding 335 branches in
California and 17 in Nevada, Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup announced May 22 that it had agreed to buy GSB for $5.8
billion in cash and stock.</TE>
<TE>   If Citigroup wants to expand in California, it should become the
leader in financial education, Gnaizda said. Instead, he said,
Citigroup was leading efforts to block a new state law requiring more
disclosure by credit card issuers.</TE>

<HD>Others Still Embrace All-American Know-How</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid accounting scandals, falling stock prices and a declining
dollar, it is fair to ask what is America's economic place in the
world and what is the outlook on this Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   The answer, still, is that the U.S. has an innovative economy that
teaches the world how to do business and raise living standards. Not
much has changed despite the repeated beating corporate reputations
are taking.</LD>
<LD>   But the late-1990s days of effortless dominance by U.S. companies
are truly over. U.S. business faces challenges at home and abroad.
The spread of China into every aspect of economic endeavor poses
threats to U.S. manufacturing as well as opportunities for U.S.
ingenuity.</LD>
<TE>   Yet U.S. business practices and thinking will continue to lead the
world--as they have since the nation's beginnings over two centuries
ago. To understand why, it's good to examine a couple of companies
that are doing brisk business worldwide by infusing humble products
with innovation and drive.</TE>
<TE>   Avery Dennison Corp. of Pasadena is building four new plants in
China to make labels for consumer and office products, graphics for
trucks and factories, and tickets and tags for clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The new factories, built with an investment of $50 million, will
add to the company's existing plants in Shanghai and Hong Kong, says
Philip M. Neal, chief executive of the firm, which had $3.8 billion
in sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   3M Co., the St. Paul, Minn.-based maker of Post-it Notes and
Scotch tape, is supplying China's explosive demand for splices for
electrical wiring and reflective signs for highways, plus products
for health care and dentistry. The company gets 53% of its
$16-billion annual sales from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   What is notable about both companies' growing sales in China is
that they stem from rising living standards. China is building its
infrastructure and therefore needs electrical wiring and road signs.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese consumer goods are wrapped in more attractive packaging
and need sophisticated labels that print easily on plastic and glass.
Clothing, whether for domestic use in China or shipments abroad, need
labels, price tags and sales tickets.</TE>
<TE>   But that U.S. companies are reaping such seemingly routine
business is testimony to applied research and product development in
Pasadena; St. Paul; Austin, Texas; Painesville, Ohio; and other
locations at which Avery and 3M employ about 10% of their 90,000
people in research and development.</TE>
<TE>   3M's expertise in electrical wiring began decades ago when it
developed black tape for electricians; Avery Dennison, the maker of
no-lick postage stamps, has developed hundreds of advances in
labeling.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. companies' knowledge goes beyond products to management
of global information and distribution networks. "We have developed
software that connects every shipment of clothing from factories in
Thailand, China, Korea and other sites in Asia with proper tags for
size, color and price," says Neal of Avery Dennison.</TE>
<TE>   "Moreover, we now have developed software that prevents mistakes
in shipping. A purple, size-10 sweater cannot be shipped in a box
calling for green, size-8 sweaters," Neal says. The company is
marketing the expertise to manufacturers, shippers and retailers
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   What U.S. companies are selling of course is knowledge--whether
it's termed information or software or management education or the
motion picture, television and music products of Hollywood. Formal
statistics for U.S. exports, which show $11 billion for education,
for example, or $22 billion in royalties on intellectual property,
scarcely capture the hundreds of billions of dollars in knowledge
that the U.S. economy sends out to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say that everything is just fine today. The
misdeeds of companies boosting stock prices by phony accounting have
diminished confidence in U.S. companies and led to a worrisome
dumping by foreign investors of U.S. bonds and stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In matters of competitiveness, many U.S. manufacturers are
hurting. David Castro, head of San Luis Obispo-based El Dorado
Enterprises, a distributor of machine tools, complains that
low-priced tools from China are flooding the U.S. market, driving
domestic toolmakers out of business.</TE>
<TE>   In knowledge industries, renewed competition from Japan will
surprise U.S. companies in the next five years, predicts UCLA
professor Ronald Morse, an expert on Japan.</TE>
<TE>   What can be done about that? Companies must fight for markets and
demand fair treatment. But with a long-term U.S. interest in rising
living standards in developing countries such as China (and Latin
America), the U.S. government is not going to keep their products out
of our market.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies will have to stress the advances and knowledge in
their products and systems. And thus they will have to rely on
skilled workers and innovative management systems. It's noteworthy
that industry has been slow to resume hiring in the recovery from the
post-boom recession. "We're seeing a productivity recovery, not a
payroll one," says economist Diane Swonk of Bank One Corp. in
Chicago. "Companies are looking to hire only skilled workers."</TE>
<TE>   It has been that way from the start--knowledge has been a driver
of U.S. industry since 1789, when New England industrialists such as
Francis Cabot Lowell set up the new American factory system.</TE>
<TE>   It was different from England's factory system at that time,
writes historian Daniel Boorstin in "The Americans: The National
Experience." England's industrialists took their workers "from a
large pool of paupers" with little education or hope.</TE>
<TE>   But New England factory owners didn't want a poor "factory class"
but rather workers who could be trained to improve their skills and

<HD>L.A. Businessman May Bid for Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Tom Gores has the money, and his data and voice
services company, NextiraOne, would mesh with a global fiber-optic
network, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a telecom industry clogged with familiar names, little-known Los
Angeles financier Tom T. Gores is emerging as a strong candidate to
buy the core fiber-optic network business of Global Crossing Ltd.--if
the process doesn't wear him out first.</LD>
<LD>   Gores' Platinum Equity, a private buyout firm that has picked up
some big chunks of the telecommunication sector already, has the
cash, the solid balance sheet and the incentive to grab the bulk of
Global Crossing's business, said people familiar with the bidding
process. Potential buyers are scheduled to turn in offers by July 11,
and the company can then start negotiations to bring Global out of
the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   More important, Gores has what other telecoms drool over:
customers to fill largely empty cable pipelines.</LD>
<TE>   NextiraOne, Platinum's data and voice services company, has
400,000 customers, and if Gores could offer deals to entice just a
quarter of them to change their long-distance carrier, he would more
than double Global Crossing's 85,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could plug Nextira into Global Crossing, you'd have a
grand slam," said analyst Vik Grover of Kaufman Bros. in New York.
"That deal would be a great one."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's reach across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
connecting 27 countries and plugging into skyscrapers in major cities
such as Hong Kong, appears to be a natural fit for Nextira.</TE>
<TE>   "Nextira is the faucet, and Global Crossing is the plumbing,"
Gores said.</TE>
<TE>   He would not discuss bidding details because of a confidentiality
agreement bidders signed before the process began, and cautioned that
Platinum, known to be interested in Global, had not decided yet
whether it would make a bid.</TE>
<TE>   Nextira designs, implements and maintains telecommunications
systems for mid-size and major corporations in 17 European countries,
Canada, Mexico and the United States. It figures out telephone,
computer and other communications needs of its customers--including
IBM Corp., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson--then it buys
the equipment, installs it and keeps the systems working and up to
date.</TE>
<TE>   It is focused on customer services, and that is essentially where
the industry is heading after spending more than $444 billion in six
years to build out networks worldwide. Indeed, said one telecom
executive, Internet and business services are the only parts of
telecom doing well.</TE>
<TE>   Platinum also stands ready to operate firms for years, if
necessary. Gores even calls Platinum a mergers, acquisitions and
operations company. It goes into deals to enter markets, not to exit
quickly with a profit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "One question I always have is whether you can live with the
business if you can't exit it for two or three years," Gores said.
"If you can't, don't buy it."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are other bidders for all or parts of Global
Crossing's network, and Global's chief executive, John Legere, has
said management will put together a plan to bring the company out of
bankruptcy protection as an independent concern.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Legere said more than 60 companies were interested
in Global Crossing's assets, but fewer than 10 are expected to file
secret bids next week. "And only two or three will be meaningful
ones," said analyst Alex Mou at Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Although potential buyers are double-checking numbers in the wake
of the accounting fiasco disclosed last week at WorldCom Inc., they
are more antsy about bidding for Global Crossing's assets for other
reasons, analysts said. The industry suffers from continued slack
demand and too much bandwidth, and any healthy buyers remaining might
be looking at the prospect of more assets going up for sale at
troubled companies such as WorldCom, Qwest Communications
International Inc. and others teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Even AT&amp;T Corp., a stalwart among long-distance companies, could
shy away from taking a slice of Global Crossing, mainly because it
has its own worldwide network and because it already carries a hefty
load of debt.</TE>
<TE>   The more healthy Baby Bells, local service carriers such as
Verizon Communications Inc. and PacBell parent SBC Communications
Inc., also are thinking twice about giving up their monopolies to
enter the stagnant long-distance market, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation gives Gores a big door to enter into the bidding
process. But he'll need more than the $750 million for 79% of Global
Crossing that two Asian firms initially offered. Hong Kong-based
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies Telemedia recently
backed out, however, when bondholders indicated they would reject
such a bid.</TE>
<TE>   Gores, or any bidder for the company, would have to come up with
more cash and take less of a majority stake to satisfy creditors, who
are owed $12.4 billion and are being left with pennies on the dollar
and a minority stake in the new company.</TE>
<TE>   Gores probably could do it alone. Platinum generates more than $4
billion in revenue from a portfolio of 24 companies, and about $2.5
billion of that comes from NextiraOne, an amalgamation of units from
Williams Communications Group Inc., Alcatel  and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   But Global Crossing's sales would have to justify any bid, and
Platinum may go right up to next week's deadline before deciding how
much to bid or whether it's even worth it. The hurdles include
setting values on assets, such as contracts for capacity on cable
systems owned by other telecoms that are in financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Gores also could get help from his older brother, Alec, who
operates Gores Technology Group, a Los Angeles investment firm also
bidding for Global Crossing's assets. Though the brothers are close,
they often compete for the same distressed properties and unwanted
units of larger firms. But industry watchers said the brothers might
join in the effort to buy Global.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Tom Gores isn't hedging all his bets on buying Global
Crossing. He said he had $1 billion worth of other deals in the works
and could buy or join with partners such as AT&amp;T to give Nextira much
of what it would get with Global.</TE>

<HD>Billing Could Be an Issue for WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Courts: The company may have overcharged its customers by
as much as 10%. A judge sets March 31 for SEC trial to start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. may have overbilled its customers by as much as 10%,
raising more legal and financial questions for a company already
reeling from an accounting scandal that threatens its existence.</LD>
<LD>   The billing issue arose as a federal judge Wednesday set a March
trial date for the scandal-plagued telecommunications company, and
the House Financial Services Committee withdrew two key witnesses
from a hearing scheduled for Monday for fear their testimony could
compromise other investigations.</LD>
<LD>   The overbilling issue first surfaced in the spring, before
WorldCom's accounting problems boiled over. Drake Johnstone, an
analyst with Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond, Va., began to question
WorldCom's finances after hearing claims from some WorldCom clients
that they had been routinely overbilled.</LD>
<TE>   One of them was Prieur Leary, owner of Miami communications
services firm Infolink, who has fought a long-running battle with
WorldCom over bills he says were chronically inflated. At one point
last year, Leary said he owed WorldCom some $300,000 because of
billing errors he claims were the telecom giant's fault.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom eventually credited Infolink--which contracted to buy
Internet access and other services--for some charges, but others
remain disputed. Leary said he sent a letter last year to Arthur
Andersen, WorldCom's outside auditor at the time, alerting it to the
overbilling, as well as to WorldCom executives and board members. He
got no satisfactory response, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Overbilling is not uncommon in the telecommunications industry.
San Diego-based ProfitLine Inc., which audits telecom services bills
for clients, said that telecom companies on average overbill
customers by about 10% annually.</TE>
<TE>   "If you took $20 billion in business revenue at WorldCom and
applied the 10%, you'd get $2 billion," said Johnstone, the Davenport
analyst. "That's a pretty sizable number. This overbilling is another
huge issue. It's really the next shoe to drop."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns said, like others in the telecom
business, "now and then we have billing issues." But Burns said the
company would not comment on specific billing matters.</TE>
<TE>   Burns also said the company didn't have "any conclusive evidence
at this point" that overbilling would become an issue as it relates
to revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with overbilling is nothing new to WorldCom. The company
agreed in March 2001 to pay up to $90 million to settle claims that
its MCI unit overbilled customers for long-distance service.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Vandeventer, a former WorldCom customer service
representative in San Antonio, said he frequently encountered
overbillings as he worked with WorldCom clients who had disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Vandeventer said he believed the mishaps usually occurred because
of the staff's lack of training and were not intentional.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff set March 31 as the
tentative date for the Securities and Exchange Commission to begin
presenting its case accusing WorldCom of violating securities laws by
covering up $1.22 billion in losses by improperly booking $3.9
billion in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is seeking unspecified monetary penalties and to bar the
company from violating securities laws again.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff also appointed Richard Breeden, a former head of the SEC,
to ensure no documents are destroyed by the company and that no
payments that exceed $100,000 are made to current or former
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee scratched
WorldCom's internal auditor Cynthia Cooper and the audit committee
chairman, Max Bobbitt, from Monday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) "became concerned
that testimony from these two individuals could potentially
compromise other inquiries," said Peggy Peterson, spokeswoman for the
committee. WorldCom is being investigated by the Justice Department
and the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that Cooper found
the accounting errors on her own and the audit committee delayed
taking action on her findings, differing from the chronology offered
by WorldCom. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony was expected from WorldCom Chairman Bert Roberts, Chief
Executive John W. Sidgmore, Salomon Smith Barney telecommunications
analyst Jack Grubman, and Melvin Dick, once a senior partner at
former WorldCom auditor Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Clinton, Miss.-based company more than doubled in
Nasdaq trading Wednesday, albeit only going to 22 cents from 10
cents, a day after Sidgmore apologized for the scandal and tried to
stem the company's fall.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Chief Vows to Fix Its Cash Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping in to restore investor confidence in battered Vivendi
Universal, new Chief Executive and Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou vowed
Wednesday to address concerns about the company's cash needs and make
its accounting more transparent to shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Fourtou was responding to fears among investors and credit
agencies that the company would not be able to meet its financial
obligations this year. Those worries continued to cause a free fall
in the company's share price, which plummeted more than 30% in two
days to close at $15.66 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "In the next two weeks, all possible measures will be taken to
improve the situation, particularly in terms of the short-term cash
position," Fourtou said in a statement after an emergency meeting in
Paris.</LD>
<TE>   Hours after Fourtou replaced beleaguered Jean-Marie Messier,
Vivendi issued another statement saying the company was in talks with
banks to obtain new credit lines after downgrades in its debt caused
a $97.6 million credit line to be terminated and $878 million in
unused credit lines to mature. The firm said the value of its assets
far exceeded debts.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's board Wednesday also voted in two new members: Gerard
Kleisterlee, CEO of Philips, a Dutch electronics company that is a
major investor in Vivendi, and Claude Bebear, the chairman of insurer
Axa and a chief Messier critic.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the board created two committees to evaluate the
company's strategy and finances. Bebear will head the financial
committee that will seek to repair relations with French banks that
sources said had threatened to withhold credit unless Messier were
ousted.</TE>
<TE>   The task facing Fourtou, 63, is considerable. The businessman who
helped create the Aventis pharmaceutical giant must outline a
clear-cut strategy to reduce billions in debt and address fears that
it faces a cash crisis, challenges that ultimately led to Messier's
departure. His resignation was made official Wednesday by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fourtou did not supply specifics, analysts and investors
say that in all likelihood the next weeks and months will see the
dismantling of the often-puzzling empire that Messier built in the
hopes of transforming a onetime utilities firm into a media and
entertainment powerhouse to rival AOL Time Warner Inc. But investors
were never able to share that vision of merging diverse technology,
media and entertainment interests, and soon grew impatient with a
string of setbacks and flip-flops by Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Even in his departure, Messier continued to draw controversy:
Messier negotiated a $17-million buyout, although his net
compensation will be offset substantially by money he must pay back
to Vivendi in connection with loans he took out to buy company stock,
a source close to the board said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a buyout would be startling because Messier, in his
autobiography, "Moi-Meme Maitre du Monde" ("Myself, Master of the
World"), vowed he would never take a golden parachute and criticized
another European executive for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Messier declined to comment on the matter Wednesday but has
emphatically denied borrowing any money from the company. Vivendi
would not comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   A two-year buying spree and various contingency payments left
Vivendi with $30 billion in debt, including $17 billion from its
media and communications business. The company's financial
obligations this year will be $3 billion higher than many analysts
expected, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   The high debt load means Vivendi needs to raise cash quickly by
selling off assets.</TE>
<TE>   The board is seriously considering unloading Canal Plus, the
money-losing European pay-TV and film company that could fetch at
least $1.95 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate for sale is Vivendi's 44% stake in French
telecom firm Cegetel, which could raise $5.86 billion to $7.8
billion, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to simplify the company, and they need to dispose of
assets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The board has yet to decide on the fate of Universal Studios and
Universal Music Group. Rather than sell those businesses outright,
which would be difficult in the current media market, a more likely
scenario is that the companies would be spun off into a separate,
publicly owned company run by Hollywood mogul Barry Diller, chairman
of Vivendi Universal Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   A glimmer of good news came Wednesday when top executives from
French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale tried to reassure
investors that Vivendi was not facing a financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Merrill Lynch reiterated its "strong buy"
recommendation for Vivendi shares, although it acknowledged that this
week's credit-rating downgrades by Moody's Investors Service and
Standard &amp; Poor's make things riskier.</TE>
<TE>   Downgrades mean Vivendi will pay higher interest rates on its
debt. A 1 percentage-point increase in rates would reduce the
company's 2003 earnings per share by 12%, Merrill estimated.</TE>
<TE>   If Vivendi can successfully refinance $3.3 billion euros of bank
loans coming due during the next six months and address other
short-term credit issues, its shares "should sharply recover as focus
shifts to the company's strategy and performance," London-based
analyst Neil Blackley said.</TE>

<LD>Derrel Green retired 15 years ago from the big seat at the front of
an RTD bus, but he still drives a route most days--only now the ride
is a glistening silver Toyota Highlander and the stops are a series
of gasoline stations near his West Covina home.</LD>
<LD>   Green is on the lookout for pump prices that he can feed to a free
Web site that helps consumers find the best deals on gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   Green is a devotee of www .gasbuddy.com, but there are a few other
such Web sites and thousands of other such volunteers. These are
people willing to burn precious petrol in the monitoring of tens of
thousands of gasoline prices nationwide so that fellow motorists can
save a few dollars per fill-up.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, it's a hobby," said Green, who routinely sees price
differences of 20 cents or more per gallon among the retailers he
surveys. "I kind of got hooked."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet would seem to be the perfect forum for this kind of
activity. Like a band of traveling coupon-clippers, these gas price
"spotters" join together to find the best and worst fuel prices
posted each day in communities across the country.</TE>
<TE>   It is a service with noble intentions but with perhaps a limited
audience. Because as much as Americans enjoy grousing about the price
of gasoline, we are less likely to do something about it, gas experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think consumers care as much as they say they do," said
John Umbeck, an economics professor at Purdue University who has
studied gasoline marketing. "In today's society, the price of time is
just too important."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is no disputing that gasoline prices can swing by a
dime or two per gallon in the space of only a few blocks. Such
differences are what drive these gasoline price sites and irk the gas
spotters, an enthusiastic bunch with a pronounced skepticism about
major gasoline producers.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest is the regional gas price survey conducted each week by
the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer
advocacy group. The survey is so well followed that retailers have
been known to wait until after the survey is posted each Tuesday (at
www.ucan.org) before they raise prices.</TE>
<TE>   UCAN uses its pricing survey to push its argument that gasoline is
priced unfairly in the San Diego area and that lack of competition
keeps prices higher there than in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The group also hopes to jolt visitors to the gasoline section of
its Web site into becoming more savvy shoppers, said Michael Shames,
UCAN's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Proctor was intrigued by the price disparities he saw among
service stations as he delivered a free technology publication to
retail outlets in the Midwest two years ago. Proctor was so intrigued
that he and a few partners started a Web site called www.gasprice
watch.com that he hopes will some day turn a profit by helping
consumers shop for gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "The motivation is to help your friends and neighbors and people
you will never meet make a better decision the next time they buy
gasoline," Proctor said.</TE>
<TE>   At www.gasbuddy.com, "there are a lot of people on the Web site
who wouldn't classify themselves as people who are crazy about gas
prices. But the thing is, it can really save a lot of money," said
Jason Toews, co-founder of GasBuddy.com, which runs dozens of linked
sites posting gas prices for specific areas, including www
.losangelesgasprices.com and www .orangecountygasprices.com.</TE>
<TE>   In Arcadia, for example, an Arco station could be found recently
on www.losangelesgasprices.com's list of lowest prices ($1.51 per
gallon), while a 76 station nearby made the list of highest prices
($1.69 per gallon). Buying 10 gallons at the cheaper station would
save a motorist $1.80.</TE>
<TE>   These sites have lured a loyal cadre of price watchers, attracted
by the opportunity at some sites to win points and prizes for
inputting prices, or drawn by a community of other motorists who hate
to pay too much for gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   At UCAN, the price spotters number less than a dozen, but they are
regular volunteers with the consumer group, Shames said. Paid staff
members spot check the prices for accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   At www.gasbuddy.com, which is run out of the Minneapolis area, and
www.gaspricewatch.com, based in Dayton, Ohio, tens of thousands have
registered to post prices.</TE>
<TE>   There's competition among spotters to find the cheapest or most
expensive gas, Toews said.</TE>
<TE>   Spotters get a bit defensive, he said, if a newcomer tries to
update a price at a retailer that a regular spotter already has
staked out.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to feel that they are making a contribution to the
Web site," Toews said. "They don't like people to post over their
prices."</TE>
<TE>   The Web sites receive the most visits--and spotters are most
active--when gasoline prices are rising. Even so, the Internet is
littered with the carcasses of gas sites that are no longer active.
One, www.gaswars.com, lists prices entered more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers were not very interested in supporting the site,
figuring "people who are trying to save money on gasoline are cheap
to begin with," said site administrator Darrell Harter, who added
that it's "very hard to keep people coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Proctor hopes to make his www.gaspricewatch.com site profitable
some day through partnerships with gasoline retailers; Toews said his
GasBuddy.com covers its costs by selling banner ads.</TE>
<TE>   The appetite for gas-shopping sites has limits, said economist
Umbeck.</TE>
<TE>   In one study Umbeck conducted for a major gasoline retailer, which
he declined to name, the corporation wanted to know how customers
chose among the many outlets selling that particular brand of
gasoline. In more than 200 interviews, price was never mentioned as a
factor.</TE>
<TE>   In another study, Arco let Umbeck and a colleague change the
posted price of gasoline up or down by 2 cents a gallon at 54
company-owned stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego
for a week at a time. The Purdue professors then recorded how much
business the Arco outlets lost or gained.</TE>
<TE>   The change was surprisingly small, he said--even in Los Angeles,
where gas stations are more plentiful and motorists have more options
than in San Francisco or San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real eye-opener for me," Umbeck said. "I've been
studying gasoline marketing for 20 years. I would have guessed that
consumers were a little more willing to go out of their way to save
money on gas."</TE>
<TE>   Motorists are more interested in convenience, Umbeck said, which
could be defined as a gas station that accepts credit cards at the
pump or a station on the right side of the road or a station with
fast pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Annemarie Curry can't understand that kind of shopping, even
though she doesn't need to count pennies. Curry, a film producer, and
her husband both own luxury cars, but she will drive a few blocks out
of her way to find the best price.</TE>
<TE>   On long weekend driving trips, the savings really add up, Curry
said. The couple plan their gas stops based on prices posted at
www.gaspricewatch.com and can save 20 cents or more per gallon, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's startling how much prices can vary," Curry said. "As soon as
the gas prices spike in summer, it becomes even more critical to know
where you can find the cheap ones."</TE>
<TE>   "It's human nature," Curry said. "Everyone loves a bargain."</TE>

<HD>Chapter 11 Filings Are on Pace to Set Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. corporate bankruptcies are headed for a second straight record
year after filings by Adelphia Communications Corp., Global Crossing
Ltd. and Kmart Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 255 publicly traded companies, led by Enron Corp., put
$260 billion of assets under court protection. This year, 113
companies with $149.3 billion in assets have filed. WorldCom Inc.,
with $103.8 billion, may seek Chapter 11 protection after
acknowledging it hid expenses to boost profit.</LD>
<LD>   The recovering economy hasn't been enough to stem a bankruptcy
trend fueled by corporate scandals and a stock market downturn.</LD>
<TE>   "The worst isn't over by any means," said Ken Buckfire of
investment banking firm Miller, Buckfire Lewis &amp; Co. "I don't see any
decrease in the volume of bankruptcies for the next year and a half
to two years."</TE>
<TE>   Enron, with $63.4 billion in assets, filed the largest Chapter 11
case in the U.S. in December. It would be dwarfed if WorldCom
declares bankruptcy. The long-distance telephone company said it's
trying to work out a plan with banks to avoid Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen the magnitude and the concentration of financial
failures in such a short period of time," said corporate lawyer David
Heiman of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, who has handled some of the
biggest Chapter 11 restructurings. "There are some huge companies
where the value has simply evaporated."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the eight largest Chapter 11 cases have been filed since
December. Besides Enron, they are telecommunications company Global
Crossing, with $25.5 billion in assets; Adelphia, with $24.4 billion;
retailer Kmart, with $17 billion; and NTL Inc., Britain's biggest
cable TV operator, with $16.8 billion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Laguna Niguel homeowners association was awarded $7.8 million for
damages due to construction defects by Shea Homes, the country's
second-largest residential builder.</LD>
<LD>   The defects alleged in the Orange County case included leaking
roofs, decks and windows, and the accumulation of ground water at the
Breakers at Brand complex. Mold was present in 95% of the
development, according to the suit.</LD>
<LD>   The association's complaint was filed in July 1999 and the trial
began in April.</LD>
<TE>   Construction defect lawsuits have become increasingly common in
recent years. Homeowners have been helped by the implementation of
"strict liability" laws, which say that homes are defective if the
builders fail to construct them as well as they should be built.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Launch Probe of Cingular</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Thousands of consumer complaints lead the PUC to
order an investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California regulators are investigating Cingular Wireless, the
second-largest U.S. wireless telephone company, after receiving
thousands of consumer complaints about shoddy service and
cancellation fees.</LD>
<LD>   In its order for the probe, the state Public Utilities Commission
said Cingular's system appeared "fundamentally unfair to consumers."</LD>
<LD>   Complaints focused on limited phone coverage areas; frequently
disconnected, or "dropped," calls; misleading advertising; and a
termination fee of $150 or more to cancel service early, the order
said.</LD>
<TE>   The commission, which regulates the telecommunications industry in
California, said it has received more than 4,700 complaints about
Cingular's operations in the state since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers found they did not have coverage where they lived,
worked or commuted, or that their calls were routinely dropped," the
commission said. "... Customers felt trapped into inadequate service
with Cingular."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta company, a joint venture between BellSouth Corp. and
SBC Communications Inc., has more than 22 million voice and data
customers nationwide. It ranks behind market leader Verizon Wireless,
a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group.</TE>
<TE>   Cingular said in a statement that it is committed to
"best-in-class" service in California and is "disappointed" that
state regulators are investigating it.</TE>
<TE>   On May 1, Cingular started a nationwide "no questions asked"
return policy under which customers do not have to pay an early
termination fee if they cancel the service and return the phone
within 15 days of signing up.</TE>
<TE>   The company, however, will charge a nonrefundable $36 "activation
fee," Cingular spokesman Clay Owen said.</TE>
<TE>   Cingular is spending $945 million to upgrade its system in
California, Nevada and Washington, Owen added.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC will schedule a hearing with Cingular but has not set a
date, said spokeswoman Sheri Inouye.</TE>

<HD>City of Hope Auction Investigated</HD>
<DH>Courts: A grand jury looks into claims of real estate fraud
involving a former executive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A grand jury is investigating allegations that a former City of Hope
National Medical Center executive rigged an auction of some hospital
properties to benefit himself and others involved in the scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry came to light in court documents filed June 18 in a
civil suit by City of Hope against its former real estate department
director, Joseph W. Rohn, and his alleged accomplices.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
would neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Rohn has denied any wrongdoing and is cooperating with the
district attorney's office, said his criminal attorney Janet Levine.
The allegations stem from a misunderstanding between Rohn and a City
of Hope management team that came to power during Rohn's tenure, she
said. Rohn is confident he will be fully exonerated, Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the civil suit, Rohn persuaded City of Hope to
auction a package of 85 properties, including 29 limited partnership
interests and 56 stakes in oil and gas ventures. The investments had
been donated to the hospital, a nonprofit cancer center in Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on Rohn's advice, the hospital accepted a bid of $288,120
from a company called K&amp;K Oil Co. for the entire package, according
to the complaint. Rohn identified K&amp;K as the high bidder, the suit
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the suit alleges, K&amp;K's offer was not the highest. The
suit claims Rohn influenced the hospital to accept K&amp;K's offer
because he and his wife had an interest in K&amp;K through another
company they controlled.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims Rohn hid his relationship to K&amp;K from City of Hope
as part of a scheme to defraud the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   After City of Hope accepted K&amp;K's offer, the suit claims, Rohn
substituted property from City of Hope's portfolio for properties in
the auction agreement. The suit said Rohn made the changes because
K&amp;K's bids on some limited partnership stakes were so low that they
were not accepted by the general partners.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the suit said, the general partners of a real estate
partnership called BRV Building Interests rejected K&amp;K's offer as 20%
below market. Rather than sell to K&amp;K, the general partners purchased
City of Hope's stake in BRV themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the substitutions, the suit said, K&amp;K ended up
acquiring 17 limited partnership interests and seven real property
interests, in addition to the 56 oil and gas investments.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope claims that the properties moved into K&amp;K's agreement
had a market value of $725,000, substantially higher than K&amp;K's bid
for the entire package. The hospital claims it lost in excess of $1
million on the K&amp;K transaction, which took place in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's lawsuit also claims that Rohn defrauded City of
Hope by secretly acting as a broker or property manager on certain
real estate deals through a second company that he and his wife
controlled. The suit said the company, Tidemark Properties, received
commissions on at least 14 City of Hope real estate transactions.</TE>
<TE>   However, Levine said Rohn had provided "in-house" brokerage
services to City of Hope from 1992 until 1998, when he was placed on
administrative leave. After a new management team took over at City
of Hope, there was a misunderstanding about Rohn's authority to
"broker, package, sell and buy" the hospital's real estate
investments, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's current management team, led by former L.A. Gear
executive Gil N. Schwartzberg, took charge in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   John Moscarino, the civil attorney for Rohn, Rohn's wife, K&amp;K and
two people identified as minority owners of K&amp;K, accused City of Hope
of filing the civil lawsuit to dredge up evidence to support the
3-year-old criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Moscarino disclosed the grand jury investigation in court
documents. His clients deny the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope acknowledged that it contacted the district
attorney's office around the time it placed Rohn on leave. However,
City of Hope general counsel Glenn Krinsky called Moscarino's
assertion "complete nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Krinsky said: "We're suing him because he stole money from us, as
outlined in the complaint."</TE>

<LD>The vast services sector grew for a fifth straight month in June but

two reports Wednesday showed, suggesting it may take longer for the
U.S. economy to fire on all cylinders.</LD>
<LD>   That was underscored by a mixed picture for the labor market,
following news that service sector layoffs accelerated in June even
as jobless benefit claims hit a 15-month low in the latest week. That
raised concerns that the June employment report, expected Friday,
could show weaker payroll growth than predicted.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group,
said Wednesday that its monthly non-manufacturing index fell to 57.2
in June from 60.1 in May, below analysts' forecasts, for a dip to
58.8. A number above 50 indicates growth; anything below 50 denotes
contraction.</LD>
<TE>   Factory orders climbed for the third straight month, by 0.7% in
May to $321 billion, boosted by demand for machinery and computer
products, the Commerce Department said. That matched a 0.7% rise the
prior month and beat analysts' expectations of a 0.5% gain.</TE>
<TE>   Weekly jobless benefit claims fell 11,000 in the week ended June
29 to 382,000, their lowest level since March 2001 at the outset of
last year's downturn, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four weeks, new claims have averaged 392,000, down
for the 10th consecutive week. But Americans still are having trouble
finding jobs, pushing up the measure of the total number of people
claiming benefits to 3.7 million in the latest week available.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the bad news, ISM's employment index for the service
sector showed another decline. The index slipped sharply to 44.3 in
June from 49.5 in May, marking the 16th straight month of job losses
and raising some concerns that a jobs recovery may take longer than
was initially thought.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in factory orders was the second report this week showing
good news for manufacturing after ISM said Monday that its monthly
manufacturing index rose to 56.2 in June--the fastest pace since
February 2000--from 55.7 in May.</TE>
<TE>   Machinery demand rose 2.1% in May while orders of computers and
electronic products rose 0.6%, the government said Wednesday.
Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a barometer of business
investment seen as crucial to a strong recovery, rose 1.2%.</TE>
<TE>   New orders for durable goods rose 0.9% compared with 0.5% in
April. Nondurable goods climbed 0.4%, led by an increase in beverage
and tobacco products.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding transportation, factory orders also were up 0.7% and
excluding defense, they gained 0.8%.</TE>

<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. said Wednesday that federal prosecutors in Los
Angeles will investigate allegations that two employees shredded
documents at the Madison, N.J., offices of the bankrupt fiber-optic
network builder after government investigations began.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing has said that documents unrelated to government
and securities fraud lawsuits were destroyed at five of its U.S. and
Canadian offices, but not at its U.S. headquarters. It denied that
any sensitive documents were destroyed at any of its offices.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission, are looking into the Bermuda-based company's accounting
practices as part of ongoing investigations into Global Crossing's
collapse in January.</LD>
<TE>   A shareholder in one of 60 securities fraud suits uncovered
allegations from a former employee and a current one that they heard
a shredding machine operating behind a closed storage room door. The
workers said they never saw any shredding nor any shredded material,
though one said she saw a small shredding machine in the room.</TE>
<TE>   The room is on the third floor near the office of Joseph Perrone,
the finance chief who directed the aggressive accounting methods at
the heart of the investigations and lawsuits. One of those alleged to
have destroyed documents is his son-in-law, Steve Scro. Scro has
denied that he shredded any materials.</TE>
<TE>   But federal prosecutors are acting in the aftermath of reports of
vast shredding at bankrupt Enron Corp. and its auditor, Arthur
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing and the shareholder, the Ohio State Retirement
System, have resolved the pension fund's concerns about protecting
documents.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California home construction dipped in May, brought down by a plunge
in new multifamily units that reflected a slower pace of construction
in most of the major markets.</LD>
<LD>   Builders pulled permits at an annual rate of 149,350 units,
dropping more than 5% from April and 3% from a year earlier,
according to a state analysis of industry figures.</LD>
<LD>   The output for May reflected one of the slowest rates of
production this year. State analysts estimate that more than 200,000
units are needed to keep pace with population growth.</LD>
<TE>   "These numbers just aren't keeping up," said Howard Roth, chief
economist for the Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Planned construction of apartments, condominiums and townhomes
plunged statewide by nearly 30% from a year ago. Single-family units
rose nearly 9%.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, total permits dropped nearly 12% from a
year earlier, almost entirely because of reduced multifamily
production, according to the Construction Industry Research Board, a
Burbank firm that tracks home building.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County posted a 20% increase in home production from a weak
number posted a year earlier, the figures showed.</TE>

<LD>US Airways Group Inc.'s effort to realign its business and avoid a
bankruptcy filing was set back after Continental Airlines Inc. broke
off talks about sharing airline passengers and frequent-flier
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Unprofitable US Airways wants to ally with another U.S. carrier to
help persuade the Air Transportation Stabilization Board to give it a
$900-million loan guarantee. Such agreements let carriers build
revenue by sharing passengers. US Airways said it may seek bankruptcy
protection without a guarantee.</LD>

14 cents.</LD>

<LD>A coalition of U.S. manufacturers and energy producers said they will
be harmed when the Kyoto agreement on global warming is adopted by
other nations while the Bush administration and Congress refuse to
participate.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. companies will lose out to foreign competitors that gain
expertise and market share in energy-reducing technologies, and may
face trade sanctions against U.S. exports that are made at
higher-polluting factories, according to the Business Council for
Sustainable Energy, whose 37 members include Honeywell International
Inc., Maytag Corp. and Covanta Energy Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Since federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions is
inevitable, the U.S. government is not doing U.S. companies a favor
by keeping them outside the worldwide emissions trading system that
may be adopted with the Kyoto accord this year, said the council's
president, Michael Marvin.</LD>
<TE>   The business council's stance is at variance with other business
groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, that oppose U.S.
participation in the Kyoto accord.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline fell on signs that refiners are producing more than enough
fuel to satisfy rising U.S. demand as travelers take to the highways
for the Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. refineries last week produced gasoline at the fastest pace in
seven months and fuel imports were at a record for a second
consecutive week, the American Petroleum Institute said. The extra
supplies came as U.S. demand rose to the highest level since August.</LD>
<LD>   Gasoline for August delivery fell as much as 1.88 cents, or 2.4%,
to 77.1 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
futures, which represent wholesale markets, were up 6.8% from a year
ago.</LD>
<TE>   Demand for gasoline, as computed from figures in the institute's
report, rose 3.6% to 9.89 million barrels a day last week.
Inventories fell 1.3 million barrels to 216.4 million in the week
ended Friday. The decline was within the range of analysts'
expectations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. said it will extend the process of excluding certain steel
imports from tariffs of as much as 30%, a step that may head off a
$350-million retaliation by the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Although the exclusions were scheduled to conclude Wednesday, the
Bush administration will continue the process on a "rolling basis"
through August because of the volume of requests from U.S. steel
importers and foreign producers.</LD>
<LD>   The EU will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization,
saying they break global trade rules. Europe has been joined in its
WTO challenge by other countries, including Japan, China, South Korea
and New Zealand.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission said it will pursue its case against
Schering-Plough Corp. and Upsher-Smith Laboratories for allegedly
using a patent settlement to keep cheaper versions of a popular heart
medication off the market.</LD>
<LD>   An FTC administrative law judge ruled earlier that the agency had
failed to prove the 1997 patent settlement between the companies was
aimed at thwarting competition.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC had contended that Schering-Plough used a patent agreement
with American Home Products and Upsher-Smith to delay generic
versions of blood pressure medication K-Dur. It estimated the patent
agreements had cost U.S. consumers more than $100 million.</LD>

<HD>Three Airlines Raise Fares for Leisure Travel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's three largest airlines raised the price of certain
round-trip fares by $20 for leisure travelers ahead of the Fourth of
July holiday.</LD>
<LD>   The ticket price increases introduced by AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines and matched by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Delta Air
Lines Inc. on Wednesday apply to 14-day advance-purchase companion
fares that require a Saturday night stay.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for American, which initiated the move late Tuesday,
said the change applies to the lowest fares in the carrier's pricing
structure.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the fare increase is the industry's fourth such
effort since mid-April and comes at a time when the biggest airlines
continue to lose millions of dollars a day. The major carriers' three
previous attempts to raise ticket prices were short-lived as
competitors, most notably Northwest Airlines Corp., refused to go
along.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday afternoon, Continental Airlines Inc., US Airways
Group Inc. and Northwest hadn't matched the fare increase. Industry
analysts downplayed the change, saying that many more fares had been
reduced earlier in the week.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Energy Charge Lawsuit Settled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four of the nation's top hotel companies Wednesday tentatively
settled a class-action lawsuit stemming from energy surcharges they
imposed during last year's power crisis, in an agreement that could
cost them more than $60 million in future discounts.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement presented Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior
Court, each person who stayed at a hotel run by Marriott
International Inc., Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., Hilton
Hotels Corp. or Hyatt Corp. and paid an energy surcharge would be
entitled to a $10 discount on a future stay.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of the tentative settlement must still be approved by
the court.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Barry Himmelstein, who represented the plaintiffs, said
guests who stayed at hotels operated by any of the four companies
starting in February or March 2001 and running as long as 10 months
later would be potentially eligible for the discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott's brands include Marriott, Renaissance, Ritz-Carlton,
Courtyard and Fairfield Inns; Starwood's brands include Westin,
Sheraton and W; and Hilton's chains include Hilton, Embassy Suites,
Doubletree and Hampton Inn.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Judge Carolyn Kuhl acknowledged that the number of
people who collect coupons under the proposed settlement would likely
be far smaller than the number eligible.</TE>

<HD>TV Set-Top Maker to Cut Work Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said Wednesday that it eliminated 1,300 jobs
in Mexico, or 16% of its staff, because of declining demand at the
second-largest U.S. maker of television set-top boxes.</LD>
<LD>   The company trimmed production at its plant in Juarez, Mexico, to
reduce the work force to 6,700 and may cut more jobs, spokesman Paul
Sims said.</LD>
<LD>   Scientific-Atlanta, second to Motorola Inc. in the set-top box
market, has seen sales decline as cable operators sign up fewer
subscribers for digital-TV service, which features hundreds of
channels. The majority of the company's revenue comes from a few
large cable customers, including AOL Time Warner Inc., analysts and
investors said.</LD>
<TE>   The company's customers "were having their own problems and having
to manipulate their own inventories," said Jeanie Wyatt, chief
executive of South Texas Money Management, who manages more than $100
million and sold her Scientific-Atlanta shares.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta shares rose 17 cents, or 1.2%, to $14.24 on the
New York Stock Exchange. They have declined 68% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's shipments of digital set-top boxes are expected to
decline this quarter partly because of sagging demand from AOL Time
Warner's cable unit, said Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Tal Liani, who
has a "near-term reduce/sell" rating on Scientific-Atlanta shares.</TE>
<TE>   The AOL Time Warner cable business, second-largest in the U.S.,
accounts for about 51% of Scientific-Atlanta's set-top box shipments
and 22% of the company's revenue, Sims said.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. issued its second warning in two weeks,
cutting its second-quarter sales forecast by up to a third from its
original target and raising fears the company was falling farther
behind its main rival, Intel Corp., as the PC industry they supply
stumbles.</LD>
<LD>   AMD said it sees second-quarter sales of about $600 million. On
June 18, it had projected sales of $620 million to $700 million, down
from an earlier forecast of $820 million to $900 million.</LD>
<LD>   AMD at that time attributed its poor sales performance to a weak
market for PCs and also forecast a substantial second-quarter
operating loss. A company spokesman declined to elaborate on reasons
for the revised outlook.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AMD, which plans to release results on July 17, fell 37
cents to $8.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compaq Computer Corp. has agreed to a $28.6-million settlement with a
group of shareholders who accused the company of inflating its stock
price by failing to disclose bad news.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement with Houston-based Compaq, which was acquired
recently by Hewlett-Packard Co., was reached after about a
three-month mediation process.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in 1998, alleged that Compaq failed to disclose
that its reported growth in sales and earnings was actually the
result of its practice of borrowing sales from future quarters. The
suit also accused executives of using their knowledge of these
problems to sell shares at inflated prices.</LD>
<TE>   Compaq's attorney, John L. Carter, said the settlement agreement
is not an admission of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement will be split among investors who bought
stock between July 10, 1997, and March 6, 1998.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The publisher of a hackers magazine ended a 2 1/2-year legal battle
with Hollywood's major studios, agreeing to drop a case over copying
DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Corley, who operates the 2600 magazine and Web site, chose
not to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling that ordered him to
remove links to decryption software written by someone else. Corley's
attorneys unsuccessfully had argued that publishing the program was
free speech.</LD>
<LD>   The Electronic Frontier Foundation, the civil liberties group that
represented Corley, pledged to challenge a controversial 1998
copyright law making it illegal to produce or distribute software
that could circumvent copy protections.</LD>

<HD>Big WorldCom Customers Eye Alternatives</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Some of company's corporate clients are debating
paying breakup fees or staying put through a possible reorganization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of WorldCom Inc.'s big corporate customers are scrambling to
line up alternative suppliers for systems that transmit company data
internally and to business partners and customers, but analysts
predict that many firms will suffer one way or another from
WorldCom's problems.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of the largest clients have long-term contracts with
WorldCom that set steep penalties for switching, even if WorldCom
files for bankruptcy reorganization. As a result, many companies may
be forced to choose between paying those breakup fees and letting
their vital communication networks deteriorate.</LD>
<LD>   Only about 20% of the big corporate customers have escape clauses
in their WorldCom contracts that allow them to walk away if
WorldCom's financial condition slides past a certain point, said
analyst David Willis of Meta Group.</LD>
<TE>   Because penalties for the remainder of customers can run as high
as 50% of the cost of staying in the contract, many will probably put
up with problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have more outages, and we'll have outages that last
longer," Willis said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a gradual decline in service levels."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the line, consumers will eventually see slower Web
site connections, because WorldCom carries more than 40% of Internet
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that almost no one believes WorldCom's system
will be allowed to go dark, which would be catastrophic for the
Internet backbone.</TE>
<TE>   If WorldCom enters bankruptcy proceedings, it probably will emerge
debt-free or sell its networks to other vendors.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate customers already are seeing a slowdown from
WorldCom, which is laying off 17,000 workers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are beginning to make back-up arrangements and steering
at least some of their traffic to WorldCom competitors. A full-scale
switch can take months, depending on the complexity of the system.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting other suppliers lined up, because you want to
have options ready to go," said telecommunications analyst Jeffrey
Kagan. "You have to dig your well before you're thirsty."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, beset by an accounting scandal that has drawn a lawsuit
from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a congressional
inquiry, said it has seen little flight by major customers so far.</TE>
<TE>   But competitors AT&amp;T Corp., regional phone companies including
Pacific Bell parent SBC Communications Corp. of San Antonio and
data-traffic specialists such as Atlanta-based Equant are seeing an
increased number of inquiries from nervous WorldCom clients.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had many dozens of calls from lots of big names who have
been using WorldCom," said Equant spokeswoman Stephanie Willerton.</TE>
<TE>   "Many are just trying to understand what their options are, how
long it would take for contingency plans to go into effect."</TE>
<TE>   After WorldCom's bombshell announcement that it had overstated
operating profit by $3.9 billion, Equant formalized a U.S. version of
European programs designed to speed credit checks of new customers
and install equipment faster.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T and SBC have increased sales efforts and launched unsubtle
advertising campaigns. Recent newspaper ads from SBC say the company
brings "Peace of Mind. And infinite reliability" to corporate
information officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a 25% increase in call volume to those centers
handling customers returning to SBC," said firm spokesman Joe
Izbrand.</TE>
<TE>   If WorldCom goes to Bankruptcy Court, legal rules could make
moving to another service provider even more complicated: for that
reason, those customers that can afford to get out soon may choose
not to wait.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's 20 million customers include many Wall Street
powerhouses, large manufacturers and government agencies. None
contacted Wednesday agreed to discuss what steps are being taken.</TE>

<LD>Amid the chaos in the corporate offices of Vivendi Universal, Barry
Diller, chairman of the Hollywood studio and recreation divisions,
has been a phantom, keeping out of the public eye and corporate
cross-fire. On Tuesday, however, he surfaced in cyberspace to deliver
a short message to his troops: Keep your noses to the grind stone.</LD>
<LD>   "It is reasonable to be upset, saddened or simply confused and
weary by the turmoil of the last period and the resultant change in
leadership, but it's more important right now to view this change as
the end of an increasingly distracting and tumultuous time and the
beginning of a clear-eyed, long term and stable strategy.... Now is
not the time to analyze and dissect the past.</LD>
<LD>   "Transitions are always difficult, and while this one is
exacerbated by turbulent capital and equity markets that will try us
all, the work that you do so successfully well will ensure safe
passage for Universal.</LD>
<TE>   "So keep only this in mind as the rumors and speculation and town
criers abound--you are all part of an enterprise with fine values
first established by Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman more than 70 years
ago ... and that the motion picture, television, and recreation
businesses begun by them may have gone through multiple convolutions
over the last decade, but nothing will deter their ability to grow
and thrive with those same values intact far into the future."</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P, Dow End Losing Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock indexes edged higher Wednesday as investors did some
last-minute buying ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, snapping a
losing streak that had pushed prices to multiyear lows.</LD>
<LD>   Still, dour forecasts from firms such as Advanced Micro Devices
weighed on sentiment, and investors, bracing for the next big
accounting blowup, fled shares of complex companies such as General
Electric.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the gains by the big indexes, falling stocks outnumbered
advancers by 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange and by about 4 to
3 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going a little higher but don't read too much into it,"
said Anthony Iuliano, head equity trader for Glenmede Trust Co.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a few more days of gains for it to mean
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index broke a three-session
losing streak to rise 5.90 points, or 0.6%, to 953.99. The index fell
to a 4 1/2 -year low Tuesday. During Wednesday's trading, it slipped
below the 944.75 intraday low hit on Sept. 21 after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.22 points, or 0.5%, to
9,054.97, recovering from an early 110-point loss to register a gain
for the first time in four sessions. The technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index gained 22.35 points, or 1.7%, to 1,380.17, after
sinking to five-year lows over the last two sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volumes were strong in early trading, but tapered off in
the afternoon as the bond market closed early and many traders
slipped out ahead of today's holiday, when U.S. financial markets
will be closed.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case Monday and Tuesday, much of the Nasdaq volume was
due to heavy trading in WorldCom, which rose 12 cents to 22 cents a
share on volume of more than 1 billion shares.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about potential terrorist attacks today kept many
investors on edge, analysts said, but the market may be poised for a
snapback after weeks of decline. Wednesday's late rally added to
those hopes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. markets are scheduled to close early Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Economic news was mixed. Monthly factory orders came in better
than expected, but a key gauge of the services sector disappointed
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on short-term Treasury securities dipped while they inched
up on longer-term issues.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar fell against the yen and rose against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Among the market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Chipmaker AMD fell 37 cents to $8.43 after cutting its quarterly
sales forecast for the second time in two weeks. Rival Intel advanced
$1.18 to $17.75.</TE>
<TE>   * AOL Time Warner added $1.54 to $14.06, and Viacom rose $1.05 to
$43. Investors have been dumping shares of media companies, in part
because of accounting worries.</TE>
<TE>   * Battered wireless stocks surged 14%, the biggest sector gainer
in the S&amp;P 500. Sprint's PCS Group, down 80% this year, rose 61 cents
to $4.91. AT&amp;T Wireless Services added 75 cents to $5.76.</TE>
<TE>   * Home Depot jumped $3.10 to $36.85, boosting the Dow. Other
retailers also rose, as investors bet a resurgent economy will spur
consumer spending. Wal-Mart Stores jumped $1.62 to $55.04, Target
advanced $1.29 to $37.05, and Dillard's added 87 cents to $25.56.</TE>
<TE>   * GE sank as investors were spooked by scandals at other
companies. GE at one point fell to lows unseen since October 1998,
but closed down only 20 cents, to $27.90.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets tumbled again, in part on continued weakness in
Vivendi Universal shares, which lost more than 11%. Britain's FT-100
index fell 3.4% to its lowest level since April 1997.</TE>

<HD>IRS Seeks End to Tax Break on Perk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday proposed to sweep away the
tax break in a life insurance perquisite many companies give
executives.</LD>
<LD>   In proposed new regulations, the agency said executives should pay
annual income tax on the cash accumulated in universal and whole life
insurance policies when their company pays the premiums. The IRS said
the payments amount to an interest-free loan.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS reversed a decision in February that suggested taxes were
owed only on the cash value when a policy is terminated, tax and
compensation experts say. An estimated 115,000 executives and
employers will be affected by the rule, the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   "The employee is going to have to come up with the cash to pay for
this tax," said Ivan Taback, a senior lawyer in the personal planning
department at law firm Proskauer Rose in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules deal with the tax on so-called split-dollar
life insurance arrangements, or ownership and premium payment
arrangements that involve some kind of cash-value life insurance such
as whole, universal or variable universal life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies offer such policies to executives as a form of
compensation by paying premiums on insurance held by the executive or
by a trust set up by the executive.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS became concerned about the arrangements in 1996 because
investment accounts funded with corporate dollars were building up
cash value tax-free for the executives.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is seeking comments on the proposal until Sept. 7.</TE>

<LD>Credit Suisse Group said Lukas Muehlemann will step down as chairman
and Switzerland's second-largest bank may report a loss for the first
half of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The Zurich-based company, parent of U.S. brokerage giant CS First
Boston, also replaced Thomas Wellauer, 46, the head of banking and
insurance, amid "substantial losses" at the firm's Winterthur
Insurance unit. Credit Suisse called Oswald Gruebel, 59, out of
retirement to run the business.</LD>
<LD>   "The market wants to see a few scalps," said Henry Rising, a fund
manager at Christows Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   Muehlemann, 52, who will remain as chief executive, has been
criticized for his acquisitions in recent years, and for CS First
Boston's $100-million settlement with U.S. regulators earlier this
year over allegations of initial public stock offering manipulation.</TE>

<HD>Sharing the Beach With Pollution</HD>
<DH>With sewage rules stifled, a dip can be sickening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BECKMAN and NANCY STONER</AU>
<BD>David Beckman and Nancy Stoner are senior attorneys at
the Natural Resources Defense Council.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vacation season is now in full swing, with families across the
country flocking to their favorite travel destinations. For many
Americans, that means packing swim trunks, piling into the car and
heading straight for the water. Summer is all about the sun, the
surf, the sand and, unfortunately, the sewage.</LD>
<LD>   These days, pollution from clogged or broken sewer systems is too
often an unwelcome visitor in our recreational waters.</LD>
<LD>   When sewer systems are not properly maintained or they get
overloaded, untreated wastewater flows from our toilets into
waterways instead of the treatment plants.</LD>
<TE>   The federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates that sewage
spills occur about 40,000 times a year. Sewage pollution causes fish
kills and shellfish contamination and last year accounted for more
than 2,200 beach closings and advisories nationwide, according to the
Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California residents are all too familiar with sewage
pollution. Los Angeles, with its 6,500 miles of sewers--nearly half
of which are at least 50 years old--reported 682 sewage spills last
year. As a result, the city has found itself in federal litigation
with local environmental organizations such as the Santa Monica
BayKeeper and homeowners who suffer not only from the spills but from
continuing odors. To its credit, the EPA also has joined the fray to
fight the sewage problem in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sewage in the water can do more than disrupt the fishing or spoil
a day at the beach. Every year millions of Americans get sick from
swimming in rivers, lakes and coastal waters contaminated with raw
sewage. The most common illness is gastroenteritis, which can cause
fever, vomiting and diarrhea. People exposed to pathogens in
sewage-contaminated water also can contract respiratory illnesses,
dysentery and hepatitis. The health risk is greater for children and
people with weakened immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Although swimming-related illnesses usually are not severe or
life-threatening, they are inconvenient and unpleasant at best and
often result in lost work time, as well as ruined vacations.</TE>
<TE>   So what's being done to address this widespread problem?</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, the federal government announced regulations to
minimize sewer spills into waterways and require sewer operators to
notify the public when they happen. The EPA estimates the cost of
implementing the regulations at just $1.92 annually per U.S.
household. The cost pales in comparison with billions of dollars in
revenue generated by water-based tourism. After all, beaches are the
top U.S. vacation destination. When you consider the economic benefit
of water-based tourism, investing in monitoring sewage spills and
notifying the public clearly pays off.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Bush administration will not let the EPA
implement the new rules. The administration refuses to require sewer
system monitoring or to make sewer operators notify local officials
and citizens when sewage contamination threatens human health.</TE>
<TE>   With the summer beach season in full swing, it's time for the
administration to reassess its position. A crackdown on sewage
contamination not only would make for happier summer vacations across
the country but also would keep related water-based economies strong.
This kind of win-win outcome would benefit everyone who wants to take
a dip in the water this summer.</TE>

<AU>PETER DREIER and DICK FLACKS</AU>
<BD>Peter Dreier teaches politics and public policy at
Occidental College and is co-author of "Place Matters: Metropolitics
for the 21st Century"(University Press of Kansas, 2001). Dick Flacks
teaches sociology at UC Santa Barbara and is author of "Making
History: The American Left and the American Mind" (Columbia
University Press, 1989).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This Fourth of July is likely to be the most fervent in many years.
Since Sept. 11, the nation has seen a dramatic increase in public
expressions of patriotism, including displays of the flag, songs,
parades and red, white and blue everything. Most pundits interpret
this as a sign that the nation is in a conservative mood, but the
reality is more complicated. Loyalty to country is neither
conservative nor liberal. How one expresses one's patriotism depends
on the core values one associates with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   A case in point is the current controversy over the Pledge of
Allegiance. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the
words "under God" in the pledge violate the 1st Amendment was an
incredible act of bad political timing. Thanks to the uproar,
however, Americans learned a valuable history lesson. The original
version of the pledge did not include that phrase or any reference to
religion. "Under God" was added by Congress in 1954 when many
politicians thought the nation was threatened by godless communism.</LD>
<TE>   Lost in the public dispute is any understanding of what its
author, Francis Bellamy, was trying to accomplish--or its relevance
for today. Bellamy, a Baptist minister, wrote the pledge in 1892
during the Gilded Age, when reformers were outraged by the behavior
of corporate robber barons who were exploiting workers, gouging
consumers and corrupting politics with their money. Bellamy was a
leading Christian socialist who hoped that the pledge, and especially
the line "one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all,"
would promote a more egalitarian vision. Bellamy penned the pledge
for Youth's Companion, a magazine for young people. A few years
earlier, the magazine had sponsored a largely successful campaign to
sell American flags to public schools. In 1891, the magazine hired
Bellamy to organize a campaign to celebrate the 400th anniversary of
Christopher Columbus' discovery. Bellamy gained the support of the
National Education Assn., President Benjamin Harrison and Congress
for a national ritual observance in the schools, and he wrote the
Pledge of Allegiance as part of the program's flag salute ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy's view that unbridled capitalism, materialism and
individualism betrayed America's promise was widely shared in the
19th and early 20th centuries. Many American radicals and progressive
reformers proudly asserted their patriotism. To them, the U.S. stood
for basic democratic values: economic and social equality, mass
participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties,
elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial
minorities, a welcome mat for the world's oppressed people.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans are unaware that much of our patriotic
culture--including many of the symbols and songs that have become
increasingly popular since Sept. 11--were created by writers of
decidedly left-wing sympathies.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Emma Lazarus' words, written in 1883 and inscribed on the
Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled
masses yearning to breathe free." She was a well-respected poet, a
strong supporter of Henry George's "socialistic" single-tax program
and a friend of William Morris, a leading British socialist. Her
welcome to the "wretched refuse" of the Earth was meant to project an
inclusive and egalitarian definition of the American dream.</TE>
<TE>   The words to "America the Beautiful" were written in 1893 by
Katherine Lee Bates, a professor of English at Wellesley College.
Bates was a poet and a lesbian whose book "America the Beautiful and
Other Poems" expressed outrage over U.S. imperialism in the
Philippines. She was part of progressive reform circles in the Boston
area concerned about labor rights, urban slums and women's suffrage.
The poem's final line--"and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea
to shining sea"--is an appeal for social justice.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans consider Woody Guthrie's song "This Land Is Your
Land," penned in 1940, to be our unofficial national anthem. Guthrie
was inspired to write it as an answer to Irving Berlin's popular "God
Bless America," which he thought failed to recognize that America
belonged to "the people." The lyrics reflect Guthrie's fusion of
patriotism and support for the underdog. He celebrates the nation's
natural beauty and bounty but criticizes the country for its failure
to share its riches, reflected in the song's last and least-known
verse: "One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple / By
the relief office I saw my people. / As they stood hungry I stood
there wondering / If this land was made for you and me?"</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, Bruce Springsteen has most closely followed in
the Guthrie tradition. From "Born in the USA" to his songs about Tom
Joad (the militant protagonist in John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of
Wrath") to "Land of Hope and Dreams" to his "My City of Ruins," which
he recently dedicated to the victims of the Sept. 11 tragedy,
Springsteen has championed the downtrodden while challenging the
nation to live up to its ideals. Every day, millions of Americans
recite the Pledge of Allegiance, sing "American the Beautiful" or
"This Land Is Your Land" and memorize the words on the Statue of
Liberty without knowing the names of their authors or the political
context in which they were written. The progressive authors of much
of the nation's patriotic iconography rejected blind nationalism,
militaristic drumbeating and sheep-like conformism. They believed
that America's core claims--fairness, equality, freedom,
justice--were their own.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism has diverted attention from the reality that
the U.S. now confronts a new Gilded Age. The gap between rich and
poor is widening. The unbridled greed and political
influence-peddling demonstrated by many executives of large
corporations has triggered another wave of public outrage. The
behavior of large HMOs and pharmaceutical companies angers Americans
who can't afford the cost of basic health care. The growing power of
American-based global firms that show no loyalty to this country in
terms of where they move their jobs, the taxes they pay or the
environment they pollute has led to a grass-roots movement for fairer
trade.</TE>
<TE>   The recent controversy over the pledge has focused on the words
"under God." But if Francis Bellamy were alive today,  he'd be more
concerned that the actions of big business and many politicians were
undermining his vision of a nation that promises "liberty and justice
for all."</TE>

<HD>Justice O'Connor Swings a Mighty Vote</HD>
<DH>She dictates huge changes based on her own priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University and teaches a course on the Constitution and the Supreme
Court.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On this Independence Day, a few citizens may pause between burgers
and beers to consider this country's long struggle against the
pernicious practice of one-person rule.</LD>
<LD>   With the end of the Supreme Court's term last week, it is not
clear that this struggle has been nearly as successful as our holiday
folklore might suggest. Even as we commemorate our rejection of one
supreme leader in 1776, lawyers and politicians are studying the
latest social and legal decisions mandated by another: Associate
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</LD>
<LD>   Because of her position as the perennial "swing vote" on a divided
Supreme Court, O'Connor continues to dictate massive changes for the
nation based on her own highly evolving views and priorities.</LD>
<TE>   This term alone, O'Connor's concurring opinions produced sweeping
changes in areas ranging from drug-testing of high school students to
the entanglement of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, we have come to accept a new reality: As O'Connor
changes, so does the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The division on the court means that we effectively have a Supreme
Court of one in many areas. In a study of the 1999 term, O'Connor
held the highest percentage of voting with the majority in decisions,
a whopping 85% of the time. This gives her a remarkable level of
power because the court often splits 5 to 4 in the most important
cases, as was the case in 26 out of 85 cases in the 2000 term.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, every term is preceded by commentators debating how
O'Connor currently views abortion or the death penalty or federalism.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor is not alone in this pivotal role. Associate Justice
Anthony Kennedy also has become a trump player in some areas. Yet, on
the major social issues, it has more often been O'Connor who is
positioned to dictate the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor's swing votes have fundamentally changed rules in a host
of controversial areas. Other areas linger in an uncertain status.
For example, because of her past criticism of Roe vs. Wade, there is
an annual O'Connor-watch to determine whether she will maintain,
restrict or extinguish the right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor has repeatedly played this role of judicial Hamlet,
staring into the skull of constitutional doctrine and contemplating
its sudden demise. For example, she was previously the key concurring
vote to bar the government from giving money to religious schools to
prevent the entanglement of church and state. This year, however,
O'Connor felt more comfortable with some entanglement and exercised
her trump vote to allow school vouchers and to effectively rewrite
church-state doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, it is perfectly legitimate for O'Connor's
views to evolve and for her to support changes advocated by other
members. It is the structure of the court, and not O'Connor, that is
to blame for this situation.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of this problem is not what the Constitution says but
what it does not say.</TE>
<TE>   In establishing the Supreme Court, the framers left out an
intriguing little detail: how many people would sit on the court. As
a result, the number of justices has actually fluctuated through the
years from a low of five members in 1801 to a high of 10 in 1863.
There have been eight different configurations through the years.</TE>
<TE>   Our current number is dictated only by tradition.</TE>
<TE>   This tradition was challenged in 1937 by President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, who grew so exasperated with the court striking down his
New Deal program that he stated an intention to increase the court to
15 members. Roosevelt never carried out this threat. He did not have
to. One justice switched sides after the threat and voted in favor of
some of Roosevelt's programs, a change that became known as the
"switch in time that saved nine."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, I have long believed that Roosevelt was right for the
wrong reason. Capping the court at nine justices was a terrible idea
and made the current problem of one-person rule inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   A better option would be to increase the size of the court to 19
members, roughly the size of a standard circuit court. This would
serve to reduce the individual importance of justices and foster a
greater array of perspectives on this court.</TE>
<TE>   Such an expanded court could still produce close splits, but it
would be less likely that a single justice would be viewed as
determinative in most of these close cases.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I will celebrate the Fourth with my wife and three boys
with our annual flag-raising and off-key version of "God Bless
America." I will then think of the many things I love about this
country and pray that in the coming term O'Connor likes them too.</TE>

<HD>Europe's Dirty Little Secret</HD>
<DH>Deep within, crass America is appreciated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anti-Americanism is alive and well on the Continent, as it is in much
of the rest of the world, but it appears to have taken on a
distinctly Freudian quality.</LD>
<LD>   If Europe is the superego--better yet, if NATO and the European
Union give voice to the European superego--the United States embodies
the id. If, in their own eyes, Europeans are the courtiers, Americans
are the cowboys enacting Europe's repressed desires.</LD>
<LD>   We may be the bad guys with the guns, but traveling in Europe, one
gets the feeling that more than a few Europeans secretly still
approve of what we are doing. They just can't bring themselves to
admit it in the light of day. Interestingly, this superego/id
relationship mirrors a similar and long-standing dynamic in American
politics. Democrats and Republicans serve as each other's ids.
President Clinton and Gary Condit were crucified for their
involvement with Monica Lewinsky and Chandra Levy, respectively,
while naughty Henry Hyde and Robert Livingston just slunk away after
their indiscretions were revealed. Why? Because it's a trade.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans pander to the Christian right's notions of marital
fidelity while pasting the shame for their own dalliances on the
horny Democrats. Likewise, by blaming Republicans for corporate
greed--Enron, WorldCom, etc.--Democrats keep their blue-collar
respectability while lining their pockets with the same gold.</TE>
<TE>   European liberals and leftists do the same with American
conservatives. We are a useful caricature of wealth and jingoism onto
which outwardly decorous Europeans can affix their guilty but
eminently understandable desires for a tough stand in the war on
terror and a thriving democratic capitalist economy.</TE>
<TE>   These feelings sometimes get expressed in interesting, subliminal
ways. While the European governments loudly slam the U.S. for the war
on terrorism and the Iraq and the Middle East issues, I saw more than
a few adults walking with their children (too young to read) whom
they had dressed in T-shirts that said things like "Peace by Superior
Force" and "Practical Peace." The shirts had pictures of guns or
tanks below the slogans. Other adults wore their own propaganda. One
T-shirt said, "Dollars &amp; Gold." Another said, "You can never be too
rich." They were written in English. People around the world have
always worn T-shirts with American slogans on them, but now it's
especially startling to see cartoon versions of greed and violence
esteemed so boldly, given the widely expressed European disapproval
of U.S. foreign and economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   Is this the difference between the intellectual policymakers and
the man on the street? Maybe. It may also be the difference between
public and private opinion.</TE>
<TE>   More left-leaning Europeans than most might suspect will
admit--sotto voce--that they were mighty glad that a Republican was
in office on Sept. 11. They may not vote that way, but they recognize
the necessity of President Bush's policies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite public outcry for the Palestinians, deep down many
probably know that their own security depends in part on Israel's (as
well as on Afghanistan's, Pakistan's and India's) and on the use of
"superior force" in the face of Islamic extremism.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain. Europeans are every bit as frightened as we
are, a fear that manifests itself mostly in xenophobia. I saw a lot
of swastikas scrawled on walls, next to graffiti that said things
such as "Europe for Europeans."</TE>
<TE>   If this is any indication of nationalistic fervor, it goes well
beyond anti-Semitism to include everyone who isn't "European." That
means Islamic militants because they cause trouble, Jews because they
are targets and Americans because, as in the world wars, we bring a
necessary evil Europeans wish they didn't need and a realpolitik they
are, perhaps, ashamed of secretly endorsing.</TE>

<LD>Trust us. That's the message at the Los Angeles Unified School
District from the people in charge of fixing old schools and building
new ones. But trust has to be earned, built on a foundation of full
and timely information. District officials flunked that test when
they didn't do their homework on 3D/International Inc.--a company
recently kicked off a Maryland schools construction project--before
asking the school board to pay the firm millions to supervise repair
work in Los Angeles. That's no way to protect public money.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks ago, school board member Mike Lansing asked the
district staff to investigate a tip that one of the LAUSD's potential
awardees had been terminated from a construction management project
in another school district. He had the wrong company name, and LAUSD
officials found nothing. They didn't look hard enough.</LD>
<LD>   Times staff writer Doug Smith broke the story on the day the board
was scheduled to vote on $33 million in contracts for a joint venture
that included 3D/I. Last month, the Baltimore County school system
terminated a contract with 3D/I because of possible asbestos
contamination at two elementary schools.</LD>
<TE>   That controversy may have no bearing on the work by a different
team from 3D/I and URS Corp., its partner in the L.A. venture. But it
must be checked in a district that wasted millions of dollars on
construction of the Belmont Learning Complex and, long after
Proposition BB bond money became available, still had not installed
air conditioning in many San Fernando Valley schools.</TE>
<TE>   At the June 25 board meeting, James A. O'Connell, the head of the
district's construction management services, recommended an
investigation. Mark him tardy.</TE>
<TE>   School board members have asked LAUSD Inspector General Don
Mullinax to scrutinize 3D/I before they vote on a contract. Mullinax
will probe the firm's background, business practices, litigation
history and any violations of regulations. But why stop at one
company? The board should direct the inspector general to vet all
applicants for major contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD has a history of disclosure problems, excessive
management fees and work performance complaints involving firms that
now are owned by 3D/I-URS.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer says problems between the district and those
companies are in the past. Fine. Then no one should object to the
independent scrutiny that Mullinax will bring now and in the future
to the LAUSD contracting process, because, goodness knows, this
district needs all the help it can get.</TE>

<LD>Legend has it that an early draft of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's speech to Congress after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor
called Dec. 7, 1941, "a date which will live in history." The
president, with a keen ear for language, scratched out "history" and
wrote in "infamy." He knew the symbolic power of one word--and one
date.</LD>
<LD>   Here we are today on the first July 4th after Sept. 11th, both
days etched in history and memory for different reasons. So much has
happened. We know that. And so little has changed. We need reminding
there. We're at war, the president says, and it's bound to be a long
one with more chapters than we imagine. The Taliban has been ousted
and the tedious process of constructing Afghan democracy has begun.
But, four months out from U.S. midterm elections, the camouflage of
bipartisanship has evaporated in Washington politics and battle
metaphors reign again.</LD>
<LD>   The United States celebrates its 226th birthday today, wounded for
sure, flustered perhaps, but still going strong as the world's
brightest beacon of tolerance, liberty and opportunity. At least 19
terrorists came here to end their lives and commit homicidal mayhem
against innocent civilians. But millions of people over the years
have come here to begin new lives and build things.</LD>
<TE>   Buildings go up and come down for one reason or, alas, another.
But the idea of the United States has proven to be far stronger than
any individual or physical structure. That's because the idea of
freedom and democracy, as written and approved on that distant July
4th, taps into the wondrous human creativity and imagination of the
myriad souls who've lived here, worked here and added their own
dollop of personal effort and inspiration to this grand, imperfect
experiment in democracy. It's a noisy, raucous place at times, even
rude, crude and overbearing. But over two centuries, no other
enduring nation has strove so consistently for openness and
self-improvement.</TE>
<TE>   We need to recall that amid the holiday hoopla. The hot dogs this
year will taste pretty much the same. Some parades may be a tad
longer. More spectators might stand respectfully when the flag passes
or the national anthem plays. The fireworks tonight may make us think
of more lethal explosions elsewhere. In sum, we're more aware today
of what we've had all along.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago in this same space, talking about appreciating the
fragile democratic heritage launched by the founding fathers July 4,
1776, we wrote: " ... then one day what we thought we appreciated is
somehow gone forever and the word 'appreciate' takes on a much deeper
meaning. That's the feeling that ought to rise in our heads and
hearts for a few minutes today." In the end, it seems the message
from one Fourth of July to another is exactly the same. We're what's
changed.</TE>

<LD>On the centennial of the establishment of Yellowstone National Park
in 1972, President Nixon observed, "Parklands and wilderness become
more precious to us with each passing year, and the forces that
mitigate against them intensify."</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years later, it's the government doing the mitigating. In
late June, the Bush administration announced it would almost
certainly roll back the ban on driving snowmobiles in Yellowstone
that was scheduled to start in late 2003. Commerce and machines
triumph over nature.</LD>
<LD>   The decision will not be final until this fall, but National Park
Service officials announced a tentative plan to permit the use of
snowmobiles with newer, quieter and less-polluting engines. The
details, including how many machines to allow, still have to be
worked out. But forget the details. Tourists have no more business
tearing through our first national park on snowmobiles than they do
skateboarding down the halls of Congress with boomboxes on their
shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   Last Thursday, 127 members of the U.S. House rallied on the
Capitol steps in favor of imposing the ban by legislation. Senators
followed. Among the leaders are Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco)
and Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.).</TE>
<TE>   Each winter, as many as 63,000 snowmobilers roar over more than
200 miles of road, mainly on the routes to Old Faithful from West
Yellowstone and the south entrance. The Clinton administration
approved the ban in 2000 after more than 10 years of study, which,
the Environmental Protection Agency said, represented an "extremely
thorough and credible body of human health, environmental and
wildlife science."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration promptly declared that the ban was based
on poor science and failure to consult with local officials and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In the review the administration ordered, the public again
overwhelmingly supported the ban, and so did the EPA. No matter. The
outcome was rigged from the start in favor of the snowmobile folk, a
few businesses and a handful of local politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Someone needs to remind President Bush of the second word in
"Yellowstone National Park." Americans expect their government to
understand that such places are precious to people in all 50 states
and to stand up to the forces that would shatter their increasingly
rare serenity.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Extends Bosnia Missions</HD>
<DH>Policy: The mandate will last 12 more days. Dispute on
exempting Americans from a global court is unresolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Averting a midnight shutdown of U.N. missions in Bosnia but
continuing a broader dispute between the U.S. and its European allies
over a new international court, the Security Council voted late
Wednesday to extend peacekeeping operations in the Balkan nation for
12 more days.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came after the council members failed to reach
agreement on U.S. proposals to exempt American peacekeepers--and
possibly all peacekeepers--from the jurisdiction of the International
Criminal Court, which became operational this week.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. had insisted going into Wednesday's negotiations that it
would veto an extension of the missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina if its
soldiers were not shielded from the court's reach. But Washington
later backed down and agreed to allow time for more talks.</LD>
<TE>   Without the last-minute extension, the legal mandate for the two
peacekeeping missions in Bosnia would have expired at midnight EDT,
following a U.S. refusal to vote to renew it unless the council added
provisions protecting peacekeepers there from prosecution before the
global tribunal. As one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, the U.S. holds veto power.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most such missions, the Bosnia efforts have a built-in
safety net in the event of their U.N. abandonment: NATO is already
leading the 18,000-strong peacekeeping force there, which includes
about 3,000 U.S. troops, and says it would continue to do so without
an endorsement by the world body. And the European Union was
preparing to take over management of a 1,600-member police training
program, which includes 46 American civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But without a solution to the more fundamental conflict, which
pits the Bush administration against its European allies,
peacekeeping operations scheduled for renewal this month in other
nations will prompt identical battles, U.S. and European diplomats
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has threatened to veto even those peacekeeping
missions in which no American personnel are deployed unless the U.N.
grants protection from prosecution for U.S. forces now and in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration maintains that American peacekeepers could
face politically motivated or malicious prosecutions at the hands of
the court, given the United States' role as the only remaining
superpower.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations during the last four days have failed to close the
gap between Washington's demand for immunity for U.S. soldiers and
the stance of officials abroad, and the mood among council members
here could be described as cautiously pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative to the United Nations
and the current council president, said after another full day of
discussions Wednesday that there had been "no momentum toward a
substantive resolution" of the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte acknowledged that "it has been
an uphill fight" for the United States here this week and declined to
predict that the Bush administration's view would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, U.S. diplomats circulated a proposed resolution
affecting not just Bosnia but all U.N. peacekeeping missions, with
some American officials privately predicting support from Bulgaria,
China, Syria, Russia and Mauritius--countries not normally in the
inner circle of support for U.S. initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   The draft resolution in effect would have granted all present,
former and future U.S. peacekeepers protection in perpetuity from the
international court by mandating a binding, annually renewed 12-month
exemption to the treaty for nations, like the U.S., that had not
signed the pact.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights lobbyists campaigning against the U.S. proposal
feared that Washington was close to the requisite nine-member council
majority. Neither Britain nor France would veto an American-sponsored
resolution with such wide support, European diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as discussions began Wednesday, the U.S. proposal was roundly
condemned inside and outside council chambers as an attempt to amend
by fiat an international treaty ratified by 76 nations and now in
legal force. Only China spoke positively of the U.S. initiative,
other council members said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation proposed some minor changes to the text, to
mixed response, while the French and British suggested alternative
resolutions invoking protections contained within the court treaty,
which U.S. officials had already rejected as insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to break the impasse, the council adjourned for the
four-day Fourth of July holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has really slammed the door shut on our proposals,"
Negroponte said, "and it was on that basis that we agreed to continue
these discussions next week."</TE>
<TE>   Negroponte declined to comment on an unexpectedly caustic letter
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, copies of which were given to council members before the
afternoon's deliberations here.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole system of United Nations peacekeeping is being put at
risk" by the hard-line U.S. stance, Annan said. Contending that the
International Criminal Court already provides sufficient protection
for U.S. and other peacekeepers, Annan said the prospect of
politicized or frivolous prosecutions is "highly improbable."</TE>
<TE>   If the council were to adopt the U.S. resolution, it would be
discredited in the eyes of the world, Annan asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting downstairs at the U.N. headquarters during the Security
Council debate this week were delegates from 139 signatory countries
to the criminal court, who are drawing up rules for the selection of
judges and prosecutors. In an unusual move, the delegates issued a
statement Wednesday unanimously urging the council to resolve the
peacekeeping dispute in a manner that "fully respects the letter and
the spirit" of the treaty forming the court.</TE>
<TE>   "This is traditional diplomatic language, but the message is
crystal clear," said a European delegate, who asked not to be named.
"The U.S. is proposing a blanket solution for all eternity for all
peacekeepers, like it or not, and this cannot be accepted."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Ambassador Paul Heinbecker was less oblique, blasting the
U.S. for "sending the unacceptable message that peacekeepers are
above the law." Heinbecker argued to the court gathering that
Washington could protect its forces by not participating in missions
"where it believed its troops would be at risk" and by negotiating
bilateral assurances with host countries that U.S. personnel would
not be handed over to international tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   "There is therefore no reason for other states to be prevented
from carrying out U.N. peacekeeping operations, particularly as it is
other states that contribute the vast majority of personnel to these
operations," Heinbecker said.</TE>
<TE>   Friction with allies might intensify, though, if the Bush
administration demands blanket immunity from the court in countries
with a large U.S. military presence, such as Germany, Japan and South
Korea--all strong supporters of the new tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   But pressure for more aggressive U.S. action against the court is
mounting in Washington, where both houses of Congress have passed
similar bills calling for the denial of U.S. military aid to most
countries that are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization if their governments ratify or otherwise "collaborate"
with the Hague-based tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed American Servicemembers Protection Act, or ASPA,
would prohibit U.S. soldiers from appearing before the court as
defendants or witnesses and--in Section 3008, a provision that raised
eyebrows and hackles in the Netherlands--authorize the use of force
to rescue U.S. military personnel turned over to the court by third
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The Netherlands, a NATO partner and close ally of the United
States, was not particularly amused by Section 3008, which has led
some to refer to ASPA as the 'Hague Invasion Act,' " the Dutch
ambassador to Washington, Boudewijn van Eenennaam, said in a speech
last week. "Even though we do not deem an American invasion of the
Netherlands an imminent threat, we do think the language was ill
considered, to say the least."</TE>

<HD>Alert System Down in Air Collision</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Germany opens criminal probe as Swiss disagree on
whether safety rules were met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UEBERLINGEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>A collision-warning system was out of service at the Zurich air
traffic control tower when a chartered Russian airliner and a DHL
cargo plane collided over southern Germany, Swiss authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The revelation threw Swiss air traffic spokesmen into confusion
over whether, under those circumstances, a controller who took a
break at the time and left just one colleague responsible for the
sector where the Monday night collision occurred had violated
regulations. By Wednesday evening it appeared that the action might
have gone against routine procedure but did not technically break any
rules.</LD>
<LD>   Still, German prosecutors in the city of Konstanz opened a
criminal investigation into the collision, which killed all 71 people
aboard the two planes, and said they expect to question the flight
controllers.</LD>
<TE>   Swiss air traffic control took charge of the flight paths of both
planes shortly before the collision because they were flying through
the approach zone for Zurich airport. Traffic was light at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Herr, a spokesman for Swiss air traffic control, said it
was "a purely theoretical question" whether the disaster would have
been avoided had the system been working. "Many signs point to an
exceptionally unlucky combination of circumstances," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities revised the number of Russian children
known to have been on the Tupolev-154 passenger jet to 45 from 52.
Sergei Kolesnikov, general director of the Kreks travel agency in
Ufa, in Russia's Bashkir republic, said seven other people boarded
the flight after buying last-minute tickets through a Moscow travel
agency. Their ages were not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   The children, mainly from the political elite of the oil-rich,
predominantly Muslim region, were headed for a beach vacation in
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Flags in the Bashkir republic flew at half-staff, and three days
of mourning were declared. State television showed parents and other
relatives sobbing and comforting one another. One father watched a
home video of his daughter, Julia, playing and laughing. "She was so
bright and versatile. She gave us so much hope. We were going to send
her abroad to study when she graduated," Rim Sufiyanov said. Julia
died on the eve of her 15th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "Daughter, daughter, please forgive me for sending you on this
trip," wept a mother, who was not identified by name, stretching her
hands toward the sky.</TE>
<TE>   About 140 relatives of the victims prepared to fly today to
southern Germany to visit the place where the planes fell, to pray
for their loved ones, collect handfuls of earth and place flowers.
They were to be accompanied by physicians and psychologists to help
them through the ordeal before returning to Russia tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They just want to see the place where [their children] spent
their last moments," said the Bashkir republic's deputy prime
minister, Khalyaf Ishmuratov.</TE>
<TE>   Germany said it would waive visa requirements for those who had
not had time to obtain proper travel documents.</TE>
<TE>   Visual identification might be difficult in many cases, and
relatives will not necessarily see the corpses or body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "We will spare the relatives from having to look at the bodies,"
police spokesman Michael Kuhn said. "The identifications will be made
by autopsy, pieces of clothing or personal possessions. If necessary,
DNA will also be used."</TE>
<TE>   Parents were being asked to bring items such as toothbrushes to
help with DNA identification.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
President Bush sent condolences "on behalf of the United States to
all the families of the victims of this tragic air accident and also
to the people of Russia for their loss on this sad day."</TE>
<TE>   In Ueberlingen, near the crash site, police said 10 more bodies
were found Wednesday, bringing the total recovered to 38.</TE>
<TE>   Russian investigators were on the scene. They focused on a large
section of the Bashkirian Airlines jet's fuselage, which still had
some bodies strapped in the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Work crews were preparing to move pieces of the wreckage to the
airport in nearby Friedrichshafen for further investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian pilot began descending about 25 seconds before the
collision occurred 35,000 feet over Lake Constance, according to
German authorities. About the same moment, the DHL Airways Boeing 757
jet, with two people on board, also cut its altitude, apparently in
response to its on-board collision avoidance system.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian plane was headed from Moscow to Barcelona, and the
cargo plane was en route to Brussels from Bahrain, after a stopover
in Bergamo, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Maag, chief of the Zurich control tower, said Wednesday that
the controller who took a break while the on-ground collision warning
system was being serviced had violated regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "Two men have to work on a sector when the system is down," Maag
said in comments broadcast by a Swiss radio station. The second
controller "was not allowed to leave his workstation." Maag made
similar statements to other media. He also declined to rule out the
possibility that the second controller's absence might have
contributed to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Later Wednesday, other spokesmen said the break was permitted.</TE>
<TE>   "The presence of two men is the habit," traffic control spokesman
Alain Rossier said. "But when traffic allows it and the one who stays
agrees, a single-man operation is also possible and allowed--not only
in Switzerland but also in many other countries."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss air traffic control later issued a press release that
stated: "Mr. Maag ... has given an unclear statement ... in an
unfortunately already published interview. It fits with official
regulations for one of two traffic controllers to take a break after
agreement with each other.... Operation procedures for night duty
allow such behavior, which does not violate regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss air traffic control on Tuesday had been forced to revise its
version of how much warning the Russian pilot had that he was on a
collision course. It initially said that the Tupolev-154 had been
given nearly two minutes' notice and that the pilot did not begin
descending to avoid the cargo jet until after receiving a third
request.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss revised their account to confirm a statement by the
German government agency for air accident investigations that the
Russian pilot was given only about 50 seconds' warning to change
altitude and that he reacted after a second notice.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, in footage on Russian
television, said he had spoken with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder "and he told me Germany will do everything necessary to
ensure an objective investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Russians have resented the implication in the early statements by
Swiss air traffic officials that the Russian pilot was responsible
for the collision because he did not immediately respond to the
command to begin an emergency descent.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to airline officials, who have accused Swiss air
control of failing to prevent the accident, the State Civil Aviation
Service of Russia's Transport Ministry said Russia would not
speculate on the reasons for the collision pending the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to gather all facts and ensure their thorough
analysis," said Vladimir Rudakov, a senior investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Retzlaff of The Times' Berlin Bureau and Sergei L. Loiko
of the Moscow Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Ethiopia Wants Its Pillaged Pillar</HD>
<DH>Antiquities: Ambassador tells Italy it has no more excuses
for keeping ancient obelisk in Rome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>What Ethiopian Ambassador Mengistu Hulluka can't figure out is why
influential Italians even want the 80-foot carved granite pillar that
stands, without any identification, at a smoggy Rome intersection.</LD>
<LD>   For Ethiopians, he said, the ancient Axum Obelisk, looted from his
country by dictator Benito Mussolini's forces in the prelude to World
War II, is a stolen symbol of national identity. But what is it for
Italians?</LD>
<LD>   "Is it a symbol of fascism?" he asked. "Is that what they are
after? That's what it reflects, really, if it remains in Rome."</LD>
<TE>   It might seem that the obelisk won't be here much longer, because
the Italian government has agreed to give it back. But it's already
agreed three times, in 1947, 1956 and 1997, and somehow the obelisk
still stands near Italy's former office for African colonies.</TE>
<TE>   The long dispute is part of a broader global battle over whether
art objects that were stolen decades or centuries ago, often by
colonial powers, should be returned to their countries of origin.</TE>
<TE>   This particular fight has escalated sharply in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   First, a lightning strike damaged the obelisk, breaking off about
six feet of granite in large chunks and provoking Ethiopian anger
that it hadn't been better protected.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at a world hunger summit in Rome, Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi blasted Italy for giving his country "the runaround" for
55 years "as one excuse after another is created to frustrate the
implementation of these agreements."</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime, the obelisk is subjected to the heavy traffic
and pollution of Rome, and provided no protection against the
elements," Meles said. "As a result, the obelisk has begun to crumble
... in front of the eyes of all of us gathered here, and in front of
the eyes of the world. I am sure you will all agree with me that this
is nothing short of an outrage."</TE>
<TE>   The summit was held in the headquarters of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization--which just happens to occupy the old
colonial office, with the obelisk right outside.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian government still maintains that it is going to give
the obelisk back, Mengistu said. But now it has decided--over
Ethiopia's strenuous objections--that the damage from the lightning
strike should be repaired first. Workers have already fenced in the
obelisk in preparation for that project.</TE>
<TE>   "Any restoration work that needs to be done should be done after
the obelisk is dismantled and taken back to its original place,"
Mengistu said. "We're a bit suspicious, really, [that] once it is
restored, they may keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, arguments against returning the obelisk have
focused on claims that it is safer in Rome than it would be in Axum,
that it might be damaged by a move and that it has been here so long
that it has become part of Italy's heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Those first two arguments were weakened, if not demolished, by the
May thunderbolt, and it is mainly right-wing nationalists who are
bold enough to claim that 65 years in Italy outweigh two millenniums
in Axum.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent changes of government in Italy and political upheaval,
wars or famine in Ethiopia played a role in the failure to implement
all three agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The obelisk, which has door and window designs on its sides, is
estimated to be about 2,000 years old and to weigh about 180 tons.
Mussolini ordered it taken in 1937 from the holy city of Axum, the
cradle of Ethiopia's civilization and a key site in the development
of Christianity in that country.</TE>
<TE>   The pillar was set up at its current site that same year both to
mark Italian power in Africa and to commemorate the 15th anniversary
of the fascist "March on Rome" that put Mussolini into power.</TE>
<TE>   Mussolini's display of the Axum Obelisk was also meant to echo the
deeds of Roman emperors who brought back monuments from ancient
Egypt, some of which can still be seen in Rome today.</TE>
<TE>   While numerous other obelisks still remain in Axum, the one in
Rome is one of the biggest and most elaborately carved.</TE>
<TE>   "The Italians really value very much their monuments, their
ruins," Mengistu said. "Consider how many tourists they are
attracting because of their ruins. We want to value the glories of
the past. This is really what we are after. [The obelisk] reflects
the past glory, and we want to show it to the international community
in its original place."</TE>
<TE>   Italy first agreed as part of a 1947 peace treaty to return the
obelisk and all other artistic, religious and historic objects taken
from Ethiopia after Italy's 1935 invasion. It returned some items but
not the obelisk. A second agreement was reached in 1956. Disputes
over shipping costs played a role in the breakdown of that deal.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 agreement had promised to return the obelisk by year's
end. After that deadline passed, some Italian officials cited the
1998-2000 border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea as a reason for
further delay.</TE>
<TE>   Ethiopia believes Italy used the fighting as an excuse, Mengistu
said. "My government believes it's not really out of concern for the
monument. We suspect it is a matter of keeping it longer here. That
is why the people are angry."</TE>
<TE>   Rarely spoken of is what could be the critical explanation for
Italy's behavior: fear that giving the obelisk back would open the
door to demands by other countries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Rino Serri, who was then undersecretary of foreign
affairs and a vocal supporter of quickly returning the obelisk,
alluded to this concern.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that perhaps certain circles in Italy and abroad are
afraid that a precedent will be set," Serri said.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the lightning strike converted one of the fiercest
opponents of returning the obelisk, former Culture Undersecretary
Vittorio Sgarbi, into one of the most high-profile proponents of
giving it back.</TE>
<TE>   Sgarbi said his opposition had been based mainly on the view that
this important cultural treasure faced the risk of damage if sent
back. It was brought to Italy in several pieces, and returning it
would require disassembling it and putting it back together again,
with what he believed would be serious risk of harm, he said. He no
longer sees that as an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Now because it's broken, we can give it back to them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Parliament responded to Italy's continued
foot-dragging with an angrily worded resolution approved June 18 by
an almost unanimous vote. "Failure to return the obelisk without
delay will be detrimental to bilateral relations between the two
countries," it declared.</TE>
<TE>   For Ethiopia to threaten Italy with a worsening of relations may
not seem like the most frightening thing in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But Mengistu said Rome genuinely wants to have influence in
Ethiopia and neighboring countries of the Horn of Africa, where Italy
traditionally has had significant business, cultural and diplomatic
ties. "Italy has a stake in Africa," Mengistu said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not just political leaders but ordinary Ethiopians who care
deeply about the obelisk issue, Mengistu added. "The whole country is
out to get this monument back," he said. "They consider it as their
own identity."</TE>
<TE>   Holley was recently on assignment in Rome.</TE>

<HD>Israel Shuts Out Palestinians' 'Supporters'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The nation's stepped-up policy of denying entry to
foreign activists hinders efforts to monitor conditions, rights
groups contend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>With Israeli troops reoccupying much of the West Bank, the government
has begun routinely barring foreign human rights activists deemed too
sympathetic to Palestinians from entering Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The practice has become so common that rights groups say it is
hampering the international community's ability to monitor and report
on human rights issues in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Under the policy, introduced in March but recently intensified as
troops have moved into more Palestinian-controlled areas, 35 would-be
visitors were turned back at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport near Tel
Aviv during the last week of June, according to figures provided by
the Interior Ministry. The airport is the principal port of entry for
international travelers seeking to reach the Palestinian territories.</LD>
<TE>   Many of those turned back were Italians who had been invited to
participate in a joint Israeli-Palestinian peace demonstration that
was subsequently canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen other activists, including 17 American citizens traveling
under the auspices of Fellowship of Reconciliation, a New York-based
pacifist group, were sent back to the United States on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to go to Gaza, Hebron, Bethlehem and other places
that are now closed military zones," said Tova Ellinson, spokeswoman
for the Interior Ministry, of the Americans who were sent away. "They
want to support the Palestinians who are for sure, now, our enemy.
Nobody, anywhere in the world, can go to a country and support its
enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Interior Minister Eli Yishai warned that "the
ministry does not, nor will it, allow those coming to support terror
and those out to harm the state of Israel into the country,
especially at such a difficult time."</TE>
<TE>   The policy, joked Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing opposition
in the Israeli parliament, is "having a direct personal impact" on
him because he takes telephone calls from the airport "all the time
now" from people being barred from entering the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship of Reconciliation delegates carried with them a
letter from Sarid saying they had an appointment with him. A
spokesman for the interfaith organization, which includes Muslims,
Jews and Christians, said its members had intended to visit
Palestinian-controlled areas and meet with Israeli politicians and
Jewish settlers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was our fourth trip this year, and we had not had any
problems previously," said Ben Rempell, assistant project coordinator
for the group's missions to Israel and the Palestinian-controlled
territories. "This time, the group left with the Israelis refusing to
provide a reason for why they were not being allowed into the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Sarid said the restrictions represent "a sort of collective
punishment. The authorities have no idea about the character and the
nature of the groups" that are being denied entry.</TE>
<TE>   Rights groups say the policy is particularly damaging at a time
when there is a large-scale Israeli military presence in
Palestinian-held areas and the crumbling Palestinian Authority is
unable to serve the needs of the besieged population.</TE>
<TE>   "It is much more comfortable to again invade the occupied
territories without being molested by human rights activists," said
Gaby Lasky, a lawyer with the Public Committee Against Torture in
Israel. The group is representing three activists, including one from
the United States, who were arrested in the Balata refugee camp in
the West Bank in May and slated for deportation. They have appealed
to the Israeli courts.</TE>
<TE>   The access of international organizations to the West Bank and
Gaza is particularly important, Lasky said, at a time when Israelis
are banned by their government for traveling to those areas because
of security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Many local human rights organizations depend on foreign staff
members, their language skills and professional expertise, in order
to pass their findings on to the outside word," Lasky said.</TE>
<TE>   Several human rights and legal aid organizations contacted by The
Times said they were studying the issue and might file appeals in
Israeli courts.</TE>
<TE>   The interior minister has broad leeway to ban almost anyone from
entering the country, said Michal Pinchuk, a lawyer with the Assn.
for Civil Rights in Israel. But "this is misuse of the interior
minister's authority to decide who comes into the country and who
doesn't. Being a human rights activist, by itself, should not be a
reason to deny someone from entering Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Citing security concerns, government spokesmen made no apologies
for a policy they say they were forced to institute after droves of
foreign activists were allowed entry at Ben Gurion, only to join
Palestinian demonstrations and sneak into cities and villages that
had been declared closed military zones.</TE>
<TE>   One group of activists charged into Yasser Arafat's Ramallah
headquarters in April, when the site was surrounded by Israeli
troops, vowing to serve as human shields to protect the Palestinian
Authority president. In the same month, another group entered
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, where they joined Palestinian
gunmen and others who had taken refuge there when Israeli troops
occupied the town. In each case, the activists were deported after
the standoffs ended.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to suffer with all this nonsense," said Daniel
Seaman, head of the Government Press Office. "We began the policy
when we started getting all these terrorist sympathizers coming to
Israel with the single purpose of causing disturbances."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Seaman said, "there are not that many tourists coming
here. So usually, if somebody is coming in, it is questionable what
the purpose of their coming is.... If some innocents are caught, too
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials are also discussing a plan to more closely
control the entry of journalists, Seaman said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel grants most visitors from Western countries a 90-day
tourist visa upon arrival. Journalists present a letter from their
employer to the Government Press Office and are issued credentials.
Reporters based here must obtain the type of work permit any visitor
must get to be legally employed.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman said the government is discussing a new system that would
require journalists to apply for visas in their home countries and
would create a special category of work permits for those based in
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "You have too many people coming here posing as supposed
journalists," Seaman said. "It is a loophole that is now a security
concern."</TE>
<TE>   He said that he knows of no instance in which those who
represented themselves as journalists to the press office were later
charged with security offenses, "but the system could be used by
somebody for such purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Israel, he said, has about 800 foreigners permanently based here
for international media organizations.</TE>

<HD>Israel to Lift Curfews; Gaza Stages Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Israel approved a plan Wednesday to gradually lift
daytime curfews that have locked hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians in their homes in West Bank cities. Meanwhile, in the
Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinians chanting "more attacks and
explosives belts" took to the streets to protest U.S. calls to
replace Yasser Arafat as Palestinian Authority president.</LD>
<LD>   Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
said the army will lift daytime curfews in seven major
Palestinian-ruled cities "so that normal life can be gradually
restored."</LD>
<LD>   Gissin said it would be left to Israeli commanders to determine
when the security situation permitted an easing of restrictions.
Israel will continue to keep 700,000 Palestinians confined to their
houses at night as the army hunts for militants it says are behind a
recent wave of bombings.</LD>
<TE>   Israel reoccupied Nablus, Tulkarm, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Kalkilya,
Jenin and Hebron after 26 Israelis were killed in two suicide
bombings last month.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has urged Palestinians to replace Arafat, saying he
and his Palestinian Authority have been irreparably tainted by
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But amid the U.S. demands for reforms, Jibril Rajoub denied news
reports this week that he had been dismissed as the powerful head of
preventive security in the West Bank. "I think someone is trying to
harm the whole security services and leak such lies and baseless
stories," said Rajoub, considered one of Arafat's potential
successors. Palestinian Authority sources said Arafat had received a
recommendation from his new interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh,
to fire Rajoub but was reluctant to act on it.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has set elections for January, but that has not been enough
to mollify the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City, thousands rallied in support of Arafat in one of the
biggest demonstrations by his Fatah movement in months.</TE>
<TE>   An activist from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of
Fatah that has carried out suicide bombings that have killed dozens
of Israelis, pledged over a loudspeaker that any Palestinian openly
challenging Arafat's leadership would be killed.</TE>

<HD>Flag Fever Dollars Go to Imports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 10 months after the terrorist attacks, sales of American flags
are still lighting up cash registers. But for some local apparel
manufacturers who took a flier on the flag-making business, it's the
twilight's last gleaming.</LD>
<LD>   They blame a flood of low-cost foreign-made flags that swept them
out of the banner trade almost as quickly as they entered it.
America, manufacturers said, can't resist a bargain, even if the
Stars and Stripes are stitched abroad.</LD>
<LD>   It's a familiar story for Southern California's garment makers,
who have been battling cheap imports for years. Still, it rankles
industry veterans such as Los Angeles textile maker Ali Zahedi, who
figured this was one product on which a "Made in USA" label would
give him an edge.</LD>
<TE>   Within days of Sept. 11, he and a handful of other nimble apparel
entrepreneurs were producing tens of thousands of car, porch and
hand-held flags to feed surging demand. But Yankee ingenuity was soon
trumped by globalization as more than 100 million foreign-made flags
hit U.S. shores in the last three months of 2001, according to
government trade data.</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi and others said profits quickly outstripped patriotism as
retailers shifted to cheaper imports.</TE>
<TE>   As if that weren't bad enough, eagle-eyed flag experts suspect
countless foreign-made flags have been passed off as domestic to
satisfy some consumers' desire to buy American.</TE>
<TE>   Flag Fabric Goes Unsold</TE>
<TE>   As flag dealers celebrate their best Fourth of July in a decade
and crowds stand to salute Old Glory, Zahedi finds himself sitting on
enough unsold flag fabric to give even Betsy Ross a case of the red,
white and blues.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 10,000 yards at least," said Zahedi, president of
Lafayette Textile Industries. "Once the imports hit, it was all
over."</TE>
<TE>   Like the rest of the nation, U.S. flag makers were caught off
guard by the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon. Despite their link with crackling fireworks and
drum-pounding parades, flags are a sleepy trade dominated by old-line
companies whose core product hasn't changed since Hawaii gained
statehood in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The peak selling season begins around Memorial Day and winds down
by Labor Day. Presidential elections provide a little fall excitement
for the flag industry every four years, but nothing like the outburst
of patriotism that swept the country after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when there was nothing in the pipeline, demand just
spiked" to unprecedented levels, said Tibor Egervary, director of
sales and marketing for Womelsdorf, Pa.-based Valley Forge Flag Co.,
one of the nation's largest manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Flag dealers ran out of stock within days as consumers snatched up
anything red, white and blue. With only five major domestic
manufacturers supplying the U.S. market and retailers desperate for
the product, quick-thinking entrepreneurs spotted an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, no region was more prepared to pounce than
Southern California. Apparel manufacturers here specialize in
quick-turn production, churning out small runs of up-to-the-minute
women's fashions at blazing speed, with products going from design to
department store shelves sometimes in a matter of days.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing an Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a Lycra bikini or multi-pocketed jeans festooned
with rhinestones and zippers, a simple rectangle printed with stars
and stripes would be a snap, reasoned David Glasberg, co-owner of
Vernon-based U.F.N. Textile Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Sept. 11, he had rounded up fabric, found a nearby
textile printer to press the design on the material, hired a local
plastics company to produce a holder and lined up seven area sewing
contractors to begin cranking out porch and car flags--200,000 of
them in the first week.</TE>
<TE>   "People think we don't make things here anymore, but they've got
short memories," Glasberg said. "When American industry is called on,
we can perform like nobody else."</TE>
<TE>   But the real engine of global textile and apparel production now
lies in Asia, whose manufacturers also had their eyes on the grand
old flag.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, foreign nations led by China exported more than 112
million U.S. flags of all sizes to the United States, virtually all
of them arriving during the last three months of the year, according
to the U.S. International Trade Commission.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with an average of 2 million annually over the
previous five years. Imports are still running strong, with about 9.6
million units arriving in the first four months of 2002. That's on
pace to beat the 14.1 million tallied in 1991 when the United States
saluted the troops of Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   But the fireworks have fizzled for local producers. Glasberg said
customers who rang his phones off the wall immediately after Sept. 11
have defected to foreign suppliers peddling Chinese-made car flags
for less than $1 each--20% less than it was costing Glasberg in labor
and materials.</TE>
<TE>   He has tried selling his remaining stock of more than 50,000 flags
via a Web site but so far hasn't found many takers. Though Glasberg
said he knew demand couldn't possibly continue at last fall's
frenetic pace, he blames cheap imports for torpedoing what could have
matured into a profitable sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Flag vendors said their summer sales are shaping up to be the
strongest since the Persian Gulf War and probably will be elevated
for years to come as a new generation embraces the colors.</TE>
<TE>   No one tracks domestic flag sales, and the industry is notoriously
secretive. Still, Fred Bretzloff, president of the National
Independent Flag Dealers Assn., said that his company's revenue this
season is up 50% from last summer and that many of his group's
members are reporting similar increases.</TE>
<TE>   "I've sold three truckloads of in-ground poles since 9/11 and
thousands of porch flagpoles," said Bretzloff, owner of Yankee Doodle
Flag Co. in Toledo, Ohio. "Flags eventually wear out, and people are
going to keep buying replacements."</TE>
<TE>   Like all members of his association, Bretzloff carries only
American-made products. It's a decision that cost him plenty in the
post-Sept. 11 frenzy, when he sold out his inventory within five days
and waited nearly two months for more stock. Foreign-made flags
became widely available within a short time.</TE>
<TE>   "Importers were flying them in by the plane load," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a Stand</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bretzloff refused to carry them despite the tantalizing
profit opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, he is a veteran and Toledo is a blue-collar union
town whose denizens might have hanged him from his own flagpole for
selling imports.</TE>
<TE>   But he also insists that all flags are not created equal. He said
the traditional American suppliers do extensive quality testing to
retard shredding and fading. His bestseller is a 3-foot-by-5-foot
nylon porch flag whose stars and stripes are stitched rather than
printed. That item retails for about $35 compared with less than $10
for a Chinese-made model that comes with mounting brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Though he commends Southern California's garment makers for their
entrepreneurial spirit, he said there is a lot more to flag-making
than slapping a design on fabric. He said their quick entry in the
bargain end of the business has put them squarely in the path of
low-cost foreign producers whose products are sold mainly through
discount chains.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine buying a foreign-made [American] flag, no matter
what it costs," Bretzloff said. "But there are plenty of them out
there."</TE>
<TE>   He isn't the only one dismayed. Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) was
so incensed by the foreign invasion that in October he introduced the
"Genuine American Flag Act" prohibiting the importation and sale of
foreign-made U.S. flags.</TE>
<TE>   That legislation has gone nowhere, and even staunch flag advocates
such as David Martucci, president of the North American
Vexillological Assn., an organization that studies the history and
cultural significance of flags, said the United States must stand
behind its own philosophy on free trade, even when it comes to
imported flags.</TE>
<TE>   Clouded Origin</TE>
<TE>   What really irks Martucci and others is that some sellers may have
tried to hide their flags' pedigrees to avoid consumers' wrath at a
time of intense nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   Like other textile products, flags must carry a country of origin
label. Martucci said that at a store near his home in Maine a few
months ago, American flags were being marketed as the product of a
U.S. firm. Closer examination revealed that, although the
distributing company was U.S.-based, the flags were manufactured in
China.</TE>
<TE>   He also has heard anecdotes about retailers and suppliers selling
flags with no origin labels, or repackaging them in "Made in USA"
plastic wrap.</TE>
<TE>   None of those claims has been substantiated, however. And at least
two of the nation's largest discount chains, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
Kmart Corp., said all flags sold in their stores after Sept. 11 have
been made in the U.S. But Martucci is skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is denying [that they carried foreign-made flags], but
the import figures tell the real story," he said. "All those flags
didn't come into the country and just disappear."</TE>
<TE>   All L.A.'s former flag makers know is that while others are
profiting from the banner boom, they've had the wind sucked from
their sales.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the biggest problem for Los Angeles apparel maker Masoud
Rad is figuring out what to do with his unsold bolts of preprinted
stars-and-stripes fabric--enough to manufacture thousands of flags.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Iran but now a U.S. citizen, Rad said he has a profound
respect for Old Glory, which to him represents freedom and
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Wary of running afoul of cultural taboos about defiling this most
American of symbols, the president of CR&amp;A Custom Apparel has opted
to store the fabric rather than sell it at fire-sale prices or toss
it into a dumpster to save space.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's only worth a penny, I'm hanging on to it," Rad said. "No
way I could throw it away. It's still the American flag, no matter
how you look at it."</TE>

<HD>Global's Unsinkable Captain</HD>
<DH>Gary Winnick's cable firm went under, taking billions in
investor wealth with it, but he is lavishly restoring his $94-million
mansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even by the standards of Bel-Air, Gary Winnick's mansion on Bellagio
Road is lavish.</LD>
<LD>   Perched on a bluff overlooking the Bel-Air Country Club, the
Georgian-style house commands views from downtown to the coast. Its
64 rooms include a kitchen with six sinks and enough ovens to warm
100 plates at once. The master suite boasts separate massage, sitting
and shower rooms. There are a dozen bedrooms and a dozen bathrooms
just for servants.</LD>
<LD>   But Winnick isn't satisfied. He's spending millions to restore the
65-year-old estate.</LD>
<TE>   Inside, craftsmen are stripping away seven layers of paint,
refurbishing antique doorknobs and light fixtures and sculpting
plaster crown moldings using techniques in vogue when the house was
built. Outside, as many as 100 workers are resurfacing patios and
replacing ailing trees and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   None of this sits well with former employees and shareholders of
Global Crossing Ltd., the telecommunications company Winnick founded
in 1997. For a few years its stock soared on hope and hype. Then, in
January, the company filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S.
history, wiping out $54 billion of shareholders' money and putting
thousands of employees out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, the company's chairman and the largest individual
shareholder, lost billions in paper wealth. But he had sold millions
of shares two years earlier, when the stock still was flying high. He
cleared more than $575 million then and used some of it to buy his
$94-million mansion--the highest price ever recorded for a home in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Now the 8.4-acre spread has become the stuff of legend among those
who lost their jobs, investments or both in Global Crossing's
collapse. They see the 23,000-square-foot mansion as symbolic of the
excesses of the tech boom, when stock options and a giddy atmosphere
on Wall Street enabled some entrepreneurs to get rich even as the
firms they led were about to melt down.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's going down the tubes, and he's flaunting his money
and spending millions of dollars on the house," said former Global
Crossing employee Michael Nighan, who has joined other laid-off
workers in an effort to recoup $32 million in severance pay wiped out
by the bankruptcy filing. "At this point, we're beyond anger. Now
it's amazement more than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The house and the elaborate renovation are lampooned regularly on
a Web site run by former Global Crossing employees. "Where do I sign
up as a subcontractor? I need a job," one former worker wrote
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech leaders have been humbled by the collapse of their
companies. In April, Bernard J. Ebbers, the deposed chief executive
of long-distance giant WorldCom Inc., sold his yacht to pay off some
of the approximately $400 million he owes on loans he used to buy
now-worthless company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, sold luxury homes
in Colorado and Texas to stave off personal bankruptcy. His wife,
Linda, opened a thrift store in hopes of raising cash by selling
family castoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, by contrast, continues to pour money into his home
renovation, which is expected to cost as much as $30 million. Because
the house is Winnick's personal property, it cannot be seized by
Global Crossing's corporate creditors as part of the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about the house all the time," said attorney Randy
Sunshine, a golf enthusiast and member of the Bel-Air Country Club
who has watched the renovation from the five greens that surround the
house. "You can't help it--it's just so huge and it just looms right
over the golf course. And with all of what's going down with Global
Crossing, I think there's an irony there."</TE>
<TE>   Built to Be Talked About</TE>
<TE>   The mansion--dubbed Casa Encantada, or House of Enchantment--was
built to be talked about. Its very design reflected the original
owner's determination to impress.</TE>
<TE>   A gurgling fountain adorned with bronze statues dominates the
long, curving driveway, and four slender columns frame the entrance
beneath a triangular pediment. Painted the color of white stone and
topped with a pitched copper roof, the mansion would look at home on
the Mall in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, a grand, curving staircase rises above the entryway's
parquet floor. Each step is decorated with an oval design resembling
a seashell. The grounds--big enough to hold three major league
baseball fields--include several lawns and plazas, elaborate formal
gardens, a tennis court, a pool, a two-story pool house and a pair of
greenhouses. Pine, eucalyptus and other trees shield the estate from
public view.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, who lives in a Brentwood estate, declined to discuss his
Bel-Air house. Friends say the 54-year-old entrepreneur, who has
pledged more than $100 million to charity over the years, considers
the restoration another of his many philanthropic efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Previous owners opened the house for lavish parties and
fund-raisers to benefit a variety of causes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very handsome house," said actress Jane Wyatt Ward, who
lives nearby and visited the house when hotel magnate Conrad Hilton
was the proprietor.</TE>
<TE>   "The dining room was huge, about three times as big as mine," said
Ward, best known for her role in the 1950s TV series "Father Knows
Best." "The living room and the library are immense. It has very high
ceilings. And there were formal gardens. I hope when [Winnick] gets
through he has an open house so we can all see the beautiful
gardens."</TE>
<TE>   The house was built for Hilda Olsen Boldt Weber, who purchased the
property in 1934 for $100,000. A New York City nurse who married one
of her wealthy patients, Weber wanted to build an estate that would
give the impression of old money, according to books on the history
of Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   She hired architect James Dolena, who prepared 400 sets of plans
before Weber was satisfied with the design. The house took two years
to build and cost an estimated $2 million--$23.7 million in today's
dollars--including elegant sculptures and paintings and room upon
room of custom furniture, designed specifically for the estate.</TE>
<TE>   Poor investments and gambling cost Weber her fortune, and she had
to sell. Hilton bought the house and its contents in 1950 for a mere
$225,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton made few changes during his 19-year stay. He kept the
furniture, the aging French lace curtains and the somber green paint,
but converted a playroom into a trophy room. Though he was in his 70s
when he moved into the mansion, Hilton hosted frequent parties,
sometimes rolling up the carpet for dancing. The house served as a
backdrop for several movies, featuring stars such as Natalie Wood,
Robert Redford and Christopher Plummer.</TE>
<TE>   After Hilton's death in 1979, Dole Food Co. Chief Executive David
Murdock purchased the property for $12.4 million and sold most of the
original furnishings and art. In the 20 years he owned Casa
Encantada, Murdock held numerous political fund-raisers there and
hosted Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, himself a major fund-raiser, visited many times while
Murdock owned the house and tried to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "He fell in love with the house," said Rosalie Zalis, a longtime
friend and executive director of the Winnick Family Foundation, the
vehicle for Winnick's charitable giving. "It's just a beautiful
property."</TE>
<TE>   Murdock rebuffed several offers from Winnick before finally
succumbing, said Jeff Hyland, co-author of "The Estates of Beverly
Hills" and president of Hilton &amp; Hyland Real Estate in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to sell, but Gary kept sweetening the pot," Hyland
said. "David finally said, 'I've got to do this. I'd be foolish if I
didn't.' "</TE>
<TE>   Winnick grew up far from Bel-Air, in the Long Island town of
Roslyn. His father owned a food service business that fell into
bankruptcy in 1960. While attending the C.W. Post campus of Long
Island University, Winnick worked as a bus driver, a golf caddy and a
ski-shop salesman. After college, he signed on with a furniture
retailer that failed.</TE>
<TE>   Then Winnick joined junk bond king Michael Milken at Drexel
Burnham Lambert, moving to Los Angeles in 1978 to work in the bond
sales operation. The division became the centerpiece of a fraud
scandal, though Winnick never was charged with wrongdoing. He left
Drexel in 1985 to start his own investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   He became a man of influence in Los Angeles, donating heavily to
political causes, funding a children's petting zoo and pledging $40
million to the Simon Wiesenthal Center to help pay for an institute
on peace and tolerance in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he launched what became Global Crossing. The firm was
built on a vision of wiring the world with fiber-optic cable to
transmit phone calls, faxes and e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick had little expertise in telecommunications, but he knew
how to sell. He raised $20 billion from investors, more than any
corporate start-up ever. Over the next four years, the company laid
more than 100,000 miles of cable across continents and beneath
oceans.</TE>
<TE>   Though the firm never turned a profit, expectations that customers
would rush to use the network sent its stock soaring. Winnick was
crowned the richest person in Los Angeles in a 1999 ranking by the
Los Angeles Business Journal. His stake in Global Crossing then was
worth $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But the network did not fill with traffic. Demand was much lower
than expected, and other start-ups competed for customers. Global
Crossing couldn't bring in enough revenue to repay its debt. A lack
of stable leadership made matters worse: The company changed CEOs
five times in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's accounting methods came under scrutiny early
this year. After the bankruptcy filing, the Securities and Exchange
Commission launched an investigation. Angry investors have filed
dozens of lawsuits against the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Fixated on the Details</TE>
<TE>   Before the money ran out, Winnick was known for his free spending
and his love of historic architecture.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman, he lavished perks on Global Crossing executives and
board members, including Aston Martins and Rolls-Royces. Among his
pet projects was a meticulous $7.5-million restoration of the ornate
former MCA building in Beverly Hills, where the company's executive
offices were based.</TE>
<TE>   Former employees say that even the smallest details of the
renovation commanded Winnick's attention. He personally inspected
each brick and ordered replacements for those that were dirty, the
wrong color or just not right. He repeatedly rejected the shades of
white paint used in the hallway leading to the room he chose as his
office, a replica of the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   "They went through painting the whole area five times or so to get
it just exactly the shade he wanted to complement his art," said a
former Global Crossing manager.</TE>
<TE>   Though it drove his subordinates to distraction, Winnick's
perfectionism earned him great respect among preservationists, who
are grateful to see Casa Encantada in the entrepreneur's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any historical protections here, so it's always a
sigh of relief when someone buys an important house and does the
right things to it," said Hyland, who also is an architectural
historian.</TE>
<TE>   Although close friends say Winnick is a modest man not prone to
self-aggrandizement, he often surrounds himself with politicians and
notables. Most of his charitable donations have put the Winnick name
on buildings, scholarships or other projects.</TE>
<TE>   His latest acquisition "is a definite trophy property," said Joyce
Rey, executive director of Coldwell Banker Previews International in
Beverly Hills, the estates division of the realty firm. "It takes a
certain personality to want it."</TE>

<HD>Van Houten's Parole Hearing: Just a Farce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The farcical California State Parole Board gave new meaning to the
term "cruel and unusual punishment" when for the 14th time the
two-member panel rejected Leslie Van Houten's bid for freedom
("Ex-Manson Follower Loses 14th Parole Bid," June 29).</LD>
<LD>   Undeterred by Judge Bob Krug's sharp rebuke of their repeated
rejection of Van Houten's parole, the board matter-of-factly stated
that she had not served enough time for the two "cruel and
calculated" 1969 murders, an admission that obviously indicates it
never seriously considered parole for Van Houten, thus making the
entire process, by definition, a meaningless bureaucratic farce.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the state nor the system is well served by this absurdity.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Teachers Lose Bid to End Class-Upsizing Plan," June 28:</LD>
<LD>   If L.A. Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer cuts salaries for
teachers (as he was given the authority to do), this will be the
final blow to my already low morale as a teacher. I am going into my
seventh year as an elementary school teacher. I am also a
second-career UCLA graduate with an MBA who became a teacher when
then-Gov. Pete Wilson reduced class size to 20 in grades K-3.</LD>
<LD>   I love my students, my school and my job, but having experienced
the reality of teaching I don't think I could stay if my salary was
cut. The district can't afford to lose teachers like me--but will, if
this drastic action is taken. Can you imagine the teacher shortage
and the quality of teachers then?</LD>
<TE>   Genie Penn</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why are teachers upset with the LAUSD school board?</TE>
<TE>   Romer just had his expense account for meals and entertainment
doubled to $30,000 (June 27)--so he can eat at the Pacific Dining Car
restaurant, because no other restaurant will serve him after late
meetings; teachers are given two additional students per class and no
pay raise.</TE>
<TE>   Romer's wife gets fully paid health benefits for life; teachers
are being asked to start paying additional premiums each month for
each dependent (effectively, a pay cut). School board members get
private bathrooms in the new headquarters building so they can "have
a private place of refuge"; teachers work at schools notorious for
bathroom problems (and no place for refuge).</TE>
<TE>   All of these items may seem little, but they are symbolic. And the
symbolism is that the school board cares more about administrators
than it does about teachers. Romer has never taught in a classroom;
teachers are there every day preparing your children to deal with
life.</TE>

<LD>Re "No Details, No Hope," Opinion, June 30: Gershom Gorenberg wrote
the clearest exposition of the religious basis for Israeli claims to
Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) and of contemporary Jewish
messianism in his book "The End of Days." He is an authentic expert
on why war is breaking out over rival claims to land in
Israel-Palestine.</LD>
<LD>   That said, ideologues on both sides of the conflict will criticize
Gorenberg's defense of compromise with the Palestinians and the
return to the goals of the process begun by Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated by a Jewish messianist. The martyrdom of the peace
process in the Middle East continues with the sole use of militant
means to confront Palestinian extremists, which only escalates both
hate and acts of revenge.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush has listened to all sides, but he has chosen to
hear the polarized message of extreme elements who see the conflict
in stark terms of "evildoers." Gorenberg points out that if today's
enemies are to become tomorrow's neighbors, one must negotiate about
what matters to them as well as to oneself. The U.S. is in a position
to enforce dialogue about the ultimate status of Jerusalem, the
ultimate boundaries of a Palestinian state and the militant
intransigence of Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon, whose policies have
called down destruction on their own people. What the U.S. cannot
enforce is the cessation of violence by extremists who deliberately
attack when both sides begin to pull back.</TE>
<TE>   By shrinking from the tough process of political settlement of
religious territorial claims, the U.S. has empowered the very
terrorists it wishes to defeat. The road to peace is mined with
extremist bombs, but it is the only road and we must keep walking.</TE>

<TE>   Gorenberg's article was the best one I have seen in a very long
time on this subject. But alas, with the coming elections in
November, President Bush would never say anything about how to bring
peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that might turn the Jewish
lobby against the Republicans. His speech was exactly what they
wanted to hear, no more, no less, and it will bring the peace process
no further than it has been up to this point. I wish there were a lot
more in Israel like Gorenberg, with the intelligence he obviously
has.</TE>

<TE>   Much is being said, by Bush, Arafat, the Saudis and everyone else,
on defusing the Israeli-Palestinian thing. But the truth is that two
peoples are stuck in an overly populated area with no way to let off
steam. The Jews have nowhere to go. The Palestinians could readily
adapt to life in the sparsely populated neighboring lands of their
Arab brothers. While the Saudis are to be commended for their lead in
suggesting a Palestinian state, their goal of peace could be more
rapidly attained if they were also to lead the Arab countries in
permitting the emigration to their lands of those Palestinians who
wish to do so, with the eventual likelihood of citizenship.</TE>

<LD>Dan Sheehy's June 30 letter has left me dumbfounded. While he
astutely points out the role the terrorist attacks and subsequent war
had "in damaging our economy and shattering our confidence," he
blames the Clinton administration for the emerging corporate
scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Had it not been for the strong economy built during the Clinton
administration we would never have rebounded economically from Sept.
11. If Sheehy wants to point fingers at former President Clinton for
the big-business mess then he must also point them at the Newt
Gingrich/Bob Dole Republican-led Congress and its so-called contract
with America. While Washington and the unwitting public choose to
play the blame game, the evildoer terrorists are regrouping in
Lebanon right in front of everybody's eyes. Fix the damn problem and
move on!</LD>

<LD>Re "School Vouchers Win Backing of High Court," June 29: So let me
see if I've got this straight. If I start an Islamic religious
school, like one of the madrasas covered in "Pakistani Government
Will Attempt to Rein In Militant Religious Schools" (June 29), I can
get government-issued school vouchers for my students. And I thought
"selecting" George W. Bush as president was the worst decision the
Supreme Court could ever make.</LD>

<LD>Re "Flagging Attention to Etiquette," Opinion, June 30:</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing sadder than an American flag that is faded,
tattered and dirty. I've seen many flags flying on homes, cars, boats
and government buildings that need to be retired. July 4 is a special
and meaningful day this year. Sept. 11 will be in the hearts and
minds of all Americans. Let's show our patriotism and fly Old Glory
at its best.</LD>
<LD>   The emblem of our country should look sharp and radiant at all
times. Buy a new flag and fly it proudly. It truly is our "grand old
flag."</LD>
<TE>   God bless our flag and all the good things it stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Schreiner</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Jack Miles, for your commentary on the etiquette of
displaying the American flag. I am particularly offended by the
doormats made as replicas of our proud symbol. Why would anyone place
one of these at their door? It's like saying, "Welcome to my home,
but before you enter, please wipe your feet on our country's flag."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Miller</TE>
<TE>   La Habra</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bemused, bewildered and occasionally annoyed, I have observed the
American cult of the flag: One pledges allegiance to the flag, one
sings a national anthem about the flag. And although there exists a
de jure separation of church and state, there is no church without a
flag. (In the religious sense, this, of course, is idolatry.) One
would do well to recall that such cults tend to be more prevalent in
totalitarian states.</TE>
<TE>   Miles proposes flag etiquette. While I do not believe in killing
anyone's sacred cows; I believe we would be better advised spending
the amount of energy used on flags on the country, that is: Do not
litter--soiled flags may be an affront; a soiled country destroys us
in the end. Leave the SUVs at home--ride bikes, or the bus. Be good
to the creatures that share the country with us, both in the wilds
and at home. Be good to the people who share the country with us.</TE>
<TE>   If Miles makes those issues a top priority, I might consider
flagging flag etiquette. But I will never pledge allegiance to a
piece of cloth. This is the Fourth of July, the birthday of a nation.
Let's be good to it instead of pampering the flag.</TE>
<TE>   Pauli Peter</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When computer-generated child pornography is covered by the 1st
Amendment and "one nation under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance is
not, one must wonder what America has to celebrate on the Fourth of
July. We wave the flag and watch the fireworks while our liberty
continues to be eroded by one voice.</TE>
<TE>   Which of our cherished traditions is next for the gallows? Will
the Declaration of Independence meet the ax for the words "endowed by
their Creator"? Or will it be the U.S. Constitution for the phrase
"in the year of our Lord"?</TE>
<TE>   To allow a minority to rule over the majority is not democracy. It
is tyranny and a disgrace to the millions who have bled and died for
our freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Ema Sherman</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A pledge for July 4: I pledge allegiance to the ideals of equal
justice and freedom established by the United States, and I pledge to
preserve, protect and defend its Constitution from all threats
foreign and domestic-- regardless of fears and dangers--and I make
this pledge in union with all who have fought to create and preserve
these ideals, laws and freedoms.</TE>

<HD>S. County to Get Arts Conservatory</HD>
<DH>Education: Directors will leave O.C. high school to
establish an after-school program.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two founders of the successful Orange County High School of the Arts
are leaving to open an intensive after-school arts program in San
Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   The California Conservatory of the Arts is set to open in
September, with auditions for the competitive program for students in
grades 7 through 12 beginning July 15.</LD>
<LD>   "This is going to be a real comprehensive program designed for
kids who want careers in the arts," said David Green, the school's
executive and artistic director. "It's intended to give them the
competitive edge they'll need to get into the colleges and programs
of their choice."</LD>
<TE>   Green and partner Nancy Melbourne were two of three founding
directors of the arts high school 15 years ago. The charter school,
which is affiliated with Santa Ana's public schools, has since grown
to 1,045 students.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he and Melbourne wanted to leave administration and get
back to the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The core values that we share work better in a smaller
environment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatory, in the Sycamore Commons office complex, will
offer training in dance, musical theater and visual arts.</TE>
<TE>   Tuition for the 10-month program is $1,500. Green said about 125
students will be chosen for this fall's classes.</TE>
<TE>   He said the conservatory will tap students in the growing South
County region.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another avenue for a different market," he said. "We hope
to have a collaborative relationship with [OCHSA] instead of a
competitive one."</TE>

<LD>A newborn girl found at a Walnut Park recycling center died of
injuries inflicted during the recycling process, sheriff's officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A bulldozer driver moving cardboard found the baby in a box
Tuesday afternoon.</LD>

attached. They believe she had arrived at the Best Way Recycling
Plant on Firestone Boulevard that day.</LD>
<TE>   Cause of death was blunt force trauma as a result of the recycling
process, an autopsy found.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's homicide detectives are asking for the public's help in
locating women who were known to be pregnant and are now childless.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blood drives will be held during the next two weeks to benefit a Los
Angeles police officer critically injured last weekend in a multiple
car crash in Santa Clarita, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The drives will be organized by the Los Angeles law firm of
Manning &amp; Marder, Kass, Ellrod, Ramirez LLP, where Officer Bruce
Hunt's wife, Kathy, is a partner, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Hunt, a 14-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, was
in critical but stable condition at County-USC Medical Center on
Wednesday, said Jon Weiner, a hospital spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Hunt was pinned between two cars as he helped victims of an
accident on the Antelope Valley Freeway late Saturday. He suffered a
broken pelvis, fractures in his collarbone and legs, collapsed lungs
and internal bleeding, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do this to support both Kathy and Bruce, and to help
replenish the blood supply in L.A. County," said Frances Lee, a
spokeswoman for the law firm.</TE>
<TE>   The blood drives will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on
Wednesday and on July 18 at the law offices on the 23rd floor at 660
S. Figueroa St., Lee said. The blood will be donated to the Los
Angeles-based Ralph M. Parsons Blood Donor Center.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone wishing to donate should contact Lee at (213) 624-6900,
Ext. 235, for an appointment.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Force Out Child Welfare Director</HD>
<DH>Social services: Board ousts Anita Bock after two years in
frustration over pace of reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after she undertook the task of reforming the nation's
largest foster care agency, Anita Bock has been forced out of her
post as head of Los Angeles County's child welfare department.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday in closed
session to instruct the county administrator to negotiate Bock's
departure, according to two county sources, but the decision was not
announced until she submitted her resignation Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors in recent months had grown increasingly frustrated
with the lack of progress at the agency, publicly criticizing the
department's continuing failure to properly staff the child abuse
hotline, quickly investigate alleged abuses by workers, streamline
one of the country's slowest adoption programs, and help children who
grow up in the system prepare for independent adulthood.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty self-evident from a number of the things we've been
struggling with that we're frustrated with the pace of change," said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   Bock will stay on until August, then receive a nine-month
severance package. The county administrator is recommending Marjorie
Kelly, former head of the state's child welfare division, as an
interim replacement.</TE>
<TE>   In a news release, Bock said the decision to leave her
$182,000-a-year job was her own. She took credit for a decline in the
number of foster children entering the system and said she has
stabilized the department. "I am immensely proud of what we have
accomplished," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bock had been recruited from Miami, where she had run the largest
of the state's 15 welfare divisions--a program currently under fire
for losing a foster child, among other problems. She resigned under
pressure when a new Republican administration took over in 1999 and
found a backlog of child abuse investigations.</TE>
<TE>   She is the third person to lead the Department of Children and
Family Services since it was spun off from the county welfare
department in the 1990s, itself an effort to stimulate reforms in the
problem-plagued foster care system.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is still dealing with some of the same issues as it
struggles to protect the county's 35,000 abused and neglected
children.</TE>
<TE>   Some child welfare experts say Los Angeles' problems persist in
part because of its size and in part because of politics.</TE>
<TE>   Unions, child advocates, a county commission, the board and
individual supervisors' staffers all exert considerable pressure on
the department leadership, robbing it of necessary autonomy and
authority, said John Mattingly, a national child welfare expert with
the Annie E. Casey Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point the Board of Supervisors needs to make it clear who
runs L.A. County's child welfare system, and it can't be the 25 to 30
people who feel they have that authority now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bock often lamented the rigidity of the county bureaucracy
and the growing chasm between her and the advocacy community.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to prioritize. That's my job," Bock said in an interview
earlier this year. "It's my job to sift through the
hundreds--thousands--of recommendations we have. They want me to say
we'll do it all, and I think the one area where I know I have not won
fans is saying I can't do it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to balance the union with the county with the budget with
the staff. I understand that people who are passionate about children
want someone to say, "Let's do it.' But then I wouldn't be an
effective director. I'd be a yes person."</TE>
<TE>   It was that directness and passion that led the board to hire her
on a 4-1 vote in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   They have said they thought Bock's business background--she has
master's degrees in business administration and law, not social
work--would solve some of the perceived problems of the prior
director, who was seen as an idea man who started a number of
revolutionary pilot programs but failed to run the shop effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Before she arrived, a number of internal and external audits
diagnosed the department as suffering from unfocused, ineffective
management, a lack of planning, a siege mentality, overloaded social
workers and myriad other fundamental breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   G. Peter Digre had abruptly resigned as director in 1999 under the
pressure of those negative reports and allegations that he had used
his influence to keep on the county payroll a political ally and
foster mother accused of abusing her wards.</TE>
<TE>   To Bock, a self-described "change agent," taking on the job of
reforming the mammoth system was an irresistible challenge.</TE>
<TE>   At heart, she said, her plan was simple: Use statistics rather
than emotion to guide decisions, and stay focused by doing constant
long-range planning.</TE>
<TE>   She required managers to attend training in the Baldridge
management method, which focuses on customer satisfaction and
excellence. She began semimonthly staff meetings requiring managers
to present key statistics on how their divisions are running. She has
required them to write business plans, action plans, budget proposals
and detailed reports on how those plans affect the rest of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   She had an intense focus on creating and maintaining computer
systems.</TE>
<TE>   She tore down the chain of command, freely giving out her e-mail
address and inviting workers of all levels to bring her their
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   She also reorganized the 7,000-employee department. She created a
division of social workers who investigate child abuse complaints,
separating them from those who supervise foster children.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said she turned a poisonous environment into a friendly
one, that she is an intelligent woman with an impressive ability to
see all the angles and keep her eye on the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   But a vocal faction of the management complained for months that
her focus on management technique came at the cost of all else.</TE>
<TE>   They complained that she promoted staffers from the bowels of
management who lacked experience, lost valuable experience by
marginalizing some staff and undermined management through direct
contact with social workers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are four management levels above me. I'm the last person
[in my hierarchy] who ever carried a case, ever made a home call,
ever wrote a court report," one manager complained in a recent
interview. "It's crazy-making that you'd have everyone in charge who
don't know the job. It's very, very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Some complained that Bock violated internal policy against having
personal relationships with clients.</TE>
<TE>   Six months after she arrived in Los Angeles, she invited an
emotionally troubled 18-year-old foster youth to live with her in her
Hollywood home. She found the young woman a job in her department's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy resulted in two internal investigations, the
results of which have remained confidential. Bock said she was
absolved of policy violations.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps her biggest problems have been political.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after her arrival, she inadvertently derided the county's
Commission for Children and Families, referring to their members as a
"group of ladies."</TE>
<TE>   "The advocates and stakeholders were all ready to work with Ms.
Bock and change the system in a positive way," said Amy Pellman, head
of the nonprofit Alliance for Children's rights. "Instead she wanted
to do it her way. She didn't want to hear from anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the board initially backed her in those battles--telling
advocates to be patient and work with her. Most of the supervisors
interviewed earlier this year said it was too soon to judge her
performance.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point may have came in February, when Bock faced off
with Yaroslavsky, who until then had been one of her biggest
supporters on the board and a swing vote on issues involving her
department.</TE>
<TE>   Bock was trying to persuade the board to allow her to appeal a
judge's ruling requiring judicial consent before social workers can
reduce the number of times they visit children below once a month.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky thought it was the wrong way to go, and pushed her to
justify herself.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than backing down from a public fight with her boss, Bock
pressed her case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just giving you the reality, Supervisor," she replied. Bock
said the court was overstepping its authority, dictating to the
department how often it had to visit wards. She thought it was up to
the Legislature to make and fund those mandates.</TE>
<TE>   The county has lost all three of the appeals it filed in that
case.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Garrett Therolf contributed to this report.</TE>

<CX>   Anita Bock--An article in Thursday's Section A about the resignation
of Anita Bock as director of the Los Angeles County Department of
Children and Family Services incorrectly stated historical facts
about the agency. Bock was the fourth person to be named permanent
director of the agency since it was created in 1984. Her predecessor,
Peter Digre, ran the department for 8 1/2 years.</CX>

<HD>Colonel, O.C. Man Accused in Bribe Scam</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County businessman and a U.S. Army colonel were indicted
Wednesday on charges of rigging $150 million worth of military
service contracts in South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Richard J. Moran, 56, who oversaw all U.S. military contract
bidding in South Korea, is accused of pocketing $850,000 in cash
kickbacks from contractors hired to build barracks and provide
security guards. A portion of that money, according to the U.S.
attorney's office, was funneled through Joseph Kang Hur, 57, of
Anaheim Hills, who was allegedly recruited by the colonel as a
middleman.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI, IRS and Korean National Police began investigating the
two after U.S. Army investigators noticed irregularities in the
awarding of contracts, according Assistant U.S. Atty. John Hueston.</LD>
<TE>   Moran, who was stationed at Yongsan Army Base in South Korea, was
arrested by military police and put on a plane to Los Angeles after
his indictment by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana. Hur surrendered
to authorities following his indictment and was ordered released
hours later on a $10,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments names three other civilians, including Moran's
wife, Gina Cha Moran, 44. She is accused of soliciting some of the
contract bribes for her husband and of attempting to hide the cash
from investigators.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the Morans could not be reached for comment. Hur's
attorney said his client was unwittingly duped.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of the Morans' home in January, investigators
uncovered $700,000 worth of $100 bills and Korean traveler's checks
that had been stuffed into a couch, a bed and a bedroom closet. As
Army investigators searched the home for 10 hours, Gina Moran
attempted to shuttle wads of cash from the couch to the bedroom by
feigning illness and telling investigators that she had to leave the
room, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas McConville.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Moran used a computer, his wife and Hur as
go-betweens in various kickback schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Moran met Hur in August 2001 in Korea and
recruited him to negotiate a bribe for an upcoming $100-million
security contract. Although Moran had been ordered to select the
least expensive, best qualified bidder, he focused on IBS Industries
Co.--a firm that was ranked eighth in cost out of a field of 11.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the contract, IBS allegedly paid Hur and Moran
$40,000 in $100 bills, as requested by Moran. "They called him a
consultant, when in fact he was just a conduit for the bribes,"
Hueston said of Hur.</TE>
<TE>   "Col. Moran sold the trust placed in him by the U.S. armed
forces," Hueston added. "He sold the honor and prestige of his
position to the highest bidder."</TE>
<TE>   While appearing at a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday
afternoon, Hur's lawyer said his client had been unsuspectingly
pulled into the plot. He said Hur was working for another security
firm that was bidding on the project when Moran recruited him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was used as a pawn," Fernando Leone said. "The colonel needed
someone who could speak Korean and do what he wanted him to do. Mr.
Hur was victimized."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer also said bribes and kickbacks are viewed differently
in South Korea than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how business is conducted in Asia," Leone said, explaining
why his client wasn't more suspicious. "Everybody's on the take.
What's not enforceable in Korea, though, is a serious offense here."
He also said his client was involved in only a small part of Moran's
contract dealings.</TE>
<TE>   At Hur's bail hearing, Leone described his client as a general
contractor and a 30-year American citizen.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the security contract, prosecutors said, Moran
persuaded South Korean building contractor Aulson and Sky Contractors
Ltd. to pay him $700,000 for construction worth $25 million. The cash
was allegedly collected by Moran's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have described Moran as a 25-year Army veteran whose
primary residence is in Maine. He oversaw 17,000 contracts with an
annual value of more than $310 million. He and his wife probably face
up to 10 years in prison if convicted of the charges, which include
bribery, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Also named in Wednesday's indictment are Ronald Adair Parrish, 49,
a civilian who was chief of the Army's contract support division in
South Korea, and Indiana businessman Richard Lee Carlisle.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that Parrish was responsible for releasing
bidding information to Carlisle, who hoped to win a computer
contract.</TE>

<LD>The Hansen Dam Aquatic Center's 1.5-acre swimming lake will reopen
today after being closed for repairs since January, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   More than $2.5 million in work on leaking pipes and a cracked

<LD>   If the project had not been "fast-tracked," he said, the lake,
which is normally available for use year-round, would not have opened

<LD>A judge Wednesday refused to block the appointment of South Gate's
new police chief, but ordered the city to halt, for now, schedule
changes that police unions had challenged.</LD>
<LD>   The unions contend that city leaders ordered the changes in
retaliation for their support of a voter recall targeting them.</LD>
<LD>   Although Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs said
there was "strong evidence" of retaliation on certain issues, she
decided against granting preliminary injunctions in several key
areas.</LD>
<TE>   Janavs said sufficient doubt existed over whether the unions would
prevail at trial. Janavs did order the city to halt for now a new
rule that requires all police officers, including detectives, to wear
uniforms.</TE>

<LD>Tap water may have a musty taste and odor for the next few weeks
because of naturally occurring algae blooms, Metropolitan Water
District officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After receiving calls from alarmed residents, water officials said
the algae is harmless.</LD>
<LD>   "With the national security alert, we thought it would be prudent
to address concerns that may be raised by consumers if they notice a
change in the taste or odor of their water," said spokesman Bob Muir.</LD>
<TE>   It may take several weeks of treatment to get rid of the algae, he
said. Water officials recommend refrigerating the water to improve
its taste.</TE>
<TE>   An especially large and persistent algae bloom in the California
Aqueduct, caused by warm weather, is to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Officials Wednesday applied copper sulfate to a part of the
aqueduct, but the problem may persist for several weeks.</TE>

<DH>Probe: Catholic bishop promises to turn over all records of
complaints of sexual abuse made against priests dating to 1936, when
the diocese was founded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>At the request of local prosecutors, the Roman Catholic Diocese of
San Diego has agreed to turn over records of complaints about sexual
abuse by priests dating to the founding of the diocese in 1936.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Robert H. Brom has pledged "100% cooperation" with
prosecutors. In a letter to parishioners, Brom said: "Rooted in
prayer and united in faith, we must work together to overcome the
scourge of sexual abuse, not only in the church but also in the
family and in all sectors of society."</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst has assigned three prosecutors and an
investigator to review complaints against priests. So far,
allegations against 18 priests in San Diego and five in Imperial
County dating to 1990 have been turned over.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's not beyond reason that there may be active criminal
investigations coming out of this," Pfingst said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for cooperation from the diocese, Pfingst has pledged
that names of victims will be made public only if criminal charges
are filed. In many cases, he said, victims went to church officials
with the assurance of confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very serious psychological business of reviving
memories of past child abuse," Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the cases occurred years ago, prosecution is
possible because the normal three- to five-year statute of
limitations begins only after police are notified, Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   In the three-county Los Angeles Archdiocese, authorities are
reviewing complaints against more than 50 current and former priests
dating to the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the growing national scandal, Brom, bishop of San
Diego since 1990, has said that a committee composed primarily of
laity will be involved in issues of providing medical and counseling
services to victims of abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, such decisions were made by the diocesan financial
officer, with little outside oversight. Under new guidelines approved
by the nation's Catholic bishops in June, each diocese is required to
assemble a board with substantial numbers of lay members to review
accusations of molestation.</TE>
<TE>   900,000 Catholics</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego diocese has 900,000 Catholics and 98 parishes in San
Diego and Imperial counties.</TE>
<TE>   In a related action, Msgr. Steven Callahan, chancellor of the
diocese, announced on Wednesday that $250,000 was paid to an abuse
victim in December. The payout consisted of $100,000 from the estate
of a deceased priest, $75,000 from insurance, and $75,000 in diocese
funds.</TE>
<TE>   The case involved allegations by a 50-year-old man that he was
molested by Msgr. William Kraft when he was 17 and had suffered
decades of psychological torment.</TE>
<TE>   When Brom learned of the man's complaint, he arranged a "healing"
confrontation between the man and Kraft, who was then in a hospice.
Brom authorized the payment, although no lawsuit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Kraft died in September at age 75 after 40 years as a San Diego
priest. He had served as director of public relations for the diocese
from 1956 to 1963 and director of cemeteries from 1964 to 1970. The
victim worked at a Catholic cemetery when the alleged incident
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Brom is currently serving as chairman of a committee formed by the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to monitor compliance by bishops
with the council's new policy on reporting allegations of sexual
abuse to civil authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rare News Conference</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, the normally media-shy Brom called a news conference
to announce that since he took control of the diocese, 23 complaints
of abuse had been made against priests and that "slightly less" than
$200,000 has been paid by the diocese to victims in that time.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's fuller accounting by Callahan, however, indicates that
in compiling that figure, Brom included only the $75,000 in the Kraft
case settlement that came directly from diocese funds--not the
amounts paid from Kraft's estate and the insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 23 complaints made during Brom's tenure, only four were
made against priests who were still working in the diocese, the
bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   "The conclusion was reached that three of them should no longer be
in ministry and they are not," Brom wrote in a letter to
parishioners. "The one remaining case is under investigation."</TE>

<HD>Ray Brown, 75; Jazz Bassist Was an Icon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Brown, who expanded the boundaries of the upright bass during a
career in jazz spanning more than five decades, has died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   According to bassist John Clayton, a onetime student of Brown's
and a longtime friend, Brown had played golf Tuesday morning in
Indianapolis in sweltering heat.</LD>
<LD>   Brown returned to his hotel room in the early afternoon to rest
before his scheduled appearance that night with his trio at a local
club. When he didn't arrive for an evening sound check--something
that the punctual, highly professional Brown never missed--members of
his entourage returned to his hotel, where they found him dead.</LD>
<TE>   He had not been ill, associates said Wednesday, but apparently
died of natural causes.</TE>
<TE>   Known for his longtime association with pianist Oscar Peterson,
Brown also was recognized for his prodigious work in Los Angeles
music studios, where he was the bassist of choice for several
generations of the top names in music.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his own vast catalog of recordings, he recorded on
hundreds of dates for a wide variety of artists.</TE>
<TE>   "He was without question one of the great bassists in jazz
history," said Dan Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz
Studies at Rutgers University.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a remarkable command of the instrument, great intonations,
wonderful sound, terrific beat."</TE>
<TE>   Jazz critic Nat Hentoff said Brown "had everything going for him,
a full sound and the sense of time and the melodic imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "And unlike some bass players, he never forgot that time was the
basis of everything in jazz. He had the full scope of the instrument
and everything that it could do in jazz."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pittsburgh, Pa., on Oct. 13, 1926, Brown took piano
lessons at age 8 and learned the keyboard by memorizing the
recordings of Fats Waller.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the orchestra in high school but dropped the idea of
being a pianist when he found that about 14 of his classmates were
playing the instrument. He thought about the trombone but didn't have
the money for one. The school's music department gave him a bass,
which he took to immediately.</TE>
<TE>   He learned quickly and began playing local gigs while in high
school. After graduating in 1944, he worked in regional bands.</TE>
<TE>   His musical influences then were Jimmy Blanton, the pioneering
member of Duke Ellington's orchestra who helped move the bass from a
rhythm instrument to one with its own distinct voice. Brown also was
influenced by Oscar Pettiford, a prime mover of a modern approach to
the jazz bass.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's big break came shortly after he moved to New York City in
1945. He encountered pianist Hank Jones, who introduced him to Dizzy
Gillespie, one of the leaders of the emerging bebop movement.
Gillespie hired him without an audition.</TE>
<TE>   The other members of Gillespie's group, Brown found out at his
first rehearsal, were saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker, pianist Bud
Powell and drummer Max Roach, the founding fathers of the new music
called bebop.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known these guys any better, I would have probably never
gone to the rehearsal," Brown told an interviewer for Jazz Journal
International some years later.</TE>
<TE>   But Gillespie later said that Brown had nothing to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray Brown, on bass, played the strongest, most fluid and
imaginative bass lines in modern jazz at the time, with the exception
of Oscar Pettiford," Gillespie wrote in his memoir, "To Bop Or Not to
Bop."</TE>
<TE>   After playing with Gillespie's big band in 1946 and 1947, Brown
went out on his own. For several years, he was musical director for
singer Ella Fitzgerald, whom he married in 1947. They later adopted a
son.</TE>
<TE>   Though they divorced in 1953, partly because of conflicting career
demands, their musical relationship lasted years longer.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald and Brown joined Norman Granz's Jazz at the
Philharmonic in the late 1940s, and Brown was on stage at Carnegie
Hall in New York City in 1949 when Peterson, a Canadian, made his
American debut in a concert promoted by Granz.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Peterson also joined Jazz at the Philharmonic and
toured with Brown in a duo. Brown also kept busy in 1950-52 as a
member of the Milt Jackson Quartet, which included the great pianist
John Lewis and was a forerunner of the influential Modern Jazz
Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   By 1952, Brown was part of Peterson's first drumless trio. At the
height of its success, the group included the guitarist Herb Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson was a tough taskmaster, which Brown didn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are not intimidated with absolute professionalism, then
you have no problem" with Peterson, Brown told Jazz Journal
International. "Sure, he'll throw you a curve from time to time by
calling unscheduled numbers or unexpectedly doubling the tempos, but
if you're not good enough to handle that, you shouldn't be playing
with Oscar anyway."</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, Peterson went back to a traditional trio setting,
replacing Ellis and eventually settling on the drummer Ed Thigpen.
Peterson, Brown and Thigpen would work together until the mid-1960s,
but the touring schedule was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the tours were really punishing; we'd come to Europe and
do 62 one-nighters in 65 days," Brown later recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Brown left Peterson in late 1965 and moved to Los Angeles, where
he supplemented his jazz playing with lucrative session work--with
figures like Henry Mancini and Frank Sinatra--or with house bands for
film and television.</TE>
<TE>   An astute businessman in his own right--he acted as his own
manager and handled his own bookings, whether at the Hollywood Bowl
or in a 100-seat club--Brown also worked in music publishing and
record production.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, he founded the L.A. Four with saxophonist Bud
Shank, guitarist Laurindo Almeida and drummer Shelly Manne.</TE>
<TE>   He later was part owner of a club on Pico Boulevard in West Los
Angeles called Loa.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in jazz education throughout his career, Brown first
encountered Clayton--now a significant bassist and composer and one
of the leaders of the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra--in a class at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton, who was just 16 then, said that Brown had an enormous
influence in his career by paying his way into the musicians union
and helping him land his first jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought to the bass world," Clayton said, "the understanding
that we have to pass on the torch to help the next generation."</TE>
<TE>   Other younger associates of Brown recalled his contributions to
their careers Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I never once asked Ray a question about music that was not
acceptable to him or a subject he didn't want to address," said
pianist Benny Green, who played in Brown's trio for several years in
the 1990s. "He would sit with me and look me in the eye until I got
the point. He preached integrity in music."</TE>
<TE>   Green recalled that despite personnel changes in the band, there
was always a sense of continuity. Shifts in how the band played or
what the members were asked to play were gradual, never abrupt, and
influenced by the abilities of the musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who replaced the more experienced Gene Harris on the piano,
remembered Brown telling him patiently: "You learn this music ....
I'm going to watch you, and after you've been in the band, I'll write
new arrangements."</TE>
<TE>   Ulf Wakenius, the Swedish guitarist who plays regularly with
Peterson, said Wednesday that playing with Brown was always
illuminating.</TE>
<TE>   "He was certainly the greatest, the icon of bass," said Wakenius
from his home in Europe. Wakenius recorded three CDs with Brown,
including the just-released "Some of My Best Friends Are ...
Guitarists" on Telarc records.</TE>
<TE>   "When you played with Ray, you felt you were close to the source.
To listen to him play was as much about the definition of jazz as it
could possibly be."</TE>
<TE>   Green agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray had this golden pulse that was infectious. He propelled the
music in such a way that it was impossible not to want to play at
your best. He had a positive, affirmative spirit."</TE>
<TE>   And, according to Green, his advancing age did nothing to diminish
his fire.</TE>
<TE>   "He was no joke on the bandstand. He went out at the top of his
game."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 48 years, Cecilia, a son, Ray Brown
Jr., and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending.</TE>

<TE>   Little did Cal know. Nor I, as I drove my behemoth pickup through
rush-hour traffic dragging three tons of boat and trailer back into
Sacramento after two weeks at Lake Tahoe. Unbeknownst to me or Cal, I
was driving into real, rare drama at the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   It was late Friday. The bill's backers then were secretly plotting
to hatch a new measure--same substance, but a different number (AB
1493), to confuse Cal and other opponents. On Saturday, sponsors
would quickly pass the bill in the Senate (23-16). Monday, the
Assembly would follow during a bitter floor fight, sending the
landmark bill to Gov. Gray Davis with no votes to spare (41-30).</TE>
<TE>   New Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) would earn his
leadership stripes by twisting arms for votes. Veteran Senate leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco) would demonstrate again that he's the
wiliest of legislators by quietly finessing the bill through his
house.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will eagerly sign the bill because politically it's a
winner. But it'll be a far different measure from the demon
characterized by car dealer Cal.</TE>
<TE>   The bill--the nation's first to fight global warming by limiting
greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles--merely directs the
state Air Resources Board to establish carbon dioxide standards by
2005. They wouldn't take effect until 2009, and the Legislature could
toss them out. The ARB could not raise taxes or fees, ban any vehicle
type or set speed limits.</TE>
<TE>   Some personal background here: My pickup--a 1995 Ford F-250--is
propelled by a mammoth V8 (7.5L, 460 CI) that has guzzled gasoline at
a sorry rate of 9.4 mpg over its life. Pulling the boat to Tahoe over
7,200-foot Donner Summit, the truck runs at 5.6 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   I love it. I'll happily pay for the safety of acceleration, the
ability to avoid lugging down behind some 25-mph big rig.</TE>
<TE>   But Worthington's "warning" to me as I near the end of this tense
trip is badly misfiring. He's blatantly distorting the bill. And, I'm
thinking, it's only logical that America's auto makers somehow will
find the technology to produce an affordable tow vehicle I "need and
want."</TE>
<TE>   Seems I'm hardly alone in that thought. A recent statewide poll by
the Public Policy Institute of California found that 77% of SUV
owners favor the concept of the bill. Among all adults, there's 81%
support.</TE>
<TE>   Such polling made this bill easier to vote for, but it was a
pitched battle.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Legislature split down party lines, with most
Democrats backing the bill and Republicans aggressively
opposed--typical GOP losing politics.</TE>
<TE>   It was a far cry from previous generations when politically
successful Republicans--President Richard Nixon, U.S. Sen. George
Murphy, Gov. Ronald Reagan, Assemblyman Frank Lanterman--joined
Democrats in pioneering clean-air legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, this fight was reminiscent of a long-ago Sacramento
era--before scandals, term limits and skittish leaders--when
lawmakers routinely played skillful hardball and accomplished
remarkable deeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe the politics involved," says the author,
Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), a rookie who carried the
biggest environmental bill in a generation. "I had no idea of the
political dynamics."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, who had been accused by pundits of lacking leadership,
decided this was the place to make his mark. "This is one of those
important issues where you break your pick," he says. "There are
still a few tools left in a speaker's bag."</TE>
<TE>   Most Democrats wound up sharing the attitude of Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas (D-Panorama City), a swing voter who was worked over by
Wesson. "I remembered that when I was a little boy in L.A., I
couldn't play outside at school because there were so many smog
alerts," says Cardenas, 39.</TE>
<TE>   "The auto guys screamed bloody murder, that the world was going to
end if we had smog controls. Lo and behold, a generation later we
have cleaner air. We don't have to tell our kids, 'You can't play
outside.' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis says he's "strongly inclined to sign the bill." No kidding.
It will distinguish him from Bill Simon and President Bush, reassure
core Democrats and establish his environmental credentials worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase Cal Worthington, he'll: Pick up the pen. Sign it
now. Or real soon.</TE>

<HD>Police Identify Slain Suspect in South Gate Robbery and
Alleged Accomplice</HD>

<LD>Police released the names Wednesday of two of the four robbery
suspects who led authorities on an hourlong car chase that ended on
the Golden State Freeway with the vehicle catching fire and officers
killing one of the suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Bilderrian, 18, of East Los Angeles pointed a gun at
California Highway Patrol officers and was shot, said Officer Wendy
Moore, a spokeswoman for the CHP. Bilderrian was taken to Providence
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where he died.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Gutierrez, 21, and two male juveniles, 15 and 17 years
old, were arrested at the scene. All three are from Pico Rivera.</LD>
<TE>   The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday when two armed men
entered a Public Storage building on Firestone Place in South Gate,
taking about $2,500 and the tape from the surveillance camera.</TE>
<TE>   The two fled with two others in a GMC Jimmy, followed by a
witness, sheriff's deputies and, later, California Highway Patrol
officers, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The chase ended just north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway in
Pacoima, where the vehicle stalled and its left tire, ground to
metal, sparked a fire.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects remained in the car for a few seconds before three of
them emerged with their hands raised.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez, the driver, was arrested on suspicion of felony
evading, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, South Gate Police
Det. Ron Inman said. He is being held at the South Gate Police
Department jail.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they may ask the district attorney to file a murder
charge against Gutierrez in the death of Bilderrian.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they didn't intend for this guy to die ... that's
what ended up happening," Inman said.</TE>
<TE>   The two juveniles, arrested on suspicion of robbery and assault
with a deadly weapon, are being held at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in
Downey, Inman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the robbery and
is joining the CHP in investigating the chase and shooting, Moore
said.</TE>

<HD>Store to Be Put to Voters in San Juan</HD>
<DH>Land use: City Council decides to schedule a November
special election on a proposal to sell Home Depot a 13- acre site for
$9 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Torn between protecting the city's small-town charms and an
opportunity to reel in much-needed capital, the San Juan Capistrano
City Council has elected to punt. The council agreed Tuesday to
schedule a special fall election to let voters decide whether to sell
city property to the Home Depot Corp. for $9 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Nov. 5 vote will be advisory. But to Councilman Wyatt T. Hart,
it will be binding. "It's the citizen's land, so I'm asking for their
advice," he said. "Whatever they decide, I'll support."</LD>
<LD>   The council's 3-2 vote for a special election on the issue was
unexpectedly close. Council members David M. Swerdlin and Collene
Campbell believed the council had an obligation to make the final
call on whether to let the home improvement center set up shop in a
town better known for its historic mission, restaurants and streets
lined with old adobe buildings.</LD>
<TE>   "We are elected to make decisions," Swerdlin said.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative could set a bad precedent, he said. "I don't think
that land-planning issues should be done by the ballot," he said.
"Even though this is an advisory vote, it may develop more meaning
than it should."</TE>
<TE>   In November, four of the five council members are up for
reelection--everyone but Councilman John Gelff.</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlin is concerned that the Home Depot issue will dominate the
campaign. "An initiative like this is going to provide fertile ground
for a campaign issue that may well provide more smoke than light," he
said. "There's going to be no real control over what's factual, other
than what's on the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will ask voters if they favor selling 13.22
acres of undeveloped land between a set of railroad tracks and San
Juan Creek near Stonehill Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Hart said the question is simple. "We're not asking about the
constraints, the traffic problems and all the other stuff," he said.
"All we're asking the property owners is whether they want to sell it
to Home Depot for $9 million. If they say yes, then we'll figure the
rest out and make sure they're not negatively impacted."</TE>
<TE>   In April, the council voted to begin negotiations to sell the land
to the retailing giant.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,800 people signed a petition opposing the sale, saying it
would ruin the character of the town, which is built around its
225-year-old mission and 150-year-old adobes. Opponents worry that a
"big-box" store would bring traffic and pollution and block ocean
breezes.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will include arguments for and against. But the
council will write neither.</TE>

<HD>4 in Family Drown at Lake Isabella; 1 Is Hospitalized,
Another Missing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are trying to determine how a family's swim outing at
Lake Isabella in Kern County turned tragic, with four drowned, one
child in critical condition and another still missing.</LD>
<LD>   Divers continued to search for a 9-year-old girl, the last member
of the unidentified family still unaccounted for at day's end
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The six family members from the community of Wofford Heights near
the lake had been splashing about and enjoying a sunny Tuesday
afternoon, only to suddenly disappear beneath the waters of the
placid lake at the south end of the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they will not release the names of the victims
until they can notify relatives, who are presumed to be out of town
for the Fourth of July holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not ever fully understand what happened," said Kern County
Sheriff's Cmdr. Marty Williamson. "But nothing here leads us to
believe this was anything more than just a sad event for this family
and this community."</TE>
<TE>   According to Williamson, a 45-year-old man, his wife and four of
their children were wading on a sandbar protruding from the lake's
floor just a short distance from the beach. Just before 3 p.m., a man
on shore noticed the family frantically splashing around.</TE>
<TE>   "They appeared to be having fun," Williamson said. "But the man
called out just in case and asked if they were OK or needed any
help."</TE>
<TE>   The family didn't reply, Williamson said, so the man began to walk
away. Moments later, he noticed the family had disappeared from view.
The witness told authorities that he jumped on his jet ski and found
the mother and her 5-year-old son floating in the water,
unresponsive. He rushed them both to shore, where others tried to
resuscitate them.</TE>
<TE>   The woman and her son were airlifted to nearby hospitals, where
the mother was later pronounced dead. The boy was in critical
condition and on life support at Valley Children's Hospital in
Madera, Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday night, divers from the Kern County Sheriff's
Department Search and Rescue team found the bodies of the father and
two girls, ages 8 and 12. The couple's 9-year-old daughter had not
been found late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they have little to go on to determine what
could have triggered such an awful event. But they do not suspect it
was anything more than an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Two brothers, ages 12 and 14, decided to go to a friend's instead
of the lake. They told investigators that their sisters could not
swim.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives speculate that one or more of the children got into
trouble, perhaps accidentally stepping off the edge of the sandbar.
In a desperate attempt to help, the others drowned, authorities
speculated.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said there is no evidence that alcohol, drugs or family
discord played a part in the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 26 years and I can't remember such a tragic event
with so many deaths," Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a family of eight; four are dead, one's missing, one's
in critical condition, and the other two are probably going to end up
in shelter care. What a sad tragedy."</TE>

<HD>William F. Dufty, 86; Wrote 'Lady Sings the Blues' and
'Sugar Blues'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William F. Dufty, who told Billie Holiday's life story in "Lady Sings
the Blues," helped popularize macrobiotics in America, wrote "Sugar
Blues" about the evils of processed sugar, and became the sixth and
final husband of sugar-eschewing actress Gloria Swanson, has died. He
was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Dufty died Friday of natural causes at his home in Birmingham,
Mich., said his literary executor, Timothy Rooks.</LD>
<LD>   A friend of both women for many years, Dufty dedicated "Sugar
Blues" to "Billie Holiday, whose death changed my life, and Gloria
Swanson, whose life changed my death."</LD>
<TE>   Dufty published the Holiday book in 1956, and at her death in 1959
wrote a remarkable 3,000-word obituary, a personal essay, that
appeared on the front page of the New York Post, where he spent
1951-60 as assistant to the editor. Rooks said the essay sold a
record number of issues for the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson, who had advocated a sugar-free diet for many years, met
Dufty in the mid-1950s and inspired him to re-educate his sweet
tooth.</TE>
<TE>   After eliminating sugar, Dufty went from 225 pounds to 142 pounds.
In 1976 he published "Sugar Blues" and married Swanson, 16 years his
senior.</TE>
<TE>   Dufty remained devoted to Swanson until her death in 1984, serving
as cook, advisor, muse and the ghostwriter of her 1981 autobiography,
"Swanson on Swanson."</TE>
<TE>   Born the son of a banker near Grand Rapids, Mich., Dufty learned
to play piano by ear and as a child had his own radio show. He
attended Wayne State University but dropped out to become an
organizer and then speech writer for the United Auto Workers.</TE>
<TE>   He spent four years in the Army during World War II, rising to the
rank of sergeant and serving in North Africa, France, Germany and
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Dufty worked as an editor for the Congress of
Industrial Organizations and Americans for Democratic Action and as a
consultant to the American Jewish Committee and the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He also began selling freelance articles to the Post and then
worked as an editor through the 1950s, earning a George Polk Award
and a Page One Award from the Newspaper Guild for investigative
articles on such issues as police and court treatment of drug users
and minorities, particularly Puerto Ricans.</TE>
<TE>   His writing occasionally attracted brickbats as well, notably for
the Holiday book, which was turned into a 1972 motion picture
starring Diana Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Blumenthal, in a 1994 Chicago Tribune review of another book
on Holiday by Donald Clarke, said Dufty's book "was filled with
factual errors and romanticized glosses."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Blumenthal praised Dufty's style over the other author's,
stating: " 'Lady Sings the Blues' conveys a stylistic pungence that
Clarke cannot even conceive. It contains, to cite a most obvious
example, one of the great opening paragraphs in literature: 'Mom and
Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was 18, she
was 16, and I was three.' "</TE>
<TE>   Holiday's parents were actually 18 and 16 when she was born and
they never married, the review noted.</TE>
<TE>   Dufty also helped Edward G. Robinson Jr. write his 1957 book, "My
Father, My Son."</TE>
<TE>   The writer embraced macrobiotics when he met George Ohsawa in
Paris. Dufty soon began touting the discipline's "conscious concern
of the relation between food and spiritual development"--for example,
linking consumption of brown rice and vegetables with meditation--in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965 he published a translation of several of Ohsawa's books
under the title "You Are All Sanpaku," which became a cult favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "After rediscovering the hard way, through pain and suffering,
that illness can be the doorway to health," Dufty once wrote, "I hope
to encourage rediscovery in the West of the ancient Eastern
principles underlying the relation between food and spiritual
development, with a primary emphasis on embryological education."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Fire Authority Bolsters Its Ranks for Dangerously Dry
Holiday</HD>
<DH>Safety: Conditions mean 'everything is ready to burn,' but
officials are adding equipment, staff to prepare for Fourth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing the worst fire danger in almost a decade, the Orange County
Fire Authority will reinforce its ranks for the Fourth of July
holiday today with more staff, a second helicopter and strike teams
near high-risk areas.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything is ready to burn," said Capt. Stephen J. Miller, a
spokesman for the authority. "It's been a long time since we've had
rain. The vegetation is extremely dry. All we need are high winds and
high temperatures, and we will have an explosive situation."</LD>
<LD>   Two strike teams with five engines each, a bulldozer crew, two
dispatchers, a battalion chief and two division chiefs are among the
additional resources. One helicopter will be at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, the other at Fullerton
Municipal Airport.</LD>
<TE>   About 300 county firefighters will be in the field today, Miller
said, compared with the 250 on duty on a typical day. The added staff
will be on the job from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the extra equipment and personnel will give the
authority a faster response time and more resources in the early
stages of an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   County Fire Chief Chip Prather has warned that this year's
Independence Day celebration might be the most hazardous fire
situation since the 1993 Laguna Canyon fire, which destroyed 450
homes and caused $500 million in damage.</TE>
<TE>   Prather has asked the public not to buy or use legal safe-and-sane
fireworks, a recommendation that has ignited criticism among
charities and organizations that benefit from their sale.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tinderbox conditions, the authority opened fire
season on April 15, months ahead of other years. So far, fires have
burned more than 5,000 acres in Orange County this year, compared to
just 97 acres for the same period in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, sizable brush fires have hit Laguna
Canyon, Coto de Caza and Yorba Linda. Statewide, fires have consumed
at least 75,000 acres and destroyed dozens of homes.</TE>
<TE>   The authority's precautions are similar to those of other fire
departments in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Fire Department will have additional
equipment, including an extra water-dropping helicopter, four
bulldozers and water trucks, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the extra attention will be concentrated in brushy areas
such as Lancaster, San Dimas and Santa Clarita, said department
spokesman Albert Flores.</TE>

<HD>Flynn Seeks to End Feud</HD>
<DH>Politics: The supervisor urges a 'peace summit' to settle a
dispute with Oxnard leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn on Wednesday called for a "peace
summit" to help settle a public feud between himself and several
influential members of Oxnard's political community.</LD>
<LD>   Flynn said he decided to ask for the meeting after supporters
called to express concern about a series of newspaper articles on
grievances between the veteran supervisor and his critics.</LD>
<LD>   Irma Lopez, the wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, said Flynn
yelled "I'm gonna get you!" as she left a recent Democratic picnic.
Irma Lopez filed a report on the alleged threat with the Oxnard
Police Department, which is expected to refer the matter to the
district attorney's office for review next week.</LD>
<TE>   Flynn has denied the allegation, saying he is the target of a
smear campaign by a cadre of Latino leaders who would like to see him
ousted from office. A Latino civil rights group entered the fray
Tuesday, accusing Flynn of making inflammatory comments about
Oxnard's Latino officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gotten ugly enough," Flynn said Wednesday. "I want to see it
stop."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed summit got a mixed reaction from some of the people
Flynn wants included in the peace effort. Denis O'Leary, president of
the League of United Latin American Citizens, also proposed a meeting
in a letter to Flynn. O'Leary called the meeting proposal a
"beautiful" idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We are interested in dialogue, smoothing things over and letting
him continue to do his business," O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, however, said she doubted the sincerity of the effort. She
said Flynn has attacked her in the media for nearly a week, and said
blame for the feud falls squarely in his lap.</TE>
<TE>   "A peace summit?" Lopez said. "No one has declared war on him. It
was a one-sided attack on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Last week Flynn told The Times that Lopez "won't be happy until
she sees a sea of brown faces in every political office in west
Ventura County." He also told the Ventura County Star newspaper that
Lopez wanted Latino politicians "regardless of their capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said his invitations to the private meeting will be sent
Friday. The summit would most likely be held next week at a church in
Nyeland Acres or another "neutral" site, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those Flynn plans to invite are Lopez, O'Leary, Yolanda
Benitez, superintendent of Rio Elementary School District; Oxnard
Councilman John Zaragoza, and community college district trustee Art
Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   All have been critical of Flynn's behavior, saying he has publicly
berated several city officials with whom he has differences. Flynn
said he would like Hank Lacayo and Marcos Vargas to mediate the
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Lacayo, former chairman of the county's Democratic Party, and
Vargas, a well-known Latino activist, are both respected in the
community and would lend credibility to the process, Flynn said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Police Prepare for Fireworks</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Officials warn against private use of explosive
devices, which is prohibited in the city, and firing weapons to
celebrate Fourth of July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles law enforcement and elected officials warned strongly
Wednesday against any private use of fireworks or the celebratory
firing of weapons into the air in the city on today's Fourth of July
holiday.</LD>
<LD>   Interim Police Chief Martin Pomeroy and Los Angeles County Sheriff
Lee Baca also said they will have a maximum deployment of personnel
today and be well-prepared to respond to any act of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said there have been no specific threats.</LD>
<TE>   Baca said that under mutual aid plans, he would be prepared to
send sheriff's units into the city to assist local police, and call
on Orange County for assistance should the need arise. He also said
the FBI is ready to respond.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of fireworks, both the district attorney's office and
Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said they would bring the
most serious possible charges against violators. Although 229
California cities authorize the sale of fireworks, including 38 in
Los Angeles County, any sale or use outside authorized fireworks
displays is prohibited in Los Angeles city.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, joining a news conference at the Police
Academy, vowed that violators would not only be arrested but would
also be prosecuted and could serve substantial jail time.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest seizure of fireworks in the city so far came Monday,
when the Police Department's bomb squad, backed by firefighters,
found "boxes and boxes of fireworks stacked from the floor to about
halfway up to the ceiling," of an otherwise empty duplex in the 900
block of West 85th Street. Anthony Anderson, 37, is being held in
lieu of $500,000 bail on a felony charge of possession of destructive
devices.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Jack Richter emphasized that even the so-called
"safe and sane" fireworks approved by the state fire marshal and
permitted in some localities are illegal in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond these, there are explosive devices commonly referred to
as M-80s, M-100s or M-1000s, which are particularly dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Such devices vary from 1 to 12 inches in length and 1/2 to 2
inches in diameter and are generally red, pink or silver in color.</TE>
<TE>   They are designed to function by igniting a fuse, but are highly
sensitive to heat, shock or friction and can easily explode
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   There have been more than 22,000 injuries in the last two years
and 25 deaths related to the improper use of fireworks, according to
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Acting Fire Chief John Callahan said that fireworks injuries and
damage are down in Los Angeles in recent years, but that, still,
there were 66 incidents and $48,000 in damage reported last Fourth of
July.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is the firing of guns in celebration. Officials
said they find that many people who fire weapons into the air seem to
assume the bullets will go into orbit. Instead, they said, they come
down, and often wound or kill.</TE>

<DH>Community: A North Hills Ford dealership serves as a key
meeting place for the secession group Valley VOTE.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another [they] should declare the cause ... at a Ford dealership?</LD>
<LD>   Galpin Ford in North Hills is where secessionists declare the San
Fernando Valley's independence. For the last three years, they have
held their strategy sessions in a borrowed conference room above rows
of shiny Explorers.</LD>
<LD>   The giant auto store looks more like an airport terminal than like
Philadelphia's Independence Hall, but the location makes some sense
as a meeting place for Valley VOTE, the group advocating a split from
Los Angeles. After all, selling a new city can have much in common
with selling a new car.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to create the excitement," Galpin salesman Mark Evans
said on a recent evening, while Valley VOTE members were meeting
upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to see what the hot button is. Some people are looking
for safety. Some are looking for more room."</TE>
<TE>   The people pitching the secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot say
voters should trade in L.A. for a smaller city that is safer
(increased police patrols), more responsive (better delivery of
services) and cheaper (lower taxes).</TE>
<TE>   But those who want to keep L.A. together say buyer beware: An
independent Valley would be a lemon that voters can't even test
drive. "The minute you drive it off the showroom floor, it's worth
less than it was," said Larry Levine, a political strategist leading
the anti-secession group One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you wish you had back that car you sold when you were a
kid?" Levine asked. "If they secede, they're going to one day say, 'I
wish I had it back.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Valley and the rest of L.A. sprawled with the auto's
popularity, so it might seem strange that what is billed as the
world's largest-volume Ford dealership hosts a movement upset about
the city's size. At its lots on Roscoe Boulevard--"one block east of
the 405 Freeway, in the heart of the San Fernando Valley''--Galpin
Motors sells more than 24,000 vehicles a year.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do half as good a job pitching what we are as they do
selling Fords, we'll win this thing in a walk," said former
Assemblyman Richard Katz, a secession campaign leader.</TE>
<TE>   Galpin owner Bert Boeckmann, who sold Fords for dealership founder
Frank Galpin before buying him out, is one of the Valley's most
prominent secession supporters. He donates use of the room to Valley
VOTE and paid for an early poll. Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain
drives a black Expedition from Galpin, but says he got the same deal
offered any customer.</TE>
<TE>   On the third Monday evening of each month, Brain and company enter
the gleaming Galpin showroom, walk past the SST Ford Expedition
endorsed by Shaquille O'Neal and climb the stairs to the conference
room, where they sit in mauve chairs at pink-veneered tables. The
walls are bare, but there is a view of a Denny's restaurant and an
Anheuser-Busch brewery that wafts a soggy-bread aroma.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings are open to the public and have begun to attract
crowds of 100. At one session, a campaign worker laid out an
easy-payment plan for contributors. "We can charge your credit card,"
she said. "We can make it as easy for you as you will let us."</TE>
<TE>   During the day, Galpin employees use the room for sales and
motivational meetings. Among the training materials kept in the
audiovisual closet is a video series titled "Leonard Learns Leasing,"
which might prove useful to secessionists studying a plan to lease
city services from Los Angeles after a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   And if an independent Valley needs to buy a fleet of cars? "Not a
problem," Boeckmann said.</TE>

<HD>Getting Set for Get-Togethers</HD>
<DH>Holiday: For thousands, the Fourth means getting out of
town to celebrate. Then there are Orange County's perennial
beachgoers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maxine Gilles has spent every Fourth of July weekend since 1972
camping out at Doheny State Beach. She is there again this year, with
about 80 of her relatives and friends.</LD>
<LD>   "The first time, I came with two girlfriends," said Gilles, 65, of
Anaheim, "and then it just took off and spread. Now it's become a big
event."</LD>
<LD>   It took some major planning. To get the 14 campsites they needed,
group members had to reserve them individually, seven months in
advance. "We all started calling on Dec. 1st," said Stephanie
Prescott, 11, who has been coming with her family for years. "We call
from work or use our cell phones--we just keep pushing redial."</LD>
<TE>   Gilles and her fellow campers are among the hundreds of thousands
of Independence Day revelers expected to leave, arrive in or pass
through Orange County this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 145,000 will pass through John Wayne Airport,
spokeswoman Ann McCarley said Wednesday. "[Wednesday] and Sunday are
anticipated to be our biggest days."</TE>
<TE>   Her advice: Arrive at the airport at least 2 1/2 hours before
flight time, and don't even consider trying to carry fireworks
aboard. "We're being a lot more vigilant since Sept. 11," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol planned to have 80% of its available
personnel in the area on duty from 6 p.m. Wednesday to midnight
Sunday. "Mainly we'll be looking for impaired drivers, DUI drivers,
aggressive drivers or any accident-causing violations," said Officer
Mark Reeves, a CHP spokesman. "We suggest that you just be patient.
Give yourself enough space between you and another driver, have
alternate routes planned, and allow yourself plenty of time to get
where you're going."</TE>
<TE>   At the Doheny campground near Dana Point, most of the campers
lucky enough to have sites were already in them by Wednesday
afternoon. "It's a great place to spend the Fourth," said Claud Cook,
74, of Westminster, standing in front of his recreational vehicle.
"They have real good fireworks off a barge."</TE>
<TE>   The campground's 115 sites--which rent for $12 a night--are
generally reserved for the July 4 weekend within two hours of
becoming available at 8 a.m. Dec. 1, said Erin Davis, a park aide.
"It's been like this for years," she said. "I think it's a tradition
for lots of people."</TE>
<TE>   That is certainly the case for Gilles and the nine families
accompanying her this year. Among their planned activities:
horseshoes, chess, volleyball, kite-flying and water-balloon-throwing
contests, as well as a talent show on the beach, featuring
violinists, cellists, singers and novelty acts.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signals Emissions Bill Support</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor 'inclined' to back measure targeting
greenhouse gases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis said Wednesday that he is "strongly inclined" to sign
legislation that would make California the first state to regulate
automobile emissions of greenhouse gases to combat global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor made the remark during a morning interview
with a San Francisco radio station, but cautioned that he was still
reviewing the measure and some amendments made before its passage
Monday by the state Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   "Most Americans believe that we can have the choice of the auto or
truck we want, and still do a better job with the cleaning up [of]
the environment around us," Davis said during the interview with KGO
news radio. "I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance, and
that's why I'm strongly inclined to sign it."</LD>
<TE>   A day earlier, when asked for a position on the emissions bill,
Davis' Republican rival in this fall's elections, businessman Bill
Simon, told the same radio station that he was unsure whether global
warming exists.</TE>
<TE>   "Reducing global warming, if indeed there is such a thing as
global warming, is always a good idea," Simon said during the radio
interview, adding that he would review the measure closely to ensure
that it was based on solid scientific principles before taking a
stance.</TE>
<TE>   That was a change for Simon, whose campaign issued a news release
in May quoting Simon as saying an earlier but nearly identical
version of the legislation was "social engineering" and "a thinly
veiled attempt to regulate the kind of vehicles Californians are
allowed to drive."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Simon campaign released a statement saying that
Simon was concerned about the measure because it gave a "blank check"
to the same government agency that pushed to put the gasoline
additive MTBE in the state's gas supply to reduce air pollution. MTBE
was subsequently shown to pollute groundwater supplies, and the state
is now planning to phase it out.</TE>
<TE>   The global warming bill, AB 1493 by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura Hills), has been the focus of an intense political battle
between environmentalists and business interests and could lead to
changes in the design of cars sold all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   It seeks to limit the releasing of greenhouse gases, primarily
carbon dioxide, and would direct the California Air Resources Board
to come up with regulations that achieve the "maximum feasible
reduction" of the gases while taking costs into account. Because the
easiest known way to reduce the emissions in cars and trucks is to
design ones that burn less fuel, that would be the likely outcome.</TE>
<TE>   California is the nation's largest car market, making up roughly
10% of all cars sold. The state is also the only one in the nation
that has the power to pass air pollution rules that are stronger than
those set by the federal government. Other states can then follow the
new standard set by California, and have done so on a number of
occasions.</TE>
<TE>   An opposition ad campaign financed by auto makers, oil companies
and others warned California consumers that they could see higher
taxes and could be denied the right to drive trucks and sport-utility
vehicles as a result of the legislation. But the air board does not
have the power to raise taxes, and the measure specifically states
that no car types would be outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' constituent affairs department reported Wednesday that
phone calls to the governor were running slightly in favor of the
measure, while e-mails were running overwhelmingly in support.
Opponents were planning a letter-writing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has 12 days to decide whether to sign or veto the measure.
But the clock does not start ticking until he formally receives the
bill on his desk. It is still being processed after clearing the
Legislature.</TE>

<HD>Jim Brown Leaves Jail After Serving Reduced Sentence</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: The former NFL star and actor, convicted of
smashing his wife's car window, was a model prisoner, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Football legend and former action film star Jim Brown was released
from the Ventura County Jail on Wednesday after serving less than
four months of his six-month sentence for smashing the windows of his
wife's car in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, 66, was convicted on a misdemeanor vandalism charge and
chose to serve the jail time rather than complete a domestic violence
counseling program, pay a fine and donate to a battered women's
shelter.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who began his jail term with a two-week fast for "spiritual
cleansing," was a model prisoner, said Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman
for the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. "He was very
cooperative, very accommodating," he said, adding that was probably
the reason two months were shaved off Brown's sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Brown was sentenced by a Los Angeles judge but housed in Ventura
County to minimize possible conflicts among gang members he had
counseled in the Los Angeles jails. Brown has worked extensively to
establish peace among rival Los Angeles gangs.</TE>
<TE>   He also has been charged, though not convicted, in five domestic
abuse cases since the 1960s. Among other things, he was accused of
throwing a girlfriend off a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he was convicted of misdemeanor vandalism for
smashing windows in his wife's car as she phoned 911 from a
neighbor's home. She later recanted and on Wednesday afternoon was
relaxing with her husband and their infant son at home.</TE>
<TE>   While Brown characterized his prison sentence as "outrageous," he
said he was treated cordially and professionally by Ventura County
deputies and that his experience in jail was positive.</TE>
<TE>   Incarceration increased his opportunity to help troubled young
men, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It also gave him an intensely personal look at a justice system he
says doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   During his months in jail, reporters dropped by to interview him
for the national media and supporters rallied around him.</TE>
<TE>   Now his goal is to keep the momentum going.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first stops after being released and driven to Los
Angeles was Crenshaw Boulevard, where he walked along the street,
poking his head into businesses and introducing himself.</TE>
<TE>   He met with several neighborhood leaders who are attempting to
quash gang violence and phoned boxing promoter Don King to request
his involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a serene Brown sat under a blue umbrella on the deck at his
home in the Hollywood Hills, holding court over a group of attentive
young men as he spoke of his experience in jail and his thoughts on
the justice system.</TE>
<TE>   His conclusion: "Incarceration doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make our communities any safer," he said, adding that
many inmates pose no threat to the public.</TE>
<TE>   What people think of him after his stint in jail doesn't concern
him.</TE>
<TE>   "God is the only judge," he said.</TE>

agreed to a judge's conditions that he complete a domestic violence
counseling program, pay a fine and make a payment to a
battered-women's shelter. Brown objected to categorizing the
vandalism as domestic violence. B6</CP>

<HD>Probe Sought of County's Failure to Report Disease</HD>
<DH>Health: Supervisor wants to know why the public was not
notified of the Legionnaires' outbreak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County supervisor will ask the Department of Health
Services to investigate why it did not notify the public about a
recent outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in a downtown hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The motion by Michael D. Antonovich on Tuesday's agenda also calls
for the department to outline changes to its policy on publicizing
outbreaks.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't make sense that "we have full public disclosure of
restaurants that have closed for unsanitary conditions" but not for
disease outbreaks, said Antonovich, who also initiated the county's
program to post restaurant inspectors' grades.</LD>
<TE>   County health officials acknowledged earlier this week that nine
patients at Good Samaritan Hospital were diagnosed with Legionnaires'
between January and June--but they disclosed the news only after
being asked by a Times reporter investigating a tip.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the nine patients died, although Good Samaritan said they
did not die of Legionnaires' disease.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a Legionnaires' outbreak, reporting where that
occurs is a public health responsibility. There should be full
disclosure for protection of public health," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory infection that is acquired
through inhalation of water droplets. It cannot be spread from person
to person.</TE>
<TE>   The office of Supervisor Gloria Molina, whose district includes
Good Samaritan, has asked the health department for an accounting of
how it handled the Legionnaires' outbreak, her spokesman, Miguel
Santana, said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would always err on the side of informing the public," Santana
said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 8,000 and 18,000 people are infected with Legionnaires'
annually in the U.S., experiencing chills, fever and a cough,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Patients contract the disease by inhaling mist that contains the
Legionella pneumophila bacterium. The naturally occurring bacteria
can be found in warm, stagnant water systems. Tests showed the water
supply at Good Samaritan contained active L. pneumophila.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone who is exposed gets infected; cigarette smokers,
patients with lung conditions or those who have undergone major
surgery are most susceptible.</TE>

<HD>Mural Repair Grant Stops Short of Need</HD>
<DH>Freeways: State will pay $1.7 million to restore 27 of Los
Angeles County's 51 ravaged artworks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost to repair Los Angeles County's neglected and vandalized
freeway murals--and restore the county's reputation as mural capital
of the world--would exceed $2.6 million, according to a study
commissioned by the state Department of Transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The study confirmed that a $1.7-million grant set aside by Gov.
Gray Davis in March won't be enough to repair all 51 freeway murals
in the county.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the study, drafted by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs
Department, the governor's grant can restore 27 artworks that were
ranked by a panel of artists, curators and others as the area's most
significant murals. The future of the remaining 24 murals remains
uncertain.</LD>
<TE>   That estimate does not include the cost to Caltrans for traffic
control, insurance and other expenses the agency may incur in
assisting the restoration efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo said his agency plans to
request bids soon from conservation firms to begin the repairs. He
said those murals that are not restored under the $1.7-million grant
may be repaired "as additional funds become available in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The artists who painted the murals have yet to be notified, but
officials at the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department said they
will urge Caltrans to draft a restoration plan that includes the
participation of these artists.</TE>
<TE>   Several Los Angeles-based mural artists who were contacted said
they are willing to help restore their artwork and happy that state
funds have been earmarked for the effort. But they said the
restoration work may be difficult because some of the murals are
nearly 20 years old and many of the artists no longer live in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that everybody is 100% behind fixing these works," said
Glenna Avila, who painted "L.A. Freeway Kids," a mural on the
Hollywood Freeway near the Los Angeles Street exit that depicts
children at play. The study concluded that her 240-foot long mural is
a "very significant" art piece that requires more than $131,000 in
restoration work.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said the mural has been marred by graffiti and water damage.
Over the years, she has tried to paint out the graffiti, but has been
overwhelmed by the extent of the water damage.</TE>
<TE>   "As an individual artist you can't tackle something like that,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most heavily damaged murals were commissioned just
before the 1984 Olympics by the Olympic Organizing Committee and
local corporations, with the support of Caltrans. Most of the damage
cited by the study was caused by vandalism, deterioration and dirt
accumulation.</TE>
<TE>   But the study by the Cultural Affairs Department took a shot at
Caltrans, noting that the agency obscured five significant murals by
painting over them with gray paint.</TE>
<TE>   One such mural, "Eye on '84" by artist Alonzo Davis, depicted
three colorful tapestries on the Harbor Freeway near the 3rd Street
onramp. The Cultural Affairs Department study said that the mural has
been obliterated and suggested that Caltrans give Davis the
opportunity to restore the artwork at a new location.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that Kent Twitchell's "7th Street
Altarpiece," depicting a man and a woman facing each other with their
palms out, may be damaged beyond repair. Twitchell said he was
willing to help restore the mural, located on the Harbor Freeway in
downtown Los Angeles, or repaint it at a new location, whichever is
cheaper. He said he spent about six months completing the mural just
before the 1984 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He said the idea behind the mural was to greet Olympic visitors
with palms out, a Native American gesture that shows the greeter is
not carrying any weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Baca's "Hitting the Wall," a mural that depicts a woman
marathon runner breaking through a wall, was ranked as a "very
significant" artwork by the panel. But the panel said the mural, on
the Harbor Freeway at the 4th Street exit, is in poor condition and
would require up to $56,000 in repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Baca, who spent nine months painting the 94-foot-long artwork,
said the mural celebrates the first time women were allowed to
compete in an Olympic marathon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the hardest things I ever did," she said, adding that
she painted much of the mural while breathing from an oxygen tank to
avoid exhaust fumes from the freeway traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has earned the reputation of mural capital of the
world for the 2,500 or so murals painted on public and private
property throughout the county. Only 51 of them are along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, graffiti taggers have shown respect for such work by
keeping their markings off the murals. But in the last two years, a
new generation of brash young vandals has started to violate that
"taggers code," as evidenced by the proliferation of graffiti on
freeway murals.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans initially responded by painting over vandalized murals
with drab gray paint. But after loud complaints from artists and
others, the state agency adopted a policy in May of notifying artists
by certified mail when a mural of theirs has been vandalized.</TE>
<TE>   Still the problem with vandalized murals did not improve,
prompting Gov. Davis to set aside the $1.7 million in restoration
funds.</TE>
<TE>   However, the funds came with some tough new restrictions,
including guidelines for the locations and the types of materials
used on new freeway murals.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed guidelines, muralists must post a bond or sign
an agreement to maintain their mural, possibly for 10 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   But Baca rejects the idea that mural artists are responsible for
maintaining the artwork for such a period. She said that she was
given $18,000 to paint her mural, but that after paying expenses she
earned only about $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "These are gifts to a city and to a particular public event," Baca
said.</TE>

<HD>This Olympics Lets Black Youths Test Their Mettle</HD>
<DH>Competition: The NAACP event offers teens recognition for
achievements in science, art and performance. It's a reward that
often goes only to athletes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-five years ago, the NAACP launched an academic decathlon of
sorts for young African Americans. It's called the ACT-SO, short for
Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics,</LD>
<LD>   ACT-SO "was designed to let Afro-American youth gain the same kind
of recognition for academic achievement as an athlete would," said
Naomi Rainey, president of the NAACP chapter in Long Beach. "There
were a lot of stereotypes about Afro-American youths" when the
program was created.</LD>
<LD>   The youngsters on a team from Long Beach aim to shoot down those
stereotypes by just being themselves and doing what they love.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Fuzell from St. John Bosco High School can build a
Popsicle-stick bridge that holds more than 55 pounds without
breaking, and singer Melody Joyner from Wilson High School takes on
the challenges of "Ave Maria."</TE>
<TE>   Dawuan Osbourne from Long Beach Polytechnic High School wants to
win a cash prize so he can start a computer graphics component to his
already thriving art business. And Autum Brown from Middle College
High School, who will compete in the entrepreneurship category, sold
more candy than her school's student store--by herself.</TE>
<TE>   A Talent Showcase</TE>
<TE>   ACT-SO was created within the National Assn. for the Advancement
of Colored People by newspaper columnist Vernon Jarrett, and was
designed to be a forum to showcase the artistic, academic and
scientific expertise of black youths.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors in grades nine through 12 come from cities all over
the country and parts of Spain, Germany and Japan, Rainey said.
California alone has 10 ACT-SO branches, which include the cities of
Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Compton and Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Winners at the competition win gold, silver and bronze medals that
all come with cash awards. Successful ACT-SO alumni include movie
director John Singleton and actress Jada Pinkett-Smith. This year's
competition, which is scheduled to be held at the NAACP annual
convention in Houston, starts today and runs through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For some students, competing in ACT-SO means overcoming
difficulties, whether at school or home.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood High School student Mercedes Walker was diagnosed with
sickle cell anemia at the age of 2. When crescent-shaped red blood
cells clogged her bloodstream and didn't allow other cells to deliver
oxygen to the rest of her body, she cried in agony because the pain
in her arms and legs crippled her.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her earliest memories are of pain.</TE>
<TE>   Ability to Dance, Write</TE>
<TE>   "It scared me a lot," she said. "How could a little person my age
go through all this pain? I thought I was dying." Now Walker is
conquering--symbolically, at least--her disease by dancing in a
routine that is a mix of ballet and jazz, and is educating others by
writing about sickle cell, in the dance and original essay
categories.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Walker on the Long Beach team are Casey Duncan, Donnell
Davis, Jonathan Powell, Jeremy Nelson, Malika Williams, Tiffany
Shillers and Candice Arnwine.</TE>
<TE>   Shillers, a student at Jordan High School, is competing in the
oratory category, acting out a scene from the psychological thriller
"Naomi's Web."</TE>
<TE>   "I identified with the piece because there's this part when
[Naomi] says, 'Have you ever seen your mom get beat?' and I saw my
mom get beat for three years," Shillers said. "I just want to make my
mom proud. I want her to see that I got a lot going for me. She's
never really had anything to be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Arnwine, a Poly High student competing in the music composition
category, wrote her first piece about her parents' divorce, and hopes
to come back as a successful ACT-SO alumna.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity of a lifetime," she said. "It's important
because you get to see a great number of black kids doing something
positive with their lives."</TE>

<HD>Malibu Offers MTV an Alternative Reality and One-Way Ticket
Out of Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Malibu City Council voted unanimously to forbid MTV from taping a
reality show at a local residence, but was thoughtful enough to
suggest an alternative.</LD>
<LD>   "Give them the name Malibu" for the production, Councilman Ken
Kearsley was quoted as saying in the Malibu Times.</LD>
<LD>   "They can go to 818 country and fog up the window. They can put
some sand in a parking lot and call it a beach."</LD>
<TE>   By the way: I believe "818 Country" is one possible name for the
proposed San Fernando Valley city that I hadn't heard before.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see your good side: Pam Linn, a columnist for the Malibu
Times, sent along a shot of a sign that was supposed to contain the
word "opposing." In its altered state, she noted, it would be perfect
for folks in the entertainment set (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Shhh ... It's Martha speaking: James Farmer of Huntington Park
came upon an offer indicating that Martha Stewart is still wheeling
and dealing (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Or is she? My family, on the other hand, received a note from
Martha Stewart Living magazine that bore these words on the envelope:
"We'll miss you." Since we're not going anywhere, we wondered if
Stewart was--especially in light of the allegations that she used
insider information to sell some stock.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe the inscription on the envelope referred to the
cancellation of our magazine subscription.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of unforgettable offers: Paul Hinkley of Carson spotted a
rather pricey ticket for a performance of the Who at the Hollywood
Bowl. "For that price," Hinkley said, "maybe they would play in my
backyard" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Sure sign of summer: A Cypress resident "asked if police would
turn off a hose filling a pool," the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise
said, "as the resident was delayed in Palm Desert and had no one else
to ask."</TE>
<TE>   Pennies from Lane 3: The police log of the Los Angeles Independent
reported that "following a traffic dispute, a woman became angry with
a man and threw several coins at his car." Not quite as exciting as
winning the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I heard a Hollywoodite scoff at a poll showing that
his town's secession was not likely to be approved by voters. He
pointed out that many of those polled were undecided--15% in
Hollywood alone. Well, if I were him, I wouldn't count on the
undecideds who live in Tinsel Town. Some of those characters couldn't
make up their minds about what planet they're on.</TE>

<HD>State Lists Fines in Energy Crisis</HD>
<DH>Power: Generators were assessed $122 million for failing to
provide electricity in 2000-01.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State grid operators fined a dozen companies and utilities a total of
$122 million for failing to deliver electricity from December 2000 to
June 2001, according to information released Wednesday by the
California Independent System Operator.</LD>
<LD>   Those penalized include major power plant owners, such as Duke
Energy and Reliant Energy, and the operators of publicly owned
systems, such as the city of Pasadena and the State Water Project.</LD>
<LD>   The companies and agencies were punished for not generating
electricity when called on to do so by Cal-ISO, which is responsible
for maintaining an even flow of power on the transmission grid
serving three-quarters of the state.</LD>
<TE>   Cal-ISO disclosed the fines, which were imposed at the height of
the state's electricity crisis, in response to requests by the news
media. Officials with the agency said the fines were not necessarily
evidence that energy companies had shut down power plants to drive up
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rules are very clear," said Cal-ISO's executive director,
Terry Winter. "We called you; you didn't perform. We're making no
judgment on why you didn't perform."</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators gave Cal-ISO the ability to impose such fines
in December 2000 as many power generators avoided selling to the
state's utilities for fear that they would not be paid. The utilities
were on the verge of bankruptcy after several months of paying
exorbitant prices for wholesale electricity in the market that
California had created under a 1996 deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO's penalty authority was revoked by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission after June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The trading arm of Houston-based Dynegy got the steepest
fine--$44.8 million--followed by Tulsa-based Williams Cos., which
sells energy from three major Southern California power plants and
was penalized $25.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Energy paid $25 million in penalties, Duke Energy paid
$4.5 million and the city of Pasadena was fined $359,000. The
power-trading branch of the State Water Project was charged $1.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   A Williams spokeswoman, Paula Hall-Collins, said the company had
contested the fines for months.</TE>
<TE>   "We never refused to dispatch," she said. "We on occasion, because
of some kind of physical plant limitation, may not have been able to
fulfill the entire offer originally made."</TE>
<TE>   Such penalties will be considered by FERC later this summer when
it holds hearings on California's request for nearly $9 billion in
refunds from companies that earned handsome profits in the state's
electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   If FERC retroactively reduces market prices to give California
refunds, the penalties also will be reduced. For each megawatt-hour
that the companies failed to deliver to Cal-ISO, they were charged
twice the market price at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is very much tied up in the FERC refund resolution
process," said Richard Wheatley, spokesman for Reliant Energy of
Houston.</TE>

<HD>Stanley Rader, 71; Advisor in Worldwide Church of God</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Robert Rader, the long-time confidant of the late Herbert W.
Armstrong of the Worldwide Church of God, has died. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Rader, who successfully battled California during a church finance
scandal and then won passage of legislation blocking fiscal
investigations of any religious group by the state, died Tuesday in
Pasadena, two weeks after he was diagnosed with acute pancreatic
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   For years, Rader often was at the center of tumultuous events in
the church's history.</LD>
<TE>   In 1979, California Atty. Gen. George Deukmejian opened an
investigation into allegations that Armstrong and Rader had
"pilfered" millions of dollars a year from church coffers. The church
was placed into a temporary receivership by the court. Earlier, Rader
was embroiled in another controversy that ended with Armstrong
ousting his son, Garner Ted Armstrong, from the church after
allegations of gambling and adultery.</TE>
<TE>   In both instances, Rader came out on top. The attorney general's
investigation was dropped after Rader, who was joined by other
religious groups, succeeded in winning passage of a bill by the
California Legislature that removed the state attorney general's
power to investigate religious organizations over allegations of
misuse of funds or other fraud. And, after the highly publicized
father-son dispute, Rader moved into the son's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Armstrong has said publicly very often that I am a son in
whom he is well pleased," Rader told a reporter at the time. "The
only other one he ever said that about was Ted Armstrong."</TE>
<TE>   Rader, who grew up as a secular Jew, met Armstrong in 1956 when he
came to California from White Plains, N.Y., as a young attorney. He
said in a 1978 interview that he had become close to Armstrong by the
mid-1960s but didn't become a church member for another 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Armstrong asked me to give up all my commitments and devote
my talent, energy and time to him," Rader said. "In 1969 I said yes."
Rader left private practice to work full-time for Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Rader reportedly was instrumental in persuading Armstrong to open
the auditorium at Ambassador College in Pasadena to the public for
what became a critically acclaimed concert series. The series was
abandoned in the 1990s and the entire campus, including the ornate
and luxuriously furnished Ambassador Auditorium, is in the process of
being sold.</TE>
<TE>   Rader once proclaimed in court that Armstrong was "God's apostle,
Christ's representative here on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   In those days, the church rejected the Christian belief in the
Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit and refused to observe Easter
and Christmas but kept Jewish feast days. It also imposed unbending
requirements on its members to strictly give not only a 10th or tithe
of their income to the church, but more.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the church has become mainstream evangelical
Protestant in its faith and worship. The church now reports 60,000
members worldwide, half of them in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The church jettisoned virtually all of its controversial teachings
in the early 1990s after Armstrong's death in 1986, but Rader
remained a member even as thousands of disaffected members and
ministers left. The church said many of Armstrong's views were
heretical.</TE>
<TE>   Rader stepped down as general counsel and treasurer in 1981 and
was paid a $250,000 bonus, the church said at the time. He continued
to receive payments from the church's "discretionary retirement
program," Bernard Schnippert, director of finance and planning, said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and 1980s, Rader was a formidable and controversial
presence at Armstrong's side, a self-described lightning rod when the
church came under fire. He appeared on CBS' "60 Minutes" during the
investigation by Deukmejian. The probe was prompted by a lawsuit
filed by disaffected church members who charged that Armstrong and
Rader were living an extravagant lifestyle and had sold church
property below market value for private profit. The church had a
reported tax-free income of $70 million a year. In those days, it
boasted media and financial power larger than the Billy Graham and
Oral Roberts organizations combined.</TE>
<TE>   During court proceedings, Rader said he owned homes in Beverly
Hills, Pasadena and Tucson, all initially financed by the church. He
sold the Beverly Hills home at a tidy profit and told reporters
during a break in proceedings, "Buy low, sell high. I don't take
'stupid pills,' you know."</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote a book about the scandal, "A Church Under Fire,"
which was a brief for the defense. In it, he attributed the state's
temporary takeover to a conspiracy involving avaricious church
"dissidents" and slippery state officials eager for an excuse to
clamp government controls on church affairs, a book review said at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   A news release this week announcing Rader's death quoted the Rev.
Dan M. Kelley of the National Council of Churches as praising the
book as "the seminal work on church/state relations in the 20th
century." The issue, Rader argued, was religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Rader is survived by his wife, Niki, sister Joan Klein, daughters
Janis and Carol, son Stephen and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Mountain View
Cemetery in Altadena.</TE>

<HD>Retired Teacher Is Found Guilty in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Court: A judge convicts Albert Rosen, 75, a longtime member

more than 30 years ago.</DH>

<LD>A Ventura County school board member was convicted Wednesday of
molesting a 6-year-old girl more than 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Rosen, 75, a retired teacher and longtime member of the
Ventura County Board of Education, resigned a few hours later. He was
found guilty of nine criminal counts for engaging in lewd acts with a
child.</LD>
<LD>   Last month Rosen waived his right to a jury trial and submitted
the case to Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath.</LD>
<TE>   At a court hearing Wednesday, Rosen tried to withdraw the waiver,
contending he had not understood what he was doing. McGrath denied
the request and then found Rosen, a Simi Valley resident, guilty on
nine of 10 criminal counts.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Rosen, who could be released on probation
or sentenced to life in prison, declined to comment on the ruling.
Hours later, he sent a letter of resignation to the school board.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Joseph O'Neill said the ruling was expected
because it was nearly impossible to mount a defense more than three
decades after the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely unfair," O'Neill said, criticizing a state law
allowing certain sex assault cases to be filed well after the statute
of limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   "This case will be reversed on appeal," O'Neill said, "I guarantee
it."</TE>
<TE>   But Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ernesto Acosta said the California
Supreme Court has upheld the law in question.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they are going to get very far," Acosta said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen was arrested May 15, 2001, after a months-long
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Ron Rosen, 44, told Simi Valley police he and a female
relative had been molested by his father several times from 1966 to
1970.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Ron Rosen had assumed no charges could
be filed because the alleged incidents occurred long ago. But after
reading an article on a change in the law abolishing the statute of
limitations on certain sex crimes, Ron Rosen went to police and
reported he had been molested as a 9-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy to do," Ron Rosen said Wednesday. Last fall,
McGrath ruled at a preliminary hearing that there was credible
evidence suggesting Albert Rosen had molested the 6-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   But he dismissed two counts involving Ron Rosen's complaints
because the son had told an L.A. County sheriff's detective about the
alleged molestation five years earlier, which meant authorities had
one year to file a case.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rosen said Wednesday he was relieved his father was convicted
on the other charges involving his relative, and hopes he and she can
now move on with their lives.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura County school board member was convicted Wednesday of

the case.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosen said he was relieved his father was convicted on the
other charges involving his relative, and hopes he and she can now
move on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the beginning of closure and vindication," he said. "This
was devastating to our lives. I really had no idea of the extent of
what he did to [her]."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Board of Education President Marty Bates said
Rosen's conviction means he can no longer serve as a board member.</TE>
<TE>   Bates said he was not surprised by the verdict, but said he is
glad the ordeal is over. Rosen, a board member for 13 years, has not
been an asset to the panel since his arrest more than "I think the
board will be better off with a qualified replacement, and I think
Simi Valley will be better off with someone who can truly represent
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County schools' Supt. Charles Weis agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This has drawn out a long time, and it's good to finally have
some resolution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Board members must now decide how they will deal with Rosen's open
seat. Weis said because the fall election is near, he believes
Rosen's spot will have to remain unfilled until the November
balloting.</TE>
<TE>   Bates, however, said he will call a special meeting next week to
address the issue.</TE>
<TE>   If possible, Bates said, he would like the board to appoint a
temporary replacement.</TE>

<LD>Police shot and wounded a man holding his estranged wife at gunpoint
on a San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge overpass Wednesday, ending a
situation that forced officials to close most of the freeways
approaching from the east. The closures caused a huge morning
rush-hour traffic jam.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the situation began Tuesday when Clay Cael, 48,
kidnapped his estranged wife from a house in San Francisco. Police
went to Cael's home and found an 85-year-old woman shot to death.
Police said Cael will be charged with murder and kidnapping.</LD>

<LD>A computer expert for the defense testified on Wednesday that some of
the pornography seized at the home of murder defendant David
Westerfield may have been collected not by Westerfield but by his
college-age son.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that the pornography proves Westerfield had
sexual fantasies about young girls.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-year-old design engineer is accused of the kidnapping and
murder of Danielle van Dam, 7.</LD>
<TE>   Computer expert Marcus Lawson said that based on e-mail on one of
four computers at Westerfield's home, he concluded that some of the
pictures from a porn Web site had been downloaded by Westerfield's
son, Neil.</TE>

<HD>Slayer of Parks' Kin Is Convicted</HD>
<DH>Trial: A gang member is guilty of murder in the shooting of
the ex-police chief's granddaughter. He's also found guilty of eight
attempted killings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles gang member was convicted Wednesday of murdering the
granddaughter of Bernard C. Parks, the former Los Angeles police
chief.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Shabazz faces life in prison without the possibility of
parole for killing 20-year-old Lori Gonzalez, who was shot as she
drove a car out of a fast-food restaurant parking lot on May 28,
2000. Gonzalez was a bystander caught between rival gangs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's what we hoped for and prayed for, although nothing can bring
back our daughter," Gonzalez's mother, Felicia Parks, said outside
court. "We have our memories, and at least we feel that we did get
the answer that we wanted."</LD>
<TE>   Shabazz, 20, looked down as the verdict was read in the courtroom
of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Perry. Several
of Gonzalez's relatives, seated in the front row, held hands and
embraced. The former chief was not in court.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors deliberated for a day and a half before finding that
Shabazz was a gang member who committed the murder to benefit the
gang. The seven-man, five-woman jury also found Shabazz guilty of
eight other attempted murders, including four separate shootings in
1998. He was acquitted of one attempted murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they decided not to seek the death penalty for
Shabazz because he was 18 at the time of the murder.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to be sentenced July 26.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting touched an emotional chord in Los Angeles, prompting
calls for a crackdown on gang violence as Gonzalez became a symbol of
innocent victims. Condolences from then-President Clinton, Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and singer Lionel
Ritchie were read at Gonzalez's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   She was shot in the chest and head after driving through a
fast-food restaurant in southwest Los Angeles. Shabazz walked up to
her car and aimed his gun at her passenger, Ernest Gray, a rival gang
member, who ducked. Gonzalez died that night, a week before her 21st
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who lived in Mission Viejo with her father, had come to
Los Angeles to visit childhood friends, including Gray. She was a
student at Saddleback College, worked as a telephone operator and
taught Sunday school.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, prosecutors argued that Shabazz, a West
Boulevard Crip, shot at the car in retaliation for another gang
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Crips thought that Gray, a Blood, had committed a drive-by
earlier that day and responded by sending three carloads of members
to the fast-food restaurant at La Brea Avenue and Jefferson
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Manzella called several eyewitnesses
who identified Shabazz. Police testified that cartridge cases they
found in Shabazz's car matched cartridge cases found at three 1998
crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole case was strong," Manzella said. "With all the evidence
in this case, there was no defense."</TE>
<TE>   Manzella said it was only the connection to Parks that made the
case unique.</TE>
<TE>   "This happens almost every day on the streets of Los Angeles," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys argued during the trial that police planted
evidence and that the photographic lineups used to identify Shabazz
were flawed because he was the only dark-skinned male pictured.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's uncle, Bernard Parks Jr., said the murder was
"extremely hard" on the former chief, who was told of the verdict.
The younger Parks said he hopes the verdict will affect other gang
members.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope that someone will take notice from this and realize that
two years after it happened, it still doesn't make sense," he said.</TE>

<HD>Retiree Leads Campaign for a Mountain of a Flag</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From his backyard patio, Sonny Suarez gazes up at Conejo Peak with a
certain dissatisfaction, like Michelangelo sizing up a blank ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   "There should be a flag on top, and it's gotta be monumental," he
says. "In fact, there should be a monumental flag on top of a
majestic spot somewhere in every state. We've got to send a message
to the terrorists."</LD>
<LD>   At his kitchen table, he opens a folder bursting with letters to
officials, pleas to the media, phone numbers of prospective donors. A
retired warehouse manager for an airline, Suarez, 61, has made it his
mission to hoist Old Glory over the 1,814-foot mountain as a memorial
to the fallen of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   But to raise a giant flag, you have to pull some strings. While
Suarez has gotten the Thousand Oaks City Council to order a study of
the idea, he will also have to deal with neighbors who prefer their
mountains monumentless and officials who may insist on patriotic
traditions as American as the environmental impact report.</TE>
<TE>   Lighted at night, the flag would be at least 600 square feet--the
size of a one-bedroom apartment. It would wave from a pole nine
stories high. More than 189,000 motorists on the Ventura Freeway
would see it daily; atop a pinnacle just south of the Conejo Grade,
it would be visible 40 miles around, Suarez said.</TE>
<TE>   "You got your pole, you got your flag, you got your foundation,"
he said. "What's the problem? You're not going to tell me there's
some rare frog up there, are you?"</TE>
<TE>   Rare frogs and prickly little plants have thwarted far bigger
projects on Conejo Valley hillsides. But that doesn't deter Suarez,
who said: "You can take the plants and the animals and wrap them all
in a ribbon and they wouldn't be accomplishing anything compared to
what we'd be doing up there with a simple flag."</TE>
<TE>   The city's study is to be completed in September, a month when any
argument over the Stars and Stripes would be particularly sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as simple as a guy coming in and saying, 'Let's put up a
flag: Yes or no?' " said Scott Mitnick, a deputy city manager
overseeing the study.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he said, the flag would be planted in land
designated as open space. A road--estimates range from a few hundred
yards to a mile--would be carved up the slope from the access
easements beneath Southern California Edison power lines. And, if the
flag is to be visible far and wide, officials in neighboring
Camarillo and the Ventura County supervisors might also want to weigh
in on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Other city officials reeled off additional obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would be liable for someone getting hurt up there?" asked
City Councilman Dennis Gillette, who introduced Suarez's proposal to
the council in February as "a concept deserving of thorough
evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   "Who would maintain it?" Gillette asked. "Are we sure it would
withstand very strong winds? What would happen if the solar lighting
system failed and it went dark at night, violating flag etiquette?
Will environmental documents be needed? My support hasn't waned, but
all these questions have to be asked and answered well in advance."</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there is the estimated cost of $400,000. Calling
homebuilders with projects around his Dos Vientos subdivision, Suarez
said he has secured "verbal commitments" for donations. But how many
will come through, and for how much, won't be seen until the dawn's
early light.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him it sounds like a very good idea and that we would
participate," said Debbie Aronson, planning manager for Warmington
Homes California. "But I can't really tell you how much we would
give. We just don't know at all."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez came up with the idea as he focused on the mountain during
a bittersweet jog on the morning of Sept. 11. Ever since, he has been
alert to possibilities for advancing the plan. He has written to Rep.
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and to President Bush. He has called
Naval Base Ventura County to see if the Seabees could bring up heavy
equipment to install the flag's pedestal.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Las Vegas one night, he noticed a huge flag unfurling on a
pole towering above an Arco gas station.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Bingo!' " he recalled. " 'Just what I need.' "</TE>
<TE>   After impassioned entreaties from Suarez, Arco's parent company,
BP, is "seriously considering" donating a flagpole, said BP spokesman
Paul Langland.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't quite fit what we traditionally do, but it would be a
patriotic gesture," Langland said.</TE>
<TE>   The pole would cost about $20,000, Suarez said.</TE>
<TE>   If the promised donations for the monument materialize, Thousand
Oaks Mayor Ed Masry said he is all for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly in favor of putting up the flag wherever we can,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether it would violate a city ban on ridgeline
development, he said, "I don't think anyone would object to a flag on
the ridgeline. We'll deal with that once the financing is squared
away."</TE>
<TE>   However, the city already has received some notes of protest.</TE>
<TE>   Diane and Gary Anderson shot off e-mails to each council member,
arguing that saying yes to the flag would also force the city to
approve cell phone antennas, satellite receivers and other structures
in areas that are supposed to be untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "If the land is indeed designated as open space, then it should be
protected from any development, whether it be a flagpole, a cut-out
of Mom or a replica of her apple pie," their message said. "We should
all remember that well-intentioned ideas are not necessarily good
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Statements such as that strike Suarez as somewhere between
misguided and unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely agree with laws about development on ridgelines," he
said. "But we're talking about the American flag here. I guarantee
you, when people see this from the road, they'll be in tears. I know
I'll be."</TE>

<HD>Ancient Sport Still Rolling in Paradise</HD>
<DH>Lawn bowling has been around for centuries. Popular with
older people, it attracts few of the younger generation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time Norm Bender tried lawn bowling, he was escorted onto
the greens by a player well into his 80s. The old-timer inquired
about Bender's age.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him I was 65," Bender recalled. "He said, 'That's great,
we need some young blood at this club.' I thought he was kidding."</LD>
<LD>   The hilarious part is, he wasn't. Bender--now 71 and still
bowling--laughed at the memory. He has come to realize what many
bowlers hate to acknowledge: that the sport he loves is embraced
mainly by the pre-World War II crowd, those who grew up watching
Rocky Marciano and Ed Sullivan.</LD>
<TE>   When their creaky knees and bad shoulders no longer tolerate the
strains of weekend basketball, or tennis, or even golf, they shuffle
out onto the last of life's playing fields.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, that final sporting theater is appropriately
grand. Two immaculate square bowling greens, each 120 feet across,
occupy a bluff above a rocky beach--prime view property that would
never be set aside for the purpose today. Steep hills tumble in from
the east. The westward tilt of the coast, and the thick banks of
trees, succulents and ice plant rimming the bluffs, make the flatness
and symmetry of the greens all the more stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Trails skirt the low cliffs, traveled by tourists who pause at the
lawn-bowling gates, stare curiously for a few moments, and move
along. Breezy afternoons fade into red sunsets.</TE>
<TE>   "The seagulls and pelicans are swooping over, the palm trees are
swaying, and the sea is crashing," said Murray D. Brown, 71, who
bowls here regularly, his face shaded by a straw hat, one spindly
knee secured by a brace. "I don't think there's a more beautiful
setting in California for this."</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be a consensus. Though greens are still scattered
across California--bowlers compete in Beverly Hills, Long Beach,
Pasadena and other cities--the arena in Laguna offers the most
compelling union of sport and place.</TE>
<TE>   Located in city-owned Heisler Park, the bowling area is about as
old as Brown. A real estate man named Harlan S. Kittle, who had moved
to Laguna Beach from Beverly Hills, decided there was a need and, in
1931, organized the Laguna Beach Lawn Bowling Club.</TE>
<TE>   By fall of that year, the first green was built. The second green
was added in 1951 and a tiny clubhouse in 1973. The nonprofit club
still runs the place and is planning its 70th anniversary celebration
for mid-November. The rolls now list 143 members, some of them among
the best lawn bowlers in America. They pay yearly dues of $75 apiece.
A member can bowl all day for $1.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those bargain-basement rates, the club struggles to
attract younger participants. "Members range in age from 29 to over
100," according to a club news release, but there are times,
especially on weekdays, when it's tough to find anyone under 50.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Handy doesn't bowl any more. Bender remembers watching Handy
a few years ago, an inspiring sight because of the energy he had, the
way he moved. Bender had heard that Handy was 92, a fact he mentioned
one day to a bystander. "The guy said, 'He's not 92--he's 97,' "
Bender recalled. "It just blew my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Handy gave up the game while continuing to serve as a Meals On
Wheels volunteer, said club President Heather Stewart, 53. Other
players simply die off. "I think last year we lost two," Stewart
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's husband, Jerry, 56, calls lawn bowling "the secret
sport." What accounts for its obscurity, he isn't sure, but young
people seem to prefer surfing and basketball. Lawn bowling is
confusing to watch, plus it's a British sport. "It fell out of
favor," he said, "after the Revolutionary War."</TE>
<TE>   There may be 6,000 lawn bowlers in all of the United States. The
sport combines the elegance of dressage with the tactical complexity
of chess and billiards.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Harvey C. Maxwell, a former president of the Laguna club,
wrote "The American Lawn Bowler's Guide," a 200-page handbook
published in 1966. In it, Maxwell offered instruction, training
exercises and traced the roots of the pastime to stone implements
from 5000 BC.</TE>
<TE>   "The actual origin of the game is hidden in the haze of
antiquity," he wrote. "Sculptured vases and ancient plaques show the
game being played 4,000 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The game resembles the Olympic ice sport of curling. Players,
competing as individuals or teams, begin by rolling a small white
ball, a "jack," to the opposite side of the green. The object, then,
is to get closest to the jack with larger balls, known as "bowls."
Part of the strategy is to knock the opponent's bowls out of the way.
Complicating the action is the fact that the three-pound bowls do not
roll straight. They are manufactured with varying degrees of
"bias"--they're lopsided--and will veer to the left or right,
depending on which way you hold them.</TE>
<TE>   Releasing the bowl properly demands the precision of a golf
stroke. Nationally ranked Mert Hill, 54, cited the technical and
strategic nuances of bowling and said, "You're not considered to know
the game until you've played 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   "Americans have a hard time, I think, because of the patience [it
requires]," said Simon Meyerowitz, 64, another top player. "You can't
rush it. If you lose your cool, you've had it."</TE>
<TE>   Meyerowitz's days as a tournament tennis player are long gone. He
is hobbled by hip-replacement surgery. Bowling now consumes him.</TE>
<TE>   He can recite much of its history--that George Washington
maintained a green at Mount Vernon, that Sir Francis Drake took on
Sir Walter Raleigh. Supposedly, they were deep in a close contest
when the Spanish armada was spotted off the English coast in 1588. No
one recorded who won, but it's said Drake insisted on completing the
game before battle.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't think of work and do this at the same time." Meyerowitz
said. "Once you're on the green, you've got to be focused."</TE>
<TE>   Players from throughout the world come to Laguna Beach for
tournaments, but also for the ocean air, the view, the sounds of the
surf. That some of the competitors are getting up in years doesn't
make them any easier to beat. As Jerry Stewart pointed out, "It's a
very easy game to learn, but it takes a lifetime to master."</TE>
<TE>   Murray Brown shook his head as he stood out on the greens one
sunny morning, flanked by two dozen other players in their white
shorts and caps.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a man here who's 86--Grant Valentine. I've only beaten
him once," Brown said. A former golfer and senior discus thrower,
Brown admits to a competitive nature. He has been lawn bowling for
six years after retiring as a speech pathologist.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that humbles you," he said, "is when an 80-year-old
woman out-bowls you. You go home with your tail between your legs."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed. "We do need young blood here."</TE>
<TE>   "People in their 60s?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah."</TE>

residents were evacuated from the mountains above Stateline as
firefighters battled a wildfire that grew to 200 acres late
Wednesday. No structures were damaged. Firefighters said they were
making progress as high winds began subsiding. Flames forced closure
of Nevada 207, connecting Minden, Nev., and Stateline. Smoke was
visible 50 miles away in Sparks, Nev.</CP>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge dismissed felony charges Wednesday against an
Orange teacher accused of helping students threaten gang rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Cummings, 38, an English teacher at Portola Middle School,
instead will face misdemeanor charges of contributing to the
delinquency of a minor, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Central Division Superior Court Judge Elaine Streger in Santa Ana
dismissed the felony charges at a preliminary hearing, saying they
were unsupported by the evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The accusations stemmed from an April 26 fistfight between a
14-year-old student of Cummings' and a 19-year-old neighbor of the
boy. Police said the boy returned with two 18-year-old friends in a
car driven by the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   They threatened friends of the neighbor as Cummings waited in the
car, police said. The 14-year-old pleaded guilty to a charge of
making a gang-related terrorist threat.</TE>

<HD>State Technology Oversight Board Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Government: Consultant says panel would develop procurement
guidelines, ethical criteria to avoid another Oracle debacle.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis continues to try to extricate the state from an
embarrassing $95-million computer software contract with Oracle
Corp., his handpicked consultant on Wednesday called for creation of
a new board that would oversee high-tech procurement and try to avert
similar debacles in the future.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendations follow a highly critical audit that found
insufficient need for the statewide computer software licensing deal
that the administration struck with Oracle and its partner, Northrop
Grumman subsidiary Logicon.</LD>
<LD>   Prepared by professor J. Clark Kelso of McGeorge School of Law in
Sacramento, the report recommends creation of a government technology
oversight board, headed by a chief technology officer and aided by an
office of government technology. Together, they would develop
regulations, plans and guidelines for information technology
projects, as well as ethical standards for procurement.</LD>
<TE>   The new bureaucracy would replace the Department of Information
Technology, which was created in 1995 after the state spent $50
million on a Department of Motor Vehicles computer system that never
worked and had to be scrapped. The department, which replaced the
Office of Information Technology, ceased to exist on Sunday, as
lawmakers refused to fund it.</TE>
<TE>   Another Davis-appointed group is looking at procurement policy.
The reports will become part of the mix as Davis and lawmakers deal
with the issue in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who has taken a leading role
on technology issues, called Kelso's suggestions a "reasonable
approach," though she added that any revision will require a detailed
look that will spill into next year.</TE>
<TE>   Following the DMV computer failure, then-Gov. Pete Wilson
appointed a panel to recommend changes in state computer procurement.
It responded by calling for a "computer czar" who would report
directly to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, officials had high hopes for their system of checks
and balances, and for the expertise. "Will this office prevent future
crises?" asked Lee Grissom, then director of the Office of Planning
and Research. "I believe it will go a long way toward achieving
that."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Kelso said a single computer czar is impractical
given the size of state government. By creating a board, he said, the
state could open the procurement process to the public. Kelso
emphasized that the "sunshine" of public hearings would help avert
debacles and ethical lapses.</TE>
<TE>   "The real goal has to be avoid mistakes in the first place," Kelso
said. "And some of that can be accomplished by opening up our
information technology planning process and procurement."</TE>
<TE>   Davis tapped Kelso in May after the governor suspended--and later
forced to resign--Department of Information Technology Director Elias
Cortez, a booster of the Oracle deal. Kelso gained a reputation as a
trouble-shooter by serving as the Department of Insurance's interim
director when Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush was forced to
resign two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Kelso acknowledged that his recommendations are "open to further
debate, analysis and discussion." In a news conference, he said he
hadn't formed opinions about the size of the board.</TE>
<TE>   His report envisions that the Government Technology Oversight
Board would create a statewide "strategic plan and vision" for
information technology development. The report says the board would
require a "needs assessment and fiscal analysis" before the state
buys a new system, and that there would be "full and fair
competition" among vendors seeking state business. The state bought
the Oracle package without competitive bidding.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Finance would have responsibility for approving
or rejecting proposed information technology projects, and ensuring
that a fiscal analysis is done. The state did no fiscal analysis of
the Oracle deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of General Services also would be involved in
procurement, as it is now. But a few departments would retain
authority to bypass the Department of General Services and buy their
own systems. All departments would create their own "strategic plan
and vision" for computer systems, and "department-specific ethical
standards" for state workers who oversee procurement.</TE>

<HD>Church's Defense Called Valid--to a Point</HD>
<DH>Priests: Experts agree the idea of rehabilitation once held
sway, but fault transfers of molesters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In defending themselves against the sex abuse scandal, leaders of the
Roman Catholic Church often point fingers of blame at the quality of
mental-health advice they have received about reinstating errant
priests.</LD>
<LD>   In previous decades, when many of the incidents now in the news
occurred, psychiatry and psychology had markedly more optimistic
notions about how to handle sex offenders, church leaders say. That,
they maintain, sometimes led the church to believe that priests who
had sexually abused children were unlikely to re-offend.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, meeting with a group of Times reporters
and editors Tuesday, repeatedly said it was unfair to impose today's
standards of judgment on bishops who had kept priests in the ministry
on the basis of psychological advice of a different era.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone is taking the matrix of 2002 knowledge and placing that
matrix on what happened some time 15, 20, 30 years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leading experts in the area of sexual abuse say there is some
truth in this line of defense--but only some.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, they say, it is inaccurate to suggest, as Mahony
has on occasion, that there has been a radical change in expectations
from therapy as recently as the late 1980s or early '90s. The primary
sea change in the way psychologists and psychiatrists viewed
sex-abuse treatment began in the mid-1970s, when the notion of an
easy cure started to melt away.</TE>
<TE>   These specialists say blame also falls on church officials, who
sometimes failed to provide sufficient information about priests
referred for treatment, and in other cases ignored the advice of
medical professionals or interpreted it too optimistically.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that both professionals and clergy operated with
inadequate knowledge about treatment, especially in the 1960s and
early 1970s, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, optimism about cures was greater, psychological damage
done to abused children was underappreciated and the therapies in
vogue for treating perpetrators were fundamentally flawed. Many of
the cases that have recently come to light occurred in the 1970s or
'80s, but some go back as far as the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Psychology experts fault practitioners even more recently for
meting out unrealistic or vague advice to church officials, taking on
cases that were outside their area of expertise or insufficiently
investigating the true extent of their clients' problems.</TE>
<TE>   These experts also blame society for failing to take a pragmatic
approach toward the unsavory problem of child sexual abuse. The
government, they say, inadequately funds research into the roots of
sexual abuse and ways to better treat perpetrators. Trained
practitioners are lacking, as are teaching hospitals where therapists
can gain expertise in this highly specialized area, they say.</TE>
<TE>   'Polarized Thinking'</TE>
<TE>   There are also few effective, communitywide treatment and
prevention programs that coordinate with the criminal justice system
so that those serving prison time also get treated.</TE>
<TE>   Progress is sabotaged by "this polarized thinking--that you're
either for the victim or for the offender," said Dr. Fred Berlin,
associate professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine in Baltimore and founder of the Johns Hopkins Sexual
Disorders Clinic. "In reality, they're opposite sides of the same
coin."</TE>
<TE>   The experts stress that such deficiencies cannot justify the
repeated reassignment of abusive priests to ministries that put them
in contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   They refer to cases such as that of former Boston priest John J.
Geoghan, the convicted child molester whom more than 130 people
accuse of abusing them while he worked in the archdiocese of Cardinal
Bernard Law, or of Father Michael Stephen Baker in the Archdiocese of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony transferred Baker to several parishes after the priest told
Mahony in 1986 that Baker had molested young boys. The cardinal later
approved a secret $1.3-million settlement with two men allegedly
abused by Baker in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sipe, a former priest living in La Jolla and a retired
psychotherapist who has worked with hundreds of priests and victims,
said the shortcomings in the mental health profession pale in
comparison with the church's culture of secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   "When did the bishops discover that sexual abuse of minors was
illegal? Was that something that was hidden from them for the last 30
years?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are examples that make mental health professionals
wince. Gary Schoener, a Minneapolis psychologist and an expert on
sexual abuse by priests and other professionals, recalls that, in the
late 1980s, he was asked by the then-archbishop of St. Paul and
Minneapolis to review 15 years of case assessments involving priests
who had sexually abused children or adult parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   The priests, he said, had been sent for assessment or treatment to
various places, including facilities specializing in treating clergy
with behavioral problems. They returned, were reassigned--then abused
again.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop "said, 'It's obvious we've been told some of these
guys can go back, and it was bad advice,' " Schoener said. "He wanted
to know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the cases, Schoener said, he uncovered patterns of
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the psychiatrists, though highly qualified, simply
didn't have enough expertise in this area. "They might be good at
depression, they might know a lot about priests, but the sexuality
area was not their bag," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even specialized centers would sometimes fail to secure enough
details about their cases, relying on what the sexual offender or the
church told them. Offenders are often less than candid. So, at times,
was the church.</TE>
<TE>   This is important, specialists say, because without full details,
such as the number of victims, it's hard to assess the offender, his
risk for re-offending and the best treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Unrealistic Advice</TE>
<TE>   Reports to the church in the St. Paul-Minneapolis cases also
recommended measures that Schoener views as unrealistic, such as
close supervision or follow-up therapy that wasn't available locally
because of a dearth of specialists trained in treating sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "They would almost never say to put the guy out of the church," he
said. The church, in turn, tended not to query the priests further,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated telephone calls to the St. Luke Institute, a Catholic
psychiatric hospital in Silver Spring, Md., that treats priests who
have sexually abused children, were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Living, a center in Hartford, Conn., that also
specializes in such treatments, will not comment on the current
crisis, a spokesman said. But in an interview with the Hartford
Courant, officials there denied church accusations that the institute
had provided misleading advice.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Harold I. Schwartz, the institute's chief of psychiatry, told
the Courant that the church had withheld details about the priests it
referred and had "misconstrued" institute advice.</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts said they do not see huge treatment differences
between centers that specialize in treating priests and those that do
not. However, ex-priest Sipe said that, in the past, Catholic centers
were more likely to approach sexual offenses as spiritual
transgressions. They were less inclined to focus on sexual
problems--priests, after all, are not supposed to have sex--but would
tackle other issues, like drinking, drugs or depression, and hope
that curbing these would in turn curb the sexual offenses. Schoener
said some therapists' judgment in Catholic treatment centers had been
clouded by sympathy toward their patients.</TE>
<TE>   Might Be Treatable</TE>
<TE>   In the first part of the 20th century, behavioral problems such as
pedophilia and alcoholism were blamed on moral weakness. After World
War II, there was a growing realization that such disorders might be
treatable mental disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a period stretching into the 1970s--the heyday of
so-called "psychodynamic" and "psychoanalytic" therapies. The belief
was that many mental disorders, including pedophilia, were rooted in
childhood and that, once the roots were unearthed, the problem could
be solved. These were times of awful advice, said Philip Jenkins,
professor of history and religious studies at Pennsylvania State
University and the author of several books, including "Moral Panic:
Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins says he has read statements from psychologists and sex
experts spanning what he dubs the "liberal era" that "make you want
to tear your hair out" because of the way they exaggerated the effect
of therapy, downplayed the harm that sexual abuse can do and blamed
the victim.</TE>
<TE>   What research there is suggests that treatments in that era did
not work well. Yet psychologists and psychiatrists were optimistic.
Berlin said he has seen documents from the 1960s in which--after
therapy--the church was reassured that a priest had been cured.</TE>
<TE>   "And, of course, if you're 'cured,' that means you're safe,"
Berlin said.</TE>
<TE>   As the years passed, concern about child sexual abuse increased
and the mental health profession underwent a gradual but profound
change: It came to realize that simply talking about one's childhood
was no cure for serious behaviors such as alcoholism, drug abuse and
sex offending.</TE>
<TE>   Thus--though problems do persist--church statements about being
misled wear thinner the later in time that abuses came to light.</TE>
<TE>   Specialists now know that people who sexually abuse children are a
mixed bag--some bona fide pedophiles drawn to prepubescent children,
others drawn to adolescents, some with more general proclivities.</TE>
<TE>   Some offenders are especially hard to treat because they lack
consciences and empathy for their victims. And experts now believe
that, although some offenders may develop patterns of abusing
children because they themselves were abused, others--because of
heredity or brain damage--may be biologically wired to find
youngsters attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Studies suggest that modern treatments have effects. Modeled on
risk management for alcoholism, they include various therapies and
groups aimed at altering behavior and self-serving thinking and
increasing empathy for victims. They also include emergency plans,
should a perpetrator be tempted to backslide. Drugs to quash libido
and impulsiveness are also sometimes used.</TE>
<TE>   Close supervision--even electronic monitoring and lie detector
tests--can be used to help keep an offender straight.</TE>
<TE>   And it has been clear for many years--long before this year's
eruption of scandal in the church--that offenders should not be kept
in jobs that give them easy access to children.</TE>
<TE>   "An alcoholic," said Berlin, "should not be working in a bar."</TE>

<HD>Jury Told Virk Refused to Seek Divorce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Narinder Virk complained constantly about her tortured marriage but
refused to seek a divorce because of fear and the rigid values of her
culture, witnesses testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "She was afraid he would be angry at her," said Harveen Simpkins,
referring to Virk's allegedly abusive ex-husband. "She was afraid of
him."</LD>
<LD>   Virk, 42, is charged with two counts of attempted murder for
allegedly trying to drown her two children.</LD>
<TE>   She was arrested in January 2000 after an Oxnard resident pulled
the fully clothed woman, her 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son
out of Channel Islands Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Virk, motivated by revenge and a desire to
punish her husband, tried to kill the children by pushing them off a
boat dock and holding them underwater.</TE>
<TE>   But the defense has said that Virk, who has pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity, suffered a breakdown after her husband boarded a
plane for India and left the family penniless.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have since divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Simpkins testified she met Narinder Virk in 1992 after moving to
Port Hueneme. She told jurors that during their six-year friendship
she saw Santokh Virk verbally abuse his wife and demean her in front
of their children.</TE>
<TE>   "He was kind of rude and crude to her," Simpkins testified. She
told jurors she never saw injuries or signs of physical abuse.</TE>
<TE>   An Indian immigrant, Virk barely speaks English and cannot read or
write her native tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Simpkins, originally from India, testified that in the mid-1990s
she was the defendant's only friend who spoke Punjabi, and over time
the relationship became tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   Isolated and lonely, Narinder Virk complained constantly about her
spouse, Simpkins said. In 1998, the phone calls from Virk became so
frequent that Simpkins, a law student at the time and now a Ventura
attorney, had a call-blocking device put on her phone.</TE>
<TE>   "She was acting crazy, and driving me crazy," she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Simpkins told jurors she became frustrated and urged Virk to get a
divorce. Simpkins said she even volunteered to drive Virk to the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't want to go," Simpkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she said, Virk became despondent and even suicidal,
telling her friend, "The next time he takes the children and leaves,
I'm going to go to the beach and keep walking."</TE>
<TE>   Virk listened to the proceedings with the assistance of a Punjabi
interpreter Wednesday, and cried throughout much of her former
friend's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor, Elisa Quesada, also testified she had suggested Virk
divorce her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "How did she react?" prosecutor Richard Simon asked.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't want to," Quesada replied. "She said that people in
India look very poorly on divorced women."</TE>
<TE>   A UC Irvine professor testified Wednesday that in the region of
India where Virk grew up, women are generally regarded as subservient
to their spouses. Inderpal Grewal, an expert on immigrant women from
India, said arranged marriages are common in the province of Punjab.
Divorced women typically have no rights to property, she said, and
are often left impoverished.</TE>

<LD>Verizon Wireless is donating 45 cellular phones to the county for use

<LD>   The phones are programmed to speed-dial 911 as well as the

<HD>Reconsideration of Chancellor's Pact Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Colleges: A trustee says he hastily voted to renew the
contract for Philip Westin, who is under fire over spending habits
and management style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to public outrage, Ventura Community College District
trustee Art Hernandez wants the board to reconsider a newly approved
four-year contract for embattled Chancellor Philip Westin, who has
come under fire over accusations of excessive spending.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez said Wednesday he was under pressure and acted hastily
when he voted to renew Westin's contract in May despite concerns over
the chancellor's spending habits and management style.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to revisit the contract--that's what the people want,"
Hernandez said. "I just want to show some leadership.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll take responsibility for my vote," he said. "But we could
have waited. I don't want to come off like I was misled. I have
enough experience to know when to slow things down. But I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has sent board President Norman Nagel a letter
requesting a closed-session meeting with other trustees to discuss
the matter. Nagel and trustee Allan Jacobs could not be reached for
comment. Trustee Bob Gonzales has said he would be willing to meet at
Hernandez's request.</TE>
<TE>   Westin declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was on the prevailing side of a 4-1 board vote to extend
Westin's contract and award him a 16% raise, bringing his salary to
$203,000. The vote came two months after Hernandez and his colleagues
learned about Westin's spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo attorneys David Bender and David Wood provided trustees
with receipts and other public records showing that during a
four-year period the chancellor charged taxpayers more than $119,000
to cover business expenses, which included meals, travel, computer
software and car maintenance. The report has since been made public.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer advocates, teachers' union members and the public have
responded by calling for Westin's resignation. More than 100 people
jammed last month's board meeting with picket signs, demanding the
chancellor and trustees step down.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has apologized for some of his expenses and has vowed
to change things, Westin has said what he did "was not a hanging
offense" and that he has no intention of resigning. He also has
accused Bender and Wood of conducting an unauthorized audit in a bid
to oust him to gain control of the district's lucrative contract.</TE>
<TE>   The board, however, contends it did not authorize the audit and
has refused to pay a $61,000 bill submitted by Bender and Wood for
their investigative work.</TE>
<TE>   The four trustees who voted to renew Westin's contract have vowed
to impose stricter oversight of the chancellor and other
administrators but so far have stood by him. Hernandez is the first
trustee to ask the board to reconsider its decision.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Hernandez's critics say he is only acting now to save his
political career. Hernandez is one of three trustees facing
reelection in November and has also been suggested by some Oxnard
leaders as a potential challenger to county Supervisor John Flynn in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Hernandez is a day late and a dollar short," said Flynn, who
was among those critical of Westin and trustees at the board meeting
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he plans to seek reelection as a trustee but said
he has no plans to run for supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially demanded Westin's resignation after Wood and
Bender approached them with Westin's expense records and suggested he
may have broken the law. The trustees changed their minds after an
independent audit found Westin's purchases did not involve criminal
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Wood and Bender have declined repeated requests for interviews,
only to say they did nothing improper.</TE>
<TE>   Several board members defended their decision to renew Westin's
contract and to award him a $30,000 raise. They said the raise put
Westin in line with other chancellors of similar-sized college
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees also worried that financing for a recent voter-approved
$356-million bond measure, earmarked for improvements at the
district's three campuses, might be jeopardized if Westin quit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, trustee John Tallman, the sole board member to oppose
Westin's new contract, applauded Hernandez's call for revisiting the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, we really haven't gone in the direction the public wants
us to go," Tallman said. "This will give us a chance."</TE>

<HD>Noel Young, 79; Founded Independent Capra Press</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noel Young, the founder of Santa Barbara-based Capra Press--a small,
independent publishing house best known for publishing short works by
famous authors such as Henry Miller and Anais Nin, as well as
publishing the first book of fiction by short story master Raymond
Carver--has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Young died from complications of Alzheimer's disease May 31 at his
home in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Young was a commercial printer who had been designing and printing
books for Black Sparrow Press and other independent presses when he
launched his own company in 1969 by publishing "Journey," a slim
volume of poetry by his friend Gordon Grant.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next three decades, Capra Press published about 300
fiction and nonfiction books by both well-known and unknown writers.</TE>
<TE>   "He is, in my opinion, the most influential small publisher for
avant-garde writers on the West Coast," said Robert Bason, a Santa
Barbara antiquarian bookseller, who purchased Capra Press last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a book collector as well, and I had a nearly complete
collection of all the books of Capra Press, both signed and unsigned,
and that's what made me love them so much," said Bason, who describes
Young's early, hand-press printed books as "exquisite little pieces
of art."</TE>
<TE>   Young began by publishing shorter works of well-known authors and
later took risks by publishing the works of unknown writers.</TE>
<TE>   He once described his initial concept of publishing this way:
"Approach writers you admired, acquire book rights to their shorter
and offbeat works and turn them into books."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote to his old friend Henry Miller, who sent him three essays
that became "On Turning Eighty," the first in a series of 41
chapbooks--small-format books ranging from 60 to 100 pages--written
by different authors and published by Capra Press in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Young also turned to a fellow Santa Barbara resident, Kenneth
Millar--better known as mystery writer Ross Macdonald--who provided
Young with a couple of essays that had appeared in magazines years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Macdonald's "On Crime Writing" became one of Capra Press'
best-known books and has been reprinted many times.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bradbury's two-essay "Zen &amp; The Art of Writing" also became a
best-selling Capra Press chapbook.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other titles in the series are Lawrence Durrell's short
story of a wild herb gatherer in France, "The Plant-Magic Man," and
Nin's short story "Paris Revisited."</TE>
<TE>   The chapbook series concluded in 1977 with the publication of an
essay by Miller, "Mother, China and the World Beyond."</TE>
<TE>   Young's friendship with Miller, which began in 1959 when he showed
up at the author's home in Big Sur, also resulted in the publication
of a handful of other Miller works, including the books "Henry
Miller's Book of Friends," "Sextet" and "My Bike and Other Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Capra Press also published about half a dozen works by Lawrence
Clark Powell, the legendary UCLA librarian--mostly essays, but also a
collection of short stories titled "Evening Redness."</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, Young published Raymond Carver's first short story in
book format, "Put Yourself in My Shoes." He later published a book of
Carver's poetry, "At Night the Salmon Move," and "Fires," a
combination of essays, poems and stories.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Young published a series of so-called "back-to-back
books," each of which featured work by a well-known writer and an
unknown writer: The work of one author would be read with the book
held one way. Flipping the book over would bring the work of the
other author to the front, and the two sets of text would meet in the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   About half of Capra Press' books were nonfiction titles such as
"How to Protect Your Heart from Your Doctor," "Yoga for the Young at
Heart" and "Back Pain Relief."</TE>
<TE>   "Noel had this great interest in doing things that he thought were
going to influence people's lives and that represented sociological
trends that were going on," Bason said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the book that launched the company financially was the
best-selling "Hot Tubs: How to Build and Install and Enjoy Your Own,"
published in 1973 and written by Young under the pseudonym Leon
Elder.</TE>
<TE>   "That book earned more than all our literary books put together,"
Young told The Times in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   It also enabled him to publish the kinds of books he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly was a long step up from a lot of the small private
presses that existed at that time and still exist," said John Martin,
founder of Black Sparrow Press in Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, he did publish Henry Miller extensively and Raymond
Carver."</TE>
<TE>   Young was born in San Francisco on Christmas Day, 1922. The son of
a photographer, he studied journalism at Stanford University. After
World War II started, he shipped out to the Philippines as a war
correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   After the war ended, Young, his first wife, Margaret, and their
daughter Hilary were driving through Santa Barbara when their car ran
into a ditch. A motorist stopped to help and offered his guest house
while the family's car was being repaired</TE>
<TE>   Young remained in Santa Barbara and in 1949 began his printing
business.</TE>
<TE>   The twice-married Young is survived by his companion Lisa Cabryl;
three daughters, Hilary Brodey of San Francisco, Caitilin Babb of
Healdsburg, Calif., and Molly Young of Portland; a son, Aaron Young
of Santa Barbara; four grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.</TE>

<HD>Bush Filing Given a New Explanation</HD>
<DH>Finances: The 1990 sale of stock was reported late. The
White House now blames a mix-up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As President Bush prepares for a major speech on corporate
responsibility, the White House offered a new explanation Wednesday
of why he did not report in a timely manner his 1990 sale of nearly
$850,000 worth of stock in a Texas-based energy company weeks before
its value plummeted.</LD>
<LD>   Then a West Texas oilman, Bush was eight months late in filing a
sales report with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of
''a mix-up with the attorneys'' for the energy company, White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, in years past, has said that he had filed the required
paperwork and suggested that the SEC had lost it.</LD>
<TE>   The revised explanation comes as Bush readies the speech he plans
Tuesday on business ethics, an address prompted by the rash of
high-profile corporate scandals. Wednesday's developments are bound
to raise questions about Bush's own actions as a businessman, and
perhaps detract from his effort to respond to the corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Fleischer emphasized that Bush, as required by
law, had filed with the SEC a notice of intent to sell on the day
that he sold his 212,140 shares of stock in the Harken Energy Corp.
in June 1990 at $4 a share. At issue is the filing of a second form,
which is required after such a sale.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing what he termed the ''mix-up'' in the filing of the
second form, Fleischer argued that the Harken attorneys bore
responsibility for it.</TE>
<TE>   But several former SEC officials said it was Bush's
responsibility, not the company's, to make sure the stock sale report
was filed on time. Even so, they said they regarded the infraction as
relatively insignificant and the White House's revised version of
events as believable.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the current focus on the tardy filing of the second
form is misleading because ''it makes it look like he was trying to
hide something.'' Bush's filing of the first form shows that he was
not, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 1990, Harken's stock had dropped to close to $1 a
share after its revelation that August of a $23-million loss. Bush, a
member of the Harken board of directors at the time, denied any
advance knowledge or inside information of the company's financial
problems before his stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC investigated the Bush transaction in 1991 and cleared him
of any wrongdoing. According to documents released by the White House
on Wednesday, the agency concluded: ''It appears that Bush did not
engage in illegal insider trading.''</TE>
<TE>   The SEC probe drew attention when it occurred because Bush's
father was president at the time. It gained additional press
attention in Texas during Bush's first gubernatorial run in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The Harken transaction is coming under fresh scrutiny because of
the burgeoning corporate scandals involving insider trading and
fraudulent accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Bush in March proposed a 10-point ''corporate responsibility''
plan that would, among other things, require corporate officers to
disclose sales of company stock within two days. In his Tuesday
speech, which he plans to deliver on Wall Street, Bush may propose
new or tougher criminal, as well as civil, penalties for business
executives guilty of misleading or defrauding stockholders, employees
and the public.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer on Wednesday suggested that Bush's sale of Harken stock
is an old story now being fanned by the president's political
detractors.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is one of the most widely reported stories of the '90s,''
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself was asked about the stock sale on Tuesday while
visiting a church in Milwaukee. Clearly annoyed, he snapped:</TE>
<TE>   ''Everything I do is fully disclosed. It's been fully vetted. Any
other questions?''</TE>
<TE>   The president's testiness and Fleischer's comments were the latest
signs of how seriously the White House is taking the potential
political fallout from the spate of corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The issue also is energizing Democrats, who have been struggling
for campaign issues against a popular wartime president. And they
wasted no time on Wednesday jumping into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   ''President Bush, Vice President [Dick] Cheney, and SEC
Commissioner Harvey Pitt like to preach CEO responsibility,'' said
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''But
when it comes to their own records, their motto is, 'The buck stops
over there,' '' he added, referring to Fleischer's explanation about
a lawyers' mix-up.</TE>
<TE>   ''The reality is that Bush and his administration have given the
green light to unscrupulous CEOs by helping to foster a business
environment that says, 'If it feels good, do it' and when confronted
with the crisis they offer toothless reforms,'' McAuliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg doubted that
the Harken stock sale will mushroom into a greater
controversy--barring fresh disclosures about the case.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man who had earned a master's degree in business
administration at Harvard University, Bush went to West Texas, like
his father earlier, to seek his fortune in the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   But after some ups and downs, and amid a collapse of the world oil
markets in the mid-1980s, Bush merged two of his companies, Arbusto
and Bush Exploration, to form Spectrum 7 Energy Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Harken bought Spectrum 7, giving Bush hundreds of shares
of stock and up to $120,000 annually in consulting fees. But Harken
also did not weather the oil bust well.</TE>
<TE>   On June 22, 1990, Bush sold 212,140 shares of his Harken holdings
for $848,560--about two months before Harken disclosed mounting debt
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC later said he was required to report the sale by July 10,
1990--but did not do so until March 4, 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The agency launched a probe that same April after the Wall Street
Journal reported that Bush had failed to file with the SEC a
so-called Form 4, reporting the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Wednesday White House officials reexamined the case
after a New York Times Op-ed piece by Paul Krugman on Tuesday that
criticized Bush's actions in the stock sale--and suggested they may
not be so different from allegations of insider trading now dogging
Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   In his daily press briefing, Fleischer took pains to differentiate
between SEC Form 144, the notice of intent to sell, and SEC Form 4,
the post-sale report.</TE>
<TE>   ''The president thought it [Form 4] had been filed at the time,
and indicated so publicly,'' Fleischer said. ''What happened as a
result was, it was a mix-up with the [Harken] attorneys dealing with
the Form 4, and it was filed later. But it was, indeed, filed.''</TE>
<TE>   White House communications director Dan Bartlett compared the
eight-month delay to driving 60 mph in a 55 mph zone. ''These types
of late filings are not out of the ordinary,'' he told the Washington
Post on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   ''From everything we're able to glean, that's absolutely right,''
Fleischer said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He also asserted that Form 4 is ''required to be filed by
corporations, and so it was corporate attorneys'' who were at fault.</TE>
<TE>   ''The key issue is the public notification,'' Fleischer said.
''The president believes very much that corporate officers should
disclose their sales, which is what the president did.''</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Well-Armed in Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Washburn and Percival team up on a four-hitter,
and Erstad's throw is key to 1-0 win over Orioles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a group of reporters surrounded Jarrod Washburn, Kevin Appier
leaned toward the circle and needled his teammate.</LD>
<LD>   "If you didn't have so many losses," Appier said, "you might be
going to the All-Star Game."</LD>
<LD>   Appier grinned, and Washburn laughed. Washburn hasn't lost in 2
1/2 months.</LD>
<TE>   Washburn and Troy Percival teamed on a four-hit shutout Wednesday,
with Washburn extending his win streak to nine games in a 1-0 victory
over the Baltimore Orioles before 17,477 at Edison Field. Center
fielder Darin Erstad preserved the shutout with a marvelous defensive
play in the fifth inning, then drove in the winning run in the eighth
inning, ending the Angels' scoreless streak at 22 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (9-2) has the longest current win streak in the major
leagues and the best winning percentage of any American League
starting pitcher not named Pedro Martinez. He has not lost since
April 13, and his earned-run average of 3.21 ranks among the league's
top 10.</TE>
<TE>   When the AL All-Star team was announced Sunday, the Angels were
disappointed that outfielder Garret Anderson was their lone
selection.</TE>
<TE>   When Martinez turned down his invitation, the Angels were unhappy
that New York Yankee Manager Joe Torre replaced Martinez with the
seventh Boston player so honored, closer Ugueth Urbina. The Yankees
have six players on the team. Washburn was bypassed again.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised he didn't make it," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the only guy in here that was deserving that didn't get
picked," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was right that we only got one guy picked, with
as well as we've played and as many guys as we have doing well....
Hopefully, we'll keep winning and next year [Angel Manager Mike]
Scioscia gets to pick 'em."</TE>
<TE>   For the first seven innings, Washburn matched zeroes with
Baltimore's Scott Erickson, an Angel nemesis for all these years.
Erickson lost for just the second time in 10 starts in Anaheim,
though he deserved better. He pitched a complete game and gave up
four hits, all singles.</TE>
<TE>   Bengie Molina singled to start the eighth inning, and Jose Nieves
ran for him. Nieves took second on a sacrifice bunt and third on a
ground out.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad then took what will not be remembered as one of the finest
swings of his career, poking a dribbler down the third-base line.
Baltimore third baseman Tony Batista charged and backhanded the ball.
But, as Batista tried to make an off-balance throw, the ball slipped
out of his hand, and he ended up spiking the ball. Erstad reached
first on the infield single, with Nieves scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just in scratch-and-claw mode," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   And, for all of Washburn's heroics, Erstad was the man who
preserved the shutout in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With one out, the Orioles had Marty Cordova at third base and Jose
Leon at second.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bordick flied to center field, definitely deep enough to
allow Cordova to score from third. So Erstad ignored Cordova,
realizing that he had a chance to throw Leon out at third.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus did his best to fake out Leon, pretending
there would be no play there.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad approached the ball from behind, got a running start, made
the catch and threw a strike to Glaus, who tagged out Leon to
complete the double play.</TE>
<TE>   Next thing you knew, Molina, the Angel catcher, was jumping for
joy at home plate. Cordova tagged from third base, but a sore right
foot prevented him from running at full speed toward home. And so the
run did not count, because umpires ruled that the Angels had
completed the double play before Cordova had touched home plate.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn never did give up a run, scattering three hits over eight
innings and making 101 pitches before giving the ball to Percival for
the ninth. Percival got the save, and Washburn will await another
chance for his first major league shutout.</TE>

<LD>Betsylew Ross Miale-Gix, 43, a world-class boomerang thrower, was
arrested Sunday after arguing with a security screener at Bradley
International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   She became irate after the screener had noticed the boomerangs
inside her carry-on luggage and told her the items would have to be
checked.</LD>
<LD>   "A girl walked by us on the plane with two tennis rackets,"
Miale-Gix said. "A tennis racket is much more dangerous on that plane
than any of our boomerangs can ever be."</LD>
<TE>   You might say, her carry-on attempt boomeranged on her.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first player to earn $100,000 or more in
a year on the PGA Tour?</TE>
<TE>   Dreaded news: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune on Tiger
Woods' withdrawal from the Western Open: "Tiger Woods isn't coming.
Those are the four chilliest words in the English language for a
tournament director....</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger pulling out two days before the first round of the
tournament is cold, but this is a cold, cold business. Woods has
'flu-like symptoms,' the sort of catch-all description that could
mean anything from a stuffed-up nose to an inadvertent burp."</TE>
<TE>   Geography whiz: Kansas star Drew Gooden, the top pick of the
Memphis Grizzlies, has to do his homework on the Volunteer state.</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City Star asked him if he planned to visit Graceland.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know Elvis was from Memphis," he said. "I thought
he was from Tennessee."</TE>
<TE>   Where's the windmill? Greg Cote in the Miami Herald on Ted
Williams' son, John Henry, trying to make it in the minor leagues at
age 33: "The man with the name but not the game is a diamond Don
Quixote, Walter Mitty with a mitt."</TE>
<TE>   Come again? During the Senior Open on Saturday, NBC host Don Hicks
reported that after driving the ball out of bounds, Isao Aoki
"accepted double bogey."</TE>
<TE>   Said Phil Mushnick of the New York Post, "Accepted double bogey?
That's crazy talk. What was there, an awards ceremony?"</TE>
<TE>   Durable record: Wednesday marked the 36th anniversary of arguably
the greatest hitting performance by a pitcher, two grand slams by the
Atlanta Braves' Tony Cloninger in a game against the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Cloninger, now pitching coach for the Red Sox, is the only pitcher
to have hit two slams in a game. He had nine runs batted in that day,
another record for a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Don't rush us: Nick Canepa in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "See

<HD>Carew Calls for Steroid Testing</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Hall of Famer says too many players want to take
shortcuts, although he doesn't name names.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rod Carew, a Hall of Fame player and 10-year major league batting
instructor, said baseball should test for steroids because "if you
want the fans to respect what's left of the game's pureness, you're
going to have to start testing."</LD>
<LD>   "It's unfortunate that players have to use steroids to produce big
numbers," Carew said by telephone from his South Bay home, during an
interview this week about an upcoming Angel promotion. "They don't
have to do that.... But too many players today want to take
shortcuts."</LD>
<LD>   The topic of steroids is taboo with some current players and many
former hitting stars, but Carew didn't balk when asked about
allegations made recently by Jose Canseco and Ken Caminiti, former
league most valuable players, that steroid use in baseball was
widespread.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to understand that cheating in baseball has been a big
part of the game," Carew said. "It's unfortunate, but it always will
be."</TE>
<TE>   The reason cheating has gone well beyond corking bats, scuffing
balls, stealing signs and tipping pitches is simple, Carew said:
"With the kind of money out there, guys are going to do anything to
make millions.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to be left behind, especially when steroids will give an
average player with no power an opportunity to easily hit 25-30 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "As for the superstar, well, they will hit 50 to 70."</TE>
<TE>   Carew, who played 19 years in the majors and was with the Angels
from 1979 until his retirement in 1985, said he began to suspect
steroid use in the early 1990s, when he was a batting instructor with
the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   He said he couldn't fathom how players he'd seen weighing 175
pounds during spring training could have bulked up 25 to 35 pounds in
three months and were hitting towering home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to get that big and muscular in such a short
period of time without using some type of enhancement drug," Carew
said. "But after just seeing a couple of guys, I started seeing more
and more guys looking like bodybuilders and not baseball players."</TE>
<TE>   Carew was the batting instructor for the Angels from 1992 through
'99, then spent the 2000 and 2001 seasons in the same capacity with
the Milwaukee Brewers. He said he never knew of any Angels or Brewers
using steroids while he was coaching with those teams. He also said
he didn't know of any players who used steroids during his playing
time in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Carew, a .328 hitter, was a lanky 6-footer weighing 180 pounds for
most of his career with the Minnesota Twins and Angels. He hit only
92 home runs, getting many of his 3,053 hits on bunts, choppers and
line drives.</TE>
<TE>   "Just my forearms were big because I wanted to be able to fight
off pitches inside and hit them for hits," said Carew, who won seven
American League batting titles. "But during my days with the Angels,
we had guys like Reggie Jackson and Brian Downing who were somewhat
big, but they did it the right way and didn't take steroids. They put
in long hours in the gym to build up strength and I respect that."</TE>
<TE>   Carew said he knows many players who would agree with his call for
testing, but, he added, "It's unlikely to happen because of how
strong the players' [union] is right now."</TE>
<TE>   As for that upcoming promotion, bobble-head dolls in Carew's
likeness will be given away at Edison Field before Saturday's game
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Such dolls are all the rage in baseball giveaways nowadays, and
Carew is happy that at least that part of the game remains pure.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know they aren't taking any steroids," he said of the
dolls.</TE>

finally getting the recognition he believes he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Among those interviewed in this excellent profile of him are
Lewis, his mother Violet, his half brother Dennis, his surrogate
father and former trainer Arnie Boehm and current trainer Emanuel
Steward.</TE>
<TE>   Violet, a nurse, moved from Jamaica to London's East Side, where
Lennox and Dennis were born. Lennox, the result of an extramarital
affair, never really knew his father.</TE>
<TE>   Lennox moved with his mother to the Toronto area, where he
attended high school and starred in football and basketball. But
boxing became his true love.</TE>
<TE>   Although his mother returned to London, Lennox remained behind and
boxed for Canada in the 1984 and '88 Olympics, beating Riddick Bowe
for the gold in '88. He returned to England after turning pro.</TE>
<TE>   When Bowe refused to fight Lewis for the undisputed heavyweight
championship, the World Boxing Council stripped Bowe of his title and
awarded it to Lewis. Because his championship was not won in the
ring, the episode took some shine off the belt.</TE>
<TE>   The first time Lewis fought Evander Holyfield, at Madison Square
Garden, Lewis dominated the fight. But it was ruled a draw.
"Obviously they ripped me off," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Now with his victory over Tyson, Lewis, who in the past shied away
from media attention, is concerned with how he will be portrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely happy with my achievements," he said. "I would
love history to just speak it the way it is. I mean, I'm basically
making my own history. My problem is, will they write it down
correctly."</TE>

<HD>Gagne Gets Rattled</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Diamondbacks rally against All-Star closer in the
eighth to get 5-3 victory and salvage last game of series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers were beaten by the sound of silence Wednesday night, a
soft end-of-the-bat poke down the right-field line that reduced
closer Eric Gagne to a mere mortal and prevented the Arizona
Diamondbacks from getting swept in an important three-game series.</LD>
<LD>   Quinton McCracken was way out in front of Gagne's two-strike
changeup, but the Arizona outfielder got just enough of it to float a
well-placed, two-run triple to right to score the tying and go-ahead
runs in the eighth inning and lead the Diamondbacks to a 5-3 victory
over the Dodgers before 39,609 in Bank One Ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   It was Gagne's second blown save of the season and first since May
7. It marked the first time this season the Dodgers lost when leading
after seven innings; they were 45-0 in such games before Wednesday
night.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers knew what hit them; it was McCracken, who was hitless
in his previous 14 at-bats before reaching against Gagne. They just
didn't hear it.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit a great pitch--he hit the ball off the end of the bat,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "Did you hear the sound? It didn't
even make a noise. He could have very easily swung over it and
missed."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers shut out the Diamondbacks in the first two games of
the series and led, 3-2, Wednesday night on the strength of Shawn
Green's 26th home run of the season, a two-run shot off starter
Miguel Batista in the first inning, and pitcher Andy Ashby's RBI
single in the second.</TE>
<TE>   But Arizona second baseman Junior Spivey, whose sixth-inning
sacrifice fly pulled the Diamondbacks within 3-2, extended his
hitting streak to 17 games with a one-out single off reliever
Guillermo Mota in the eighth, and pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn drew a
walk off Jesse Orosco.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy summoned Gagne, who had a 1.27 earned-run average and 30
saves in 31 opportunities. Gagne, who stranded all 11 of his
inherited runners this season, jumped ahead of McCracken, but after
fouling off a pair of two-strike pitches, McCracken tripled to right
for a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grace capped the rally with a sacrifice fly for a 5-3 lead,
and Gagne walked David Dellucci, the right-hander's first walk since
May 4, a span of 28 innings and 99 batters. Dellucci was caught
stealing to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger second baseman Alex Cora singled off Arizona closer
Byung-Hyun Kim with two out in the ninth, but Kim got pinch-hitter
Mark Grudzielanek to fly to center for his 21st save, as the
Diamondbacks pulled to within 2 1/2 games of the first-place Dodgers
in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not upset; disappointed would be a better choice of words,"
Tracy said. "They're the defending world champions and we were an
inch and a half away from sweeping the series. You have to tip your
hat to them. We move on to St. Louis knowing we gained a game [in the
standings], and they beat our best guy. That's it."</TE>
<TE>   It's a tall order for a closer to get five outs, especially with
two runners on in the eighth, but Gagne saved five of the six games
he entered before the ninth inning in save situations and pitched
only once in the previous four days.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," Gagne said. "I didn't care how many outs I needed.
I was in a good position, and it just didn't happen. Give [McCracken]
credit. My 0-2 pitch caught too much of the plate. I should have
thrown it in the dirt. He threw his bat out there and made contact.
He did a great job with it."</TE>
<TE>   The last time Gagne blew a save, the first-year closer barely
blinked. He recorded saves in his next 20 opportunities. There was
little concern Gagne would be devastated by the events of Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Not a half hour had passed after the loss, and already Gagne was
flushing it out of his system.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm already thinking about [today]," Gagne said. "I cost us the
game, but that's part of the job."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who gave up two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings, had a
quick chat with Gagne in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is for him to realize it's going to happen," Ashby
said. "He's been dealing the whole year, and the guy blooped one in.
He'll be all right. He just has to stay positive. He's going to be
there the rest of the year."</TE>

<HD>Where's Kazmania?</HD>
<DH>Japanese haven't gotten excited over Ishii, the country's
latest export</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>When the Japan Travel Bureau offered tours to Seattle to watch
Mariner star Ichiro Suzuki, Japanese tripped over each other to get a
spot. When it offered a similar package recently built around Dodger
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, including the chance to meet him, watch him
practice and get his autograph, no one signed up. JTB canceled the
tour.</LD>
<LD>   Competing against Ichiro--on or off the field--is a difficult
proposition for almost anyone. That said, even relative to other
Japanese players, Ishii is creating very little buzz among fans in
Japan.</LD>
<LD>   One of the biggest reasons may be that so many have come before
him. Japanese fans are becoming a bit more blase nowadays as more of
their best players go abroad and do well. Ishii isn't a pioneer, or
even a second or a third.</LD>
<TE>   As Japan's first star hitter to make it in America, Ichiro has
garnered the lion's share of attention and endorsement money, given
his impressive athleticism and clear charisma. Dodger Hideo Nomo was
Japan's first star major league pitcher, and he continues to do well.
Mariner pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki was the first reliever and recently
signed a huge contract, and Giant center fielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo is a
colorful figure by most standards.</TE>
<TE>   "Ishii's not the first, and the Japanese are always interested in
something with novelty, or someone who's a real challenger," said
Jack Sakazaki, president of JSM Ltd., a sports marketing firm. "He's
also not overpowering as a pitcher. He's got a good record, but he's
been saved by his team."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor behind Japan's noticeable lack of Ishii hoopla: all
the competing events back home. World Cup fever swept Japan big time,
both because the nation co-hosted the soccer tournament with South
Korea and because its team did much better than expected, reaching
the second round before losing to Turkey. And in Japanese baseball
this year, the Hanshin Tigers are doing well for the first time in
more than a decade, another good local story.</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, even the recent news that Ichiro had gotten
his 100th hit of the season was largely lost in the roar of the
soccer crowds.</TE>
<TE>   A third reason why Ishii has failed to ignite fans' fuses is,
arguably, Ishii. Even during his decade pitching for the Yakult
Swallows, he never built a hard-core following in Japan. He is
perhaps best remembered for activities off the field, namely a
high-profile affair with celebrity Uno Kanda before he settled down
with television anchorwoman Ayako Kisa.</TE>
<TE>   Marketing experts say it's always a challenge to figure out
exactly why someone has mass appeal among the Japanese--or any
nation, for that matter--but Ishii never really had it. Some say he's
just not seen as an everyman type.</TE>
<TE>   His string of extraordinary-looking girlfriends, a certain
prankster quality and his lack of consistency on the mound contribute
to a perception that he's not as serious about baseball as he should
be, in a country where modesty, understatement, predictability and
tireless hard work reign supreme.</TE>
<TE>   "Ichiro has a typical Japanese samurai image. He doesn't talk
much, but he does his job perfectly," said Kazuo Ojima, editor in
chief of Nikkei Trendy, a top Japanese marketing magazine. "Shinjo is
very good at reaching out to fans and the media, and his aggressive
style plays well. And Nomo has heroism and a 'do-or-die' nature. But
Ishii is more of a blank. He doesn't have much real charm."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii clearly has been helped in his debut season by some timely
Dodger hitting, which has allowed him to compile an 11-4 record
despite falling behind in several games. This dovetails with his
reputation in Japan as a somewhat lucky, at times emotional player
who wins but doesn't overwhelm batters.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's move into professional baseball also involved a certain
amount of luck, to hear his father and high school coach tell it. He
joined the team as an outfielder and gained a pitching spot only
because the coach thought he had a muscular back, was relatively tall
and seemed to have good aim. "I didn't see any great potential in
him," said Mikio Motoki, the high school coach who plucked him from
obscurity. "If I hadn't discovered him, he'd probably be driving a
truck for his father's company now."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii gave up 35 runs in his first high school appearance, a
pounding that lasted four hours. The humiliation was so great that
Motoki apologized to the opposing manager for the pitiful
competition.</TE>
<TE>   But in traditional Japanese style, Ishii over the next few years
was forced into a blistering training regime, including running
several marathons over the Christmas holiday in exercises nicknamed
"death camp."</TE>
<TE>   He was forced to do the "chicken walk" on his haunches, was
punished when he gave up runs in games and was steered away from
girls.</TE>
<TE>   "If he forgot his signs, I'd hit him," Motoki said. "That was the
way we taught students in those days, although now if I did anything
physical I could lose my job. He's the one who got the most blows
from me."</TE>
<TE>   An article featuring him in a national newspaper attracted several
professional scouts, and in his final year he was picked up by the
Yakult Swallows. Manager Katsuya Nomura, who took him under his wing,
describes him as an aggressive left-hander with a very strong
physique. His problem, then as now, he added, was control. Years of
trying to get him to change his stance, vary his pitches and throw
with greater precision were largely unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Ishii put the Swallows on the map and was a major part
of their winning record during those years.</TE>
<TE>   Nomura is known for a managing style that puts a premium on a
detailed analysis of opposing teams and their players. Ishii earned a
reputation for finding it all a bit confusing. Some counter that
Ishii preferred to rely on intuition, but Nomura said he never saw
much evidence of intuition. Ishii's catcher did much of the strategic
heavy lifting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Nomura added, Ishii was aggressive and did well in
clutch situations, including a no-hitter he pitched one season during
a trip to the Japan Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know about things beyond human power, but I think
Ishii is very lucky," Nomura said. "A man with luck can definitely be
a force."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii spoke repeatedly about his dream of going to play in the
U.S., Nomura said. His family, manager and many teammates weren't
terribly supportive, but the Dodgers signed him before this season.
His 11 victories are tops on the team, but so are his 61 walks.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all against him going to the majors because the Swallows
had been so generous toward him," said his father, Takashi Ishii.
"But his will to go was very strong, and I know he's now trying very
hard."</TE>
<TE>   While Ishii hasn't exactly overwhelmed most Japanese fans, he
still could if he keeps winning, particularly if the Dodgers make it
to the playoffs and he's a key part of their success.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a leading-man, good-looks type, and he doesn't have a
lot of pizazz," said Marty Kuehnert, president of International
Sports Management &amp; Consultants. "But if you see him build to a
20-game winner, he could still become more of a phenomenon."</TE>

<LD>A judge in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday upheld a Florida law
restricting public access to autopsy photos that was being challenged
by several newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   The law was passed in March 2001 after the death of race car
driver Dale Earnhardt, who was killed in a crash in the final lap of
last year's Daytona 500.</LD>
<LD>   "The right to privacy, the right to freedom of press and speech,
the right of the people to have access to public records and the
right to be left alone are important rights to all who live in this
county," Circuit Judge Leroy Moe wrote in his order.</LD>
<TE>   "They are not absolute rights, however, and they frequently clash,
as they did in this case. The legislature has indeed applied a proper
balancing of these rights in enacting this legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Said Orlando Sentinel attorney David Bralow: "We're really quite
disappointed about the judge's ruling." The newspaper will appeal.</TE>

<LD>Kareem Rush, acquired from the Toronto Raptors by the Lakers on draft
day, has signed a contract with the three-time defending NBA
champions, two days after negotiations were able to begin.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers acquired the rights to Rush, the 20th pick in the
draft, along with forward Tracy Murray, in a deal that gave the
Raptors guard Lindsey Hunter and the rights to Chris Jefferies, the
27th pick in the draft.</LD>
<LD>   A 6-foot-6 guard, Rush made himself available for the draft after
his junior season at Missouri. He averaged 18.9 points in 84 college
games.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the NBA's labor agreement, Rush is eligible for a
guaranteed three-year contract worth $2.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   In other NBA news, the Miami Heat signed Caron Butler, the 10th

<HD>Men's Game Desperately Needs a Strong Sampras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras says his second-round Wimbledon loss was a fluke.</LD>
<LD>   The loss to George Bastl, a nice man of no distinguished tennis
accomplishments, was a sad occasion for fans of Sampras, for fans of
his elegant, complicated game, his under-appreciated class, his
record 13 Grand Slam titles.</LD>
<LD>   This loss made fans of Sampras nostalgic, but it didn't make him
nostalgic. Sampras says he'll win again. He says that the day he
doesn't believe he can contend is the day he'll quit. And he says
that day is far away.</LD>
<TE>   If only Sampras, who turns 31 next month, and Andre Agassi, 32,
could play in Sunday's Wimbledon men's final. And the final of the
U.S. Open. And the Australian Open. Even the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   If only Sampras and Agassi could reprise their 2001 U.S. Open
men's quarterfinal match, over and over, until men's tennis produced
another worthy champion. Or their 2000 Australian Open semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Lleyton Hewitt, ranked No. 1, seems more like Martina Hingis than
a new Sampras; a temporary No. 1 until a legitimate champion comes
along. Hingis was unbeatable until the Williams sisters grew up,
until Lindsay Davenport matured into a winner, until Jennifer
Capriati decided to work hard.</TE>
<TE>   But if Hewitt is the best there is, men's tennis is in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Right now the men's game is almost unwatchable. The best of the
new breed are all numbing baseliners with no variation of the "Bash
the ball as hard as possible" theme. The volley, the drop shot, the
lob, all ancient history.</TE>
<TE>   That match Pete and Andre played in New York last September was an
instant classic, replayed a day or so later on ESPN Classic as if we
wouldn't remember. Nothing has happened to make us forget.</TE>
<TE>   This Wimbledon loss was Sampras' 14th of the year, his 35th since
winning Wimbledon two years ago. That was the last time Sampras was a
tournament winner. This latest loss was discouraging to his fans
because Sampras seemed beaten from the start. His shoulders were
slumped when he came onto Court 2, as if the very thought of being
moved from his beloved Centre Court was sending a message Sampras
didn't want to acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   That message would seem to be: It's over, Pete.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who have admired Sampras for a decade, it hurts
too much to see Pete lose to Bastl, to Fernando Gonzalez, Felix
Mantilla, Max Mirnyi, Andrea Gaudenzi and Nicolas Kiefer. They've all
beaten Pete this year.</TE>
<TE>   Losing to Bastl was a fluke? Maybe it's a fluke without all those
other losses on the ledger.</TE>
<TE>   "Where that loss was, when it was, to whom, it was shocking,"
Sampras says. "It was the biggest nightmare possible. This has been a
[terrible] six months, tennis-wise, and I'm trying to get through it.
This is the toughest thing I've ever had to get through in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's my challenge. I've worked too hard to keep having the
results I've had. This is not about my forehands and backhands. It is
more mental."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras is back home in Los Angeles, unable to watch Wimbledon but
eager to talk about his future. He is sure he has one in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't lost any of his physical ability, Sampras says. Nor any
of his commitment and desire.</TE>
<TE>   That match Sampras played against Agassi in the quarterfinals of
last year's U.S. Open, that late-night match won by Sampras, 6-7 (7),
7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5), is still the standard of his tennis,
Sampras says, not what happened at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras is self-effacing and willing to make fun of himself. He
talks about watching "SportsCenter," then laughs and says, "I've had
a lot more time than I like to watch it."</TE>
<TE>   He finds it mildly amusing that after all the years of being taken
for granted, especially at his beloved Wimbledon, after all the times
of being accused of single-handedly bringing about the ruination of
grass-court tennis because he was just too good at it, now he is
being missed.</TE>
<TE>   "They wish I was back, huh?" Sampras says. "Be careful what you
wish for."</TE>
<TE>   The bravado is touching, and nearly convincing.</TE>
<TE>   "The day I feel I can't contend for a major again," he says, "the
day I can't do it, that's when I quit. But that day is far from here.
Far from it."</TE>
<TE>   Is Sampras kidding himself?</TE>
<TE>   He speaks of the depth in men's tennis as the reason there have
been seven Grand Slam tournament winners in the seven Slams since
Sampras last won Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Depth or mediocrity?</TE>
<TE>   Look at some of these winners. Goran Ivanisevic was 29 last summer
when he won Wimbledon. Thomas Johansson was two months from his 27th
birthday when he won the Australian in January. Albert Costa, winner
of this French Open, was 27. These were all first-time Slam winners.
And last-timers too. They couldn't come close to winning when Sampras
and Agassi were at their best. So they gobble up titles now in the
great void.</TE>
<TE>   Too much excellence? Or too much mediocrity and not enough
champions?</TE>
<TE>   Sampras did acknowledge having all these different, anonymous
winners is not great for the game. U.S. fans need recognizable faces
and characters.</TE>
<TE>   "We need Americans to start winning championships," Sampras
concedes. He's a sports fan as much as he is a player. If pushed,
Sampras would have to agree that right now, soccer is hotter than
men's tennis here at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we cool?" Sampras asks at the end of the conversation. We
would be cooler if Sampras was playing Agassi on Sunday. Because now,
breakfast at Wimbledon is just another meal.</TE>

<HD>Mauresmo Eases Her Way Into Semifinals</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: New relaxed attitude helps her upset Capriati.
Serena Williams also advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>When Amelie Mauresmo of France suffered a devastating first-round
loss at the French Open last year, she crumbled under the weight of
disappointment, practically dropping out of sight, submerging like a
submarine.</LD>
<LD>   It could have happened again last month after Mauresmo lost in
three sets to Paola Suarez in the fourth round of the French Open.
But Mauresmo, who turns 23 Friday, recalled last year and decided to
curb the excess.</LD>
<LD>   "I decided not to put my head under water like that," Mauresmo
said. "When I lost this year, I let it go after three days."</LD>
<TE>   For Mauresmo, Paris might as well be a world away. With minimal
pressure and lowered expectations, she was traveling lighter, hitting
freely and powerfully at Wimbledon. That and an artful game plan
combined to help the ninth-seeded Mauresmo record her biggest Grand
Slam tournament victory in more than three years as she defeated No.
3 Jennifer Capriati, 6-3, 6-2, in the quarterfinals Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In today's semifinals, she will play No. 2 Serena Williams, who
defeated No. 11 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia by an identical score.
Hantuchova, in her first Slam quarterfinal, did not play poorly. The
score was reflective of Williams' focus and intensity despite the
multiple rain delays. Even Williams was surprised she had 10 aces and
no double faults.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really easy for me. Nothing bothers me," said French Open
champion Williams, who will be in her second Wimbledon semifinal.
"I've become jaded."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hantuchova, who was 0 for 4 on break points: "She really hit
a big one when she needed it. I had a couple of break points, she
always hit like 110 [mph serve], 115 first serve. It's really hard to
do anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   The weather problems hardly bothered the fiery Williams or the
serene Mauresmo.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati never seemed to find her form, mostly because of
Mauresmo. It was the first time Capriati had failed to reach the
semifinals of a Grand Slam event since the fourth round of the 2000
U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Mauresmo mixed her slice serve with power and took the initiative
in getting to the net, refusing to let Capriati establish control
from the baseline. Her low slice approaches were up the middle,
taking away the potential angle from Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps because I have a really clear goal, maybe I ask myself
fewer questions about everything," Mauresmo said. "I just know how I
have to play. If it works, great. If not, it's not meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   The players spent more time running off the court and warming up
than playing an actual match on the rain-soaked day.</TE>
<TE>   "One more warmup and I'll be too tired to play," said Martina
Navratilova, who lost her mixed-doubles match with partner Todd
Woodbridge to Jonas Bjorkman and Anna Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   The unsettling circumstances would have appeared to favor
Capriati, who has won three Grand Slam titles and is more experienced
at this stage than Mauresmo, who has appeared in only one Slam final,
the Australian Open three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Their match started almost four hours later than scheduled and the
first service break came just before another rain delay. Serving at
2-3, Capriati appeared unnerved by the increasing rain and double
faulted on break point.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see she was getting a little [hacked] off," Mauresmo said
of Capriati. "I guess that's the way it is. I tried to stay calm, as
you say."</TE>
<TE>   Closing it out is usually more difficult for Mauresmo and the
tension went up a few levels when Capriati needed treatment from a
tour trainer for her left shoulder and neck, trailing 4-1 in the
second set. Mauresmo sat calmly in her chair during the medical
timeout and needed only three more games to reach the semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati said her neck was stiff when she got up in the morning
and the cold weather, plus the lack of a decent warmup session, made
it worse. She did not use it as an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to know that this is Wimbledon," Capriati said. "It
didn't help to be playing an opponent today that was playing the best
she's played in a long, long time. It's disappointing. It's a little
bit of bad luck. But I've got to hand it to her. I mean, she played
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Mauresmo agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "At least on this surface, I think I've never played better tennis
than today," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not so coincidentally, her best results at Grand Slams have come
away from France.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure, maybe that's what helped me go so far here
and in Australia," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, she beat then No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport in
the semifinals at the Australian Open and lost to Martina Hingis in
the final. Wednesday was the first time she had returned to a Slam
semifinal since and it has been a long journey back to this stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is experience again, gaining maturity, growing up,
learning from what I did," Mauresmo said. "Sometimes, you lose and
you don't know why. As I was saying, the French Open was a good
experience for me because it made me grow up a little bit. And I hope
it's going to last."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It took about a half-hour of actual play for Richard Krajicek's
dream of another improbable Wimbledon title to stay alive.</TE>
<TE>   His fourth-round match against Mark Philippoussis of Australia,
scheduled for Monday, never started. They split four sets Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Krajicek, of the Netherlands, prevailed after a long day
of stop-and-start tennis, winning, 6-7 (2), 7-6 (4), 6-7 (1), 7-6
(5), 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's fifth set essentially came down to one point as
Philippoussis double-faulted on break point in the first game.</TE>
<TE>   Philippoussis had 27 aces and 12 double faults, while Krajicek had
24 aces and 10 double faults. Krajicek began Wimbledon having played
only one match in the last 20 months because of injuries. Today, he
will play Xavier Malisse of Belgium in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the third round was maximum," said Krajicek, the 1996
Wimbledon champion. "Yeah, it's unbelievable. I never would have
expected this. I booked my holiday house for today. My wife is
already on the holiday house. That just shows the trust I had in my
ability to reach the second week."</TE>

<HD>Villagers Describe a Night of Terror</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Guests say they were dancing and singing when
a U.S. aircraft attacked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KAKARAK, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Villagers who survived a raid Monday by U.S. aircraft said a plane
suddenly blasted away at them as they were celebrating an upcoming
wedding in the predawn coolness, dancing and singing in a pool of
light from a tractor's headlights.</LD>
<LD>   The villagers in this narrow valley told Wednesday of running for
their lives through fields as a U.S. aircraft appeared to chase them,
firing bullets. Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah said 44 people were
killed and 120 wounded in Monday's raid on half a dozen villages in
Oruzgan province.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon said it has confirmed that 21 people were wounded,
including 17 Afghans being treated at a hospital in Kandahar and four
others at the U.S. airbase in Bagram.</LD>
<TE>   Maj. Gary Tallman, a spokesman with a joint U.S.-Afghan
investigating commission, said an antiaircraft artillery piece was
firing on the U.S. plane from the walled compound where the party was
held.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman said U.S. aircraft had flown over the area hourly for two
days before Monday's attack, and each time the antiaircraft gun
opened fire. But Tallman acknowledged Wednesday that investigators
had found no wreckage of the gun. Villagers said 25 of the dead were
attending the party at the home of Mohammed Sherif, brother of one of
President Hamid Karzai's close allies, to celebrate the marriage of
Sherif's son, Abdul Malik, which was to have occurred this week. By
tradition, neither Malik nor his fiancee was present. Sherif was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   At the front door of Sherif's compound, 40 pairs of shoes sat
awaiting their owners. Nearby was a pile of women's clothing. A small
boy stood weeping in front of it.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is burning with anger," said Abdul Malik. "The Americans
should be put on trial."</TE>
<TE>   Coalition forces found an arms cache 10 miles away containing 15
tons of munitions, including antiaircraft weapons, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' Washington Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Land Dispute Is Blamed for Mexico Deaths</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Officials said Wednesday that a dispute over land was behind the
shooting deaths of five people--including a 101-year-old man--on a
mountain road in western Mexico over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Nayarit state Atty. Gen. Jorge Armando Banuelos Ahumada said
investigators had ruled out political or drug-related motives in the
Sunday shootings. "These events were caused by deeply rooted
hostility between families," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Gunmen with automatic weapons waited along a road and opened fire
on a truck carrying 15 people returning from a political rally for a
mayoral candidate in Huajicori, about 445 miles northwest of Mexico
City.</LD>
<TE>   Five people died, including centenarian Felipe Aguilar Hernandez.
With local elections set for next Sunday, speculation had focused on
a possible political motive. A spokesman for the attorney general
said police arrested a suspect and were seeking two others.</TE>

<HD>Balloonist's Voyage Ends in Outback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DURHAM DOWNS, Australia</DL>
<LD>Steve Fossett landed his Spirit of Freedom balloon early today in the
Australian outback, finally ending his record-setting trip around the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Associated Press photographer Rob Griffith, who was flying
overhead, saw Fossett touch down on a remote cattle ranch about 725
miles northwest of Sydney.</LD>
<LD>   The capsule bumped along the ground for about 15 minutes before it
stopped. Fossett clambered out and waved to members of his recovery
crew, said Griffith, who was in a small plane circling the landing
site.</LD>
<TE>   At least three members of the crew were briefly dragged as they
clung to ropes to help Fossett deflate the balloon. None appeared to
be hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at mission control in St. Louis confirmed that Fossett
had landed safely and spoke with him via satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett said that he had some problems deflating the balloon but
that the ground crew helped him.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem of not being able to deploy the deflation system
meant I could be dragged forever," Fossett said. He said he braced
himself inside the capsule ahead of the landing and was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't plan to make any more major balloon flights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours earlier, the American adventurer had to climb out of
his capsule in the freezing Australian night to put out a fire caused
by a loose burner hose.</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old Chicago multimillionaire sailed into the record
books Tuesday night as he crossed east of 117 degrees longitude to
become the first person to fly solo around the world in a balloon.</TE>
<TE>   But gusty winds in Australia meant that he had to wait until early
today to touch down.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett said the fire started immediately after a hose fitting
came loose.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to put out the fire by shutting off a ball valve
joint, which is used to attach the hose to propane fuel tanks and the
balloon's burner.</TE>
<TE>   The trip began June 18 in western Australia and took 13 days, 12
hours, 16 minutes and 13 seconds. By the time he landed, Fossett had
spent nearly 15 days aloft.</TE>
<TE>   After being checked by a doctor, he flew to Sydney. He was
expected to head back to the United States on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett said his cramped capsule would be put next to Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis plane at the Smithsonian Institution.</TE>

New China News Agency reported.</LD>
<TE>   The 233-foot Leshan Buddha, carved into a cliff in Sichuan
province, had been eroding rapidly because of wind and acid rain. Its
face is discolored and parts of the statue have broken off.</TE>
<TE>   The experts are cleaning the 1,280-year-old statue's body and
filling in cracks. They will also install a system to drain
rainwater.</TE>
<TE>   Acid rain is a major problem in much of China due to heavy
reliance on coal-burning power plants.</TE>

<HD>8 Islamic Suspects in Italy, Germany Are Questioned</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Eight people, including a man under investigation for links to
several of the Sept. 11 hijackers, were questioned Wednesday after
talking about sacrificing their lives for Islam, German authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Seven of the men were questioned, photographed and fingerprinted
after early morning searches at their apartments and a bookstore in
Hamburg, Germany. The men were later released, police spokeswoman
Christiane Leven said. Another official said that despite five months
of surveillance, the raids didn't turn up enough evidence to hold
them.</LD>
<LD>   An eighth suspect was being questioned in Italy after his home
there was searched, said Hamburg police spokesman Reinhard Fallak.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that the men were forming an Islamic
fundamentalist group with the aim of carrying out attacks, the
federal prosecutor's office said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no indication that the group was involved with the Sept.
11 attacks, but one detainee, identified only as 29-year-old
Abdelghani M., is also suspected of supporting the Sept. 11 Al Qaeda
cell that was based in Hamburg, said Frauke Scheuten, a spokeswoman
for the federal prosecutor.</TE>

<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Four suspected members of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network and three government personnel died Wednesday in a
gun battle at a security checkpoint in western Pakistan. Afterward,
authorities found explosives in the suspects' van and said they may
have been planning an attack.</LD>
<LD>   The gun battle occurred as Pakistani troops searched for dozens of
suspected Al Qaeda members who escaped a gunfight last week with
Pakistani soldiers in a remote village in the country's tribal belt
on the Afghan border.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the suspects were coming from the direction of
Wana, where the earlier battle occurred.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects opened fire and hurled grenades as guards approached
the van when it stopped at a checkpoint near Kohat, about 40 miles
southwest of Peshawar, officials said. Police and troops returned
fire, killing three of the suspects in the van. The fourth jumped out
and was shot dead as he tried to flee, still firing.</TE>
<TE>   After the gunfight, officials found explosives in the van,
suggesting that the suspects may have been planning a terrorist
attack in Pakistan, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani troops have arrested 16 suspected Al Qaeda fugitives
since last week's battle in Wana district.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the suspects slain Wednesday, and those of the
government personnel--one soldier, one police officer and one
Pakistani intelligence agent--were taken to a military hospital in
Kohat.</TE>
<TE>   Later, thousands of villagers descended on the Kohat checkpoint
demanding that the bodies of the suspects be handed over so they
could be buried quickly, in accordance with Islamic tradition, a
local politician said.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Investigating Rape Ordered by Tribal Council</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEERWALA, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday summoned top police and
government officials from Punjab province after it was revealed that
a tribal council there allowed an 18-year-old woman to be gang raped
in order to punish her family after her brother was seen walking with
a girl from a higher-class tribe.</LD>
<LD>   The June 22 rape has outraged human rights groups, and senior
police and provincial government officials are visiting the tribe's
village, Meerwala, to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   The victim recalled Wednesday how the ordeal began.</LD>
<TE>   For two nervous hours, she worried for her 11-year-old brother as
their father pleaded before the tribal council that the boy had done
no wrong in walking unchaperoned with a girl from a different tribe.
But the council was unconvinced, and ordered a brutal punishment: The
boy's sister would be gang raped to shame her family.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, four council members took turns raping her in a
mud hut as hundreds of people stood outside laughing and cheering.</TE>
<TE>   "I touched their feet. I wept. I cried. I said I taught the holy
Koran to children in the village, therefore don't punish me for a
crime which was not committed by me. But they tore my clothes and
raped me one by one," the young woman said.</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke, her mother, Allah Bachai, sat beside her at their
home, wailing.</TE>
<TE>   Asef Hayyat, Punjab's deputy inspector general of police, said the
top officer at the local police station had been suspended and
several close relatives of the suspects were detained to pressure the
perpetrators into surrendering. "We will soon arrest the real
culprits," Hayyat said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has a tradition of tribal justice in which crimes or
affronts to dignity are punished outside the framework of Pakistani
law. The private Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has demanded an
end to punishments by tribal councils.</TE>
<TE>   Rana Ijaz, the Punjab government's law minister, was among
officials who visited the village Wednesday. He promised a full
investigation and assistance to the victim's family.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very sad and shocking incident," Ijaz told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's father, Ghulam Farid, told of how he pleaded with the
tribal council for clemency. "I begged them ... my daughter is a very
pious girl," he said. "I reminded them, 'She has been teaching holy
Koran to your children, you are fully aware of her character.' "</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "nobody supported me. There was no one to protect
my daughter."</TE>

<HD>Oil Tanker Hits a Reef Near Fiji</HD>

<DL>SUVA, Fiji</DL>
<LD>An oil tanker ran aground in stormy seas on a reef near Fiji's
popular tourist islands, threatening an ecological disaster if the
cargo leaks, the South Pacific nation's navy said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A salvage attempt was underway to refloat the Papua New
Guinea-registered Great Theresa, which ran onto the reef several
hours after it left Fiji's main port of Nadi, Navy Operations Officer
Waisale Korowisa said.</LD>
<LD>   So far the tanker's cargo, the size of which was unknown, had not
leaked, Korowisa said.</LD>
<TE>   Navy Cmdr. Viliame Naupoto said Fiji had no salvage ships or other
equipment to deal with a large oil spill, but a tugboat had been
secured to the ship, which was resting on the reef in the Navula
Passage, about 30 miles west of Nadi, on the west side of Fiji's main
island, Viti Levu.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an oil spill, it will be disastrous for the tourist
coastal area of Fiji, especially with the huge waves coming in," he
said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Thai police raided a beachside condominium and arrested an American
wanted for the highly publicized slaying of his socialite wife in
Atlanta 15 years ago, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   James Vincent Sullivan, who had been under police surveillance for
weeks, was arrested Tuesday night in a condominium in the Cha-am
beach resort, 100 miles south of Bangkok, said police Col. Somchai
Yoklek.</LD>
<LD>   He said Sullivan's arrest was requested by the FBI. Sullivan, 61,
has been indicted in the United States on charges of hiring someone
to kill his estranged wife, Lita McClinton Sullivan, in 1987.</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan is being held while the Foreign Ministry organizes
extradition proceedings, police Maj. Gen. Surasit Sangkhaphong said.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who also has Irish citizenship, is listed on the FBI Web
site as one of the agency's most-wanted fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities allege that Sullivan, a millionaire investor from
Palm Beach County, Fla., paid someone $25,000 to kill his wife to
avoid losing property in a costly divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged hit man was arrested in April 1998 and is on trial in
Atlanta for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan is believed to have left Florida for Costa Rica soon
after the killing. It is not clear when Sullivan arrived in Thailand,
but he obtained a resident visa in 1998 and married a local woman.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Combat jets will patrol the skies over New York, Washington and other
U.S. cities today as part of the government's beefed-up security for
Fourth of July celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   Two senior U.S. officials, speaking Wednesday on condition of
anonymity, said U.S. intelligence is picking up more talk about an
attack on or about July 4, but there is still nothing specific or
corroborated.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, U.S. intelligence had been doubtful about the
prospects for an attack, saying most of the information pointed to
other dates, the official said.</LD>
<TE>   The official stressed that the increased intelligence could easily
be a result of more media attention or natural speculation.</TE>
<TE>   While White House spokesman Ari Fleischer reiterated that federal
officials know of no specific terrorist threat, he announced that a
special coordination center will roughly double its staffing in order
to monitor more than 2,000 Independence Day events "that can become
something of a target for people who want to do us harm."</TE>
<TE>   Combat air patrols "will be flying over several American cities
and randomly throughout the nation," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "As you're hearing from many people in law enforcement, they're
saying, 'Leave the worrying to us.' They will be out there. They will
be vigilant," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Limit on Autopsy Photos Upheld</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A judge upheld a state law Wednesday that restricts public access to
autopsy photos, turning back challenges from several newspapers and a
television station.</LD>
<LD>   The law was passed in March 2001 after the death of race car
driver Dale Earnhardt.</LD>
<LD>   "The right to privacy, the right to freedom of press and speech,
the right of the people to have access to public records and the
right to be left alone are important rights to all who live in this
county," Circuit Judge Leroy Moe wrote in his order.</LD>
<TE>   "They are not absolute rights, however, and they frequently
clash," he wrote. But the Legislature properly balanced those rights
in making the law, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt was killed in a crash in the final lap of last year's
Daytona 500. The Orlando Sentinel sought his autopsy photos so a
safety expert could review them to determine whether better equipment
could have prevented the racer's death.</TE>
<TE>   His family's outrage prompted the state Legislature to act quickly
to bar access to autopsy photos. The law makes it a felony punishable
by up to five years in prison for unauthorized people to view or copy
autopsy photos without a court order.</TE>
<TE>   The Sentinel and its sister paper in Fort Lauderdale, the South
Florida Sun-Sentinel, argued that the law is unconstitutional and too
broad.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really quite disappointed about the judge's ruling," said
Sentinel attorney David Bralow. He said the newspaper will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt attorney Park Thomson said he was pleased with the
judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that it never occurred to anybody that autopsy photos
were open," he said. "You now have Web sites that specialize in
autopsy photos."</TE>
<TE>   The law also was being challenged by the Tampa Tribune, its
television affiliate, WFLA-TV, and four newspapers owned by the New
York Times Co.: the Gainesville Sun, the Ledger in Lakeland, the
Sarasota Herald-Tribune and the Ocala Star-Banner.</TE>
<TE>   The law also was upheld last June by a judge who denied access to
the photos to the Independent Florida Alligator, a newspaper that
covers the University of Florida. A state appeals court has heard the
case but not ruled.</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A rabbi accused of groping two girls and two young women at a
Jewish day school will stand trial on 11 criminal sex charges, a
judge in Oklahoma City decided.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma County District Judge Donald Deason said there was enough
evidence to warrant a trial for Rabbi Richard Marcovitz, 65, who
faces six charges of sexual battery and five counts of lewd acts with
a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Deason refused a motion by Marcovitz's attorney to have the
charges reduced or dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   An 18-year-old day-care worker testified that the rabbi put his
hand on her thigh and buttocks numerous times from August 2001 to
January 2002. A 10-year-old girl alleges the rabbi put his hands on
her chest, above her breasts. A 13-year-old girl and a 28-year-old
teacher testified they too had been inappropriately touched by the
rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   Marcovitz's lawyer said the rabbi doesn't dispute that he touched
the girls but that it was not sexual in nature.</TE>

<LD>   Two men pleaded not guilty to murder charges alleging they killed
a 10-year-old girl with a shotgun blast aimed at members of a rival
gang playing basketball in a Boston park.</LD>
<TE>   The death of Trina Persad, who was shot Saturday, is the 26th
murder in the city this year.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Nelson, 23, and Joseph Cousin, 17, were ordered held

pellets and died Monday after life support was removed.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner Paul Evans said police were investigating
whether more people were involved.</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The Pledge of Allegiance must be recited every week in Missouri's
public schools under a bill signed into law a week after a panel of
federal judges ruled the wording of the pledge is unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   State lawmakers had passed the bill before the ruling was issued,
and Gov. Bob Holden said it didn't affect his decision to sign.</TE>
<TE>   In their June 26 decision, three judges from the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals said that the pledge phrase "one nation under God"
amounted to a government endorsement of religion, which violates the
separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling, which applies to nine Western states and not
Missouri, has been stayed until other members of the court have a
chance to weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Missouri law, effective Aug. 28, public schools must
ensure the pledge is recited weekly in a scheduled class of every
student, but students cannot be required to participate.</TE>

<LD>   NASA reported the spacecraft was in its proper orbit and working
fine after launch.</LD>
<TE>   "It appears the mission is right on the mark. We're happy here,"
said launch director Chuck Duvall.</TE>
<TE>   Contour will orbit Earth until Aug. 15, when its rockets will send
it toward an encounter with Comet Encke in 2003, then Comet
Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Contour is equipped with a special debris shield so it can
navigate closer to the comets and survive bombardment from the minute
particles of dust and frozen water that form a comet's most
distinctive feature, the tail.</TE>
<TE>   The shield includes a layer of Kevlar, the material used in
bulletproof vests, to help vaporize particles striking Contour with
the force of .22-caliber bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Contour will spend most of its operational life hibernating, NASA
said, to hold down costs on the $158-million program.</TE>
<TE>   During each of its passes near the comets, its four instruments
will work for about six minutes, collecting hundreds of photographs
and about two gigabytes worth of data.</TE>
<TE>   Comets are common in the solar system--there may be trillions
altogether, experts say--but most remain far beyond the orbit of
Pluto, the outermost planet, and beyond the reach of scientists.</TE>
<TE>   However, scientists remain interested because they believe each
has a nucleus frozen about 4.6 billion years ago, at the time planets
were forming, and may contain vital secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous theories, from the destruction of dinosaurs to the
beginning of life on Earth, involve comets.</TE>
<TE>   "Comets are the solar system's smallest bodies, but among its
biggest mysteries," said Joseph Veverka of Cornell University.</TE>
<TE>   Contour will return to the Earth's orbit after studying the two
comets and can be sent out again.</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Accused of Setting Ariz. Blaze Pleads Not
Guilty</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal judge cites anger in the community among
his reasons in denying bail. Last 4,000 evacuees are told they can go
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A part-time firefighter accused of intentionally starting a massive
wildfire to get work pleaded not guilty Wednesday in federal court
here, even as the last of 30,000 evacuees were told they could return
home.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard Gregg, 29, who is accused of starting the Rodeo fire June
18, faces 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The Rodeo fire
merged with another fire to become the largest conflagration in state
history.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate Stephen Verkamp ordered that Gregg be held without
bond, citing the allegation that he set the fire intentionally and
that he may be suicidal.</LD>
<TE>   Verkamp also said anyone housing Gregg, a member of the White
Mountain Apache tribe, could be targeted by angry residents driven
from their homes. Gregg's family and tribal leaders on the nearby
Fort Apache reservation, where he lives, have reported death threats
since his arrest Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The final 4,000 evacuees, most from the towns of Heber and
Overgaard, received word that they could head home even as Gregg sat
silently in court.</TE>
<TE>   More than 430 homes burned to the ground in the Rodeo-Chediski
fire. Officials announced Wednesday that the fire was 80% contained,
thanks in part to rain falling for the first time since the blaze
began.</TE>
<TE>   Verkamp set a preliminary trial date of Sept. 3 for Gregg, who at
his first hearing Sunday tried to apologize "for what I've done"
before Verkamp cut him off, saying he should not admit guilt at that
time.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg's attorney, Deborah Euler-Ajayi, said after Wednesday's
hearing that Gregg was not suicidal but simply very upset.</TE>
<TE>   "It's distressing," Euler-Ajayi said. "He's frightened. He's never
been through this process before."</TE>
<TE>   In Denver, meanwhile, a federal judge delayed the trial of a
recently fired U.S. Forest Service employee charged with setting the
largest fire in Colorado history.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Barton, 38, told investigators she accidentally started the
Hayman fire when she burned a letter from her estranged husband.
Prosecutors allege she purposely set the blaze, which burned 138,000
acres and destroyed 133 homes in and around Pike National Forest, 40
miles southwest of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Barton's attorney, Warren Williamson, sought the delay in order to
gather more forensic evidence. Government attorneys did not oppose
his request, saying they too needed more time.</TE>
<TE>   Barton's trial had been set to begin Aug. 26. U.S. District Judge
Richard T. Match did not schedule a new trial date.</TE>
<TE>   Barton is living in a federal halfway house while she is out of
jail on a $600,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   When Gregg was denied bond. Many Native Americans were upset,
alleging a double standard that treats Indians and other minorities
differently than whites.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the woman who started the Colorado fire out of jail?" said
Al Homer, a member of the American Indian Movement, as he stood
outside the Flagstaff courthouse. "Because she's Anglo. We all know
that."</TE>
<TE>   Some Native Americans also argue that the woman who ignited the
Chediski fire, which merged with the Rodeo fire, should face charges.</TE>
<TE>   The woman got lost while hiking and set a small fire to signal a
passing helicopter, investigators say, but the blaze quickly spread.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe it was an accident but note that there is no
clause in the law allowing an emergency signal fire to be set when
the forest is closed to fires.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation in that case is ongoing.</TE>

<HD>Storm Lingers, Flooding Roads, Creeks in Texas</HD>
<DH>Weather: Three people are reported dead and one is missing
as 16 inches of rain fall on San Antonio. Governor declares a
disaster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>While a drought continues to parch the West, a powerful summer storm
stalled over Central Texas this week, flooding highways, creeks and
dams with as much as 16 inches of pounding rain.</LD>
<LD>   By Wednesday, at least three people were reported dead and one was
missing as a result of the deluge. The storm began Saturday and is
expected to linger through today. The 16 inches of rain that fell on
San Antonio--a record for the entire month of July--paralyzed parts
of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Rick Perry declared parts of the rain-soaked state a disaster
Wednesday. After a helicopter tour of the hardest-hit areas, Perry
said he had requested federal disaster relief. "Help is on the way,"
the governor said after touching down in San Antonio.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not expecting a lot more rain, but the rivers are still at
dangerously high levels," said Nezette Rydell, a meteorologist at the
National Weather Service in the Central Texas town of New Braunfels.
"We're not out of the woods yet."</TE>
<TE>   Torrential rains submerged more than 100 sections of San Antonio's
freeways, causing massive traffic jams as thousands left work early
before the roads became impassable.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 homes were knee-deep in murky water that quickly
rose over lawns and seeped through walls. Neighbors clutching pets
and photo albums sloshed through the muck to waiting rescue boats,
while others found refuge on rooftops. At least two people were
injured by water strewn with debris and tree limbs.</TE>
<TE>   In the northern parts of Bexar County, which includes San Antonio,
overflowing creeks forced firefighters to jump on Jet Skis to rescue
stranded residents. Perry called out Texas Army National Guard Black
Hawk helicopters to pluck motorists from as many as 150 cars stranded
on Interstate 10 west of San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, three people
drowned in high waters caused by the storm.</TE>
<TE>   In Utopia, west of San Antonio, a man on a farm tractor heading
out to help his neighbors was washed off the road Tuesday and killed.
On Sunday, an 18-year-old hiker from Austin drowned when he fell into
a swollen creek. And Tuesday in nearby Bandera County, a driver was
killed when his pickup skidded in a pool of water and slammed into a
tractor-trailer rig.</TE>
<TE>   One man remains missing near Utopia after he was swept away from a
car stalled in deep water Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The storm caught hundreds of holiday campers by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   At Garner State Park, one of the most popular in Texas, rangers
woke hundreds of campers in the middle of the night Tuesday to warn
of rising flood waters.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't believe it. It was pouring rain, but we managed to
get most of them awake to tell them to clear out," said Glenda Zorn,
who works in the park. "They couldn't leave the park because the
roads were flooded, but they were able to move their RVs to higher
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the park, drenched vacationers tramped up hills or
clambered atop cabin roofs to escape the overflow from the Frio
River, which was 25 feet above flood stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not raining as much today," Zorn said Wednesday, "but the
park is a real mess. It looks like rock and mudslides all over the
place."</TE>
<TE>   Flash flood warnings were to remain in effect overnight in 21
Texas counties, Rydell said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Kone, a rancher in Uvalde, about 80 miles west of San
Antonio, said the rain was a welcome sight, at first. "We were way
dry before; it was real droughty," he said. "We needed rain real bad,
and, boy, we got it."</TE>
<TE>   The rain is a major boost for the Edwards Aquifer, which is the
only source of drinking water for more than 1 million people in San
Antonio and surrounding areas.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Gun Policy Praised, Scorned</HD>
<DH>Retailer: NRA registers opposition to the new sales
decision but says no boycott is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Wal-Mart was deluged with both praise and condemnation
Wednesday for its decision to toughen its policies on gun sales, a
surprise move that highlighted flaws in the system that is used to
keep guns out of the hands of criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Expressing the National Rifle Assn.'s opposition to the move, the
group's chief lobbyist spoke with a senior Wal-Mart manager to let
the company know ''we feel it's not right that law-abiding citizens
should have to bear the burden for a system that doesn't work,'' said
NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.</LD>
<LD>   The NRA, which has 4 million members, is upset because Wal-Mart
has told its store managers that they should no longer sell firearms
in cases where authorities cannot determine whether the would-be
buyer is banned from owning a weapon. The disclosure was first
reported in The Times on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Under federal law, if authorities cannot determine within three
business days if a buyer has a felony record or another
disqualification, the dealer is allowed to complete the sale anyway.
Nine states, including California, have tougher standards that
require longer waiting periods.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA emerged from its discussions Wednesday with a pledge to
work with Wal-Mart to improve the background check system--a system
that NRA lobbyist Chris Cox said ''has yet to deliver on its promise
of an instant check to the American people.'' But Cox said the NRA is
not considering a boycott of Wal-Mart--a relief to the nation's
biggest retailer.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA organized action against Kmart last year after a few
stores briefly pulled guns and ammunition from their shelves in the
wake of the Sept. 11 hijackings. Wal-Mart officials were concerned
that they might now face similar action by the powerful lobby.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were glad to see that,'' Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Eldred
said of the NRA's announcement that it would not seek a boycott.
''You can imagine we have a lot of customers who are NRA members.''</TE>
<TE>   Gun control advocates rallied around Wal-Mart on Wednesday, and
the retailer said it received a number of calls and e-mails from
customers about its decision. Most were positive, Eldred said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have heard from NRA members today that said they support
Wal-Mart's decision, and we feel that we've made the right
decision,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the NRA members who e-mailed Wal-Mart with praise was
William Corgnell, a gunsmith who runs a sporting goods shop and sells
firearms in Lake Alfred, Fla. He said in an interview that he
believes Wal-Mart is taking a responsible approach and that even
though federal law allows a sale to go through after three days,
sellers should use their own discretion.</TE>
<TE>   Corgnell, who described himself as a lifelong member of the NRA,
said he disagrees with the group's stance. ''The NRA just doesn't
want any restrictions'' on gun rights, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest seller of guns, has been criticized
in the past for allegedly lax gun policies that were linked to
several high-profile shootings. The company decided to review its
policy after receiving a letter in April from Americans for Gun
Safety, a moderate gun control group in Washington, calling on it and
other major gun retailers to voluntarily adopt a ''don't know, don't
sell'' policy on gun sales.</TE>
<TE>   About 95% of the millions of federal gun background checks each
year generate results within a few hours. But Americans for Gun
Safety pointed out in its April appeal that the small number of sales
that are inconclusive after three days--and are allowed to proceed by
default--produce a disproportionately high number of illegal gun
sales to people banned from owning a weapon. A recent study by the
group found about 10,000 cases in a 2 1/2-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Gun Safety applauded Wal-Mart's decision on
Wednesday and said that it hopes other major gun retailers will
follow Wal-Mart's lead.</TE>
<TE>   And the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence said in a separate
statement that Wal-Mart's decision ''marks a giant step forward in
the fight to reform the gun industry and to encourage accountability
from gun sellers and manufacturers.''</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the FBI, which runs the National Instant Check System
for conducting federal background checks, said they believe it is
''prudent'' for gun dealers to wait for a positive response before
selling a weapon after three days, even though it is not required by
law. But they rejected the notion that the background check system is
at fault.</TE>
<TE>   ''The system has worked extraordinarily well,'' said FBI spokesman
Paul Bressen.</TE>

<HD>Charity Ex-Chief Admits to Theft</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former head of N.Y.'s Hale House gets probation.
Husband also pleads guilty in the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A judge Wednesday sentenced Lorraine E. Hale, the former president of
Hale House, to five years' probation after she admitted siphoning
thousands of dollars from the nationally known charity for children.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband, Jesse L. DeVore, pleaded guilty to attempted forgery
and received the same sentence.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors did not press for
prison time. The couple also agreed to return $600,000 to the Hale
House in Harlem.</LD>
<TE>   During the proceedings in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan,
Justice Herbert Altman asked Hale, the 76-year-old daughter of the
organization's founder, Clara Hale, whether she had used "thousands
of dollars for personal expenses and other non-charitable expenses."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I did," said Hale, who pleaded guilty to larceny.</TE>
<TE>   Altman then turned to DeVore, 70, who admitted shifting hundreds
of thousands of dollars into a bank account for his personal use.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you do that?" Altman asked. "Yes," DeVore answered.</TE>
<TE>   Both were forbidden to run another charity and could face prison
time if they fail to return the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "This closes an unfortunate chapter in the otherwise extraordinary
history of Hale House," the charity's board Chairman Zachary W.
Carter, a former federal prosecutor, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The convictions culminated multiple investigations into the
charity, which over the last 30 years has provided a home in Harlem
for more than 1,800 children, many of whose parents took drugs and
had contracted AIDS. Its founder, known as Mother Hale, drew
widespread praise, including from President Reagan, who called her an
"angel" and "national heroine."</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Hale took over the Hale House after her mother died at
age 86 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, members of the charity's board of directors criticized
Hale for spending lavishly on antiques and furnishings for her
office, while leaving the children in far lesser surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be the least of the problems.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of articles in the New York Daily News and an
investigation by Kroll Inc., a risk consulting company hired by Hale
House's directors, New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer in
February indicted Hale and DeVore for allegedly stealing more than
$700,000 from the charity.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers charged that Hale diverted almost $250,000 in charity
funds to a secret checking account that was never disclosed in the
organization's records. Hale also was charged with grand larceny for
cashing in a $488,000 insurance policy owned by Hale House on her
life and shifting the money to her private bank account.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the money was used to make lavish improvements on the
suburban home of Hale and her husband, finance a play DeVore produced
and pay the college tuition of Hale's nephew, the indictment alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Hale's lawyer, William Dowling, labeled the embezzlements "an
aberration" and said the couple were spared prison time because of
their age and poor health.</TE>
<TE>   He said authorities had seized $100,000 of their funds, and after
pledging to return about $600,000 to Hale House, they were
"destitute."</TE>

<HD>After Flight to U.S., Stepson of Hussein Held on Visa
Charge</HD>
<DH>Security: Relative of Iraqi leader is arrested in Miami,
where he had arrived to attend aviation training class.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. officials arrested the stepson of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
in Miami, where he had arrived Wednesday to take flight training
courses without the proper visa, FBI officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The South Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force tailed Mohammad Saffi
to a Comfort Inn in Miami and arrested him about 5:30 p.m., said FBI
spokeswoman Judy Orihuela. He had arrived that day from New Zealand
via Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have any information to connect him with any terrorist
activity," Orihuela said.</LD>
<TE>   Saffi, a citizen of New Zealand, where he works for an airline,
entered the country on a tourist visa but did not have the student
visa necessary for foreign students to enroll in flight training.</TE>
<TE>   He also failed to tell customs agents in Los Angeles of his intent
to take flight courses when he arrived Tuesday from New Zealand, INS
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said Saffi, 36, is cooperating, but they declined to
say if he had made any statement to authorities. He was taken to a
facility south of Miami and is likely to be deported unless officials
determine that he is engaged in terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they do not know whether Saffi is also a citizen of
Iraq. They also were not sure whether his mother is still married to
the Iraqi leader. Orihuela also declined to elaborate on how
authorities learned that Saffi planned to enter flight school.</TE>
<TE>   A New Zealand newspaper reported in December that Saffi was
employed by Air New Zealand as an engineer and had lived in the
country for six years. New Zealand officials investigated the man
then, but no action was taken.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Liddy Did Not Defame DNC Aide, Jury Finds</HD>
<DH>Court: The former party secretary alleged that the
Watergate conspirator harmed her by tying her to a prostitution ring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A federal jury on Wednesday rejected claims from a former Democratic
National Committee secretary that she was defamed by Watergate
conspirator G. Gordon Liddy.</LD>
<LD>   Ida "Maxie" Wells had sued Liddy, claiming he falsely accused her
of procuring prostitutes for the DNC as part of his theory that the
1972 Watergate break-in was not about gathering political
intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   Liddy, who arranged the break-in, has said in speeches that the
operation was masterminded by Nixon White House Cunsel John W. Dean
III in an effort to retrieve photographs and papers from Wells' desk
that could have tied Dean's future wife, Maureen Biner, to a
prostitution ring.</LD>
<TE>   The Deans have denied Liddy's theory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very important that American citizens be able to
have vigorous debate on the elements of our history," Liddy said
after the verdict. "Agree or disagree, we have to have the freedom to
discuss it. Otherwise, our history becomes set in concrete."</TE>
<TE>   Wells was in tears. "There's no justice in the world. I just can't
understand it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, David Dorsen, said he and Wells will discuss whether
to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, jurors deadlocked on Wells' 1997 claim and a new trial
was ordered.</TE>
<TE>   After closing arguments Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Frederic
Smalkin told jurors to determine the truth or falsity of what Liddy
said about Wells in two speeches. One was given at James Madison
University in Virginia in 1996 and the other on a Mediterranean
cruise a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors were asked to determine whether Liddy was negligent and
whether Wells suffered any harm.</TE>
<TE>   They deliberated four hours before returning a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Liddy, 71, served four years and four months in prison for his
role in the burglary. He refused to testify on his behalf and kept
quiet about what he knew until his autobiography was published in
1980.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Liddy had testified that he never alleged Wells
was directly involved with the call-girl ring, only that her desk was
the target of the break-in.</TE>
<TE>   "The burglars had a map leading them to that desk, and they had a
key for that desk," Liddy said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jury foreman Stuart Friedrich Finks said he focused on Liddy's
source of information about the prostitution ring theory--Phillip
Macklin Bailley, a disbarred attorney with a history of drug and
mental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Finks noted that no one besides Bailley has ever said that the DNC
was linked to the call-girl ring.</TE>

<HD>In New York, Inner Worries Don't Cancel Out Festivities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>They were supposed to be chatting about beach blankets, bathing suits
and lunch boxes. But when a group of Manhattan parents attended a
recent summer camp orientation for their children, talk quickly
turned to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   If an event like Sept. 11 were to happen in New York City this
summer, they were told, the children would be taken to special
shelters at an undisclosed location. Parents would be notified, but
the address could not be given out now for security reasons.</LD>
<LD>   "I never dreamed we'd get into this issue so quickly, but I guess
it makes sense," said Nora Brennan, a casting director whose daughter
is attending the bucolic camp just north of the city. "This is the
reality of New York now. There's always a level of concern, just
underneath the surface, and you have to deal with it."</LD>
<TE>   As the Big Apple gears up for a huge July 4 celebration today--a
bash that will include some of the largest fireworks displays ever
seen in the city--New Yorkers are being told to be vigilant but also
to enjoy themselves. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, unveiling elaborate
security, has urged residents to celebrate the four-day holiday
weekend by gathering in public places and thus "stick it to the
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   It's an increasingly common theme in New York, and many have taken
the message to heart. But as Brennan's experience shows, even the
most fundamentally innocent activities have been transformed by the
terrorist attacks, and a low-grade anxiety seems to permeate every
discussion about safety and the future.</TE>
<TE>   This week's cover of the New Yorker, for example, displays a
resident's nightmare: While a family stands on a rooftop, admiring
holiday fireworks, a gigantic mushroom cloud looms large in the
background.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it 'The Fears of July,' " said cartoonist Art Spiegelman,
who wished he could have sketched something more reassuring, like a
backyard barbecue or seaside picnic. "But that wouldn't convey the
true sense of New York now. In other parts of the country, people are
wondering if the other shoe will drop, with another act of terrorism.
In New York, we cut to the chase: People just want to know where the
shoe is going to drop and how big it will be."</TE>
<TE>   There has been no shortage of national terrorism alerts, of
course, but they seem to have a special resonance in the city that
took the brunt of the destruction on Sept. 11. In recent months, New
Yorkers have been warned of threats against subways, tunnels, bridges
and large public spaces such as Times Square. They've been told to
keep an eye out for terrorists driving bomb-laden emergency vehicles;
they've nervously watched the skies over Manhattan, where small,
general aviation planes routinely swoop near the Empire State
Building and other tall structures.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax fears that dominated public and private conversations
last year have been replaced by ruminations over dirty bombs and the
damage they could do to a commuter hub like Pennsylvania Station.</TE>
<TE>   This week, radiation detection devices were installed in select
police precincts throughout the city, and about 300 hand-held
radiation monitors were distributed to members of the New York Fire
Department.</TE>
<TE>   If accepting all this is part of "getting on with normal life," as
Bloomberg suggests, New Yorkers are struggling to cope in different
ways.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Ho, president of IQ Financial Systems, a software company,
believes many residents are braced for the unthinkable but have no
intention of succumbing to their worst fears.</TE>
<TE>   His firm was on the 84th floor of the World Trade Center, and four
employees died in the attacks. Since then, the company has relocated
to another Manhattan neighborhood and is focused on getting everyone
back to work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hard, because some people want to avoid traveling at
rush hour, remembering what happened before, and others insisted that
our new office not be located near any monuments," said Ho, who lives
on the Upper West Side.</TE>
<TE>   "So we take all the precautions you can imagine and still live
with the idea that if someone is going to do something horrible,
there's not much you can do to stop them. You just have to be aware."</TE>
<TE>   Like many New Yorkers, Ho and his wife have had numerous
conversations about whether they and their twin 2-year-olds should
leave Manhattan for a safer place. Each time they raise the issue,
the same old questions surface: Where could they go that would be
safer? And why abandon a city simply because of personal anxiety?</TE>
<TE>   "We're actually going to leave New York for the suburbs later this
year," he said. "But it's all about needing more space for our kids.
We're not running away because of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of whether to flee New York before another attack occurs
is pervasive; it's been a hot topic in therapy sessions, from the
Upper East Side to Battery Park City, according to Bernadette Hogan,
a psychologist and psychoanalyst.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many clients I see who can't quite put a finger on what
seems to be wrong with them; something seems out of kilter. And when
I ask if it's related to this feeling of being threatened by another
terrorist attack, that's quite often the root cause," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the same discussions about leaving New York in our own
home, but we keep coming back to something from Greek mythology. The
very thing you do to protect yourself can get you into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "You can flee Manhattan and go live in Kansas, and then your
16-year-old could die in a car accident. Who knows what the world has
in store?"</TE>
<TE>   Fears notwithstanding, Manhattanites aren't leaving the city.
Although there was a dramatic drop in sales of townhouses,
condominiums and co-ops after the September attacks, the real estate
market--a key barometer of psychological confidence here--began
rallying in December and has been booming in recent months, according
to Pamela Lieberman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, one of
New York's leading real estate firms.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw the market drop 11% in one day after Sept. 11, but now we
are 50% ahead of the sales pace ... at this time last year,"
Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception was that New Yorkers would be jumping ship by now,
but it hasn't happened. A great many people looked at buying vacation
homes in places like Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey,
but that's all they did. They stayed put."</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Hogan, are taking precautions. To guard against a
catastrophic attack, she said, her family will be placing valuable
items in a safe deposit box outside of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Ho, who is president of his condominium's board of managers, noted
that many city apartment buildings are working more closely than ever
with police units to guard against suspicious visitors or packages
left on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the tension in New York, you just have to use common
sense," said Ho, who added that his building's roof deck will offer a
stunning view of the city's annual fireworks display today. Given New
York's heavy police deployment, the explosions need not be a source
of fear, as in Spiegelman's menacing cover, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes, New Yorkers can't ignore the feelings of
vulnerability and terror that seem to lurk beneath the surface of
everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   In May, people hurrying to work on West 34th Street in Manhattan
were stunned by a deafening explosion just outside the Empire State
Building.</TE>
<TE>   As smoke began pouring into the sky, a second explosion, even
louder than the first, rocked the busy street. Suddenly, people began
fleeing the scene, some screaming: "This is it!" while others wept.</TE>
<TE>   It was only when a third explosion rocked the street 15 seconds
later and a manhole cover shot into the air that the cause became
clear. There had been an underground fire on overloaded power lines,
causing several covers to explode. Within minutes, police and fire
crews sealed off the street and a measure of calm returned.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a big attack all over again," said Avril
Williams, who works in a shoe store across the street. "And then I
said to myself, it's just another crazy problem in New York, the kind
of thing you deal with all the time."</TE>

<HD>2 Pilots Charged With Being Drunk Will Be Fired, America
West Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- America West said Wednesday that it will fire the two pilots
who were charged with trying to fly a jetliner to Phoenix while
drunk.</LD>
<LD>   Pilot Thomas Cloyd and co-pilot Christopher Hughes "have been sent
a letter notifying them that our intention is to terminate their
employment," spokeswoman Janice Monahan said.</LD>
<LD>   She said the letters were delivered Tuesday. The pilots can appeal
through their union if they choose, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The airline has worked closely with police, who provided
information the airline needed to proceed with the firing, Monahan
said. She did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Cloyd, 44, and Hughes, 41, were charged Monday by Miami-Dade
County police with operating, while under the influence, an aircraft
and a motor vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Both had blood-alcohol levels above the legal limit of 0.08 when
they were ordered to return their Phoenix-bound plane, carrying 124
passengers, back to the gate Monday morning because a screener had
noticed they smelled of alcohol. Hughes initially told police it was
"merely mouthwash," according to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   Cloyd and Hughes returned to their Gilbert, Ariz., homes Tuesday
after they were released from jail on $7,000 bond. They could face
five years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona police records show that Cloyd has been arrested twice for
alleged alcohol-related offenses while at his home in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Cloyd was arrested on a charge of disorderly
conduct after allegedly harassing his downstairs neighbor. He told
police he had been "drinking a lot" before he shouted obscenities,
pounded on her door and stomped on his floor, records show.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to two years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Cloyd had been drinking when he was arrested for
misdemeanor domestic assault at his home near Phoenix. He admitted he
spit on his then-wife and shoved her into a refrigerator with his
chest.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors dropped the domestic assault charge after Cloyd took
an anger-management class, said Carla Boatner, administrator for
Chandler Municipal Court.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Cloyd family, Steve Hicks, said, "We're
saddened by the occurrences and the allegations made against them."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Floridian Sues Over Free Prozac Sample Sent Through Mail</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The woman who received the package says she
didn't ask her doctor to switch her prescription.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A Florida woman opened her mailbox last month to find a
free box of once-a-week Prozac from her pharmacy chain--astonishing,
she says, since she didn't use Prozac and hadn't asked her doctor to
switch her from another antidepressant.</LD>
<LD>   It's not clear how many other patients received unsolicited Prozac
(the woman's attorneys say they know of two more so far) or whether
the apparent campaign to sign up new Prozac customers extended beyond
South Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Prozac maker Eli Lilly &amp; Co. issued an apology for the incident
late Wednesday and said it is investigating. The Food and Drug
Administration is watching closely.</LD>
<TE>   The Prozac mailings may mark the first time a powerful
prescription drug had been sent to patients neither expecting nor
wanting new pills, an apparent twist on marketing campaigns to
persuade patients to switch medications.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm incredulous," said drug safety expert Michael Cohen of the
nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices, who called the
mailings dangerous. "You might have [people] other than the patient
picking it up out of the mailbox and taking it. It could be a child."</TE>
<TE>   The big question: Is mailing patients unsolicited prescription
drugs, as if they were detergent samples, legal?</TE>
<TE>   Laws governing prescription-writing and pharmacy practices vary by
state. The drugstore chain Walgreens maintains it properly filled
prescriptions from doctors' offices and mailed them free because it
had "coupons" from Lilly to provide reimbursement. The Florida
woman's doctors aren't talking.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly issued a statement late Wednesday saying it was
inappropriate to mail medicine to patients without their request.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent Lilly personnel may have participated in this
program, Lilly apologizes to those patients affected by it," said
spokeswoman Debbie Davis. "We are investigating this matter
vigorously, and if company policies were violated, Lilly will take
appropriate action."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA--which regulates prescription medicines, their makers and
their marketing--is monitoring the case to see whether it needs to
intervene.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the acts of prescribing and providing the drug likely
come under state jurisdiction, FDA intends to keep an eye on this
case because of the promotion issues it may raise," said spokesman
Larry Bachorik.</TE>
<TE>   The Broward County woman, identified in court documents only as
S.K., this week sued her doctors, Walgreens and Lilly, charging
invasion of privacy and improper medical practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Patient," reads a letter accompanying the pills that was
signed by her local doctors. "We are very excited to be able to offer
you a more convenient way to take your antidepressant medication.</TE>
<TE>   "For your convenience, enclosed you will find a free one-month
trial of Prozac Weekly," the letter continues. It tells patients to
stop their regular antidepressant a day before starting the
once-a-week version.</TE>
<TE>   "It really upset me," S.K. said in a telephone interview arranged
by one of her attorneys, Stephen Sheller of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   She said her grandchildren might have opened and swallowed the
mailed drug, and anyone seeing her mail would learn she suffers from
depression, which she keeps private. "Then I started to think, 'Wait
a minute, how did they know to send them to me?' "</TE>
<TE>   S.K. said her doctor maintains that the office physicians signed a
blank form letter provided by a Lilly salesman. S.K.'s medical
records show no Prozac prescription, said fellow attorney Gary Farmer
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the doctors' office, Holy Cross Medical Group,
did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit charges that Walgreens must have allowed access to
patient prescription records.</TE>
<TE>   Walgreens didn't allow anyone access to patient records and
properly filled prescriptions from doctors' offices for all the
Prozac it mailed, said Michael Polzin of the chain's Deerfield, Ill.,
office.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. highway regulators issued rules Wednesday requiring makers of
vehicles, tires and child restraint systems to provide quarterly
reports on deaths and injuries linked to their products.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules implement
the early warning provisions of legislation passed in response to the
Firestone tire debacle.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers producing more than 500 vehicles annually and all
makers of child restraint systems and tires must report deaths and
injuries in the United States as well as warranty claims, consumer
complaints, property damage and field reports, the NHTSA said.</LD>
<TE>   The first quarterly reports will not be due until Aug. 31, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   To help the agency use the data, larger manufacturers will be
required to provide a limited amount of historical data on warranty
claims and field reports covering three prior years on Sept. 30,
2003.</TE>

<HD>Pesticides Approved Illegally, Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Ecology: EPA failed to consult Fisheries Service about the
effect of chemicals on threatened and endangered salmon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the government violated the
Endangered Species Act by not setting guidelines for pesticides that
could harm threatened and endangered salmon.</LD>
<LD>   Judge John Coughenour said the Environmental Protection Agency had
failed to consult the National Marine Fisheries Service, beginning in
1989, over the potential harm to fish from 55 commonly used
pesticides.</LD>
<LD>   The Fisheries Service oversees salmon recovery, and "such
consultation is mandatory," the judge wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling could force the EPA to eventually withdraw approval of
some pesticides or require stricter rules for their use near water.
It follows a lawsuit by anti-pesticide and commercial fishing groups.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Mark MacIntyre said the agency had not reviewed the
ruling and could not comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   Fisheries Service scientists have found that levels of pesticide
between 1 part per billion and 1 part per 10 billion, commonly found
in salmon streams around the West, can harm the nervous systems of
salmon--particularly their sense of smell. Small amounts of
pesticides can also affect reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few restrictions on using pesticides near water,"
said Erika Schreder of the Washington Toxics Coalition, one of the
plaintiffs. "It is no surprise we see pesticides in our water
practically whenever we look for them."</TE>
<TE>   The pesticides at issue are applied to everything from farm fields
to suburban lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns.,
another plaintiff, said the ruling could help restore wild salmon
that, before starting a precipitous decline in the 1980s, supported a
$1.25-billion fishing industry and 60,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But Heather Hansen of Washington Friends of Farms and Forests,
which intervened in the suit on the side of the EPA, said it is too
early to say what the ruling might mean for farmers and homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of doing consultation is to look at all the data
you have, figure out if there is a problem, what the problem is, and
what to do about it," she said. "We don't know yet how any of those
steps in the consultation process for each product will come out."</TE>

<HD>A Small Matter, but Bush's Responsibility, Experts Say</HD>
<DH>Securities: 'It's a serious obligation,' according to a
former SEC official. Many don't support the claim that blame lies
with corporate lawyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On the seismic scale of insider trading violations, President Bush's
failure to file a required form on time 12 years ago was a minor
blip, but one for which he bears ultimate responsibility, securities
law experts said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Several former enforcement officials for the Securities and
Exchange Commission said they regard Bush's tardy filing of a form
detailing a big stock sale in 1990 as relatively inconsequential and
not indicative of an intent to defraud investors.</LD>
<LD>   But they said they do not buy the White House's claim that it was
the responsibility of corporate attorneys, not Bush, to ensure the
paperwork was turned in on time.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a serious obligation," said Robert Heim, a former SEC
enforcement attorney who is now a partner in Meyers &amp; Heim, a New
York law firm. "It raises questions about how seriously Mr. Bush was
taking his responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC concluded that the filing lapse did not merit
prosecution, new disclosures about Bush's actions could undermine the
president's credibility as he prepares to detail his efforts to crack
down on corporate crime in a major policy address next week.</TE>
<TE>   The violation in question occurred in 1990, when Bush was a member
of the board of directors of Harken Energy Corp., a small Texas oil
company, and decided to sell about two-thirds of his stock in the
company.</TE>
<TE>   According to SEC documents, Bush filed the required notification
of his intent to unload more than 212,000 shares, which he sold on
June 22, 1990, for nearly $850,000. But he failed to file a second
form divulging details of the transaction until March 4, 1991, more
than eight months after the legal deadline.</TE>
<TE>   About two months after Bush sold his shares for $4 each, the
company announced a big quarterly loss, and the stock price fell by
the end of the year to just over $1 per share. The SEC looked into
the transaction but concluded that Bush had not engaged in illegal
insider trading because it did not appear that he was acting on the
basis of information not available to the general public.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has long maintained that the required filings had been made
on time and that the SEC had somehow misplaced the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, the White House said it had determined that the
second filing, called a Form 4, was 34 weeks late. It suggested that
Harken's attorneys were to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "Form 4s are filled out by corporations, under the SEC rules,"
said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. "... The president believed
at the time that he had filled out all the paperwork that was
required, and it was filed, and that the lawyers did as they were
required to do."</TE>
<TE>   But according to former SEC officials, it is the director's
responsibility, not the company's, to make sure that all insider
stock sale reports are filed on time.</TE>
<TE>   "From passage of the Securities Exchange Act in 1934 up until
today, it has been the filing person's responsibility," said Edward
Fleischman, who served as an SEC commissioner from 1986 to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Fleischman said he regarded Bush's failure to file on
time as a relatively minor offense. At the time it occurred, he said,
it would have been regarded as even less significant.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, the SEC had just begun to crack down on tardiness,"
said Fleischman, now senior counsel for Linklaters, a London-based
law firm. Until the late 1980s and early 1990s, he said, the
timeliness of Form 4 filings had not been closely monitored, let
alone enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he said, expectations have changed.</TE>
<TE>   "The failure to file a Form 4 does not appear to me as a
practicing lawyer to be substantive," he said. "Does it expose my
client to SEC prosecution? Today, absolutely. Fifteen years ago, not
a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Lorne, a former SEC general counsel now at the Los
Angeles-based law firm of Munger Tolles &amp; Olson, said late filings
were commonplace at the time Bush sold his stock.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have enough digits to count the number of times I've seen
people file Form 4s late," Lorne said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the individual's responsibility, but companies often handle
it for them because the individuals don't remember to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Bush filed the initial notification of his intent to
sell Harken stock suggests that he was not trying to evade his
reporting responsibilities, the SEC officials said, and that the late
filing of the second report was just an oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a technical violation," said another former SEC official,
who requested anonymity. "With all that's going on today, it's a flea
bite on the tail of an elephant."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers in Tennessee OK Sales Tax Hike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The state Legislature passed a 1-cent sales tax increase late
Wednesday, ending a partial government shutdown and giving Tennessee
its biggest tax hike in state history.</LD>
<LD>   It now goes to Gov. Don Sundquist, who said he would sign it.</LD>
<LD>   The stalemate over an income tax and how to resolve an
$800-million deficit resulted in lawmakers failing to meet the
deadline to pass a balanced budget by July 1, the start of the new
fiscal year.</LD>
<TE>   Sundquist was forced to furlough half of the state's 42,000
workers and keep in operation only essential services. The employees
will return to work Friday, Sundquist said.</TE>
<TE>   The House approved the sales tax bill 50 to 41, the minimum number
of votes required for passage. The Senate passed it 22 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   When the tax goes into effect July 15, Tennessee will have one of
the highest sales tax rates in the country: 9.75% in 30 of the
state's 95 counties.</TE>

<HD>Thome's Home Run Is Wasted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Thome just wishes he could enjoy his historic home run tear.</LD>
<LD>   Thome homered in his seventh consecutive game, leaving him one shy
of the major league record, but the New York Yankees defeated
Cleveland, 11-8, Wednesday night. It was the Indians' fourth
consecutive loss and 11th in 15 games.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice, but it's not fun when you don't win," Thome said.
"It's been a great deal, don't get me wrong. You hope it doesn't end,
but you know someday it will. I haven't really given it much thought
because of the way we've been playing."</LD>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs for
the Yankees, who improved to 11-0 against AL Central teams. Rondell
White and Jorge Posada had two-run singles, Ron Coomer had a two-run
double and Enrique Wilson tripled twice on a 93-degree night in the
Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees (52-31) have won five of six to move a season-high 21
games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Thome hit a 3-2 pitch from David Wells (9-5) over the fence in
left-center with two outs in the seventh inning. The solo shot gave
Thome an AL-leading 26 homers and cut Cleveland's deficit to 6-5. He
finished one for five.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty hot right now," teammate Ellis Burks said. "I just
wish we could support him as well as he's been supporting us, because
he's definitely been carrying us."</TE>
<TE>   The major league record for consecutive games with a home run is
eight, shared by Ken Griffey Jr. when he was with Seattle (1993), Don
Mattingly of the Yankees (1987) and Dale Long of Pittsburgh (1956).</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see Thome hit a home run every night, believe me I
pull for it," Cleveland Manager Charlie Manuel said. "But I think
we've still got about a half a season to go--if he does that, I want
to be his agent."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Kansas City 0--Joel Pineiro started July with the same
dominance he showed in June, giving up two hits in eight innings at
Seattle for his fifth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro (9-3) did not give up a hit after the second inning and
retired 12 in a row during one stretch. Kazuhiro Sasaki, who gave up
four runs in his previous two outings, combined with Pineiro for the
two-hitter with his 19th save in 23 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Oakland 1--Johan Santana gave up only one run and six
hits in 6 1/3 innings as the Twins ended Mark Mulder's seven-start
winning streak with a victory at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, Toronto 2--Tony Clark's tiebreaking single off Cliff
Politte (1-2) keyed a three-run eighth inning at Boston as the Red
Sox took advantage of four Toronto errors to win their ninth game in
a row over the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Chicago 4--Brian Moehler came off the disabled list to
win for the first time in nearly 22 months, pitching the Tigers past
the White Sox at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, Tampa Bay 5--Ivan Rodriguez hit a game-winning, leadoff
homer in the ninth inning and had a two-run shot in a four-run first
as the Rangers won at Arlington, Texas.</TE>

struck out 19, walked three, given up one run and held opponents to a
.156 batting average.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, the Angels broke in closer Troy Percival as a setup man
for Lee Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Could the Angels break in Rodriguez as a setup man for Percival?</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff-wise, no doubt. He's definitely the real deal. He probably
needs to get a little more experience," said Salt Lake coach Mike
Butcher, who pitched for the 1995 Angels. "At that stage, I think
Troy was a little more polished."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to adjust their starting rotation after the
All-Star break so that Jarrod Washburn and Ramon Ortiz can pitch as
many games as possible against the first-place Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trail Seattle by four games and face the Mariners six
times in the first 17 games after the break.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn is expected to start next Thursday, in the first game
after the break.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Armed forces personnel overseas will be saluted as part of the
Fourth of July celebration at tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a pregame ceremony on the field at 5:30 p.m. and
during the game fans will have an opportunity to send either a
personalized digital video message to a family member or friend
overseas or a general message of thanks.</TE>
<TE>   A Give Thanks America kiosk where the messages can be recorded
will be located at the Gate 4 courtyard area. Also, pre-recorded
messages by Angel players will be shown on the scoreboard during the
game.</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Officials Are Supportive of Selig</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Countering criticism from players--including one inside their own
clubhouse--Boston Red Sox officials voiced support for Commissioner
Bud Selig on Wednesday and said he has the support of baseball's
owners in negotiations over a new labor contract.</LD>
<LD>   "Bud's being vilified, we think unfairly. It's his platform that
we all stand for," Red Sox President Larry Lucchino said. "He is
being criticized unfairly by the other side.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a misperception that Bud Selig is a one-man band
marching to his own drummer. He really is carrying the water for a
unified set of clubs and pushing issues that are being thrust upon
him by one of his constituencies," the owners.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the most focused comments came from right inside the
building.</TE>
<TE>   Boston pitcher John Burkett said last month that he would boycott
the All-Star Game in Milwaukee because he wouldn't want to benefit
Selig, who owns the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   (Selig put the voting rights to his shares of the team in a blind
trust when he became commissioner and the club is now run by daughter
Wendy Selig-Prieb.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston reliever Ugueth Urbina was picked to replace teammate Pedro
Martinez on the American League roster for next week's All-Star Game.
Urbina, 28, has 21 saves, and also has a 2.70 earned-run average and
an 0-3 record.... The San Francisco Giants put outfielder Marvin
Benard on the 15-day disabled list because of torn cartilage in his
left knee. The move is retroactive to Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tracy Not Taking It Back; Diamondbacks Annoyed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy admitted he may not have used the best
choice of words Tuesday night, but he did not retract his insinuation
that Arizona pitcher Rick Helling may have feigned injury to justify
hitting Adrian Beltre in the back with a pitch or to avoid a
bench-clearing brawl.</LD>
<LD>   Helling sprained his right ankle in an awkward home-plate
collision with Brian Jordan in the sixth inning of the Dodgers' 8-0
victory, and his ankle gave out on his next pitch, which drilled
Beltre and nearly precipitated a brawl.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope [Helling] did hurt himself," Tracy said after the game.
"Not to be nasty or anything, but if he didn't hurt himself on the
previous play, then it was unnecessary to hit Adrian Beltre in the
back.... If he did turn his ankle, I can see how a ball would get
away from him and hit a guy in the back. But we'll see how he is in
five days."</LD>
<TE>   The implication that Helling's injury couldn't have been that
serious if he makes his next start infuriated Helling, who said, "If
[Tracy] thinks I faked an injury to avoid a fight, then he's an
idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday to respond to Helling's comments, Tracy said he
would not get into a mud-slinging match with an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the way I worded my answer [wasn't right].... I wasn't
wishing someone to be hurt," Tracy said. "All I was saying was that
if he wasn't hurt and he hit our guy in the back, I'd take exception
to that. I'm not going to respond to what [Helling] said. Everyone
has a right to his opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Helling insisted he did not hit Beltre on purpose, that his ankle
gave way on the pitch, "and if I had thrown a curve [instead of a
fastball] the ball would have ended up in the stands," Helling said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know Jim Tracy. I'm just surprised that a guy I've heard
to be knowledgeable would insinuate I hit a guy on purpose and faked
an injury to get away with it.... My integrity is very important to
me, and it bothers me when someone I don't know questions that."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Helling was shagging balls in the outfield during
batting practice Wednesday--and was not in the trainers' room--seemed
to confirm the Dodgers' suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   When told of this, Tracy responded with a lengthy blank stare
before saying, "I'm not interested in mud-slinging."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's comments after Tuesday's game surprised many Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until [Tuesday] I thought that guy did nothing wrong," Arizona
pitcher Curt Schilling said. "I have a ton of respect for the guy,
and everything he's said and done has been right. I was shocked to
read something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Added pitcher Brian Anderson: "I'm sure a lot of it was said in
the heat of the moment, because I can't imagine a manager saying he
hoped a guy hurt himself."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy had no intention of apologizing to Helling, and Helling felt
no need to apologize to Beltre or the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel that's necessary," Tracy said. "That was [Tuesday]
and today's a new day. We'll move on."</TE>
<TE>   As will the Dodger-Diamondback rivalry, which was heated before
Tuesday night's exchange and could grow even more intense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if this makes [the rivalry] any better, because
there's enough desire to beat them on their own," Anderson said. "But
it certainly makes it more interesting for [reporters] and fans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek, who suffered a mild concussion in an outfield
collision with Jordan on Sunday, said he felt good enough to play
Wednesday night, but Alex Cora, who turned a splendid double play to
preserve a 1-0 lead in the fifth inning of Tuesday night's victory,
started at second base again.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who is struggling with a .245 average, said he had
"no idea" why he wasn't playing and was a little frustrated sitting
out a third game. "This is a big series, and you want to be in there
in a big game against a big-time team," he said. "That's what you
work so hard for."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy wanted to be cautious. "He could play, but I want to wait
one more day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jordan pulled himself out of the game in the seventh inning,
suffering from cramps brought on by dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will host their seventh annual 5K Run/Walk on Monday
at Dodger Stadium with proceeds benefiting the Dodgers Dream

<HD>Open Might Have Record Karrie-Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is the list of players who have won the U.S. Women's Open three
consecutive times:</LD>
<LD>   That's right, no one has done it, although Karrie Webb has a
chance to be the first one this week at Prairie Dunes Country Club in
Hutchinson, Kan. Webb has a few things going for her, namely five
major titles since 1999, plus four of the last eight and five of the
last 12.</LD>
<LD>   She also gets style points. Webb hasn't merely won majors, she has
blown everybody else away, winning those five by a total of 27 shots.
Last year at Pine Needles in North Carolina, Webb beat Se Ri Pak by
eight shots.</LD>
<TE>   But Webb has history against her. Six players have had an
opportunity to win three in a row and six have failed. The list
includes Mickey Wright (1958-59), Donna Caponi (1969-70), Susie
Berning (1972-73), Hollis Stacey (1977-78), Betsy King (1989-90) and
Annika Sorenstam (1995-96).</TE>
<TE>   Webb, 27, is already the youngest woman to win all four of the
LPGA's majors, which she accomplished last year at the LPGA
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   She won her first tournament of the year two weeks ago at
Rochester, N.Y., which puts her five tournament victories behind
Sorenstam, who won for the sixth time in 12 outings last week in
Northfield, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, when Sorenstam tried for her third consecutive U.S.
Open victory in 1997 at Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon, she missed the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam has already been identified as Webb's biggest
challenger. Sorenstam leads the LPGA money list by a ton--she has
$1.534 million and leads Pak by nearly $800,000--and she also leads
for the Vare Trophy (68.74) and in player-of-the-year points.</TE>
<TE>   Pak has won three majors, including the 1998 Open at Blackwolf Run
in Wisconsin, so she is probably going to be a factor at Prairie
Dunes, a 6,293-yard, par-70 layout. Pak has won twice this year and
so has Laura Diaz. Another player to watch out for is Juli Inkster,
who has won six majors.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tiger Woods withdraws from the Western Open because
he's sick.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Now, his final tuneup before the British Open at
Muirfield becomes his fishing trip in Ireland with John Cook and Mark
O'Meara ... if you don't count a pre-Open practice round at Muirfield
he is likely to play.</TE>
<TE>   Harmonious</TE>
<TE>   News item: Nancy Sinatra and Glen Campbell are featured in new
Nike Golf advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Thus leading to rhinestone-covered golf boots made for
walking 18 holes, or the time it takes to get to Phoenix, whichever
comes first.</TE>
<TE>   Second Helpings</TE>
<TE>   He went five playoff holes before losing to Don Pooley in the U.S.
Senior Open, but coming close didn't make Tom Watson feel so great.
It was the fourth time in 10 tournaments this year that Watson has
been second and the ninth time since he joined the Senior PGA Tour
full-time two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That's too many, Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like Jug McSpaden to Byron Nelson, I feel like Phil
Mickelson to Tiger Woods," he said. "It's not a lot of fun to finish
second."</TE>
<TE>   Come Back, Len</TE>
<TE>   For further proof that golf is a strange game, we present Len
Mattiace.</TE>
<TE>   Mattiace, 34, had developed a reputation as one of the nicest guys
on the PGA Tour who just couldn't win.</TE>
<TE>   He turned pro in 1990, made two trips back to qualifying school,
played two years on what is now the Buy.com Tour, played seven years
on the PGA Tour, played 273 professional events and hadn't won a
single time.</TE>
<TE>   Now in just over four months, he has won twice--the Nissan Open in
February and the St. Jude Classic last weekend at Memphis, Tenn. As a
result, Mattiace is working on adding something to his reputation:
You don't want to see him over your shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   When he won at Riviera, Mattiace trailed leader Scott McCarron by
four shots during the last round. Mattiace began the fourth round at
Memphis seven shots off the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mattiace has won $1.92 million this year, after having won $2.86
million in the 11 previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Beagle</TE>
<TE>   And even more proof that golf is strange.... Darron Stiles holed
out twice from the fairway for eagles in the last round and won the
Knoxville Open on the Buy.com Tour by one shot. His first victory was
at the Dominion Open three years ago when he holed out from the
fairway to eagle the last hole and won by one shot.</TE>
<TE>   Boo</TE>
<TE>   Remember Boo Weekley, the 28-year-old career mini-tour player from
Milton, Fla., who earned his PGA Tour card at qualifying school?
Weekley was a cute story at the time because of his name (after Yogi
Bear's sidekick Boo Boo Bear) and his clothes (rain pants because of
a skin condition and sneakers because of extra-wide feet).</TE>
<TE>   Now there is an update to the story. Boo broke through and earned
his first paycheck this year when he tied for 19th at Memphis and
made $37,724.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Update</TE>
<TE>   It's still two months off, but it's safe to say that the Ryder Cup
has been playing to the short side of the public interest game as
Woods hogs the news in his pursuit of the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Never fear, for there is still plenty of time to pump some energy
into the event, which was postponed for a year because of the events
of last September. Maybe that's the reason for the article in the
newspaper Scotland on Sunday that did its best to fan the flames.</TE>
<TE>   There was Paul Azinger called a "rabidly right wing xenophobe" and
Curtis Strange "a 'bad-ass' competitor if there ever was one."</TE>
<TE>   But the best part was the walkaway: "There's only one solution. If
it looks as if the Americans are going to win, the European players
should whip up the home crowd into a mindless frenzy [opening the
bars before lunchtime will help in that regard]. They should get
everyone to shout obscenities at the visitors. And they should, if
things get really desperate, stampede across greens before matches
are over. Well, it worked last time."</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie's back problems flared up again, but he's
apparently well enough to play the European Open that begins today at
the K Club in Dublin. Earlier in the week, speculation was that
muscle spasms might force him out of the European Open, plus next
week's Scottish Open at Loch Lomond near Glasgow and the British Open
at Muirfield near Edinburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie tied for 13th last year at Royal Lytham, his best
finish in the Open in seven years and second only to his tie for
eighth at Turnberry in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Not many U.S. players have entered the Scottish Open: Brad Faxon,

<LD>To those who like large fields, the $500,000 American Oaks, which
will be run for the first time Saturday at Hollywood Park, is already
a success.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen 3-year-old fillies are scheduled to run 1 1/4 miles on
turf in the inaugural Oaks, which is the brainchild of racing
secretary Martin Panza.</LD>
<LD>   The American Oaks, with its abundant field and inclusion in a pick
six with a $1-million guaranteed pool, makes for a great betting
race. The Swaps Stakes and Hollywood Gold Cup, two graded races that
will be run July 14, probably won't have more than 14 starters
combined.</LD>
<TE>   Nor are any out-of-town shippers expected for the $750,000 Gold
Cup or the $500,000 Swaps. Only four locals are running in the Oaks,
with the rest of the field made up of fillies coming from, among
other places, Florida, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, France, England
and Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Believing California no longer has any races that mean anything on
a national or international level, Panza is hopeful the Oaks can
become an international event.</TE>
<TE>   "There is room for this race to grow," said Panza, who first
started thinking about the race three years ago. "We're hopeful it
can grow into one of the American classics.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 10 shippers for this race, and when was the last time
that happened for any of our races out here?"</TE>
<TE>   The Oaks is a welcome opportunity for 3-year-old turf fillies
because there is no other race like it on the horizon. For example,
Europeans who had participated in the French Oaks last month at
Chantilly would have to wait until September for another chance to
compete against their age group.</TE>
<TE>   Del Mar features the San Clemente and Del Mar Oaks for the
division. While those races normally attract good-sized fields,
neither can match the purse of Hollywood Park's newest race.</TE>
<TE>   Panza hopes to lure horses from Japan, Australia and New Zealand
for future races, but he is pleased with the field that will be in
the starting gate Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have liked to have had [Kentucky Oaks winner] Farda
Amiga, but she got sick and it didn't work out," he said, adding he
wants to increase the purse in the future and that additional
sponsorship is being sought.</TE>
<TE>   Of the locals, Megahertz is the filly to beat, although she got no
favors when post positions were drawn Wednesday. The English-bred
daughter of Pivotal, who is owned by Michael Bello and trained by
Bobby Frankel, will leave from Post 13 under jockey Alex Solis.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of one of eight starts in Europe, Megahertz hasn't lost
in four starts in this country. Her last win in the Honeymoon
Breeders' Cup Handicap over this turf course on June 6 was her best
yet. Seemingly beaten with less than a furlong to run as the 13-10
favorite, she showed an amazing turn of foot to get up and beat
Arabic Song, another Oaks participant, by three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   Among the out-of-towners, Maliziosa and Cellars Shiraz arrive
sharp. Owned and bred by Haras Santa Maria de Aras and trained by
Bill Mott, Maliziosa has won three in a row at three tracks. This
will be her toughest task after victories at Keeneland, Churchill
Downs and Hawthorne. A daughter of Dynaformer, she will break from
the rail in the large field and will be ridden by Mike Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Cellars Shiraz, owned by Bitterroot Investments Inc. and trained
by former NFL player Bill Caesare, has won four of her last five.
Cornelio Velasquez, who has been aboard for five of the filly's six
wins, will ride her again.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, here's the rest of the field for the American
Oaks: Cyclorama, Alozaina, Devon Rose, Distant Valley, Dublino, Ombre
Legere, Clerical Error, A B Noodle, Saranac Lake and Risakverse.
Linda Eder is the lone also-eligible and will race only if there is a
scratch. Distant Valley and Ombre Legere will race coupled as the
Gary Tanaka-owned entry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Valenzuela, who has a commanding lead in the Hollywood
Park jockey standings, was off his mounts Wednesday. According to the
stewards, Valenzuela didn't ride so he could be with his father, who
is hospitalized and listed in critical condition.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though trainer Bobby Frankel has scratched two multiple stakes
winners from today's $150,000 American Handicap at Hollywood Park, he
is starting the morning-line favorite in the Grade II.</LD>
<LD>   Kappa King, a 5-year-old son of Kingmambo, will be the stable's
lone representative as it seeks yet another stakes victory in the 1
1/8-mile turf race. Super Quercus, who won in a softer spot Sunday,
and Thady Quill were scratched Wednesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Oak Cliff Stable, Kappa King won an allowance race in his
U.S. debut May 26. It was his fourth win in nine starts and he won
more easily than the half-length margin of victory would indicate. He
will be seeking his first graded stakes victory under jockey Kent
Desormeaux.</LD>
<TE>   Native Desert, the 5-2 second choice, is the most accomplished
member of the field. The 9-year-old gelding, who has won two in a row
for trainer Juan Garcia and owner Miguel Rubio, has taken 21 of 65 in
his career, banked nearly $1.75 million and has won six times on the
Hollywood Park turf course.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of other stakes being run around the country have a
California feel to them. Jockey David Flores will be at Belmont Park
to ride Janet for owner Jed Cohen and trainer Darrell Vienna in the
$250,000 New York Handicap, and Garrett Gomez and Jose Valdivia Jr.
will be at Churchill Downs to ride Morluc and Touch of the Blues,
respectively, in the $250,000 Firecracker Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Prized Friend, who has won four in a row for
Golden Eagle Farm and trainer Chuck Jenda, will try to keep the
streak going in Hollywood Park's fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: The field in today's $150,000 Tom Fool Handicap at
Belmont Park. The six runners, topped by Affirmed Success and Left
Bank, have combined to win 48 of 105 starts and earn well over $5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Shug McGaughey. The trainer began the week at Belmont
Park with three victories from 42 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Surprise Halo, Luna Joe and
Taormina in the seventh, using Shezasummerbreeze and Chastity Belle
in the eighth, singling Kappa King in the ninth and using Biker's Sis
and Larkwood in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/133. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$756.40. Total money bet: $874.</TE>

<HD>Castroneves' Victory Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Tracy's appeal to reverse order of top two
finishers in the Indianapolis 500 is rejected by George.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the surprise of few, Tony George announced Wednesday that Helio
Castroneves still was the winner of the Indianapolis 500, rejecting
an appeal by Team Green on behalf of its driver, Paul Tracy.</LD>
<LD>   Castroneves had been declared the winner several hours after the
race May 26, Indy Racing League officials ruling that Roger Penske's
driver had been leading when a yellow light was displayed after an
accident on Lap 199 of the 200-lap race.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy and his car owner, Barry Green, maintained that Tracy had
passed Castroneves for the lead before the caution light was
displayed. Passing is not allowed during caution periods and Tracy
was ordered back to second place.</LD>
<TE>   Green and Penske met with IRL officials during an all-day hearing
June 17 in an attempt to determine which car was leading at the
moment the yellow light appeared, Castroneves' No. 3 or Tracy's No.
26.</TE>
<TE>   George, president of the IRL, was the sole arbitrator in the
appeal, raising the likelihood that the 11-page decision will be met
with some skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if George had ruled Tracy the winner, it would have
been a slap in the face to Brian Barnhardt, George's vice president
of operations and chief steward of the 500, who had declared
Castroneves the winner on race day. And if Tracy, who drives in the
rival CART series--except for Indy--had been ruled the winner, that
would have deprived the IRL of having the reigning Indy 500 winner at
its other races.</TE>
<TE>   "To second-guess the officials, either for calling a yellow
caution flag or for their placement of the order of the cars, is not
allowed under the rules and for good reason," George said, citing
Rule 11.2 of the IRL rule book. "Judgment calls must be final, and
that is the only way to conduct a motorsports race."</TE>
<TE>   To which Green responded, "No one has proved to me that we
finished second and, frankly, if, as Tony says, everything comes down
to a judgment call and that call is not subject to appeal, then
what's the use in even having a rule book."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said: "I'm disappointed but, honestly, not terribly
surprised. My bank account may not show it, and my face may not be on
the Borg-Warner Trophy--yet--but in my heart I know I won the race."</TE>

<LD>Larry Walker and Bobby Estallela homered and drove in four runs each
as the Colorado Rockies defeated the San Francisco Giants, 14-4,
Wednesday night to avoid a sweep at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado won for only the second time in nine games and kept the
Giants from getting their first three-game sweep at Coors Field.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco lost for the third time in eight games and dropped
to 3-6 against Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado scored seven runs in the second off Livan Hernandez
(6-10), which came one game after the Giants scored eight in the
first in an 18-5 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Uribe, Brent Butler and Todd Zeile each had run-scoring
singles, and Estalella knocked in another with a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Walker had the big hit, a three-run homer to right, his 20th and
ninth in 16 games. It's the third time this season Walker has homered
in three consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Walker finished four for five and also made a basket catch with
his glove practically resting on his hip in the fifth. Jason Jennings
(9-4) avoided the first three-game losing streak of his career by
giving up four runs and eight hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Montreal 5--Javy Lopez hit an infield single off third
baseman Fernando Tatis' glove to score Vinny Castilla in the ninth
inning and give the Braves the victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves won their 12th consecutive series and stretched their
lead over second-place Montreal to 9 1/2 games in the National League
East.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 11, Cincinnati 4--Jeff Bagwell homered twice and drove in
five runs, and Craig Biggio had a two-run shot at Cincinnati to power
the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Oswalt (9-5) also had two singles and pitched six innings to
stay unbeaten against the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, San Diego 1--Rookie Jason Simontacchi won for the
third time in four starts and Tino Martinez hit a two-run home run as
the Cardinals completed a three-game sweep at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lawrence (7-5) gave up two runs in six innings and Ron Gant
homered for the Padres, who were swept for the seventh time.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Florida 2--Kerry Wood won for only the second time in
six starts and Fred McGriff homered for the second consecutive game
as the Cubs won at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Wood, who went 1-2 with two no-decisions in June, gave up two runs
and three hits in six innings to help the Cubs win for the second
time in nine games. Wood (8-5) struck out five and had a run-scoring
single.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Milwaukee 1--Brian Giles hit a two-run homer in the
first and Josh Fogg limited the Brewers to a run over six innings as
the Pirates won at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers did little against Fogg (9-6) and relievers Brian
Boehringer and Mike Williams, scoring only on Richie Sexson's
run-scoring triple in the sixth--his first RBI in 46 at-bats since
June 19.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Rollins' two-out, eighth-inning single helps
Philadelphia overcome Piazza and Mets, 8-7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Jimmy Rollins gave the fans a reason to come back to Veterans
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Rollins' run-scoring single with two out in the eighth inning
lifted the Philadelphia Phillies to an 8-7 victory over the New York
Mets before a crowd of 50,396 on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "The crowd reminded me of the late 1970s, early '80s," said
Manager Larry Bowa, a shortstop on the Phillies' 1980 championship
team. "To win it the way we did is incredible."</LD>
<TE>   Mike Piazza hit two three-run homers for the Mets, who lost for
the fifth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Strickland (6-5) retired the first two batters in the eighth
but left after Ricky Ledee doubled to left-center. Mark Guthrie
entered and Rollins lined his first pitch into center, scoring Ledee
to give the Phillies an 8-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Though most of the fans showed up to see fireworks after the game,
it was the type of victory that could get more people interested in
the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Plesac (2-1) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings, and Jose Mesa
worked the ninth, striking out Piazza with a runner on first for his
22nd save in 26 chances.</TE>
<TE>   After Piazza's second homer--he also homered in the sixth
inning--gave the Mets a 7-6 lead in the seventh, Bobby Abreu walked
to start the bottom of the inning against reliever Jaime Cerda.
Strickland entered, Abreu stole second and Burrell hit a double to
right-center that tied it at 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was the largest at the Vet since opening day when 50,942
came to see the Phillies after they finished in second place last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "To hear that noise is nice. It's not something you normally hear
at the Vet," Rollins said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States has the 11th-best national team in the world,
according to FIFA rankings released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   On the strength of its quarterfinal appearance at the World Cup,
the Americans moved up from 13th to equal their highest ranking ever.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil, which defeated Germany in the final to win the World Cup,
took over the top spot from France, which fell into a tie for second
place with Argentina. Spain rose from eighth to fourth, and Germany
climbed from 11th to fifth.</LD>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 among the world's 204 national teams were
Mexico, Portugal, England, Colombia and Italy. Turkey, which finished
third at the World Cup, is ranked 12th, while South Korea, which
finished fourth, moved from 40th to 22nd.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching Moves</TE>
<TE>   Former Brazil World Cup standout Zico is the early favorite to
take charge of Japan's national team, the Japanese Football Assn.
(JFA) said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The JFA's list of candidates also includes two Frenchmen--Aime
Jacquet, who coached France to its 1998 World Cup title, and Arsene
Wenger, currently coach of Arsenal in the English Premier League--as
well as former Mexico, Costa Rica, U.S., Nigeria and China coach Bora
Milutinovic.</TE>
<TE>   Zico, 49, who played on Brazil's 1982 and 1986 World Cup teams,
has lived in Japan for the last 11 years, playing for and later
successfully coaching the Kashima Antlers of the J-League.</TE>
<TE>   Spain appears to have settled upon its former youth team coach,
Inaki Saez, as the replacement for Jose Antonio Camacho, who resigned
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Saez, 59, played three times for Spain in the late 1960s, and the
Spanish Football Federation is expected to select him for at least a
caretaker role, if not a permanent one.</TE>
<TE>   Under Saez, Spain won the European under-21 championship in 1998
and the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   France could follow suit and name its under-21 coach, Raymond
Domenech, to replace Roger Lemerre if Lemerre is dismissed, as
expected, at a meeting of the French Football Assn. in Lyon on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jomo Sono said in Johannesburg, South Africa, that he
would resign today as South Africa's coach to take a post as head of
the South African Football Assn.'s technical committee, which
oversees the country's national teams.</TE>
<TE>   Sono, 46, said he would recommend that either assistant coach
Trott Moloto or under-23 coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba be named to
replace him.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Looks to Rebound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Major League Soccer season is at its midway point and the Galaxy,
a perennial league power, already finds itself nine points out of
first place.</LD>
<LD>   That happens when you lose five of your last seven games.</LD>
<LD>   That gives this week's series against the front-running San Jose
Earthquakes, which begins tonight at the Rose Bowl before moving
north for a Sunday night game, added significance for the Galaxy.</LD>
<TE>   Sweep the defending MLS Cup champion Earthquakes, who beat the
Galaxy in overtime in last year's title game, and the Galaxy puts
pressure on its Bay Area rivals. But get swept, and the Galaxy's
hopes of winning a division title are just about ruined.</TE>
<TE>   "These two games are vital for us to stay in the race for the
Western Division championship," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said
Wednesday after practice. "Last year we stayed in the race and caught
them in the end. We need these two games [to do the same]."</TE>
<TE>   Helping the Galaxy is the return of Cobi Jones, who is back
full-time with MLS after playing for the U.S. national team in the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are going to talk about how we have to have a
sweep, but it's a long season," Jones said. "We haven't even made it
to the All-Star game yet so there's a long way to go. There's no
reason to panic.</TE>
<TE>   "God forbid we go 0-2 [against San Jose], but that doesn't mean
we're out of it. Crazier things have happened in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who last suited up for the Galaxy on April 27, began the
season as the right midfielder. Schmid said, however, that he was
considering moving Jones to his more natural forward position to form
a more potent attack with high-scoring Carlos Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who led the league in goals (10) and points (20) for most of
the season, has not scored since June 1 and has fallen to fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, goals change games," Schmid said, "and we need to
score goals. We've had some chances ... we're just not cool enough
sometimes when we need to be in front of the goal."</TE>
<TE>   Save for the Galaxy's 5-0 loss to the New York/New Jersey Metro-
Stars on June 15, the defense has been playing well, shutting out
opponents in regulation in three of its last four games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been unlucky in that we've hit some teams that have ended
up playing their best games against us," Schmid said. "Part of it is
because they're up for Los Angeles and they're ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the end of the day, what makes things happen is goals.
Goals change things. We've got to score goals and we've got to take
advantage of our opportunities when we create them. I think that will
open up the game and change things very much for our team."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy leads the MLS in shots (229) and shots on goal (102)
but is tied with Columbus and Kansas City for seventh in goals (18).</TE>
<TE>   Jones expects to jump-start the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the plan," he said. "I mean, they all know me. Hopefully I
can give a little burst of energy and change things up.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully it starts great right off the bat. But it's going to
take a little time for everybody to get used to each other again and
settle our lineup a bit because we've had so many people playing
different positions all the time. But we have a lot of quality
players so I think we'll be all right."</TE>

<HD>Cycle of Success</HD>
<DH>Lance Armstrong's Tour de France titles, comeback from
cancer have helped him transcend sport</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most excruciating climbs in the Tour de France--steep, twisting
mountain roads that chew up car engines, let alone a cyclist's
legs--defy the sport's numerical rating system. They are simply
labeled hors categorie, or beyond categorization.</LD>
<LD>   As Lance Armstrong readies for his campaign to win a fourth
consecutive Tour, the same tag could be applied to him.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old Texan appears to be at the peak of his athletic
ability and has no clear-cut challenger in the 2,034-mile race, which
begins Saturday in Luxembourg. With success has come a certain
serenity. Armstrong, who leaves little to chance, said he has never
been so prepared.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel better than ever," Armstrong said of himself and his U.S.
Postal Service team. "I feel strong. I feel like I know what we're
about to do. I feel calmer tackling a three-week race."</TE>
<TE>   He is also riding high image-wise. Thanks to the public's
continuing reverence for the story of his comeback from testicular
cancer, Armstrong has become a cultural and marketing phenomenon even
though cycling still dwells in the margins of American sport.</TE>
<TE>   "You could not script that kind of greatness," said Nova Lanktree,
a matchmaker for athletes and corporate advertisers who is executive
vice president of Lanktree Sports in Skokie, Ill., a division of
CSMG.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has an annual income approaching $10 million, more than
half of which comes from endorsements. Corporations shell out
six-figure fees for the privilege of having him address their
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Lanktree called Armstrong's appeal to national and mainstream
advertisers "singularly amazing."</TE>
<TE>   "He's transcended the sport," she said. "I know it's a cliche, but
that's what he's done. I don't think I would have predicted that four
years ago. Everything about him invites affection and admiration."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong is in a category of his own, symbolically set off by the
Tour leader's yellow jersey. Everything he has touched since his
recovery has turned some shade of gold.</TE>
<TE>   Although his saga may seem mythical, friends say Armstrong stands
atop a pyramid constructed with consuming attention to detail. He is
selective and exacting about the way he trains, the commercial
opportunities he pursues, and the people he allows into his inner
circle, even as he continues to live a high-profile existence because
of his significance to cancer survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong is most comfortable in an untucked shirt and jeans,
rolling around with his kids or indulging in the occasional Mexican
meal washed down with a margarita or a beer.</TE>
<TE>   But he often displays a sort of flinty, game-day reserve in
public, saving the best of his dry wit for his buddies, his
compassion and charm for his cancer work and his slap-happy moments
for his family.</TE>
<TE>   He may never have the commercial clout of a Tiger Woods or a
Michael Jordan, which suits him fine.</TE>
<TE>   "He's at least as famous as he wants to be," said ESPN's Chris
Fowler, who met the defending Tour champion when Armstrong was a
16-year-old triathlete and has remained close to him.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a unique aspect to his celebrity, and it's a tough burden
to carry sometimes," Fowler said. "Cancer survivors want him to hear
their testimonials. They want him to look them in the eye and tell
them things are going to be all right. Given that, I think he's made
wise choices. The last thing he wants to be seen as is exploitative."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's foundation devoted to research and support for cancer
survivors is growing exponentially. Contributions have doubled in
each of the last two years, reaching $9 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   His family is thriving. Armstrong and his wife, Kristin, have
7-month-old twin daughters, Isabelle and Grace, and a toddler son,
Luke, all conceived through in-vitro fertilization. The couple is
building a ranch on land they purchased outside his home base of
Austin, Texas. They have named the property Milagro, the Spanish word
for miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Single when he received his grim prognosis six years ago,
Armstrong banked his sperm when he was advised that treatment
probably would render him sterile.</TE>
<TE>   The episode is one of many recounted in his autobiography, which
has sold 500,000 copies and is considered doctrine by numerous cancer
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected to sell about 10 copies," Armstrong said. "I had a
great time doing it and I put down my life story truthfully and
honestly. For me that was enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I never considered myself anything different or anything special.
As I've said many times, I did what I had to do to come back to the
job and the sport and try to be the best."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that he made it--and that his showcase event, unlike the
Olympics, takes place annually--has kept his marketability high.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to be careful," Armstrong said. "This all gets so cheesy
when you start talking about brands and strategies and tactics."</TE>
<TE>   But there is no denying the punch his name packs. When Coca-Cola
made Armstrong the promotional face of the 2002 Winter Olympic torch
relay, nominations for torch runners soared over the numbers from the
1996 Atlanta Games, partly because of the ease of e-mail submissions,
but mostly because of Armstrong, according to Coca-Cola spokesman
Scott Williamson.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., the firm that developed the drugs used
in Armstrong's cancer treatment, has featured him and his family in
print and TV advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten a very strong positive response to the campaign, and
also to the association with Lance and his personal experience,"
Executive Vice President Don Hayden said. "To this day, he says he is
who he is because he's a cancer survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton, said he strives to give
Armstrong an "elegant" silhouette that is not at odds with his
stature in the cancer community.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kept Lance away from bobble-head dolls," said Stapleton,
who concedes neither he nor anyone else was fully prepared for the
opportunities that opened up after Armstrong's first Tour victory in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't market him as a cancer survivor," Stapleton said. "We
market him as a courageous American who has overcome something
everyone can relate to. Everyone's trying to overcome something. He's
not Everyman, but people feel as if they own a piece of Lance."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's odyssey has made him a subject of some awe even among
other elite athletes.</TE>
<TE>   In her autobiography published late last year, Olympic skiing star
Picabo Street described meeting Armstrong at an awards dinner when
she was struggling with an injury-triggered depression.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted that night was to shake Lance's hand, to feel some
of his healing energy flow into me," Street wrote.</TE>
<TE>   As Olympic speedskating gold medalist Chris Witty wryly observed
at Armstrong's annual Ride for the Roses benefit weekend in April:
"Celebrities follow him around."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong moves comfortably in circles far removed from his modest
upbringing in the Dallas suburb of Plano, or even from his days as a
brazen young world champion nearly a decade ago, when few outside the
insular sport of road cycling had heard of him.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Williams calls him "Bro." Alternative-country music star
Lyle Lovett played at a private party Armstrong threw last fall to
mark the five years since his cancer diagnosis, and took him off-road
motorcycling in Baja California last winter.</TE>
<TE>   When Armstrong was training in California early this year, he
stayed at the home of actor Kevin Costner.</TE>
<TE>   In February he attended the opening ceremony of the Salt Lake City
Winter Olympics with President Bush and a select group of
dignitaries. Former Baltimore Oriole star Cal Ripken was the only
other sports figure to make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's coach for 12 years, said Armstrong
is savoring the ride without getting hooked on jet-set adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   "His perspective is, 'I'm going to enjoy this, but it could be
gone tomorrow. Live with it, enjoy it and that's that,' " Carmichael
said.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to training, Armstrong, who manages much of his own
stock portfolio, micromanages his regimen and equipment needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Among other things, Lance is very smart," said his friend Jeff
Garvey, a retired venture capitalist who runs Armstrong's foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "He can read a balance sheet. He can read an income statement. His
training is just like somebody who's going to start up a company who
has to do the following 50 things in the following order with the
following intensity.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes a business approach. He understands what trade-offs are
all about. He likes to party in the off-season, but he's moderate
about everything he does in that regard. He rides a bike every day.
He knows that he wins the Tour de France in the winter, by virtue of
what he does from October to February."</TE>
<TE>   On most training days, Armstrong straps a heart monitor around his
chest and carries a small computer on his handlebars. The two devices
collect information about his heart rate, pedaling cadence, speed,
distance covered and energy expended. After his workout, he e-mails
the data to Carmichael for analysis.</TE>
<TE>   He is as demanding with regard to his gear as he is with his body.
Last month he requested a design change that reduced the weight of
his new handlebars by half.</TE>
<TE>   "Lance is a very rare athlete," Carmichael said. "He's not looking
to win. That's not his driving force. He's looking to do it better
than he did it before."</TE>
<TE>   This season Armstrong has continued his training practice of
previewing Tour stages to commit the terrain to memory. He rode a
busy schedule this spring and won two tuneup races in France.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has fought for his reputation in a sport infested with
performance-enhancing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   He never has tested positive and continues to defend his
consulting relationship with the controversial Italian sports
scientist Michele Ferrari, who has been accused of administering
banned drugs to elite athletes.</TE>
<TE>   French legal authorities have announced imminent plans to close an
unrelated investigation into Armstrong and his team that has
stagnated for the better part of two years. Frustrated by the fact
that the inquiry formally remains open, Armstrong recently posted his
feelings on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider this issue dead," he wrote. "It is without merit and I
will no longer pay attention to it. My steadfast focus is on the
upcoming Tour de France."</TE>
<TE>   Congenitally restless, Armstrong sometimes marvels at the fact
that he has held the same job this long.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves what he does," said Johan Bruyneel, the no-nonsense
former professional rider from Belgium who has guided the
Armstrong-led Postal Service team to three consecutive titles.
"That's what it takes if you're at such a high level and under
pressure and constantly planning commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong agreed, saying the actual sensation of riding is the
same despite of the upheaval in his lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you break it all down, and said, 'OK here's the guy, here's
the bike, does he like it, does he feel the same on it, does he
suffer the same on it,' that's all the same," said Armstrong, who
would become the fifth man to win four or more Tours if he prevails
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The days that I'm on the bike are like when I was 13," he added,
recalling rides with his boyhood friend and current teammate Chann
McRae. "We run fewer red lights, but it's the same. We used to run
all the red lights.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to draw a graph, there's been no decline in my
interest or my motivation or my love for the bike or training. I
can't think of any reason to stop right now."</TE>
