<HD>Thousands brave cold in New York for 'Idol' audition</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Five thousand seekers of fame and fortune camped out on Wall Street
Thursday morning and braved temperatures in the '30s for a chance to
appear on the second edition of the Fox television show "American
Idol."</LD>
<LD>   The producers held a cattle call at the Regent Wall Street Hotel,
and would-be songbirds and belters began to line up Tuesday morning
for a chance to follow in the footsteps of the first "Idol" champion,
ex-cocktail waitress Kelly Clarkson.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Roberts, 22, came to New York City from Bowie, Md., on
Tuesday and received a wristband that held a spot in the auditions.
He said he would wow the judges with a rendition of Elton John's
"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me."</LD>
<TE>   Visions of fat royalty checks aren't Robert's chief motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to sing professionally, that's it," he said. "Sure, the
money would be a perk."</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson, a 20-year-old Texan, received a $1-million recording
contract and is now on a nationwide tour with other "Idol" finalists.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Guarini, who placed second on "Idol," began with a New York
tryout last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Idol" senior producer David Goffin said the first 1,800 wannabes,
ages 16 to 24, were given wristbands for tryouts Thursday, today and
Saturday. More than 3,000 were turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 1,800 will be selected to meet with producers on
Sunday, Goffin said, and if they pass muster, will show their talent
to judges Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson and Simon Cowell on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The next "Idol" installment will begin on Fox at the end of
January.</TE>

<HD>Woe is high and wide in glum 'All or Nothing'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "All or Nothing" Mike Leigh returns to a familiar working-class
world following his splendiferous Gilbert &amp; Sullivan bio,
"Topsy-Turvy."</LD>
<LD>   "All or Nothing," arguably the bleakest film of his career, is a
tough go, but Leigh's depth and rigor, and his skill at inspiring
accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their
lack of showiness, offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined
and despairing milieu.</LD>
<LD>   Set over a long weekend in the lives of a family of four and some
of their neighbors in a rundown South London housing project, "All or
Nothing" deals with largely drab people living drab lives in drab
circumstances with little or no hope of escape.</LD>
<TE>   Timothy Spall's Phil is an unhandsome, unshaven, overweight,
middle-aged cab driver cursed with a greater degree of awareness and
vulnerability than most others in his environment.His common-law wife
Penny (Lesley Manville), a trim supermarket cashier, has become
absorbed in the demands of just getting by.</TE>
<TE>   Their daughter is the pretty but overly plump and withdrawn Rachel
(Alison Garland), who is resigned to a routine existence as a
retirement-home cleaning woman. She quietly performs acts of kindness
at home and at work and loses herself in books.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger brother Rory (James Corden) is another matter, a
seriously overweight layabout who is loud, crude and hostile.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, an incident jolts the family out of its deepening rut,
and what surfaces reveals Spall's -- who made a similar impression in
"Intimacy" -- and Manville's formidable resources as actors and
Leigh's skill and subtlety in drawing them out.</TE>
<TE>   It is at this point that "All or Nothing" breaks through a British
lower-class grimness so unrelenting as to verge on parody. While it's
true that this moment perhaps smacks of wishful thinking and
undeniable theatricality, there's also no telling how deep or
enduring its impact upon the family will be over time.</TE>
<TE>   Leigh piles up woe wider and higher than ever before. That he has
done so with his usual skill, perception and alertness to relieving
gestures of human tenderness and care does not keep "All or Nothing"
from being a pretty glum, overly familiar business.</TE>

<LD>Executioner's Current</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the
Electric Chair</LD>
<LD>   Richard Moran</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 276 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Executioner's Current" is a timely book. The United States is in
one of its recurring reexaminations of the death penalty. Illinois
has put a moratorium on executions as it inquires into the fairness
and justice of death as a punishment for crime. The extensive new use
of human DNA as an indicator of guilt or innocence has raised
questions about the awful finality of killing convicted criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Now most states have replaced electrocution with lethal injection
as the preferred method of killing criminals. Richard Moran's
well-sustained thesis is that "every so-called advance in the means
of execution has been in response to a rise in opposition to the
death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   So it has been, he argues, with the adoption of lethal injection.
So it was, he demonstrates, when more than 100 years ago
electrocution widely and rapidly replaced hanging.</TE>
<TE>   Moran, a professor of sociology at Mount Holyoke College and
author of "Knowing Right From Wrong: The Insanity Defense of Daniel
McNaughtan," lucidly tells the fascinating story of the arrival of
electrocution on the American scene. Its most powerful proponent was
none other than the premier American inventor Thomas Edison. Edison's
motives were not only as he claimed, to replace hanging with
something more humane, but also to discredit his archrival in the
generation and distribution of electricity, George Westinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1880s Edison had already invented the phonograph and
the lightbulb and was deeply into the distribution of electricity for
the illumination of cities. His preferred method was by direct
current. Westinghouse, though, was demonstrating that alternating
current was easier and cheaper, and Westinghouse's corporation was
overtaking Edison's in public favor.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the New York Legislature in 1886 established a
commission under Elbridge T. Gerry, grandson of a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, to inquire into the best method of
execution. Hanging was falling into disrepute, both because it was
too often botched -- some victims choked slowly to death, others'
heads were ripped off -- and because of the recent memory of very
public hangings conducted in full view of an often boisterous or
drunken crowd.</TE>
<TE>   As the Gerry Commission met, public resistance to the death
penalty was rising; the New York Legislature very nearly passed a
prohibition. Edison, though in principle opposed to the death
penalty, mounted a campaign in favor of electrocution -- but only
with Westinghouse's alternating current. Moran conclusively shows
that Edison hoped to discredit alternating current -- by associating
it in the public mind with death -- and advance his own direct
current.</TE>
<TE>   The commission supported electrocution and the Legislature
approved. Now New York needed only a human subject. The lot fell to
William Kemmler, an illiterate and habitually drunken Buffalo
huckster who with a hatchet killed his faithless girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to stop the project, which would use secondhand
Westinghouse dynamos, Westinghouse made sure Kemmler had powerful New
York lawyers. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,
which in the end upheld a lower court's decision that while death by
electrocution was unusual, it was not cruel, a finding that stands to
this day.</TE>
<TE>   Kemmler, Moran writes, was the only person in the drama of his
death on Aug. 6, 1890, who was not "diminished" by the ordeal;
"indeed, he seemed elevated by it." During his 18 months on death
row, he learned to read and sign his name, he studied the Bible with
the warden's wife, gave up tobacco "and made peace with his Maker."</TE>
<TE>   Kemmler believed his death would be peaceful and painless. It
wasn't. After the first jolt, he began to breathe again. Another
longer jolt left him obviously dead, but charred and smoking.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,300 convicted criminals were killed by electrocution in
the United States in the 20th century, according to Moran. He thinks
it likely no more will be, now that lethal injection is more
generally accepted. But what about it?</TE>
<TE>   No method of execution, Moran writes, "can ever be considered
humane." Our ambivalent feelings about the death penalty have led us
to put it further and further away from our sight as we console
ourselves that it is somehow not painful, not violent, when really it
always is.</TE>

<HD>A new term and office for 'Candidate'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three decades after Robert Redford's character Bill McKay won a seat
in the U.S. Senate and pleaded, "Now what?" Warner Bros. says it will
make a sequel to the 1972 film "The Candidate."</LD>
<LD>   Redford, 65, will produce and direct the sequel, as well as star
as McKay, now an experienced senator running for president.</LD>
<LD>   But Larry Gelbart, who will write the sequel, said McKay will not
be "used" to promote either his or Redford's activism on behalf of
Democrats or environmentalists. "We're not looking at it as a
platform for espousing our common political ideology," Gelbart said
Thursday. The original screenplay was written by Jeremy Larner.</LD>
<TE>   Gelbart said they hope to begin filming next fall or winter,
although as of this week they only have a "basis of a script" that
will focus on legislation, politics and personal growth. The
screenplay will also touch on power and all its trappings.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the only president who didn't have any sex appeal was
Woodrow Wilson after he had his stroke. That office does make women
swoon, some men too. Age is no handicap. It's the office that's such
an aphrodisiac," Gelbart said. "This movie is not about being sexy.
It's about the sexiness of politics. There are opportunities to
introduce the element of sex and the sexual appeal of a president,
but it won't be a major part of this motion picture."</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. says the film will be produced through Wildwood
Enterprises, Redford's production company that has a development deal
with the studio.</TE>

<HD>A chilling case against Kissinger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bluntly effective documentary "The Trials of Henry Kissinger"
takes as its point of departure the question posed by journalist
Christopher Hitchens in his identically titled book: Is the former
secretary of state and onetime national security advisor also a war
criminal? To answer that question, directors Alex Gibney and Eugene
Jarecki trace the Nobel laureate's evolution from German war refugee
to prime-time celebrity in the Nixon White House, where he became pop
media catnip ("Kissinger the swinger") even as he helped author some
of the most devastating chapters in recent history, including the
illegal bombing of Cambodia.</LD>
<TE>   Produced by the BBC and narrated by actor Brian Cox, the
documentary takes a confidently non-polemical approach to its
subject. Deploying a seamless blend of talking-head interviews,
trenchant archival photographs and newsreels, topped off by a sheaf
of newly declassified U.S. government documents, Gibney and Jarecki
are smart enough to let the evidence and experts do the talking. They
eschew hysterics to present a case against Kissinger that seems solid
enough for court, which is exactly where the elder statesman's
detractors would like to see him. Although the weight of evidence
here swings against Kissinger -- as do some usual suspects, such as
Pacifica Radio host Amy Goodman -- a wealth of analysis and testimony
from other, less obviously partisan sources proves even more damning.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most chilling accounts are those provided by a U.S.
military attache who hid money in his boots during the
CIA-implemented plan to assassinate a Chilean general, a supporter of
the country's democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, and
a U.S. ambassador who sat in a room with Kissinger and President Ford
as Indonesian leaders discussed their plans for East Timor, a bloody
adventure executed with U.S. materiel. If the tragedy of the whole
thing doesn't get you, perhaps the comedy will, be it a savagely
funny clip from an old "Saturday Night Live" sketch or the sight of
Alexander Haig fulminating against Hitchens.</TE>

atrocity footage. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes. Exclusively at

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's hope -- shall we? -- that the "true story" that allegedly
"inspired" "All the Queen's Men" was a lot funnier and more deftly
enacted than what's been cobbled together here. This anachronistic
throwback to the World War II espionage thrillers that flourished in
the 1960s could even have survived its cheap cross-dressing jokes if
director Stefan Ruzowitsky knew how to orchestrate a simple chase
scene like the clumsy tango of tanks that opens the film.</LD>
<LD>   One of those tanks is driven by American OSS agent Steven O'Rourke
(Matt LeBlanc), a 1990s-style self-starter in 1940s-Army khaki, who
has swiped a Nazi code machine (the legendary "Enigma" device) from
under the Germans' noses. The recovery is ruined by an anal-retentive
British officer whom O'Rourke promptly bites on the leg. Off to the
hoosegow, until another British officer (Edward Fox) recruits
O'Rourke for another behind-the-lines attempt at stealing the
machine. The catch this time is that O'Rourke and his team must all
wear dresses, wigs and makeup, since only women work in the factories
that make the machines. Worse yet, O'Rourke has a motley crew to
accompany him, including a sweet old desk sergeant (James Cosmo), a
callow young encryption expert (David Birkin) and a canny veteran
commando (Eddie Izzard), ostracized for his penchant for performing
in drag.</LD>
<TE>   Ernst Lubitsch or Billy Wilder could have done quite a bit with
this misfit crew, of which LeBlanc, for all his determined buoyancy,
seems the most out of place. His lead-footed bluster is all too
emblematic of the movie's weaknesses.</TE>

<HD>In 'Ghost Ship,' gore mixes with seawater</HD>

<LD>See evil. See evil run. Run, evil, run all the way to cable
television purgatory.</LD>
<LD>   Recently returned from a six-month gig, the crew of an Anchorage
salvage boat is hired by a young airplane pilot (Desmond Harrington)
to tug in an ocean liner that he's sighted adrift in the Bering Sea.
Some 40 years earlier luxurious Italian ship the Antonia Graza had
disappeared. What we know (but the tug crew doesn't) is that the
ship's passengers had been systematically murdered in an interlude of
such grisly extravagance that director Steve Beck, whose first
feature was "Thirteen Ghosts," stages the massacre not once but
twice, as if to ensure that we savor each fatal blow. Beck has a way
with severed body parts -- he snaps a mean wire cable -- but there's
so little substance to Mark Hanlon and John Pogue's screenplay, which
is as vaporous as the story's restless phantoms and considerably less
engaging, that all he can do is pour on the blood.</LD>
<TE>   With its minor shivers and modest Grand Guignol showmanship,
"Ghost Ship" is the sort of flimflam that would have filled eight
paneled pages in the great horror comic book "Tales From the Crypt"
or consumed about 30 minutes on the latter-day HBO spinoff. Two of
that show's original producers, action auteur Joel Silver and
director Robert Zemeckis, also co-produced this film (they were
executive producers on "Thirteen Ghosts"), and it's too bad that
neither they nor their director put a fraction of the effort tending
to niceties of character development that they did to the nastiness
of character annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the familiar faces that help pass the time are Julianna
Margulies, squaring her jaw with Sigourney Weaver fortitude, Ron
Eldard, Isaiah Washington and Gabriel Byrne. None is called on to do
much, and all comply accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "Ghost Ship": Rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and
sexuality. Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes. In general release.</TE>

<HD>Murk and mayhem in 'Lost Souls'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a meandering, hard-to-follow plot, Takashi Miike's "The City
of Lost Souls" at least is more fun than his bizarre satire "The
Happiness of the Katakuris."</LD>
<LD>   A lurid, violent thriller, "City" opens promisingly. Mario (Teah),
a half-Japanese, half-Brazilian Tokyo underworld warrior who favors
long black leather coats and shotguns, pulls off a rescue by
helicopter of his about-to-be-deported Chinese girlfriend, Kei
(Michele Reis). Unfortunately, the plot abruptly veers in several
directions, and the murk never fully clears up until the final
moments. There's enough atmosphere, mayhem and just plain energy to
make the film a viable midnight movie, a more appropriate slot than a
regular run. Teah has an exotic, volatile presence that lends the
film a sharp edge.</LD>
<LD>   "The City of Lost Souls": Unrated. Standard yakuza violence, sex,
drugs and language. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. Exclusively at
the Fairfax Cinemas. In Japanese, Portuguese, Mandarin, Cantonese,
English and Russian, with English subtitles.</LD>

<HD>Holocaust history from Shanghai</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the world of German Jews fell apart in the late 1930s, with
once-secure citizens desperate to flee Nazi persecution, only one
unlikely place would accept them without visas: a
couldn't-be-less-European city some 8,000 miles away. "Shanghai
Ghetto" is a serious and thoughtful documentary look at how some
20,000 European Jews, first from Germany and then from Eastern
Europe, came to call the commercial center of China home for the
duration of the war.</LD>
<LD>   Using archival footage, historians' comments, moving interviews
with articulate survivors, and clandestine footage of those now-aged
refugees returning to Shanghai, filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann
(whose father is one of those interviewed) and Amir Mann explore one
of the lesser-known corners of Holocaust history.</LD>
<TE>   Several accidents of fate made it possible for Shanghai to serve
as a refuge, chief among them the fact that it was conquered by Japan
in 1937, leading to a complex situation in which no country was
responsible for checking new arrivals for visas. Once in Shanghai,
the Jews in their heavy European clothing found themselves in a
completely alien environment where "the streets smelled not like
Chanel No. 5." Still, helped by the Chinese, they were able to create
a self-sufficient society, complete with cafes, sports clubs and
newspapers, that lasted until the Japanese confined them to an actual
ghetto as the war with the U.S. intensified.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest shock of all for these people, however, came when the
conflict ended. "They concentrated on the misery of life in
Shanghai," one historian says, only to find out "they were living in
paradise compared to what happened to their brethren in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai Ghetto": Unrated. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes.
Exclusively at the Music Hall, Beverly Hills; Fallbrook 7, West
Hills.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of a mistress awakening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his elegant "Looking Through Lillian," director Jake Torem swiftly
moves beyond familiar first-feature artiness to create an
illuminating portrait of a young woman (Jade Henham) brought to a
crossroads in her life.</LD>
<LD>   Lillian has settled for a luxurious but empty existence as the
mistress of Gene (Sam Bottoms), a hard-driving, successful, married
businessman. In return for being able to afford a tasteful apartment
and a fabulous wardrobe and lifestyle, Lillian must be available to
the busy Gene at precise times and must cater to his particular
sexual quirk. In Gene it inspires shame and in Lillian suppressed
disgust; they've learned that things go better with coke.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Lillian is beginning to yearn for more from life and to feel
like "a cripple with an invisible crutch." When Lillian meets Luke
(Robert Glen Keith), a handsome, low-key freelance writer, he
provides her with a fresh perspective, which is further encouraged by
her straight-shooting pal Andrea (Essence Atkins).</LD>
<TE>   Lillian's awakening, beautifully portrayed by Henham, who wrote
the film with Torem, takes some surprising turns, all the more
satisfying for their realism. Henham's portrayal is well matched by
those of Bottoms and Keith in depth and focus. "Looking Through
Lillian" also benefits strongly from Glen Ade Brown's gleaming
cinematography and its inspired use of music.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking Through Lillian": Unrated. Mature, adult themes, some
strong sexual scenes. Running time: 1 hour, 22 minutes. Exclusively
at the Fairfax Cinemas.</TE>

<HD>'Reno' exhausts a mine of cliches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The one thing that can be said of "Waking Up in Reno" is that it's
rigorously consistent. Every note rings false, for writers Brent
Briscoe and Mark Fauser have overlooked no stereotypes or cliches of
small-town blue-collar speech, behavior or tastes. Because they have
not drawn from life but from a zillion other contemporary middle
Americana movies and TV shows, their characters are so many times
removed from reality that it is hard to blame director Jordan Brady
for relentlessly condescending to their characters and plot. (This
picture is way too heavy-handed to pass for satire.)</LD>
<LD>   "Waking Up in Reno" was written by Briscoe and Fauser, scribes on
the "Hearts Afire" series in which Billy Bob Thornton starred, in
response to his expressed longing to act in a "redneck romantic
comedy" -- Thornton's phrase -- that he had never found time to write
himself. Apparently it was Thornton's stature that attracted his
co-stars.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, Darlene (Natasha Richardson) and Lonnie Earl Dodd
(Thornton), and Candy (Charlize Theron) and Roy Kirkendall (Patrick
Swayze), two couples from Arkansas, take off for a monster truck show
in Reno. Both marriages are a bit shaky, and the vacation will
predictably bring the fissures in the relationships to the surface.
"Waking Up in Reno," however, provides no reason to care how it turns
out.</LD>
<TE>   "Waking Up in Reno": Rated R for language and sexual content.
Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. At selected theaters.</TE>

<HD>Three dealers' grim descent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jan Stuart</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three young men sit around a small empire of Chinese takeout
boxes, blithely tossing wads of cash onto the table like so much
Monopoly money. With this kind of dough, they could buy the
restaurant they've just ordered from. But why settle for another
Chinese food joint when you can have black Saab convertibles, gold
pendants and the unalloyed devotion of every crack cocaine addict in
the neighborhood?</LD>
<LD>   File this little Kodak moment away in your memory, because it is
one of the few oases of communal peace in "Paid in Full," a grim,
road-to-perdition journey through the drug trade of 1980s Harlem. In
a short while, these three amigos will pull the rug out from one
another with a brutality that strikes us as a very high price to pay
for a jazzy car and a carton of spareribs. And that's the point.
Based on the exploits of A.Z., Alpo and Richard Porter, a trio of
young drug traders who have been mythologized by rap-artist
contemporaries, Charles Stone III's muscular directing debut reads
like a warning salvo aimed at anyone with misbegotten dreams of
living large in Drugville.</LD>
<TE>   "Paid in Full" is nothing if not stylish and authentic, but we're
not always sure why we are watching it. Although it has all the moral
underpinnings of the genre (there is a nod to Brian DePalma's
"Scarface"), it neglects to make us care for two of its notorious
trio. Actors Mekhi Phifer and Rico Cam'ron lend shape and intensity
to their characters, Mitchell and Rico, but they come off as
supporting players in the downfall of Harlem teenager Ace (Wood
Harris, in a quietly commanding performance).</TE>
<TE>   "Paid in Full" is a freefall into urban hell that doesn't give us
the impetus to jump or the awful gratification of the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "Paid in Full": Rating: R for violence, pervasive language, some
strong sexuality and drug content. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.
In general release.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's National Symphony dazzles under a sure baton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outrageously active on the podium, Enrique Arturo Diemecke turns his
body into a living description of musical motion. He bends his knees,
swivels his hips, swings from side to side, crouches lion-like, then
pounces. He is a picture of concentrated conductorial energy, proud
and precise, never frenzied.</LD>
<LD>   His orchestra responds with its full resources. It plays
splendidly -- for all the excitement emanating from the podium and
occupying the stage, one is aware at all times of abundant control
and discipline. In size, Diemecke may be a bantamweight, but in
substance, he is a heavyweight.</LD>
<LD>   His orchestra this week, and through a U.S. tour ending Nov. 9, is
the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, which Diemecke has headed
since 1990 (his other orchestral post, since 2001, has been as music
director of the Long Beach Symphony). At the Orange County Performing
Arts Center's Segerstrom Hall on Wednesday night, it was
enthusiastically received.</LD>
<TE>   A showy program had something to do with that reception, but high
musical accomplishment also explains it. This is a well-endowed and
balanced ensemble, strong in all choirs and solo voices -- the horn
section is particularly dazzling -- and tight in its musical
responses to Diemecke's detailed leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The climax came in Silvestre Revueltas' "La Noche de los Mayas,"
the suite compiled from the composer's film score of 1939 by Jose
Limantour. The colorful work allowed these players to display the
full panoply of their instrumental resources, from furious
note-gathering to extended whispering melodic arches. Among other
distinctive elements, one had to admire the controlled efforts of the
10-member percussion section in the heart-stopping final movement.</TE>
<TE>   The entire evening was like that, from its opening in Astor
Piazzolla's haunting and vibrant "Tangazo" through the familiar
complexities of Leonard Bernstein's Symphonic Dances from "West Side
Story."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, the audience demanded, and got, three encores.</TE>

<HD>These days, two 'War of the Worlds' may be scarier than one</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy was bad, war loomed on the horizon, and Orson Welles
thought the nation could use the distraction of a good scary story, a
Halloween fiction that terrorized thousands who took it as fact.</LD>
<LD>   Now, 64 years later, talk-radio host Glenn Beck sees a similar
environment, and so is breathing new life into "The War of the
Worlds," Welles' adapted radio play of a Martian invasion.</LD>
<LD>   "The lesson is very parallel to what we're going through now, and
the wake-up call we heard on Sept. 11. It's the whole lesson that
you're not in control of everything," said Beck, who will stage the
play live on Wednesday. KLAC-AM (570) is carrying it locally, from 5
to 6 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Beck, whose morning program airs on more than 100 stations
nationwide, including ones in San Diego, Palm Springs and
Bakersfield, will join a cast of a dozen actors, a live orchestra and
foley artists creating the sound effects in a performance hall at the
Washington, D.C., studios of XM satellite radio, which is also
carrying the broadcast -- a re-creation of the original performance.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 30, 1938, Welles and his players from the Mercury Theatre
of the Air updated the story by British science-fiction writer H.G.
Wells, and had the Martians begin their world domination by landing
in Grover's Mill, N.J. Making the most of his medium, Welles
presented the story as news bulletins interrupting music programming,
and listeners who missed the announcements that it was merely a radio
play fled in panic, sure that the Martians' tripod machines would be
marching up their streets soon, blasting their homes with deadly heat
rays.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Great Depression still gripped America, and
Adolph Hitler was only months away from starting World War II. Now
the economy is faltering, Saddam Hussein is a target, and Beck noted
the parallels by referring to Welles' original introduction to the
program: "With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the
Earth about their little affairs.... [Yet] intellects vast, cool and
unsympathetic regarded this Earth with envious eyes and slowly and
surely drew their plans against us."</TE>
<TE>   "The Martians are Al Qaeda. It's foreign invaders. Nobody really
thought at the time this could really happen," Beck said. "We now
know that we have been studied, and we have been scrutinized."</TE>
<TE>   Like any good scary story, with the requisite dose of "what if?"
to tingle the hairs on the back of the neck, "War of the Worlds"
would simply not have been as effective during the carefree dot-com
boom of the late '90s, Beck contends.</TE>
<TE>   But over at KNX-AM (1070), Welles' original broadcast is being
aired in the spirit he said he intended: "The Mercury Theatre's own
radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and
saying 'Boo!' "</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things that are classics, and this is a
classic," said George Nicholaw, vice president and general manager of
KNX, which is airing the program Thursday from 9 to 10 p.m. (repeated
at 2 a.m. Friday), continuing a Halloween tradition now in its third
decade. "We said, 'Gee, it's Halloween. Let's scare the world.' The
response was so positive, it became an annual thing."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars argue that anxiety over the days' headlines contributed
to the panic among those who heard the program in 1938. With
saturation coverage from all-news channels on radio and television,
Nicholaw said he doubted a similar broadcast could generate such
hysteria today. "Information is presented on a minute-by-minute
basis," he said. "People are much more aware of what's going on in
the world now than they were at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Beck said the story would need a plot change, such as a smallpox
outbreak, to create a similar sensation today. Even then, a flip of
the dial would debunk the tale.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholaw said he's skeptical, though, about using the story as a
metaphor for contemporary events.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stretching it a little bit, but then again, when the title
is 'The War of the Worlds,' and we're in a period of time when
there's global concern for terrorists, there may be a connection,"
Nicholaw said. "But it is a stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Beck said he intends his program as entertainment and doesn't want
to weigh it down with any heavy message. But if there is anything
listeners could take away from the show, he hopes that in a
post-Sept. 11 world, they see a reflection of themselves in the
show's characters -- heedlessly going about their lives, then jerked
by the unexpected into appreciation of what's dangerous and what's
precious.</TE>

<HD>A portrait of 'Frida' that's all in the framing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The artist Frida Kahlo was famous for a lot of things -- her glorious
paintings, her grotesque pain, her numerous love affairs, even her
unruly eyebrows, which hovered above her piercing dark eyes like a
bird in flight. The eyebrows, or rather the single formidable eyebrow
she pruned into a thick bold line, are what you first notice when you
look at many of Kahlo's self-portraits, especially the less floridly
expressive paintings, the ones without the hovering fetuses and the
swirling phantasmagoric symbolism. Looking at those majestically
aloft eyebrows, you get the sense that even when her body was held
hostage by infirmity, as it was for long stretches of her difficult
life, Kahlo wanted the world to know that part of her was free.</LD>
<TE>   To play the part of Kahlo in "Frida," Julie Taymor's prosaic new
film about the artist, the young actress Salma Hayek has put aside
her tweezers and daubed on a few prosthetic hairs. Instead of a
flying bird, the effect is of a pair of wings that wouldn't make it
through a strong breeze much less the storm that was Kahlo's life.
The resemblance to the artist is cosmetically faithful, as is the
case with much of this meticulously mounted, exasperatingly
well-behaved film, which ticks off Kahlo's lifetime milestones with
the dutiful precision of a tax accountant. But it fails to get at the
ferocity of the artist and her artifice, to get at the core of a
woman who painted a self-portrait in which she gives birth to her
adult self, as if she were both Zeus and Diana.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by multiple infirmities that confined her alternately to a
wheelchair and to her sickbed, Kahlo spent days, at times years,
immobilized with little company other than her reflection. In 1925,
at the age of 18, she was involved in a calamitous, near-fatal
accident when an electric trolley car plowed into the bus she was
riding. Among her injuries were a broken collarbone, two broken ribs
and 11 fractures to her right leg; her spinal column was broken in
three places in the lower part of her back and her right foot was
pulverized. The metal handrail that pierced her pelvis, breaking it
in three areas, exited through her vagina, leaving her incapable of
carrying a child to term.</TE>
<TE>   The accident -- and some 32 operations and countless surgical
appliances she endured in its wake -- seem too much for anyone to
bear, but Kahlo bore it, often with wicked humor. It was one of the
two defining moments of her life, happening not long after she first
met her future husband -- and other defining moment -- Diego Rivera
(Alfred Molina), painting a mural on the wall of her preparatory
school. In the film the two events seem almost mystically connected
since shortly after encountering Rivera, Kahlo and her first serious
boyfriend, Alejandro (Diego Luna), are seen riding the bus, the air
filled with the everyday noise of Mexico City and the young man's
chatter about Hegel and Marx. Frida doesn't seem to be listening but
is instead focusing on the vividly hued bluebird in the possession of
one of the other riders and by a sack of gold dust in the hands of
another.</TE>
<TE>   Then the world upends: Bodies sail through the air and Kahlo lands
in an exquisitely art-directed tableaux, her nakedness discreetly
obscured by torn clothes, her flesh covered with gold dust and blood.
It's a beautiful image -- the moment of impact as an aesthetic
revelation -- but what's missing is the gore, the crucifying rod, the
girl's own animal screams and the absolute nightmare of it all. Kahlo
never painted her accident (it wasn't her aesthetic revelation) but
her art was born from her wounds. The power of her paintings, with
their washes of blood and anatomical details, in which the artist's
own internal organs are sometimes laid out like so many milagros, is
not simply in its beauty but in its terror. Kahlo was, as her
biographer Hayden Herrera pointed out, a woman who "lived dying." Is
it any wonder, then, that hers was an art that seduces and repulses
in equal measure?</TE>
<TE>   For Kahlo, experience turned into creation, blood into paint,
flesh into art. This was her essential core, a molten alloy of
genius, pain, lust and contradiction that neither Taymor nor Hayek
and any of the six writers who had a hand in the screenplay begin to
grasp. It's impossible to know the reasons why other than all the
familiar explanations that accompany films of this type, namely that
the horrors of real life don't translate well onto the screen, where
risking the audience's repulsion is risking the very success of the
film It doesn't help matters that the screenplay is rotten, filled
with declarations that would make better chapter titles: Frida to
Diego, "You've never been my husband"; Diego to Frida, "I'm a beast";
and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Then, too, it may be that Taymor and especially Hayek, who spent
years trying to get the movie made, are too in love with their
subject and their love has made them overly protective of Kahlo.
That, at any rate, is the charitable take. Less charitably -- and it
is, unhappily, easy to find fault with this film, not only because it
falls short of its mark but because of the way in which it falls
short -- "Frida" is galling.</TE>
<TE>   You expect Hollywood to gum up true stories, to soften biography
to fit the contours of respectability, but what is the point of
blunting a life like Kahlo's? It isn't only that the film tempers
some of her more discomforting edges (including her unwavering
adoration of Stalin), it's that Taymor is incapable of getting past
the flamboyance and layers of peasant skirts. She seems dazzled by
Kahlo's appearance but oblivious to its deeper meaning and to all of
the artist's multivalent, often contradictory identities -- the
shut-in and the adventurer, the Mexican-Indian and the
European-Mexican, the independent artist and the desperately needy
lover.</TE>
<TE>   Taymor has a flair for color and an eye for sybaritic detail, and
she's enlisted the Quay brothers for one of the film's spirited
animated sequences, but her gift is that of a talented production
designer, not of a director (best known for her stage work, her only
other film credit is "Titus.") The live-action sequences have none of
the punch of the film's animations, and none of the human
performances are as expressive as the skeletons the Quays use to
illustrate Kahlo's post-accident emergency room drama. Left to their
own devices, the film's actors move through the exotically appointed
rooms like suburban revelers at a bohemian costume party, clinking
glasses and mouthing platitudes about revolution. It's incredibly
phony, never more so than in scenes featuring the likes of Antonio
Banderas as Rivera's artistic and political rival, David Alfaro
Siqueiros, and Ashley Judd, playing Italian photographer Tina Modotti
in flapper clothes and a baffling Ruskie purr.</TE>
<TE>   For all the table-pounding rhetoric and the coy suggestions of
libertinism, these scenes bring to mind one of those old MGM
extravaganzas, back when the studio boasted more stars than there are
in heaven and Norma Shearer would be trussed up in period drag to
play important personages in gently accented English. In this
respect, Molina's Rivera is in some ways the gravest disappointment
-- the character is far too tamped down for this talented actor to
ignite -- although Hayek fares worse from Taymor's inattention. The
performance is far from a disgrace, but it lacks gravitas and soul, a
sense of passionate purpose, a hint of obsession. The best Hayek can
do with her lovely face is cloud it with worry, but the face of Frida
Kahlo demands anguish. Kahlo's genius, along with her suffering and
her ferocious will to live, turned her into a complex icon but one
made of viscera and tears, not vapors or a filmmaker's vanity.</TE>

<HD>Enigmatic austerity from the butoh troupe Sankai Juku</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Fisher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The curtain calls of Sankai Juku are sumptuous, humble and majestic.
At the Wednesday-night opening of "Hibiki: Resonance From Far Away,"
at UCLA's Royce Hall, the "I am your servant" slow curtsies were the
perfect ending for another stylishly enigmatic pageant from
performers whose austerity and skill reward anyone who slows down
long enough to soak it in.</LD>
<LD>   What always comes first with this perpetually touring Japanese
butoh troupe is "the look." It starts with the dancers' naked torsos
and bald heads dusted with rice flower that makes small clouds when
glacial pacing is momentarily abandoned. For the almost 90 minutes of
"Hibiki," the six performers wear artfully draped skirts or robes of
muted colors with occasional small slashes of red. At the edge of the
stage, a number of clear, shallow plates sit, like giant contact
lenses. Above them hang what look like four hummingbird feeders
filled with a silvery blue liquid.</LD>
<TE>   Artistic director Ushio Amagatsu, responsible for both
choreography and design, alternates his own poetic solos with
sections in which his dancers cluster, exploring traveling arm
movements, panning the horizon, and breaking into occasional jumps
and earthbound scurries. Seemingly programmed by alien forces, they
suddenly become awash with, and contorted by, their own desire. Faces
tend to be set in drone-like masks, except for that of the dancer
Semimaru, whose emotional inner life is like liquid light, motivating
his drifting or contorted limbs. Amagatsu also looks elegantly alive,
moving through clawed or stretched poses, wilting and stiffening like
an enchanted plant.</TE>
<TE>   The recorded score, by Takashi Kako and Yoichiro Yoshikawa,
effectively supports moods with menacing electronic cries and
synthesized symphonic passages reminiscent of the most emotional
Barber or Elgar, as well as with drips, cricket sounds and sudden
storms. Dancers often seem oblivious to music, but when arms do glide
on melodic rhythms, it's all the more effective for being rare.</TE>
<TE>   When the end comes, a return to opening fetal positions brings to
mind life-and-death circularity. But a final gesture punctuates the
theme with the kind of subtle clue Sankai Juku tends to offer before
the finely calibrated leave-taking.</TE>

<HD>Ryan Adams lightens up and aces this test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Going into Ryan Adams' concert Wednesday at the Wiltern, you didn't
know whether to give him a review or a report card.</LD>
<LD>   Or didn't you hear about the wonder boy's recent Nashville
performance where he reportedly got so upset when a heckler requested
a Bryan Adams song, "Summer of '69," that he refused to play another
note until the offender had left the auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   You can appreciate how irritating it must be to continually run
into jokes about the name similarity, but still it sounded as if Ryan
needs to chill.</LD>
<TE>   There were also signs of eccentric, if not downright bratty
behavior in May when Adams, in his rock mode, opened for Alanis
Morissette at the Universal Amphitheatre and played the entire set in
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   The danger in all this is that an artist can start taking himself
and his celebrityhood more seriously than his music. It wasn't
reassuring when Adams joined Courtney Love's recent 24-hour egothon
on MTV2.</TE>
<TE>   So it felt like a real test Wednesday -- not just of Adams' music,
but of his attitude and work habits.</TE>
<TE>   The music: Things started well as Adams, in a suit rather than his
usual wrinkled shirt and jeans, sat in a chair and sang "Oh My Sweet
Carolina." The enchanting song speaks about wanderlust and longing
with the soulful conviction of Gram Parsons' most moving works.</TE>
<TE>   For all his acclaim as a writer, Adams, whose melodic tunes range
freely among rich rock, pop and country influences, is also a singer
with an uncommonly vulnerable edge. He expresses dreams, both
shattered and realized, with such personal, unfiltered emotion that
the music carries a nervous undercurrent of voyeurism.</TE>
<TE>   Backed on various songs by a cellist, pianist and guitarist, Adams
moved between guitar and piano during the 90-minute set. The only
constant seemed to be the trail of cigarette smoke that followed him
around the way dust trails Pigpen in "Peanuts."</TE>
<TE>   Totally focused, he put the same depth of feeling into other
songs, whether it was the wounded, sarcastic "Come Pick Me Up," the
more comforting "La Cienega Just Smiled" or the gently alluring "You
Will Always Be the Same." It was the most satisfying overview of
Adams' music that he's given us live.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The attitude: Adams demonstrated warmth by filling in on guitar or
piano on several songs by the opening act, the promising sister duo
Tegan and Sara. He also showed good humor by pretending he was going
to read a story from a book. The audience roared when he instead
recited the opening lyric of the Bryan Adams song: "I bought my first
six-string ... in the summer of '69." It felt like a lighthearted way
of apologizing for his Nashville behavior.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The work habits: To offset the serious, sometimes solemn mood of
his music, Adams, whose boyish good looks add to the wonder and
innocence of his music, also threw in some light, engaging features
late in the set.</TE>
<TE>   He played guitar and sang along with a recording of Madonna's
"Like a Virgin" and then sat down at the piano for a dirge-like
rendition of the Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar" that accented the
lustful vision of the song. Both were inviting, good-natured treats
from an artist who earned the right to have some fun on a night when
he showed the value of putting his faith totally in his music.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Review or report card? Either way, it was straight A's.</TE>

<LD>Somewhere inside the mind of a serial sniper</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   It's very crowded in here.</LD>
<TE>   And no wonder, for television's minions have spent this month
rummaging through the brain of the Washington, D.C., triggerman whose
lethal moves and motivations remain baffling even after Thursday
morning's wee-hours arrests in connection with the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Like the case, coverage of it has yielded much more ambiguity than
fact, as many in the media set aside their roles as reporters and
indulged in guesswork that assumed a life of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the slack conjecture driving coverage of this case, nothing
has been more psychedelically absurd than TV's junior Freuds putting
on the couch someone they've never met or seen. Rarely have so many
with so little to say said so much, from criminal profilers speaking
smugly of the sniper's "God complex" to the media's own amateur
shrinks blabbing on and on while madly chasing one sniper scenario
after another in some of the sloppiest TV journalism in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it was all sniper nearly all of the time this week,
with only rare interludes of other news as police authorities found
TV highly useful as a conduit to reach someone they believed to be a
murderous shooter.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a few striking exceptions to the media's loose
lips, one being the meticulous reporting of CNN's Kelli Arena
throughout these weeks of turbulence. Arena, who covers the
Department of Justice, was notably circumspect and restrained, for
example, when her own network and other 24-hour news channels
suffered a Tacoma, Wash., meltdown in the period leading to Thursday
morning's arrest of John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo as they
slept in their car.</TE>
<TE>   Her most admirable quote: "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The confusing Wednesday fiasco began when Seattle stations rolled
into a Tacoma neighborhood and fed cable news channels and others
live coverage of feds and local cops digging up a backyard, deep into
the evening, and making off with a tree stump rumored by TV news to
have been used for target practice.</TE>
<TE>   By the sniper? Giving this episode weight was the coverage's
crime-busting tone -- although the ultimate outcome of the search
remained to be determined -- and extended live chopper footage of a
rental truck traveling down a road with a tree stump inside.</TE>
<TE>   Of equal interest were the tree stumps covering the story.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles stations swiftly dispatched reporters to Tacoma, one
of them KNBC anchor Chuck Henry, who appeared to be having an
out-of-body experience on the 11 p.m. news while coughing up
uninformed live reports so dense and convoluted as to be
unfathomable.</TE>
<TE>   Arena's polar opposite Wednesday night, though, was Shepard Smith,
the crescendoing Fox News Channel anchor who quoted Seattle stations
as reporting that "the sniper is an American of Hispanic extraction."
Smith seemed pretty sure of that himself too. He was even more
emphatic when babbling: "It's possible that person is now in custody!
It's possible that person is under surveillance! It's possible that
person is out there somewhere!" In other words, Smith seemed to be
saying, everything was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a mind to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, as the TV drum roll swelled deafeningly in Tacoma, former
FBI profiler Candice DeLong led MSNBC viewers through a tour of "the
mind of the sniper." And on CNN, anchor Aaron Brown wondered what the
sniper must be "thinking"' if watching the Tacoma search on TV. "His
blood pressure is going up," answered forensic psychologist Harley
Stock.</TE>
<TE>   The mind-play began much earlier, of course. As in Bill Hemmer's
response on CNN to Tuesday's fatal shooting of a bus driver near
where earlier sniper attacks had occurred: "In essence, what he's
saying is not only can you not catch me, Mr. Policeman, but the
Pentagon [whose surveillance planes were circling the area] can't
catch me either."</TE>
<TE>   Sniper psycho-chat also floated in from afar, as in criminal
profiler Pat Brown informing CBS News from Minneapolis: "This is his
entire mission in life. He hasn't had much success before. He wants
to go down in [history] as a tarot card killer or something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   And ...</TE>
<TE>   "Up next, a look inside the sniper's mind," boomed "Hardball" host
Chris Matthews on MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   On "Larry King Live," meanwhile, "power, ego, narcissism" was the
capsule sniper diagnosis of TV host John Walsh, who has somehow
emerged as an expert on all crimes. As if having a Vulcan mind meld
with the killer, Walsh added in the sniper's voice: "I'm a low life
that's never accomplished anything in my life. Now I hold a whole
area in fear."</TE>
<TE>   On and on it went, with even Dr. Phil getting in his two cents,
courtesy of KNBC, the station that runs his syndicated series. And
Joyce Brothers was exhumed for a few sound bites of her own.</TE>
<TE>   Usual media rutabagas aside, some of these TV-launched chin
strokers are smart, impressively pedigreed and even could have been
right about the sniper. The bigger point is that this was guesswork,
not news. And ... they could have been wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, much of the coverage has risen, brick by brick, from a
bedrock of shameless speculation and uninformed theorizing. MSNBC's
Bill Press: "And the fourth theory is ... " Dumb inevitably would
bring even dumber, for if the sniper possibly was a marksman, most TV
types sprayed lead from the hip. "So you think," a Fox anchor asked a
criminologist, "that he shoots, stashes his gun and heads out?"</TE>
<TE>   Click.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, CNN anchor Miles O'Brien was "seeing considerable
evidence that there might be a conspiracy here," and wondered, if
there were a pair of snipers, what would happen if "they differ on
strategy?"</TE>
<TE>   Click.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a hazy memory by Thursday was Monday's frenzied live
coverage of a white van parked beside an outdoor phone at a Richmond,
Va., service station, where a SWAT operation yielded two men being
taken into custody in the sniper case.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are just joining us, we are hoping this is the end," said
Fox anchor Jon Scott. "The indications," he added, "are that police
are fairly confident now that they may have apprehended" the sniper.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   The white van was loaded on a flatbed and hauled away, its route
shown live by choppers, because it might have been ambushed by Ninja
warriors.</TE>
<TE>   "And that van could hold a treasure trove of clues?" an MSNBC
anchor asked a criminologist. The reply: "Oh, absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Then came eyewitnesses to the SWAT operation. "They kept their
weapons shouldered when the approached the van," one told CNN. A Fox
anchor was on the phone with another eyewitness: "And you're
suggesting whoever was behind the wheel of the white van might be a
copycat?"</TE>
<TE>   Then came Polaroid pictures -- taken by someone next door -- of
the SWAT team making its move, as the media's low burlesque again
attached itself to high tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The knee-jerk TV operation also had misfire written all over it,
for the men taken into custody turned out to be only undocumented
aliens, who were turned over to immigration authorities.</TE>
<TE>   As this is being written, official charges had not been filed
against Williams and Malvo, although the tone of TV's coverage left
little doubt that one or both was closely connected to the shootings.
We'll see.</TE>
<TE>   Needing to be amended is the old saw about news being a first
draft of history, because on TV, it's scribbled raw notes.
Newscasters for years have used their live cameras to report their
own, minute-by-minute news-gathering process. Calling it news, they
skip over their miscues while feeling they've done their job if they
get everything right by the end of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   If they don't? There's always tomorrow.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Impatient and abrasive, drop-dead arrogant but smart as hell,
Manhattan advertising copywriter Roger Swanson is the kind of
mesmerizing talker who can take over a movie as surely as a great
raconteur can dominate a dinner table, and in Campbell Scott the part
has the kind of gifted, assured actor who can turn it into one of the
defining roles of a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   But it is a mark of the smarts and sophistication of "Roger
Dodger," an intimate look at a pivotal day in a bad boy's life that
Scott, dazzling as he is, is not the only reason to watch.</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by Dylan Kidd, this astute film not only
comes up with convincing foils to counter Roger's attacks, but also
displays an open-ended, non-schematic sensibility both welcome and
unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it is Scott's work as the savagely articulate Roger, a
tireless would-be seducer, bottomlessly self-confident and oblivious
to rejection, that is the film's glistening and provocative
centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   We meet him having drinks with colleagues from work, including the
alluring Joyce (Isabella Rossellini), his sometime girlfriend as well
as his boss. Everyone at the table is clever (did I say this was New
York?), but Roger is pushing hardest, talking about sex in the city
and coming up with glib, rapid-fire pronouncements on the order of
"for women, intellectual and sexual fulfillment were never intended
to intersect."</TE>
<TE>   What Roger cares about is not advertising, not what he calls
"thinking up ways to make people feel bad." He is forever on the
prowl, in the most cynical way, for women, treating any interaction
as part of a game of trophy-hunting and seduction. He prides himself
on his knowledge of the opposite sex, but in truth Roger has a pimp's
contempt for women, a view of them as simple beings who can be
manipulated, controlled, bent to his will.</TE>
<TE>   Although Scott does not ordinarily play characters this corrupt,
it was a stroke of good fortune for "Roger Dodger" that he took the
role. Without seeming to try, he gives Roger forlorn, almost wistful
aspects, creating a jerk we still hold out hope for. As
writer-director Kidd put it in an interview, "Campbell brings some
weird, intangible thing that makes you want to give him the benefit
of the doubt."</TE>
<TE>   In a more conventional film, a character this reprehensible would
inevitably get a brusque comeuppance, falling from grace in an
obvious, predictable way. But something less expected happens to
Roger Swanson. He gets a visit from his 16-year-old nephew Nick, just
in from Ohio in search of an uncle his mother dismissively refers to
as "some kind of a ladies' man."</TE>
<TE>   At loose ends and flattered to be asked for help in figuring out
women (as well as oblivious to the fact that he's the last person who
should be asked), Roger takes his impressionable nephew on a tour of
after-dark New York, an adventure that turns out to hold new
experiences and surprises for both.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things about Scott's performance is that rather
than obliterate everyone else in the film, it nourishes the work of
the rest of the cast. This is especially true with Jesse Eisenberg,
the fine young actor who gives Nick an appealing earnestness that
strikes the right balance between being awkward and having a nascent
but very real sense of self.</TE>
<TE>   Equally strong are the two young women, memorably played by
Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley, who unexpectedly hook up with
Roger and Nick at a bar. They become the essential first step in the
complicated dynamic that develops between the two men, a process of
mutual coming of age in which both Nick and Roger struggle to come to
terms with what really matters in this life and what does not.</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Baca-Asay's hand-held, almost peekaboo camerawork adds
intimacy and immediacy to the proceedings. Baca-Asay is a longtime
associate of writer-director Kidd, who made industrial films and
videos for years before getting the chance to direct this, his first
feature.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Roger Dodger" is so confidently made it hardly feels
like a debut. Kidd has made the rare film that's more interesting and
complex than it sounds, a feature that shares with its characters a
willingness to take risks and ends up, like them, in places they
never expected to be.</TE>

<HD>An affirming journey in 'Fancydancing'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1998 bittersweet comedy "Smoke Signals," drawn from stories by
Sherman Alexie, was a groundbreaker -- both artistically, as a work
of sophistication and maturity, and creatively, as the first feature
film written, produced and directed by Native Americans. Even more
venturesome is the bravura but intimate "The Business of
Fancydancing," which Alexie directed as well as wrote, this time
drawing from his poetry.</LD>
<LD>   Each film deals with a friendship between two young men that
reaches back to boyhood, and each turns on a reunion precipitated by
a funeral. But "The Business of Fancydancing" is anything but the
warm tale of friendship and reconciliation that "Smoke Signals" was.
Nor is it a conventional narrative, beyond the outline of its story,
about a widely acclaimed and successful poet, Seymour Polatkin (Evan
Adams), who at his readings declares that he is "proud to be an
American Indian gay man" -- a pride that, unsurprisingly, has been
hard-earned in all its aspects. (He also sometimes explains that his
name came from a Russian ancestor.)</LD>
<TE>   Seymour returns to his native Spokane, Wash., reservation for the
first time in nearly a decade for the funeral of a childhood friend,
Mouse (Swil Kanim), a gifted violinist who has committed suicide.
Seymour's journey, undertaken out of a sense of obligation, is not in
search of reconciliation but for self-acceptance and affirmation that
he has taken the right path.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour, who lives in Seattle with his lover (Kevin Phillip), is
not expecting a warm welcome, as his people resent the
autobiographical candor of his poetry, infused by bitterness as well
as tenderness. He knows his onetime best friend, Aristotle Joseph
(Gene Tagaban), will be certain to resent his presence. The two had
been co-valedictorians of their reservation high school class and had
gone to university together in Seattle. But Aristotle, who had hoped
to be a pediatrician, flunked out halfway through, succumbing to
feelings of alienation and of bias toward him. Aristotle has viewed
Seymour's growing renown jealously, sneeringly regarding him as "the
little public relations warrior."</TE>
<TE>   When Seymour embarks on the five-hour trip to his past, he is also
journeying into his imagination and memories. "Fancydancing" shifts
easily between the two, and cuts occasionally to sequences back at
the reservation that depict the ceremonial preparations of Mouse's
remains for the funeral and reveal much hostility toward Seymour. His
only defender is Agnes (Michelle St. John), an intelligent woman with
whom he shares an enduring emotional bond.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, his musings, which include a rigorous interrogation
from a severe interviewer (Rebecca Carroll), are punctuated by
passages of Native American rituals, ceremonies, dances and chants,
all of which have shaped Seymour's psyche and poetry. This surrealist
approach gives "Fancydancing," enriched by Alexie's choice of
contemporary Native American songs on the soundtrack, its
captivating, distinctive power, and it bristles with a passion and
intelligence too intense to allow the film's style to seem
pretentious. Cinematographer-editor Holly Taylor shot "Fancydancing"
on high-grade Sony digital equipment, creating a dynamic flow of
highly expressive yet uncluttered images.</TE>
<TE>   A fervent assertion that an individual has the right to pursue his
own path lies at the vibrant heart of "The Business of Fancydancing."
Adams is a compact, appealing young actor who reveals Seymour to be a
truth-teller with the courageous heart of a warrior and a crackling
intellect, a fiercely articulate man unafraid to be abrasive, yet
capable of kindness and affection. St. John is easily his match as
Agnes, but while Tagaban lives up to the description of Aristotle as
"a beautiful warrior," he at times is arch and self-conscious as an
actor -- although, fortunately, not to the extent of detracting from
the overall effect of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguingly, those at the reservation who otherwise resent
Seymour and his success don't seem bothered by his sexual
orientation, yet "The Business of Fancydancing" leaves the impression
that if membership in one minority can make an individual strong,
belonging to two can it make him doubly so.</TE>

<HD>Ferretti's art of creating and re-creating</HD>

<LD>As one of cinema's great production designers, Dante Ferretti is a
kind of master poet who uses design to create vivid, expressionistic,
self-contained worlds. Whether they are whimsical or frightening or
somewhere in between, his colorful reel-life universes are always
compelling, drawing audiences into strange and beautiful worlds.</LD>
<LD>   For director Terry Gilliam's "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"
(1989), he was responsible for the film's surreal, extravagant
fairy-tale visions.</LD>
<LD>   For director Neil Jordan's "Interview With the Vampire" (1994), he
created the opulent, erotic and violent trappings of a group of sexy
vampires.</LD>
<TE>   And in Martin Scorsese's upcoming "Gangs of New York," he
re-created Manhattan of the 19th century from scratch at the famed
Italian film studio, Cinecitta.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 30-plus years, the six-time Academy Award nominee
has collaborated with such acclaimed filmmakers as Pier Paolo
Pasolini and Federico Fellini. Ferretti fell in love with the design
of movies as a youngster. "When you are young and going to see
movies, you say normally I want to be an actor, but I liked to see
period movies," he recalls. "One day I discovered this world of art
director and I said, 'Now I know what I want to do. I want to be a
designer.' I was 17 years old. I was very impressed with 'Ben Hur.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now Ferretti is the centerpiece for an exhibit opening today at
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences in Beverly Hills,
"Drawing Dreams: Dante Ferretti, Production Designer." A three-week
retrospective of his films also begins today at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the Ferretti celebration, on Nov. 7 the
academy (in collaboration with the Art Directors Guild) will hold a
symposium, "Arresting Images," that will look at the history of
production design and the challenges faced by designers and art
directors. On Nov. 9, the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive kicks off
its own three-week film tribute to production designers, "The Art of
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Ferretti will be speaking at LACMA's "Tribute to Dante Ferretti"
today and a screening of his 1983 collaboration with Fellini, "And
the Ship Sails On," on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so pleased and so proud," says Ferretti, 59, speaking by
phone from Romania where he is working on Anthony Minghella's
adaptation of "Cold Mountain," the bestselling novel about the Civil
War. "I am in the middle of Transylvania with the vampires," he says,
laughing. "I see Dracula every day. I am with him now!"</TE>
<TE>   Ferretti hasn't been involved in planning the exhibit. "I said I
don't want to know nothing," says Ferretti in his charming accented
English. "I give all my sketches, all the models and also some of the
costumes I did for 'Kundun' and then I said, 'OK. Now it is up to
you. I want to come the day before and just be surprised.' "</TE>
<TE>   The academy is collaborating with Cinecitta on the exhibit and
screening. "We have worked with Cinecitta on a number of things over
the years," says Ellen Harrington, the academy's exhibition curator
and special events programmer. "Every once in while we do exhibitions
on production designers. Part of what the gallery's job is to get
around to all of the 15 branches of the academy and try to do
programming that relates to the different branches."</TE>
<TE>   Ferretti, says Harrington, is an exceptional artist -- a designer
who does his own production design sketches. "A lot of people these
days aren't necessarily fine artists even though they are in
production design. They work on computers or they use illustrators.
Dante Ferretti is a really sort of old-fashioned Renaissance man from
Rome. He is very skilled in architecture and design and
construction."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is high-tech and interactive. "It is obviously
centered around the original artwork, but there are scale models and
film clips and projections," Harrington says.</TE>
<TE>   Though the exhibition in the grand lobby will be on the
traditional side, the fourth-floor gallery has been turned into a
black box with video hanging projections. "A lot of the artwork is
actually going to be mounted and hung off of our open-grid hanging
system in the ceiling," Harrington says. "The Tribute to Dante
Ferretti" at LACMA tonight will feature clips from several of his
films including "Age of Innocence," "Meet Joe Black," "Kundun" and
"Titus." Miramax also is producing a mini documentary on his work on
"Gangs of New York" for the evening. Besides "And the Ship Sails On,"
the retrospective includes Pasolini's "Arabian Nights" on next
Friday, Scorsese's "Kundun" on Nov. 2, Jean-Jacques Annaud's "The
Name of the Rose" on Nov. 8 and "Baron Munchausen" on Nov. 9. The
prints of "And the Ship Sails On" and "Baron Munchausen" are new.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 18, Ferretti started to work and study at Cinecitta.
He got his first break as a production designer on Pasolini's 1970
film "Medea," with Maria Callas. He made five movies with Pasolini
and then collaborated with Fellini on the master director's last five
films.</TE>
<TE>   Fellini, he says, taught him how to draw dreams. "I learned a kind
of poetic reality with Pasolini. With Pasolini everything came from
the painters. With Fellini, everything came from dreams."</TE>

<HD>Down by the water</HD>
<DH>With space at a premium in Coronado, some landowners are
finding extra room to build by digging deep. It's a solution with
problems of its own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clients, from Phoenix, had dreamed of a house on the water in
Coronado, the "island" that lies across a graceful arc of bridge
spanning San Diego Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded on three sides by glimmering blue bays and the Pacific
Ocean, the seductive 13.5-square-mile city of Coronado is connected
to the mainland by only a narrow, silvery spit of sand. Real estate
in this exclusive enclave sells for more per square foot than almost
anywhere else in California, and rarely comes on the market.
Newcomers hoping to get a foothold here will spend astronomical sums
to buy any odd piece of property they can.</LD>
<LD>   So when the clients got a chance at a piece of land with a
to-die-for view of downtown San Diego, they snapped it up -- for
around $2 million.</LD>
<TE>   It had some drawbacks. It was small -- about 7,500 square feet.
The previous owner had sold viewing rights to the two-story house
behind, so they couldn't build higher than 11 feet. At high tide the
water on the bay lapped to within 65 feet of where they wanted to
begin construction.</TE>
<TE>   "When they first got it, I looked at it and thought, 'What are you
going to do, have galoshes in the front room?' " said Harry Jackman,
of the Coronado-based Jackman Group, a planning, design and
construction firm.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Tom Vaughn had a better idea: Build down. "Basically,
it's free space," Vaughn said. "You can have all the bulk and height
you need."</TE>
<TE>   Two and a half years and 1,100 square yards of concrete later, the
clients from Phoenix have an 8,500-square-foot house, with more than
half of it underground, including a 2,500-square-foot garage and
2,500 square feet of living space, with elevator, sauna and media
room.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, I was wondering if this was all even possible,"
said the lady of the house, who declined to give her name. "That was
before I became a believer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The big squeeze</TE>
<TE>   The concept of living underground in sunny Southern California may
sound like bad science fiction or a throwback to the era of the bomb
shelter, but it turns out to be an imaginative -- if expensive -- way
to get around strict zoning ordinances and squeeze really big houses
onto really small lots. In Coronado, where the floor-area ratio above
ground is tightly controlled and houses can be no more than two
stories above grade, contractors can build out to the property line
below ground.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go 40 stories below grade!" Vaughn said, as if he's
waiting for a client to ask him to.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix couple's house was not the first on Coronado to be
built down. In the last 15 years, Ralph Brienza and his son David,
owners of Coronado Construction Management Inc., have built about 12
underground structures -- mostly garages and storage spaces. The
Jackman Group has built a total of seven houses underground in the
last decade, and two more are in the works. And recently,
Santee-based Fred C. Perry Construction undertook its first
underground structure -- a $12-million, 8,400-square-foot home on the
bay. Perry, too, said he has plans for several more.</TE>
<TE>   The underground phenomenon isn't new -- homes burrowed into
hillside berms were popular in the energy-conscious 1970s, and
commercial buildings have long been built down, to accommodate
parking, utilities and even shopping malls. But building basements
below the water level does seem to be unique to Coronado.
Representatives from the research arm of the National Assn. of Home
Builders and the Building and Industry Councils of Los Angeles and
San Diego counties said they could not recall such underground living
spaces being built anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Morafcik, communications director for the Building and
Industry Assn. of San Diego, said La Jolla is comparable to Coronado
in both income level and scarcity of land. "On a wide-scale basis,
though, I haven't seen the whole underground thing come into play
regionally," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Building down solves some problems peculiar to Coronado but has
peculiarities of its own. Jackman and Vaughn have hit the water table
in five of the seven houses they've built so far. Brienza has hit
water with all of the houses he's built there.</TE>
<TE>   Brienza said he built 500 houses in Denver that had to deal with
artesian wells and spring water flooding into the foundations. He
claims to have brought the concept of building underground to the
Coronado Cays, where he began to build houses with basements within
15 feet of the sea walls. He said he has had no problems so far.</TE>
<TE>   "My concept is that you have to build good bathtubs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, though, builders confront unexpected obstacles. Perry
confessed he "lost a few nights sleep" on his first venture
underground. "We had 14 pumps going during construction. And then you
have to make sure that you're not sucking moisture away from other
houses and causing a sinkhole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said they were pumping 565,000 gallons of water a minute
during construction. Builders then had to get a permit to dump the
water back into San Diego Bay. To do that, they had to run tests with
fish and a sea urchin. But it turned out that fresh water was flowing
in as well, so they failed the test three times."We had to hire a
marine biologist," he said. "Every week they had to come and sample
the water. That alone cost over $100,000."</TE>
<TE>   Building down will probably remain an option available only to the
very rich of Coronado. While Brienza said he can build underground
for as little as $50,000, Vaughn said his underground structures have
ranged from $250,000 to $1 million, depending on size and whether the
builders hit water.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, whose first underground structure cost his clients
$500,000, said money is no object for most of the people he works
with. And he predicts the trend will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no land there," he said of Coronado. "You have to
literally wait for someone to die or sell their house. People pay
$2.4 million for a [waterfront] lot that is 108 by 90 feet. It's a
lot of money for a little dirt.... You have to utilize every square
inch to justify paying that kind of money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the water at bay</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix couple's house is a low-lying, pale cream collage of
stucco, shingle and Texas shellstone, surrounded by concrete walls
topped with laminated glass to take in the view of the bay and the
dramatic downtown San Diego skyline. The walls also serve as a
seawall (even the gate has a watertight seal), built to keep out
rising water. Cement sofas and chairs topped with blue-and-white
striped cushions are built into the patio.</TE>
<TE>   The upper floor is spacious and airy and gives no hint of what
lies beneath. The beachfront expanse is almost all windows, and
massive skylights let the sun in. But because the grade for the house
was below the mean high tide line, the project turned out to be one
of the most challenging the Jackman Group has faced.</TE>
<TE>   The builders hit the water table 5 feet below where the first
floor was supposed to be. It took 15 dewatering wells to lower the
water level so they could work. They pumped out 415,000 gallons a
month for the first four months.</TE>
<TE>   The first concrete pour took 42 trucks, Jackman said. The floors
underground are 18 inches thick and the walls a foot, as impenetrable
as a medieval fortress. The sand of the site, layered with plastic
and a few concrete slabs, was waterproofed before the concrete pour
with Paraseal, a mixture of plastic and bentonite clay. Vaughn
describes Paraseal as "self-healing," meaning that the material
expands when water hits it and fills the tear.</TE>
<TE>   "If the wall springs a leak, you just inject the wall with this
huge syringe," explained Sheryll Jackman, a real estate agent and
designer for Jackman Group. Her husband, Harry, said a few houses
have experienced very minor leaks.</TE>
<TE>   On the street side, a curve of driveway disappears under the house
and opens into a garage as big as many L.A. mini-mall parking lots.
To counter the claustrophobic feeling of being underground, Vaughn
tries to build his ceilings high and introduce a source of natural
light. In this house the ceilings are 8 1/2 feet -- slightly higher
than in a typical house. (Some of his underground living spaces have
ceilings as high as 10 feet.)</TE>
<TE>   In the first of two bedrooms there is a window onto a tunnel to
the sky, resembling the view from a rabbit warren. Equipped with a
15-foot ladder, the tunnel allows a wan shaft of natural light to
enter the room, which instantly dispels the bomb-shelter feel of the
space. There is also a bathroom, a sauna and a media room below
ground, and an elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Though they say they trust Jackman and Vaughn, the new homeowners
are nevertheless decorating to suit the milieu. Above ground, the
house is full of glass, stone and expensive tile. Underground, it
will be spare and simple.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we put in priceless things, or $500-a-foot carpet,"
the client explained. "We decorated with the possibility of water
damage."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am awash this gray morning with memories of Joe Citera, a
19-year-old Marine who died during the Korean War, a lifetime ago.
He'd be my age now, maybe retired and with grandchildren. I'm sure
Joe would have married after the war, because that's what he talked
about most. He wanted what we all wanted, a wife and kids and a life
that had meaning.</LD>
<LD>   Two things got me thinking about Joe the other day. One was the
disclosure by North Korea's Kim Jong Il that the country has a secret
nuclear weapons program.</LD>
<LD>   I thought to myself, God, not again. Wars end in other places, why
do the lingering threats of hostilities never cease in Korea?</LD>
<TE>   An effort to organize was the second event that revived memories
of Joe. I was sorting through a pile of stuff trying to get things in
order when I came across his photograph.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those large studio shots, with Joe in gaudy Marine
dress blues, a uniform furnished specifically for the picture. None
of us had uniforms like that. We laughed at the image of a white hat
and those blue pants with red stripes down the sides in a muddy
foxhole.</TE>
<TE>   But that was long ago, and I'm not laughing anymore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Humor and courage</TE>
<TE>   The Joe Citera who looked out from the photograph was a face that
has burned itself in my memory like the brand on a horse. He was a
tall, loose kind of guy with big ears and a self-amused smile that
never failed to fit the moment. I remember that grin during the worst
times of the war: Joe glancing across at me during a withering mortar
barrage and rasping in a Durante voice, "I wonder what the poor
people are doing?"</TE>
<TE>   He had an uncanny sense of timing when it came to lifting our
spirits. He'd have made a great stand-up comic, appearing on stage in
a dungaree cap, his ears sticking out and that faint smile on his
face, talking about what it was like to be a private in the Marines.
I can still hear him saying, "Oh, the sad indecencies of war," while
trudging up a hill under a relentless sun, loaded down with combat
gear.</TE>
<TE>   We thought of him as a buffoon when he first joined the company, a
clown among warriors, but he proved himself one day under enemy
machine-gun fire when he rose in the face of that firestorm to bring
out a wounded comrade. After dragging the man into a ditch, Joe
popped his head up and hollered, "Ya missed!" We knew then he was
made of special stuff, balancing courage with humor in the face of
terrible odds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The measure of the man</TE>
<TE>   His sister, Mary Fruehwirth, sent me the photograph and some
letters her "Joeboy" had written from Korea when I was doing a
magazine piece on the war. They were a close pair, raised by
relatives after the deaths of their mother and father. She referred
to him as a kid in a letter to me, then explained, "That's all he
really was when he joined the Marines on his 18th birthday, Oct. 18,
1950. He was killed Sept. 12-13, 1951. He never really had a chance
to grow up into a man."</TE>
<TE>   Joe's letters to her were filled with an underlying loneliness.
"Write every day!" was scrawled all over them. "Send plenty of candy,
cookies and cake!" He was a high school dropout and his letters,
written in pencil, were replete with misspellings, but that wasn't
the measure of the man. What characterized this kid from Greenpoint,
Brooklyn, was his grace under fire. In one letter he wrote, "How's
everything at home? We're getting a lot of mortar and sniper fire
here. Well, that's all for now."</TE>
<TE>   The only time I saw Joe truly sad was when he talked about wanting
a girlfriend to write to. Someone to love. He didn't have one, he
said, because his ears stuck out. Who wanted a guy with big ears?
"I'll have them fixed someday," he said to me in a quiet moment.
"Then you'll see one handsome son of a bitch."</TE>
<TE>   Joe was hit by machine-gun fire on a hill called 749, but even
then he came through. Although badly wounded in a night assault by
the Chinese, he yelled for us to hold on. When the enemy hollered,
"All Marines from California go home tonight," he shouted back, "What
about Brooklyn?" He died at dawn, and as we moved on up the hill, we

<HD>From Russia with luck: A day of drama precedes a night at
the opera</HD>

<LD>"Flex-ibil-ity," says Shari Shanker, with the feigned perkiness of a
demented preschool teacher. "That's our motto here at the L.A. Opera.
Flex-ibil-ity."</LD>
<LD>   Shanker, the opera's production manager, is standing a few feet
from the stage in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. It is about quarter
past noon on Tuesday; the members the Kirov Opera company were asked
to be here at 12 on the dot for costume fittings and makeup. Thus
far, no singers have been seen anywhere in the building. This could
be because most of them arrived in Los Angeles just last night, some
as late as 10 p.m. Or it could be a miscommunication -- most members
of the Kirov don't speak English; most staffers at Los Angeles Opera
don't speak Russian.</LD>
<LD>   Not that it matters. What matters is that the show opera, "Lady
Macbeth of Mtsensk," opens here in less than 36 hours. And as of yet,
no note has been sung, no movement blocked.</LD>
<TE>   "Isn't the piano dress [rehearsal] at 1?" asks another member of
the opera staff who is not quite wringing his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "One....ish," Shanker says brightly.</TE>
<TE>   "And the maestro, he gets in today, right?"</TE>
<TE>   "Today....ish," Shanker says. She utters a high, half-strangled
laugh that in other circumstances might be characterized as "mad."
"Flexibility," she says again, "is key."</TE>
<TE>   In the tense, expectant quiet, a Christmasy smell of sugar pine
spills over the stage into the house. This is the scent of a brand
spanking new set. This is the scent of "flex-ibil-ity."</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, due to budgetary concerns, the L.A. Opera canceled the
scheduled Kirov production of "War and Peace" and replaced it with
the less-expensive "Lady Macbeth." Logistically, this was not a
problem -- the Kirov is famously self-sufficient, known around the
world for its ability to put on a lavish, fabulous opera in a matter
of days; many of the ensemble had just performed "Lady Macbeth" this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Then the dock lockout sent the production's sets, costumes, wigs
and props to Japan and things got a little complicated. The costumes
and wigs came back to L.A. by air; the sets had to be rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks before the opera was to open, Igor Suvorov,
the Kirov's technical director, flew to L.A. with 30 pounds of
blueprints, written in Russian of course. Harold "Butch" Conroy, the
L.A. Opera's carpenter, began hitting up the local unions for extra
help. As Suvorov and Jeff Kleeman, his counterpart in L.A., began
translating, Conroy had two guys cutting corner boards for one whole
10-hour day; another spent a day and a half cutting the boards that
make up the face of the set. "He looked like a snowman," says Conroy,
"like a sawdust snowman."</TE>
<TE>   Conroy, who is a fourth-generation stage hand, figured they'd
simply never make it, that they'd be hammering and painting as the
curtain rose on opening night. He said this many times throughout the
10 days and nights the crew of 26 worked at the opera's shop in Santa
Clarita, even when it became clear that they were going to finish
with time to spare. His brother Tom, who is Conroy's assistant, just
smiled and told him he was crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done six Academy Awards sets," he says, standing on the
stage in front of the fragrant, dazzling and very finished set. "It's
a show. The show will go on."</TE>
<TE>   It is almost 1 o'clock and suddenly there are Russians everywhere
-- welling up the stairwells, flooding the corridors, striding across
the stage. One man begins marking the floor for props, picking up
people's feet, shoving shins when necessary. The Kirov's assistant
stage manager, a perpetual-movement machine of a woman, slaps the
side of a large barrel in which two of the characters will cavort.</TE>
<TE>   "Nyet, nyet, nyet," she says, waving away a step-ladder brought
out for her inspection. Downstairs in wardrobe and upstairs in
dressing rooms, the chorus and principal singers need almost no help
finding and donning costumes, and soon there are Russian peasant
women on the pay phones, Russian soldiers stepping outside to smoke.</TE>
<TE>   A decision is made to forgo makeup and hair until the final dress
that evening. "O-kaaay," says wig master Rick Geyer on receipt of
this news. He utters a half-strangled laugh similar to Shanker's
laugh, a sound that will become a hallmark of the L.A. Opera staff as
the day wears on. He is used to several full rehearsals, at least two
in full dress and makeup. "Just let us know if you need anything," he
says to a member of the makeup crew who speaks "the little English."</TE>
<TE>   Taking off their street clothes, the three women who will
alternately sing Katerina, the leading role, mention, through an
interpreter, that they have not worn their costumes in six years.
There is a tense bilingual exchange -- everyone involved had assumed
that the costumes had been fitted before they had been shipped but,
alas, this was not so. And time, it turns out, has been generous to
the waistlines of two of the women in a way that will require
something more than moving a few buttons.</TE>
<TE>   "As if there were any buttons," says one wardrobe assistant in
passing.</TE>
<TE>   For the next few hours, the singers rehearse, some in costume,
some not, the opera staff continues to wonder when exactly maestro
Valery Gergiev will arrive, and the wardrobe staff creates extensions
with tape and fabric from hems, adds gussets fore and aft.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately she wears a shawl," says Janine Allen, wardrobe
supervisor, holding up the one jury-rigged dress. "A big shawl."</TE>
<TE>   Were the leads upset to learn they had gained so much weight?</TE>
<TE>   "Not so much anguish as you might expect," Allen says. "Not as
much anguish as we felt," adds her assistant, Daniel Nussbaum, with
the laugh.</TE>
<TE>   A few floors above, members of the L.A. Opera League are up to
their wrists in chocolate icing and honey-baked ham. At the request
of the opera, the league is providing a meal for the company before
every show. They've done this before for the cast of other shows, but
usually just for one night, and never for 280.</TE>
<TE>   "We're calling it Project Kirov," says Audrey Hansen, the league's
president. "You know food is such a problem in their country and we
wanted them to have a good meal."</TE>
<TE>   They have on hand 23 hams, pounds and pounds of couscous, rice and
macaroni salad, institutional-sized tins of sliced peaches and 15
chocolate sheet cakes. One woman has spent the last two hours just
frosting and cutting cake. Hansen can top that; she's been cooking
red cabbage, on the menu for Friday, for almost a week. "My house
does have a bit of a cabbagy smell," she says. "But we wanted them to
feel welcome and it freezes so nicely."</TE>
<TE>   At 5:30, the company breaks for dinner. The musicians have arrived
and so, allegedly, has Gergiev -- somewhere in L.A. Still, he is
technically here.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked him up," announces a young woman named Taylor. "The new
rule is, if I am here, he is here." (Backstage legend has it that the
last time Gergiev conducted in L.A., the downbeat for the orchestra
was scheduled for 7:30; Gergiev arrived at 7:29.)</TE>
<TE>   After so much bustle, the relative silence of the makeshift mess
hall during dinner is startling. "I think they must just be
exhausted," Hansen says. "I hope it's not that they don't like the
food," she adds with a worried frown.</TE>
<TE>   The full dress rehearsal is scheduled for 7 p.m. and for the half
hour leading up to it, it is difficult to imagine that somewhere
within this building there is a 280-member opera company. The halls
are silent, backstage is silent, the makeup people sit outside the
silent wardrobe rooms, waiting, not really knowing what is going to
happen next.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is everyone?" asks a makeup assistant. People shrug, they
laugh, they have no idea. Again.</TE>
<TE>   Down in wardrobe, they are doing in four hours what they would
usually do in two weeks. It's quarter to 7. "How close are you?"
Allen asks one man who is putting stays into a bodice. "Not terribly
close," he says, "but close."</TE>
<TE>   "Get closer," she says. "It doesn't have to be pretty, it just has
to be on. It will get pretty by tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   "I bet the costumes for 'War and Peace' all fit beautifully," she
adds wistfully.</TE>
<TE>   Dress rehearsal starts at 7-ish -- 7:15 to be exact, and the cast
appears from nowhere, hitting their marks, their high and low notes,
as if they had not been dealing with customs and hotel room mix-ups
hours ago, as if they'd been performing at the Music Center every day
of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   For a few moments, the L.A. staff too feels like maybe they have
reached familiar ground. Not so. Because this is the only rehearsal
anyone will get, Gergiev re-does entire scenes, using the different
principals. At one point there are three leading men, in similar
costumes, standing outside a wardrobe room.</TE>
<TE>   "That's unnerving," says Allen, who is delivering a gusseted
wedding bodice, hoping for the best. Someone mentions that the
Katerina now onstage is wearing white jeans and a sweater.</TE>
<TE>   "What?!" Allen says. "Who is it? Which one? I haven't even seen
her. Why isn't she in costume? I've been so busy with this," she
shakes the wedding bodice, "and I have no idea what is going on.
Wait, wait," she says, holding up her hands, "this is not my
problem."</TE>
<TE>   She takes deep breath. And through from stage right, as if on cue,
comes the smell of sugar pine. Flex-ibil-ity.</TE>

<DH>The Kirov survives obstacles and delivers a lurid 'Lady
Macbeth' in all its farcical glory.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Knowledgeable opera-goers detest the applauding of sets. But
Wednesday night was an exception to this bit of operatic etiquette.
How not to give a hand to George Tsypin's slatted wooden, sculptural
set for Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" as soon as the
curtain went up at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Built by Los Angeles Opera in 10 frantic days, this handsome copy
of the original Mariinsky Theatre set looked just fine, which meant,
under the circumstances, it looked wonderful. Indeed, with the
raising of the curtain, it was as though the black cloud that had
hung over the first Kirov Opera L.A. tour finally seemed to lift.</LD>
<LD>   Two months earlier, Los Angeles Opera had been forced to cancel
its plans to bring the Kirov's celebrated, spectacular production of
Prokofiev's "War and Peace," making a last-minute switch to "Lady
Macbeth" to save $1 million dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Though the Kirov is famed for it resourcefulness, the challenge
was considerable, given that the company is performing Shostakovich's
opera daily for a week. "Lady Macbeth" has enough punishing roles
that, with this schedule, seven roles require multiple, mostly
triple, casting. Yet with minimal rehearsal, and the company's
artistic director, Valery Gergiev, maintaining his typically
overextended schedule, the show still went on Wednesday without
noticeable hitch.</TE>
<TE>   By giving Los Angeles its first major production of Shostakovich's
once-controversial work, L.A. Opera also managed to turn adversity
into something approaching triumph, even if the lurid, parodistic
"Lady Macbeth" may not be to the taste of ticket-holders who had been
looking forward to something a lot grander. Nor is the Mariinsky's
notably Russian-style production the kind that L.A. Opera, or any
American company, would normally present.</TE>
<TE>   "Lady Macbeth" is a strange opera with a strange history. It is
best known for having made Stalin mad, when he saw it in 1936, two
years after its premiere. Begun in 1930 when the composer was only 24
years old, Shostakovich was still in the thrall of Soviet art's
avant-garde vitality. Thinking anything goes if the politics are OK,
he boldly presented one of the most boisterous operas written up to
that time, a farce with humor so blatantly black that it can only
turn tragic.</TE>
<TE>   Katerina, a merchant's wife, the oppressed woman who represents
oppressed classes, comes to life through sexual liberation in a
graphic sex scene with whooping trombone solo. She gleefully
overthrows her bonds, taking up with a charming laborer, and killing
her obstructive father-in-law and husband.</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich conveys sex and violence as grotesque burlesque
through twisted, manic, musical-hall dances, and even the priest and
police are vaudevillian.  But this reckless opera never stays in one
mood for long, as it also explores the dark recesses of Katerina's
psyche and the deep angst underlying Russian society.</TE>
<TE>   Most modern productions do their best to exploit as much raw sex
and violence as they can. The Kirov's director, Irina Molostova,
however, is more understated, contrasting silly sex with grim life.
Tsypin's set twists and turns imaginatively, but is essential a large
wooden barn. Tatiana Noginova's costumes are mostly drab,
occasionally farcical.</TE>
<TE>   The drama is enacted as a world-weary satire, except for the final
prison scene. Here, Katerina and her lover, Sergei, have been
arrested, and life suddenly turns harsh and serious. Katerina commits
a final liberating murder, as she drags Sergei's new lover, Sonetka,
into the river with her.</TE>
<TE>   The matronly Larrisa Shevchenko is probably no one's idea of the
young, sexually frustrated Katerina, and if Vladimir Grishko is
slimmer and more charming, it is only in degree. To see them bouncing
in bed -- in huge silhouette behind a red curtain -- is downright
goofy.</TE>
<TE>   But both happen to be sturdy singers, and both somehow, in the
end, wound up making this absurd "tragedy-satire," as Shostakovich
called it, convincing.</TE>
<TE>   The real force behind the performance, though, is Gergiev, who
finds a depth of expression in every dramatic outburst -- and this is
an opera with nothing but dramatic outbursts. The orchestra
constantly comments upon the action, often making a mockery of the
characters, the Kirov is a superbly expressive ensemble. Gergiev
always digs for ever richer string textures, ever more soulful or
outrageous wind solos, ever louder percussion whacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Kirov company is large and full of life. The chorus is
exceptional. And on Wednesday there was plenty of individuality in
the performances of Vladimir Vaneev, Katerina's bully father-in-law,
Boris; Leonid Zahkozhaev, her insipid husband, Zinovy; Nikolai
Gassiev, a shabby peasant; Gennady Bezzubenkov, at ludicrous Priest;
Fedor Mojaev, a Keystone Kops sergeant; and Liubov Sokolova, a
seductive Sonetka.</TE>
<TE>   All these roles will be sung by alternates at other performances,
including no less than five Sergeis; and Maxim Shostakovich, the
composer's son, conducts the last two performances.</TE>
<TE>   The cloud may have lifted, but the adventure is hardly over.</TE>

<HD>'Alagazam's' demented cast spins a raucous carnival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unbridled flimflam energizes "Alagazam," freaking out in the
late-night slot at the Actors' Gang. Director Brent Hinkley and a
demented cast devour Adam Simon and Tim Robbins' tent-show vaudeville
with fearless perversity.</LD>
<LD>   Reworking the authors' 1985 "Slick Slack Griff Graff," "Alagazam"
wraps carnival circuitry around a symbolist post-World War II
America. Conflating Tod Browning's "Freaks" with elements of National
Lampoon, Grand Guignol and the San Francisco Mime Troupe, it takes
aim at the agitprop jugular.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Hoover's sideshow setting and music director David
Robbins' crack "Anarchestra" supply snake-oily atmosphere for the
opening attraction: fiery-fingered balladeer Johnny Storm (Cameron
Dye). A reversed viewpoint shifts us backstage, zeroing in on
Johnny's fellow "prodigies, oddities and oh-my-Goddities."</LD>
<TE>   That description comes from Cyrus T. Grifter (the superb V.J.
Foster). He, along with quack Milton Callabus Cork (Steven M.
Porter), carries the jingoistic banner until losing the curiosities
to commercial television's nuclear sway.</TE>
<TE>   This arrives via the Ramsens (Ned Bellamy and Lolly Ward as John
Cameron Swayze and Dorothy Kilgallen on LSD). The immoral imperative
subsequently implodes, like a self-swallowing sword.</TE>
<TE>   The designs are ripe, notably Rebecca Herron's costumes, and the
actors display unholy abandon. Favorites will vary; at the opening,
Andrew Wheeler, Angela Berliner and Gary Kelley wriggled off with the
house.</TE>
<TE>   The grotesquerie and social relevance achieve symbiosis only
intermittently, the energy slackening when the issues elbow out the
curdled humor. Still, if there is anything else currently playing
quite like "Alagazam," I'll eat a live chicken.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HBO Films narrowly avoided a strike that could have shut down the set
where Antonio Banderas is filming "And Starring Pancho Villa as
Himself" after signing a contract with Mexican technicians.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican Union of Film Technicians complained that "Pancho
Villa" was being made without a contract and that 18 workers had been
fired without cause. It named Banderas as a defendant in his role as
associate producer and sought to bar him from leaving the country.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the union denied that the labor complaint would affect
Mexico's already-battered reputation as a location for foreign films.
"These foreign companies have to talk to us before they come down
here and make these mistakes," union leader David Negrete said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Colombian vocalist Shakira swept MTV's first Video Music Awards Latin
America on Thursday night, taking five honors, including artist and
video of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The quirky singer-songwriter, who achieved broad international
fame recently with her first English-language album, "Laundry
Service," won in all five categories for which she was nominated. Her
other three awards were for best pop artist, best female artist and
best artist North, a region that includes Mexico, Central America and
the Caribbean.</LD>
<LD>   The only other act to receive multiple awards was Chile's La Ley,
which won for best rock artist and best group or duo.</LD>
<TE>   Other key winners were Juanes, another breakthrough Colombian
performer, for best male artist; Manu Chao for best alternative
artist; Mexico's Sin Bandera for best new artist North; and the Red
Hot Chili Peppers for best rock artist international.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami-based MTV Latin America sponsored the competition, which
honored rock and pop performers in 17 categories. Aside from the top
categories, awards were also handed out by region, corresponding to
the three large geographic areas served by the network. Votes were
cast by viewers from Sept. 7 to Oct. 7 via MTV Latin America's Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   The awards show, held at Miami's Jackie Gleason Theater, was
scheduled to air live in Latin America and on MTV2 in the United
States. The show was also scheduled for later broadcast through MTV
outlets in Europe and Asia.</TE>

<HD>Mirror's apology underwhelms Bing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most publicized Hollywood libel suits in recent years may
be headed back to court amid complaints that a British newspaper's
front-page apology to settle the issue was less than sincere.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles lawyers for wealthy American film producer Steve Bing
have threatened to revive his multimillion-dollar libel suit against
the Daily Mirror after its editor suggested that one needed a sense
of humor to fully appreciate the apology. Rival papers said the
apology was so groveling that it suggested being a parody.</LD>
<LD>   Bing, vilified in the British press last year for initially
disputing his paternity of actress Elizabeth Hurley's child, had
agreed to drop his suit in return for an apology from the Mirror for
publishing his phone number and urging readers to call to berate him.
DNA tests later established that Bing was the father.</LD>
<TE>   The tabloid appeared to have obliged Bing in Tuesday's edition
with a front-page banner headline that read: "A humble and sincere
apology to Mr. Steve Bing, philanthropist &amp; humanitarian." An
accompanying full-page article printed on Page 9 of the paper ran
under the headline, "We're Sorry, Steve."</TE>
<TE>   The apology initially satisfied Bing and his lawyers, who issued a
statement saying he was "delighted that the Mirror has set the record
straight."</TE>
<TE>   However, the heavy-handedly abject tone struck some as sarcastic,
a conclusion bolstered by the paper's placement of the retraction
opposite an op-ed piece headlined, "Why Americans Can't Understand
Irony or Sarcasm."</TE>

<HD>E!-bound: more 'Anna Nicole'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undeterred by scathing reviews and a precipitous drop in viewership
from its lofty premiere, E! Entertainment Television has ordered 13
additional episodes of "The Anna Nicole Show," to begin showing early
next year.</LD>
<LD>   The unscripted series, which chronicles the exploits of plus-size
model Anna Nicole Smith and her entourage, premiered in August to 4.1
million viewers, roughly seven times what the cable network averaged
in that time period.</LD>
<LD>   However, for the most recent Sunday, that audience has fallen to
1.5-million viewers -- a decline of more than 60%, but still an
improvement over E!'s usual tune-in. While some critics accused the
channel of exploiting Smith, network officials said the audience is
"rooting for her to turn her life around," noting that the show
helped E! post its highest-rated quarter ever among adults age 18 to
34, a youthful demographic that the channel targets.</LD>
<TE>   The current season of "Anna Nicole" will conclude Nov. 3.
Production will begin next month on the new episodes.</TE>

<HD>Rock 'n' roll dreams live fast and die hard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone with a dream should know this: If you work hard enough and
just believe in yourself, anything's possible.</LD>
<LD>   That, anyway, is the message Hollywood's been selling for decades
in movies and TV shows, the same one that brothers Frank and Vince
Rogala bought into when they abandoned frosty Mackinaw, Mich., for
sunny Southern California two decades ago in pursuit of their rock
'n' roll dreams. What happened once they got here, however, bears
little resemblance to the familiar Hollywood version, from "A Star Is
Born" through Mariah Carey's "Glitter."</LD>
<LD>   The Rogalas' experience has resulted in a riveting documentary,
"Won't Anybody Listen," by first-time director Dov Kelemer, a film
(premiering tonight on the Sundance Channel) that examines the
gargantuan gulf between the myth and the reality of life in the pop
music world.</LD>
<TE>   It paints with unyielding honesty a business in which music is
often treated as an afterthought, and in which the players rarely
know just how heavily the deck is stacked against them. Kelemer began
filming the Rogalas' band, Anaheim-based NC-17, with the simple goal
of producing a concert tape to sell to fans.</TE>
<TE>   As he monitored their progress, he watched (and kept filming) as
their career path took one harsh twist after another, down a
sometimes heart-wrenching, sometimes stabbingly funny, ultimately
disillusioning road that leads to riches and glory for a select few.</TE>
<TE>   Kelemer is sympathetic to NC-17's travails, but he never treats
the group as if it were the undiscovered Nirvana.</TE>
<TE>   He weaves black-and-white footage with color interviews,
performance and rehearsal shots with the band's six members, their
wives, girlfriends, parents, several entertainment attorneys and
record company artists and repertoire executives.</TE>
<TE>   Those execs talk about the staggering odds for commercial success.
One estimates there are 40,000 bands in Southern California alone;
another notes that of 400 to 500 major albums released each year,
maybe 20 will sell enough (500,000 copies) to reach "gold" status and
only a handful will break the platinum (1 million copies) barrier.
Only a small percentage of the acts that don't hit those numbers will
ever record another album.</TE>
<TE>   For those in the small minority who do land record contracts, the
same execs outline the music industry's financial practices that
charge bands -- through recoupable advances -- all expenses related
to making albums, putting them in a hole from the outset that fewer
still ever crawl out of.</TE>
<TE>   NC-17's members wrestle with the question of whether they simply
aren't good enough, although a bemused Frank Rogala matter-of-factly
thumbs through clippings of several enthusiastic reviews the band got
from newspapers and music magazines. NC-17 also gained national
exposure briefly as a winner on MTV's old "Basement Tapes" series and
as a "Star Search" victor.</TE>
<TE>   But the point of "Won't Anybody Listen" isn't how good NC-17 is or
isn't; it's how the music business works and how it doesn't.
Ultimately, the Rogala brothers realize that the reason they keep
knocking their heads against the wall is that they love playing
music. For some of their bandmates, that's not enough, and their
soul-searching adds a poignant element to the group's long and, on
many levels, fruitless journey.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary was shot largely before the Internet revolution
that has allowed more and more musicians to establish direct links
with fans and sidestep the hoop-jumping that was de rigueur for
aspiring rock 'n' rollers, so there's nothing on how that is changing
the picture for some.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the Internet and "American Idol," most would-be rock
and pop stars still struggle against the star-making machinery that's
at the heart of "Won't Anybody Listen."</TE>
<TE>   Kelemer's understated message is as pertinent to the dot-com music
world as it is to the steel-and-concrete record business: Dreams are
great and should be cherished, but pursue your art out of love; if
you're out for fame and fortune, rock 'n' roller beware.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Apart from "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," Martin McDonagh's plays
haven't set the theatrical world on fire, leading some observers to
dismiss McDonagh as a one-hit wonder.</LD>
<LD>   But his one hit remains wonderful: a play that can generate
poignancy, laughter and heart-pumping melodrama under the right
conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Many of those conditions are right in Anthony Caldarella's staging
of "The Beauty Queen of Leenane" at the Hudson Backstage Theatre in
Hollywood. This production -- incredibly enough, the play's first
professional outing in Los Angeles -- boasts a gifted and mostly
Irish cast and a detailed Victoria Profitt set that's correctly
scaled for a play that's set entirely within four walls.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the pacing and continuity between scenes was slightly off
during the reviewed performance. The audience began applauding -- as
if the play had just ended -- when there was still one scene to go.
This was hardly fatal; the production appeared to have the
ingredients that might fully jell later in the run.</TE>
<TE>   Helena Carroll plays Mag, a possessive mother in rural Ireland who
keeps her resentful 40-year-old daughter, Maureen (M.J. Karmi), in
servitude. Carroll is notably more rotund and less spry than Ann Gee
Byrd, who played the role in the Southland premiere at South Coast
Repertory in 2000; Carroll looks like a sneaky old owl. And Karmi's
fiery red hair suggests the inner passion roiling beneath her
squared-off countenance.</TE>
<TE>   Playing Pato, the gentleman caller who offers a ray of hope for
Maureen, is Tim Murphy, who played the same role at South Coast. He's
salt of the earth all the way, and Jason Killalee is an amusing
counterpoint as Pato's younger, ruder brother.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," Hudson Backstage Theatre, 6539
Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3
p.m., 7 p.m. Ends Nov. 23. $20. (323) 856-4200.</TE>

<TE>   Kipp Shiotani's staging begins with Gil (Ray Chang) and Ian (Chil
Kong) driving to Los Angeles in "Lost Highway" mode. They voice
misgivings about each other and the wedding to which they are
traveling, alluding to an unsettling secret involving the groom.</TE>
<TE>   This would be Adam (Michael Ordona), discovered sacked out with
fiancee Lynn (Esperanza Catubig) on the couch of their Los Feliz
apartment. Their dialogue suggests a missing second-generation thread
from "The Joy Luck Club."</TE>
<TE>   The travelers arrive, spouting quips like, "My dad said getting
married is like reading the same book for the rest of your life."
Their forthcoming revelation turns things downright grisly.</TE>
<TE>   Pelfrey is undeniably talented, demonstrating a flair for bilious
ribaldry. The tech is resourceful, with Isaac Ho's lighting and
Cynthia Q. Ignacio's props proving crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Chang's twitching stoner and Kong's deadpan misogynist are
alternately funny and affecting. Ordona takes a while to match
Catubig's fine interior work, but he nails his climactic confession.</TE>
<TE>   The play has its moments too, but the plot jump-cuts and stylistic
hybridization feel implausible in the immediacy of a 99-seat theater.
While "FrEAk StORM" is certainly original, Pelfrey's idiosyncratic
approach seems more suited to the cinematic arena.</TE>
<TE>   "FrEAk StORM," Victory Theatre, 3326 W. Victory Blvd., Burbank.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Nov. 17. $12-$14.
(323) 993-7245. Mature audiences. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Pass on ticket to 'Union Station'</TE>
<TE>   It's amazing how quickly stories can derail. The romances set
aboard trains in "Union Station," for instance, hardly get out of the
depot before running off the track.</TE>
<TE>   Written and directed by Chuck Rose, this trio of tales is being
presented at West Coast Ensemble on weeknights when the company's
acclaimed production of "The Grapes of Wrath" is not performed. A
stage is the only thing that the shows share, for "Union Station" is
a mere rehashing of plot contrivances, filtered through a sitcom
sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   In the first story, a clean-cut, square-jawed pharmaceutical
salesman (Larry Toffler) boards a New York-bound train at L.A.'s
Union Station, when, much to his consternation, he is joined by one
beautiful woman (Alyss Henderson) and then another (Diahann Klein).</TE>
<TE>   On a New York-to-Los Angeles train, a seemingly innocent encounter
between a young woman (Julie Petrosky) and a kindly, fatherly sort
(Jerry Kernion) takes a turn right out of "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Having been tangled in the first two stories, the train's
conductor (Mark Alan Walker) becomes the focus of the third: a
quickly wearying soap opera that reunites him with his former fiancee
(Tania-Lee Bayliss).</TE>
<TE>   Although Rose's staging is as haphazard as his writing, he is very
nearly rescued by a cast determined to root out whatever truth it can
in these ridiculous situations. But in the end, there's no salvaging
this train wreck.</TE>
<TE>   "Union Station," West Coast Ensemble, 522 N. La Brea Ave., L.A.
Tuesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 7. $15. (323) 525-0022. Running
time: 1 hour, 35 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Rewarding insights in WWI drama</TE>
<TE>   George Bernard Shaw wrote "Heartbreak House" with World War I
weighing heavily upon his mind, and the play reflects his frustration
with Europe's cavalier attitude in the face of that calamity. He
depicts a world frittering away its days in desire, vanity and the
pursuit of money, while distant thunder builds into a cataclysm of
falling bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all his perturbation, Shaw couldn't help but feel tenderly
toward his neighbors, viewing even the scoundrels with humor and
sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   A staging by Theatre 40 keeps these contrary impulses in almost
perfect balance, providing laughter and insight.</TE>
<TE>   The action takes place in an English manor house built to resemble
a ship -- a "house without foundations," as one character describes
it. In Jeff G. Rack's design, the house is thrown further off-kilter
by zigzagging walls and skewed doors and shelves.</TE>
<TE>   This is fitting symbolism for a story in which characters turn on
a dime, seeming to switch philosophies midstream and undergo
personality make-overs. The shifting perspectives make this play one
of Shaw's most challenging. But the story possesses an internal
logic, which director Stephen Tobolowsky patiently pieces together.</TE>
<TE>   The audience sees "Heartbreak House" through the eyes of Ellie
Dunn (Fleur Phillips), a young working-class woman who is invited to
the family home of Hesione Hushabye (Jennifer Parsons), the
free-spirited daughter of the eccentric, world-weary global traveler
Captain Shotover (Tobolowsky). Soon, the house fills with
representatives of all walks of European life, among them: a fat-cat
capitalist (David Hunt Stafford), a handsome layabout who fancies
himself an adventurer (Patrick Lander) and Ellie's pure-hearted,
innately wise father (Jack Gregory).</TE>
<TE>   In December, Tobolowsky will reprise his Tony-nominated "Morning's
at Seven" performance at the Ahmanson. Meanwhile, he's the
last-minute replacement in the role that sets this show's mood. He
brings an almost mystical sense of humor to the part, waving his arms
and waggling his fingers as if casting spells.</TE>
<TE>   "Heartbreak House," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, on the campus of
Beverly Hills High School. Thursdays-Saturdays, 7:30 p.m.; Sundays, 2
p.m. Ends Nov. 10. $18-$20. (310) 364-0535. Run time: 3 hours, 20
minutes.</TE>

<LD>"Oh, wow!" Sabina cried two days after she had made the announcement.
Rachel hugged her. Most of the barrels were almost full with all
kinds of books for children. She'd have to get the committee to stay
after school to sort the books and stack them in boxes in the school
library until the drive was over.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at this one!" Paul held up a somewhat worn book. " 'Ira
Sleeps Over.' I used to love this because I was just like Ira. I
needed my teddy bear or I couldn't go to sleep." He laughed,
embarrassed. "Now some little kid will learn to read from my book."</LD>
<LD>   "Look what I found," Rachel said, showing "The Book of Dinosaurs."
"Like, I could never read enough about dinosaurs." She began reading
to herself.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the week donations had slowed, so Sabina and her
committee decided the drive was over. Now they had to move the
cartons of books to where they could be distributed. It was a good
feeling that for each book their school was donating, an equal number
of new books would come from the publisher.</TE>
<TE>   "Well now, isn't this nice?" Mrs. Evans said a week later. She
held up a section of the school newsletter. "This is about you."</TE>
<TE>   The class gathered close to the teacher. It showed a photo of
their librarian surrounded by books. The headline read: "Students
Collect Hundreds of Books for Young Readers." A smaller photo showed
second-grade students in a classroom, each with a book in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Sabina grinned. Rachel said, "Way to go!" Paul and Matt did high
fives, and the rest of the class said they all deserved a treat.</TE>
<TE>   "Cookies and lemonade in the cafeteria," Mrs. Evans said, "for the
whole school!"</TE>

<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The opening of the Lifetime special "Women Rock! Girls &amp; Guitars" may
look a bit like an "American Idol" bit, with six women somewhat
awkwardly teaming on the disco-ish anthem "I'm Every Woman." But
there's one thing that makes it clear this is no "Idol" moment: These
women all sing on key.</LD>
<LD>   They ought to, given that they are Chaka Khan, Gloria Estefan,
Chrissie Hynde, Michelle Branch, Lee Ann Womack and, yes, even
Jennifer Love Hewitt.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps, though, the program (airing at 10 tonight) -- Lifetime's
third annual concert special supporting its Stop Breast Cancer for
Life campaign -- was misnamed. Only Hynde, Branch and Estefan wield
guitars, and that only part time, in this 90-minute show, which was
taped last month at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   And anything even remotely resembling rock is in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   The only truly rocking performances come from country singer
Womack on the frisky twanger "I Need You" and Khan soaring on Paul
McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed" -- most appropriately, as it was
written for Linda McCartney, who died of breast cancer in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the show scores not merely by spotlighting each singer
but by building an ad hoc community/support system of artists in
various combinations throughout the show. Duet pairings include
Estefan and Khan, Hynde and Womack, and Hynde and Branch.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt hosts as well as performs -- she's got a decent voice but
always looks like an actress playing a singer -- and Lea Thompson,
Fran Drescher, Dana Delaney and others drop in with pitches for
breast cancer awareness. They all rock metaphorically. If only they
rocked a little more musically.</TE>

<HD>'Charlie's' angle: Too smart for its own good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The truth about "The Truth About Charlie" is that it is easier to
sympathize with the reasons director Jonathan Demme decided to make
it than to actually enjoy the film that resulted.</LD>
<LD>   After a series of features ("The Silence of the Lambs,"
"Philadelphia," "Beloved") that were everything but lighthearted,
Demme was clearly ready for something different.</LD>
<LD>   A fan of Stanley Donen's slick, Paris-based, 1963 romantic
thriller "Charade" as well as of the French New Wave filmmakers who
were working in the city then, Demme decided to restore himself by
remaking the former in the style of the latter.</LD>
<TE>   Why not hang out in Paris, the most pleasant of cities, and, while
you're at it, why not put in all kinds of film-buff references, like
naming a hotel after Cinematheque Francaise founder Henri Langlois,
convincing New Wave veterans Agnes Varda and Anna Karina to make
cameos, even inducing the iconic Charles Aznavour to sing his own
songs. And why not turn the whole thing into a valentine for
"Beloved" co-star Thandie Newton, a beautiful actress Demme clearly
has a talent crush on. Even serious directors deserve to have some
fun.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappily, although Demme likely did have fun, too little of that
carries over to the audience side of the ledger. "The Truth About
Charlie" is excessively clever and minimally charming, so eager to
demonstrate its undeniable cinematic skills that it ends up
outsmarting itself, showing off for its own pleasure when it should
be trying to satisfy the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie" relies overly much on razzle-dazzle not just because it
doesn't have "Charade's" Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant to fall back
on. It's also because this kind of playful trifle is much harder to
execute successfully than it may appear. Despite using four
screenwriters (Demme, Steve Schmidt, "Charade" writer Peter Stone
using the pseudonym Peter Joshua and Jessica Bendinger), "Charlie"
has the kinds of problems with tone and likability that did not
plague the original.</TE>
<TE>   Newton plays Regina Lambert, returning to Paris after a Martinique
vacation. She's determined to leave the rakish Charles Lambert
(Stephen Dillane), her husband of but three months. Divorce, however,
proves not to be an option, as Charles has had the misfortune to be
murdered on a train.</TE>
<TE>   Even for a bride of three months, Regina turns out to know
surprisingly little about the deceased. She thinks Charles is a Swiss
art dealer, but when the French police show her a "Bourne Identity"
variety of passports belonging to him, she's completely at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing her even more is that a sinister trio begins following
her around Paris, apparently seeking the millions that the French
police inform her vanished into the air when her husband was killed.
"I do seem to be caught in a terrible mess," Regina says at one
point, underlining the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Because she's lost, beautiful and the possible key to a whole lot
of money, two men offer their assistance. Joshua Peters (Mark
Wahlberg in the Grant role) is so omnipresent and so cheerfully
helpful that it will be a given to everyone but Regina that he's not
what he seems. More buttoned-down is Mr. Bartholomew (Tim Robbins
channeling the original's Walter Matthau), a U.S. Embassy operative
who places a premium on secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Newton, in the part "Charlie" is built around, acquits herself
reasonably well as the attractive epitome of "decency, dignity and
gumption," but her classy appeal is not strong enough for a film with
the kind of excessive plot shenanigans this one prides itself on.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably serving as "Charlie's" main point of interest is the
dazzling camera work, hand-held in the best New Wave tradition, by
Demme's longtime cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. Fujimoto is a master
at creating stylish visuals and his views of off-the-beaten-track
Paris are arresting, but this, too, is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   For the reality is that "Charlie's" flashy look and unconvincingly
glib attitude eventually turns into as much of an irritant as an
attraction, prejudicing us against a project we should be loving if
only for its wonderfully eclectic soundtrack, featuring artists from
Malcolm McLaren and Cornershop to Angelique Kidjo and Manu Chao.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the script nor the direction nor the acting has been able
to make these characters into ones we want to invest ourselves in.
"The Truth About Charlie" is one very busy film, but it's really not
going anywhere.</TE>

<HD>Out of a drawer and into the limelight</HD>
<DH>Michel Faber mopped floors as his Victorian tale
languished. But there's a happy ending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael J. Ybarra</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When Michel Faber finished his first novel, "The Crimson Petal and
the White," a dozen years ago, he did what he always did with his
writing: He stuck it in a drawer. Faber had spent eight years
scribbling a rich and lovingly detailed story about a 19th century
hooker and her rise through London society, but he couldn't afford to
hire a typist to turn his longhand chapters into a manuscript
suitable to submit to a publisher.</LD>
<LD>   He never really wanted to do anything other than write but,
without a publisher, he always had to find other work. He mopped
stairs; he changed bedpans; he went on the dole, all the while
scrawling away on scraps of paper.</LD>
<LD>   "I wrote for 25 years without submitting my manuscripts," Faber
says. "I just put them away."</LD>
<TE>   But over the last five years, those manuscripts have come flying
out of his drawer with a vengeance, making Faber a literary star,
first in Great Britain where he lives and now on this side of the
Atlantic as well. "The Crimson Petal," which Faber dusted off and
revised a couple years ago, was recently published by Harcourt, all
834 pages, and has sent critics swooning (it also broke the toe of a
Scottish bookseller who dropped a copy on his foot).</TE>
<TE>   "A big, sexy, bravura novel that is destined to be surpassingly
popular," wrote Janet Maslin in the New York Times. "A banquet of a
book, a literary feast of such extravagance that you would have to be
a very picky person not to feel deeply satisfied by it," wrote a
critic for the London Sunday Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe," Faber says, sitting in a hotel lobby here
with his wife, Eva Youren, while on a book tour. "I think there must
be some huge mistake."</TE>
<TE>   At 42, Faber is tall and thin, youthful looking and pale, with a
mop of thick hair falling into his eyes. He makes easy eye contact
but has a habit of looking out the window when talking about his
writing, as if he were gazing into some other realm instead of an
empty street.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid that if I didn't take care of the narrative and
characters at all times, that people wouldn't last the distance,"
says Faber, who can sound confident about his work and at the same
time surprised that anyone else would share his opinion. "I wanted to
engage and pull people through so they wouldn't put it down. Do you
know what the most common response is? I hear from readers all the
time that it was pleasurable and painless and that they could have
used another 800 pages."</TE>
<TE>   Faber's story has proved as seductive as Sugar, the androgynous
hooker who resembles her literary creator in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   "But it isn't simple submission and depravity that Sugar
provides," Faber writes. "Submission and depravity come cheap. Any
number of toothless hags will do whatever a man asks if they're given
a few pennies for gin. What makes Sugar a rarity is that she'll do
anything the most desperate alley-slut will do but do it with a smile
of child-like innocence. There is no rarer treasure in Sugar's
profession than a virginal-looking girl who can surrender to a deluge
of ordure and rise up smelling like roses, her eyes friendly as a
spaniel's, her smile white as absolution."</TE>
<TE>   Sugar rents her body to the world but really lives in her own
world -- in the novel that she's writing about her life. That more or
less is Faber's own story.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected writing to support me," he says. And although he
says that he's enjoying his success, Faber can sound almost put out
by the fact that people are buying his books. "I don't regard myself
as part of any literary scene," he says to the window. "I'm very
unsocial. I love to just disappear into my own little world."</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Holland and moved to Australia when he was 7 with
his parents, who were both fleeing failed previous marriages. "I was
horrified," he recalls. "No one seemed to be speaking Dutch. I
remember telling my mother after the first day of school that I was
never going back because they were all speaking a terrible language.
I was always longing instinctively for snow and ancient architecture.
Australia never felt like home to me."</TE>
<TE>   While at the University of Melbourne, Faber read George Eliot's
"Middlemarch," was inspired by the discipline and craft of the plot
and decided to write his own Victorian novel. "The great Victorian
novels, Dickens especially, come to life before your very eyes," he
says. "Modern writers are suspicious of that kind of richness.
American suspense writers especially have had a big influence.
There's an idea that everything has to be functional and spare."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Faber spent working on the book, he married and
divorced, went to nursing school and worked in a rest home and a
hospice to support himself. "My favorite job was mopping stairs," he
recalls. "It was ideal: complete brainless work. You start at the top
and work your way down. You could just think of other things in
between."</TE>
<TE>   Most of what he thought about was writing.</TE>
<TE>   "All the work I did was for food and a roof," he says. "Apart from
second-hand records, there's never anything I wanted to spend money
on. If all you want to do is live in a room with a bed and a chair
and write books, it doesn't take much money. It's only when you get
interested in a life that it gets hard."</TE>
<TE>   Faber came out of his room at a boarding house long enough to read
two of his short stories to a neighbor named Eva.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave him feedback," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that this was the woman for me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We were still together the next morning," she says. "We've been
together ever since."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the couple moved to Scotland, settling in a hamlet of
seven houses about 40 miles north of Inverness. They live in a
converted railroad station. Six trains a day still stop at the
platform, and waiting passengers queue up outside Faber's window.
"Sometimes we ask them in if it's very cold," Eva says.</TE>
<TE>   When Faber moved to Scotland, his nursing license wasn't valid
there, so he found himself working as a nurse's assistant, changing
bedpans and the like, riding a bike 15 miles to work. When it snowed
he took a cab to work, and the commute consumed his paycheck. His
wife suggested that he try just writing and maybe even share his work
with others.</TE>
<TE>   Faber entered a short story contest six years ago. After he won,
Canongate Books in Edinburgh asked to see more of his work and, just
like that, he had a publisher. "It was as painless as that," Faber
says. "I still don't have an agent."</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, he has put out five books in Britain: a
short story collection called "Some Rain Must Fall," two novellas, a
science fiction story called "Under the Skin" that is set in the
Scottish Highlands and "The Crimson Petal." (The novellas haven't
been published yet in the U.S.)</TE>
<TE>   Once Canongate was on board, Faber decided to rewrite his
Victorian novel, which took two feverish years. "I was working 14
hours a day, seven days a week," he says. "That was too much. I
didn't have a very balanced lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   The difference between his unhappy married life and his happy
married life led to a major change in the tone of the book, he says.
For one thing, he decided not to kill Sugar at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "The first draft was pushing the idea that we live in a dark and
hostile universe and that life has a very nasty end that we can't
see," Faber says. "That reflected my own pessimism at the time. This
final version is much more good humored and generous."</TE>
<TE>   But anyone hoping for a sequel will be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very opposed to modern marketing culture, everything is
supposed to be boxed and labeled in a genre. I don't believe I'll
ever write another Victorian novel."</TE>
<TE>   Faber says that his only real interest other than writing is
music. His taste? "Anything that doesn't really have a place in the
marketplace," he says. "Anything that would give the Spice Girls bad
dreams."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Uta Barth has long trained her camera where most people forget to
look: the corners of empty rooms, the borders of windowpanes, the
ledges of bookshelves.</LD>
<LD>   At the Acme gallery, in a new series of photographs, her gaze
ascends from domestic life to hover amid treetops and power lines. It
is a bold and visually breathtaking body of work.</LD>
<LD>   The installation consists of several dozen identically sized
photographs hung at the same level, though in varying intervals,
around the perimeter of the main gallery. Each depicts a slightly
different view of what appears to be the same grouping of trees,
their bare top branches silhouetted against a cold, white sky.
Interspersed with these images are several flat, solid fields of
white, gray and muted color (a coral pink or a yellowed beige, for
example).</LD>
<TE>   The images vary subtly: Some are perfectly focused, others
slightly blurred; some are pixilated, some positivized; some
double-exposed and some softly tinted with color. Barth seems to be
playing with the notion of the photograph as an imprint -- an imprint
of light onto paper as well as an imprint of figure onto ground -- in
this case, skeletal tree branches against a white sky. In her
shifting, sharpening, softening, overlaying and reversing, it is as
though she's testing the malleability of that imprint.</TE>
<TE>   The result feels like a flickering of visual consciousness. As one
stands at the center of the gallery, images float in and out of the
white like phantoms. The character of the white itself also seems to
fluctuate, from limitless to flat, alternately signifying presence
and absence.</TE>
<TE>   There is something existential about this vaulted space: It pulls
one's attention out of the personal and raises questions about of the
nature of the emptiness beyond. The tree is a loaded symbol and its
appearance here suggests a sort of purgatory in which these questions
might be considered -- a space not unlike that of art itself.</TE>
<TE>   Acme, 6150 Wilshire Blvd., Space 1, L.A., (323) 857-5942, through
Nov. 16. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>

<TE>   Hello Kitty finally gets to talk back</TE>
<TE>   Hello Kitty is spending an evening at home. She turns off her
Hello Kitty-shaped television, takes off her Hello Kitty slippers,
nestles down beneath her Hello Kitty bedspread and reaches for her
Hello Kitty vibrator. As she settles in, however, certain limitations
become quickly apparent: Because she was created without any sort of
mouth, her vocal expressions of pleasure amount to little more than
meek, muffled murmurings beneath the earnest buzz of the vibrator. In
a fit of frustration -- this is presumably a chronic problem -- she
flings the device across the room.</TE>
<TE>   So begins Jaime Scholnick's hilariously pointed tale of one
girl-culture icon's quest to find a mouth -- a 10-minute live-action
video that is the centerpiece of her current exhibition. The journey
takes Hello Kitty from her native Japan, where she is refused by
surgeon after surgeon ("Western eyes! Yes! Bigger breasts! Yes!" But
a new mouth? "No!"), to Beverly Hills, where anything can be had for
a price, and back to Japan to begin her new, vocally liberated life.</TE>
<TE>   The video has a slick, cheerful visual style and an array of
charming performances. It plays, in the exhibition, on Hello Kitty's
own TV, in a re-created set of her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of outrage that simmers beneath the demure humor of the
video -- outrage that grew specifically out of Scholnick's
experiences living in Japan but that isn't limited to the scope of
that culture alone -- bubbles to the surface in several wall-size
chalk murals depicting Hello Kitty figures in ski masks waving
machine guns. Spare in composition, the roughly 4-foot characters
float against flat fields of black and hot pink. Impeccably rendered,
these murals are both playful and vicious. The guns appear to spew
only thin ribbons of color, yet the walls are scattered with violent
black marks resembling bullet holes, suggesting that power often
comes in deceptive packages.</TE>

<TE>   Taking pleasure in art's messiness</TE>
<TE>   Working from the premise that "all the best things in life are
gooey," a deliciously lighthearted little show at Dirt celebrates the
aesthetics of viscosity. Curated by artist Mery Lynn McCorkle, it
features five New York artists whose work simulates the slimy, the
sticky, the gummy and the gelatinous.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth McGovern's quirky sculptures -- two mounds of hardened
spray foam crowned with colorful plastic shopping bags -- explore the
tactile potential of common objects and fall somewhere on the playful
side of the junk-art continuum.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Rich Beall's contribution to the show is a small brigade of
translucent, jellyfish-like creatures that hang from the ceiling.
With delicate coloration and long, thin tendrils, they are at once
convincingly oceanic and wonderfully fantastical.</TE>
<TE>   The bulbous forms and slick, candy-colored surfaces of Victoria
Palermo's sculptures -- which look just like blown glass but are in
fact made from rubber -- convey an infectiously cheerful tone.</TE>
<TE>   The two most arrestingly sensual works, surprisingly, are those
made in the least tactile media. They are also, perhaps less
surprisingly, the two that involve food. Maggie Miller's "Passion" is
a short, looped video in which we see a hand squeezing a goopy red
substance that resembles cherry pie filling out of a hole in a small
pastry--an image that, while clearly benign in actuality, is weirdly
alarming in a video close-up. In Meredith Allen's photographs, we see
Popsicles shaped like the faces of cartoon characters held up to melt
beneath a summer sun, their unnaturally bright, sticky colors
dripping down to coat the fingers that hold the stick.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously childish and erotic, these two works proclaim
overtly what the rest more discreetly imply: that art is a messy
business -- and therein lie its most basic pleasures.</TE>

<TE>   When nature is institutionalized</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Beck makes large, painstakingly focused photographs of
plants in botanical gardens. It's nature photography in a sense, but
with a sociological bent: Beck's interest lies less in the visual
possibilities of the plants than in the institutional qualities of
the setting.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these qualities are subtly embodied in the work's formal
structure. The compositions are handsome but oppressively static.
Whether in a flower garden, a greenhouse or a desert setting, the
point of view is that of the obedient visitor. The camera hovers
consistently around eye level, faces each specimen squarely, reads
every name tag and doesn't stray from the designated path. Never does
one sense a temptation to dunk a hand into the lily pond or secretly
snap off a rare blossom.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this rigidity, however, they're very likable pictures. A
garden is a pleasant place to be under any circumstances, and this
simulation is no exception. A wall of hothouse orchids, a pond
overhung with jungle vines, a mound of blood red, cheekily named
"Cheerleader" tulips -- Beck's clear-eyed style reveals their charms.
Nor does he deny the considerable comfort to be found in the gardens'
logic of classification and order.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to pinpoint where Beck's sentiments lie in this
work. Is he being critical or celebratory? Ironic or sentimental?
Like the gardens themselves, however -- which exemplify both the awe
of nature and the desire to contain it -- the work seems at ease in
its own paradox.</TE>

<LD>Community Development Bank -- A headline in Thursday's California
section incorrectly characterized the federally funded Los Angeles
Community Development Bank as "city-run." The bank is an independent,
nonprofit organization. The city and county of Los Angeles oversee
the bank and administer its funds under an agreement with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Since the bulk of the
funding is earmarked for city neighborhoods, the city plays the
largest oversight role, but it does not run the bank.</LD>

<HD>Allergan Reports Loss Because of Settlement</HD>
<DH>Revenue jumps 24% to $350 million. But the company takes a
$118.7-million charge in a patent dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost of settling a patent dispute over one of its most promising
drugs left Irvine-based Allergan Inc. with a third-quarter loss of
$36.8 million, the company announced Thursday. But sales surged 24%
based largely on the company's popular Botox cosmetic treatment for
facial wrinkles.</LD>
<LD>   The loss amounted to 28 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of
$66.8 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to
$350 million from $282.1 million a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of Botox, also approved to treat muscle spasms, rose 43% to
$110.7 million in the quarter. In April, the Food and Drug
Administration approved Botox for relaxing forehead wrinkles. Through
the nine months ended Sept. 30, Botox sales totaled $311.5 million,
surpassing sales of $310 million for all of 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The company said Thursday that it also would seek FDA approval to
expand the use of Botox to include treatment for hyperhidrosis, or
uncontrollable sweating.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan said it had reached a "settlement in principle" with
rival Pharmacia Corp. and with Columbia University over patent
infringement claims in California, Delaware and Europe involving the
company's glaucoma drug Lumigan. It recorded a reserve of $118.7
million in the quarter to cover the expense. Allergan will owe future
royalties on the sale of Lumigan, but the settlement -- which
Allergan hopes will be signed within the week -- ensures the
company's right to sell Lumigan worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said the settlement "will
enable us to focus our efforts and resources on expanding our
eye-care franchise worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's Inc. agreed, saying Thursday
that the settlement "removes a significant uncertainty" surrounding
Lumigan's sales prospects. In spite of the dispute, Lumigan sales
rose 228.5% during the quarter to $35 million and stand at $88
million for the year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding settlement costs, Allergan's profit would have been 48
cents a share, which would have beaten analysts' expectations by 3
cents.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell $4.25 to $57.40 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Revenue Up 33%</HD>
<DH>Rise not enough to post profit. Loss narrows to $35 million
from $170 million a year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 33% increase in third-quarter sales to $851 million was not enough
for electronic commerce pioneer Amazon.com Inc. to report a profit.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle-based online retailer said Thursday that it lost $35
million, or 9 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30,
compared with a loss of $170 million, or 46 cents a share, last year.</LD>
<LD>   The improvement in sales was chiefly due to price reductions, said
Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, but it came at a cost.</LD>
<TE>   "We are committed to lower prices for customers even though it's
expensive for us," Bezos said during a conference call. The company
is making up for lower prices by boosting sales volume and by holding
the line on costs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the quarter, the company also lowered the threshold for
free shipping from $49 per order to $25. As a result, the company
spent $10 million on shipping in the third quarter compared with $2
million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We view shipping as really a part of the long-term investment we
made in pricing," Chief Accounting Officer Mark Peek said. The $25
cutoff for free shipping will remain in effect at least through the
holiday sale season, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales growth was particularly strong in the company's electronics,
kitchen and tools segment, increasing 25% to $129 million.</TE>
<TE>   Seven-year-old Amazon's only profitable quarter was at the end of
last year. Peek would not predict when the company would again be in
the black.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon shares rose 11 cents to $19.86 on Nasdaq in regular trading
before the earnings report was released. They lost about $1 in
after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Brokerages Are Urged to Provide Outside Research</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal and state regulators told Wall Street firms they should fund
independent securities research that would provide investors with
stock analysis without conflicts of interest, people familiar with
the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   At the first meeting of regulators and Wall Street brokerage firms
to discuss research reforms, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and
Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement chief Stephen Cutler
said securities houses should fund up to 20 independent companies
that would give investors access to their research.</LD>
<LD>   The regulators made the proposal Thursday at the meeting at the
SEC in Washington. Regulators and companies, including Citigroup
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are working
to settle the year-old investigations.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be a strong step forward. It's better than doing
nothing, but the investment banks' research should also continue to
be scrutinized," said Duke University law professor James Cox.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street stock research has come under fire as misleading and
biased in scandals in recent months, leading to calls for reform on
how analysts and investment banks do business.</TE>

<HD>Union Carbide Liable for Asbestos Illnesses</HD>
<DH>The Dow unit faces hearings to compensate victims for
injuries related to exposure in its plants and to products containing
calidria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dow Chemical Co.'s Union Carbide was found liable Thursday for
thousands of asbestos-related illnesses and deaths in a West Virginia
trial. It now must face a series of hearings to assess whether
damages are warranted in individual cases, opening the door to
millions of dollars in potential claims.</LD>
<LD>   The trial in Charleston was originally to have pitted more than
8,000 plaintiffs against 250 corporations, including Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. But after failing in a
last-ditch bid to get the U.S. Supreme Court to block the massive
case, most defendants settled or had claims against them dismissed.</LD>
<LD>   The trial went forward late last month against Union Carbide alone
on behalf of more than 2,000 plaintiffs. Some alleged they had been
exposed to asbestos in insulation used in Carbide's chemical plants;
others said they were exposed to Carbide products, such as joint
compound, that included calidria, a unique form of the mineral fiber.</LD>
<TE>   Union Carbide mined calidria in King City, Calif., its only source
in the world, until 1985 and sold it for use in a variety of
products. Carbide maintained that the calidria asbestos it sold was
safe and that it provided "gold-standard" protection for workers and
contractors in its plants, said spokesman John Musser.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company was pleased that the jury determined punitive
damages were not warranted in the product cases and that the
potential for punitive damages was limited to three times
compensation in the plant exposure cases. Still, Musser said, the
company is considering an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel that we had the opportunity to put forward our
entire case" because certain witnesses were barred from testifying,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a day and a half of deliberations, the six jurors
unanimously agreed that the chemical maker should compensate victims
for injuries related to asbestos exposure in its plants from 1945 to
1980 and to products containing calidria from 1964 to 1972.</TE>
<TE>   A series of smaller trials to decide individual damages is
expected to begin early next year. Plaintiffs with similar
allegations and injuries are expected to be grouped together, and
each plaintiff will have to demonstrate an asbestos-related injury
and identify the source and date of exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged injuries range from asbestosis, a disabling scarring
of the lungs, to lung cancer and mesothelioma, a fatal malignancy of
the lining of the chest or abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs brought in experts who testified calidria was not safe
and workers who described the hazardous conditions created by
frequent insulation work inside Union Carbide chemical plants, said
Paul Hulsey, a lawyer representing tradesmen and other contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "Contractors were exposed to the same dust as employees," he said.
"They had men cutting and shoveling up asbestos all day long....They
had no respirators. In some cases they didn't even know it was
asbestos. One man testified he had been using asbestos for two years
when they told him it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Dow Chemical's stock on Thursday fell $2.57, or 9.3%, to $24.97 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company's exposure is not limited to the West Virginia cases.
Dow reported to securities regulators in August that through June 30,
Union Carbide had received $298 million in asbestos-related claims,
including cases that were settled but unpaid, and had $285 million in
related insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The question of calidria's safety has come up only recently in a
handful of cases. Union Carbide was acquitted in two trials, one in
Texas and one in New York, where products containing calidria were at
issue, Musser said.</TE>
<TE>   The first verdict against the company in a calidria case came in
September in San Francisco. In that case, which also included other
defendants, a shipbuilder dying of mesothelioma was awarded $4.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Dow's $1-million share reflected jurors' assessment of the
culpability of its products relative to the other sources of asbestos
he was exposed to in the shipyard. Dow is appealing that verdict.</TE>

<HD>Firms' PC Networks Targeted in Piracy Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing their battle against online piracy, the trade associations
representing record companies, Hollywood studios, songwriters and
music publishers are urging the country's largest corporations to
prevent their computer networks from being used to make unauthorized
copies through the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The groups announced plans Thursday to send a strongly worded
letter to the chief executives of the 1,000 largest corporations,
asking them to prevent their computer systems from being used to
infringe copyrights through online file-sharing networks, such as
Kazaa and Gnutella.</LD>
<LD>   Promising to "aggressively enforce our rights," the groups warn
the executives that "the use of your digital network to pirate music,
movies and other copyrighted works ... subjects your employees and
your company to significant legal liability."</LD>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America has gone after at least
one company that used its corporate network to enable unauthorized
copying by its employees. In April, the RIAA announced that
Integrated Information Systems Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., which had
dedicated a computer on its corporate network to file sharing, had
agreed to pay $1 million to settle infringement claims.</TE>
<TE>   The latest letter comes two weeks after the music and movie
industries sent a similar missive to leaders of 2,000 colleges and
universities, urging them to prevent their campus networks from
supporting piracy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., benefiting from booming home
sales and refinancings, Thursday reported a 53% increase in
third-quarter earnings and boosted its profit projections and
dividend.</LD>
<LD>   Calabasas-based Countrywide, the nation's largest independent
mortgage firm, said net income rose to $228 million, or $1.74 a
share, from $149 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose
60% to $1.21 billion from $755 million. Countrywide began reporting
results on a calendar-year basis this year, so last year's comparable
quarter ended Aug. 31, 2001, while this year's third quarter ended
Sept. 30.</LD>
<LD>   Pretax mortgage banking earnings rose 39% to $256 million.
Countrywide Chairman Angelo Mozilo said a near-doubling in pretax
earnings from other businesses, to $108 million, was the payoff for
diversification into areas such as securities trading, banking and
insurance.</LD>
<TE>   Countrywide raised its quarterly dividend for the second time this
year, to 12 cents a share from 11 cents, and projected fourth-quarter
earnings of $1.75 to $1.90 a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call had expected $1.62 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide's shares fell 9 cents to $50.29 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft, Disney in Internet Alliance</HD>
<DH>Software firm sees the pact as luring people to MSN without
having to develop its own content.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn and Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Learning from the mistakes of chief rival AOL Time Warner Inc.,
Microsoft Corp. on Thursday announced a low-risk partnership with
Walt Disney Co. in the first of what could be a series of deals with
entertainment companies.</LD>
<LD>   The deal with Disney creates a jointly branded version of MSN that
gives consumers a modest amount of Disney content along with the
regular MSN offerings for the standard MSN monthly fee of $21.95.</LD>
<LD>   The service, called Disney on MSN, includes customized pages for
kids and links to Disney movies and activities. It became available
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant might expand its
relationship with Disney, and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said his
company is working on other alliances to secure more content for MSN
in exchange for driving Internet users to selected media sites.</TE>
<TE>   None of those deals would involve Microsoft getting into the
content business, as AOL did by buying Time Warner for $99 billion in
stock. AOL planned to tap Time Warner movies, music, magazines and
other content for its No. 1 online service, but that strategy has yet
to bear fruit: AOL's Internet entertainment offerings are bringing in
little profit.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between how we're going about it and how
AOL's going about it," Gates said in an interview. "Microsoft is
fundamentally a software company, but we know there's a lot more that
can be done to find the best content. We're in constant dialogue with
leaders in the media business."</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms of the Disney deal weren't disclosed. Analysts
surmised that Microsoft might be offering Disney nothing more than
free advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft is providing a highly trafficked medium on which Disney
can provide images," said Prudential Securities analyst John McPeake,
who owns Microsoft shares and recommends them. "I wouldn't be
surprised if it came down to bartering."</TE>
<TE>   The Disney branding came as Microsoft released MSN 8, a
significant improvement for the online service with 9 million
subscribers. MSN 8 adds junk-mail filters and MSN's first serious
controls to limit children's access to Web pornography, hate speech
and other categories that parents select.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner said his company has been
searching for several years for an Internet service provider partner
that would provide a home for Disney content. MSN was an appealing
choice because of its new system for parental controls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us the ability to deliver our entertainment and our
education and our Disney environment in a way that's completely
safe," Eisner said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   McPeake said the Disney pact "gives a wholesome blush" to the
revamped MSN that will help it compete against AOL, which long has
offered effective but less easily modified parental controls.</TE>
<TE>   Gates acknowledged that MSN will continue to lose money for some
time. But analysts said its real importance is as a link to future
services involving Microsoft software.</TE>
<TE>   "Its profitability as a stand-alone business is probably
secondary," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Charles Di Bona, who
doesn't own Microsoft shares. Bernstein does no investment banking
business with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney, the venture is an admission the firm should stick to
creating family entertainment instead of trying to be a major
Internet player, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney spent more than $500 million trying to build its Go.com
portal to compete with Yahoo, according to analysts' estimates. But
Go.com never attracted the vast audience Disney expected, and the
venture came to symbolize how vexing the Internet has been for
traditional media companies.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's Internet Group has retrenched in the last 18 months,
laying off more than 500 workers and leaving just a shell of the
site.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of marketing an all-purpose Internet portal, Disney now is
focused on building up its existing Web sites. Disney.com,
ABCNews.com and ESPN.com are among the most popular sites in their
categories. The Internet Group recently recorded its first quarterly
profit.</TE>

<HD>Drug Makers' Profits Drop as Generics Lower Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Elser</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON -- AstraZeneca, Merck &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and
Schering-Plough Corp. on Thursday reported that third-quarter
earnings fell as the arrival of cheaper generic drugs took sales and
orders away from their top-selling medications.</LD>
<LD>   AstraZeneca, Europe's second-largest drug maker, said net income
dropped 5% as demand for the ulcer treatment Prilosec declined in
anticipation of generic rivals in the U.S. next year. Meanwhile,
sales of the diabetes treatment Glucophage, made by Bristol-Myers and
Merck, plunged and Schering-Plough's revenue from the Claritin
allergy pill dropped by half.</LD>
<LD>   Wholesalers are cutting orders as they unload inventories of
medicines that are losing patent protection.</LD>
<TE>   Claritin may have cheaper rivals in the U.S. as early as December.
Prilosec faces possible competition next year, and copies of
Glucophage are already on the market.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca shares closed down 45 cents to $35.95. Merck closed
down as well, by 87 cents to $50.49. Schering-Plough shares rose 43
cents to $19.12, and Bristol-Myers shares rose 38 cents to $24.17.
All trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter net income at London-based AstraZeneca dropped to
$675 million, or 39 cents a share, from $711 million, or 40 cents, in
the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Prilosec sales fell 14% to $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Net income at New York-based Bristol-Myers, the world's
fifth-largest drug maker, fell 75% to $314 million, or 16 cents a
share, from $1.25 billion, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Sales dropped
12% to $4.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers also said it plans to restate $2 billion in sales
and earnings back to 2000 to account for inventory buildups at
wholesalers.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been reducing shipments this year to wholesalers
that stocked up on discounted products.</TE>
<TE>   Kenilworth, N.J.-based Schering-Plough's net income declined 29%
to $429 million, or 29 cents a share, from $601 million, or 41 cents,
in the year-ago quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sales rose to $2.42 billion from $2.38 billion.</TE>

<HD>Profit at Duke Tumbles 71%; Firm Plans to Slash 1,900 Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp. said Thursday that its third-quarter profit plunged
71% because of weakness in the U.S. economy, forcing it to cut 1,500
regular positions and 400 contract workers.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Priory said the move
will save Duke Energy about $100 million a year.</LD>
<LD>   "One of Duke Energy's strengths is our operating efficiency and
ability to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions," Priory said.</LD>
<TE>   Duke Energy shares Thursday fell 5.3%, or $1.06, to $19.08 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte-based company said net income for the third quarter
was $230 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $796 million, or
$1.01 a share, in the same period in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges, earnings per share were 52 cents. The consensus
forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call projected 57
cents for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell to $4.21 billion, down from $4.78 billion a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Duke also said it has been subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and a federal grand jury about its energy trading
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Duke Energy said it was advised in mid-October that the SEC has
formalized its inquiry regarding so-called round-trip, or "wash,"
trading, in which an equal amount of electricity is bought and sold
at the same price. Such trades inflate revenue and trading volume.</TE>

<HD>EA Posts Profit, Raises Outlook</HD>
<DH>The video game publisher's revenue rises 89%, beating
expectations, on strong sales of 'Madden' and other PS2 titles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bolstered by blockbuster franchises and growing consumer appetite for
video games, Electronic Arts Inc. posted record fiscal second-quarter
profit and sales that topped Wall Street's expectations.</LD>
<LD>   With a growing number of American households owning new game
consoles, the nation's largest game publisher posted net income of
$50 million, or 34 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of $33
million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call expected an average of 17 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue -- driven by stronger-than-expected sales of "Madden
Football 2003," "Medal of Honor Frontline" and "The Sims" -- was $453
million, up 89% from a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   "EA is a juggernaut," said Michael Pachter, director of research
at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   EA also projected record sales of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion
next quarter, based on expected strength of its holiday titles,
including "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," "The Sims
Online," "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "James Bond 007
Nightfire."</TE>
<TE>   For its fiscal year ending March 31, the Redwood City, Calif.,
company projected sales of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, up 33% to
39% from last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The company is benefiting from a bet made several years ago to
develop its key titles for Sony Corp.'s popular PlayStation 2 game
console, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the PS2 has outsold its competitors nearly 4 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "They're riding the PS2 momentum and are set up for a great
holiday quarter," said P.J. McNealy, analyst at Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The company presented a bullish outlook for the game industry.</TE>
<TE>   EA President John Riccitiello said in an interview that the
company expects overall industry sales of video and computer games to
grow an average of 20% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the market for PS2 games would grow by 25% to 30% to
more than $3 billion in North America, he said.</TE>
<TE>   EA estimated that the market for games on Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox
and Nintendo Co.'s GameCube would grow 20% to 25% next year, while PC
games would grow 5% to 8% in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The estimates contradict a more conservative projection offered
earlier this week by THQ Inc.'s chief executive, Brian Farrell, who
said the game market would grow 10% to 15% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell's comment triggered a sell-off Tuesday in game stocks. EA
shares dropped 7.7%, THQ's shares fell 36% and Activision Inc. lost
16.3% that day.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, EA fell $2.10 to $65.85 on Nasdaq but rose to $68.20
in after-hours trading. EA announced its results after the markets
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Although many analysts continue to believe in double-digit
industry growth, this holiday presents brutal competition for retail
shelf space.</TE>
<TE>   With hundreds of new games coming out this season, cautious
retailers are limiting how much exposure each game receives, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, retailers will favor consoles that have a bigger"
consumer base, McNealy said. "That means GameCube and Xbox will
likely be struggling to rise above the bottom shelf at retail."</TE>

<HD>At Fox, a Lot of Baseball, No New Hits</HD>
<DH>Scheduling is thrown a curve. Executives look to midseason.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Corie Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox's signature new show, "Girls Club," opens to the strains of the
pop song "Under Pressure." It could be the theme song for the entire
network.</LD>
<LD>   Fox is trying to rebound from last year's prime-time season, when
mainstays "Ally McBeal" and "The X-Files" lost their appeal, sending
ratings among 18- to 49-year-old viewers down 11%. The network's top
returning shows -- "Boston Public," "Malcolm in the Middle," "The
Bernie Mac Show" and "24" -- are strong but not strong enough to
sustain Fox without new hits, according to network executives and
media analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "Fox lives on buzz," said Jon Mandel, who represents some of the
biggest advertisers on television as co-chief executive of Mediacom
Inc. "And nothing this season looks buzzy."</LD>
<TE>   New shows constitute 45% of Fox's current fall schedule, a greater
percentage than any other network, including beleaguered Walt Disney
Co.-owned ABC. But even libidinous legal associates failed to fetch a
crowd when "Girls Club" premiered Monday night, making it Fox's
second heavily hyped disappointment after its Friday night
science-fiction western "Firefly."</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite clear we are going to have a lot of program failures,"
said Peter Chernin, president of News Corp., which owns Fox. "The
question is where are the successes?"</TE>
<TE>   So far they are hard to find because of Fox's $2.5-billion
contract with Major League Baseball. Ratings for the first four games
of the all-California World Series on Fox have been dismal.
Wednesday's contest between the Anaheim Angels and the San Francisco
Giants drew 22% fewer viewers than last year's fourth game. Some
analysts predict that Fox may be forced to give advertisers free
spots to make up for the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "No question. It is extremely challenging to try to rebuild a
network," said Fox Television Chairman Sandy Grushow, adding that the
network's commitment to air baseball's post-season adds to the
difficulty of attracting viewers by temporarily knocking off its new
shows. "We're huffing and puffing all summer to promote shows that
air for two weeks and then are preempted by four weeks of baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Grushow and the network's head of entertainment programming, Gail
Berman, say no one knows how the network may rebound until at least
three weeks after the World Series ends. They say they are optimistic
that the network's midseason shows, including an installment of the
summer sensation "American Idol," could lift Fox substantially.</TE>
<TE>   "After we are back up and running, we'll make the tough choices on
the shows," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Network sources already are speculating that "Girls Club" won't
last through Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Berman is seen as the Fox executive toting the network repair kit.
Responsible for developing Fox's lineup this season, her second at
the network, Berman is credited with cultivating the critically
acclaimed "24."</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, no question, we just wanted to keep our heads above
water," Berman said. "I believe in the shows we have this year.
Whether it is a seminal year, that is for others to decide."</TE>
<TE>   By and large, Berman's new shows are big, flashy -- and slow to
take off. She hired David E. Kelley, one of television's
highest-priced producers, to create "Girls Club" as a replacement
show for "Ally McBeal." She authorized producer Joss Wheedon, whose
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" effectively tapped into teen angst, to
spend $10 million to create the two-hour pilot for "Firefly," sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other one-hour dramas are doing better but are far from the
best in their time slots. One, "Fastlane," is a "Miami Vice"-style
cop show created by film director McG ("Charlie's Angels"). The
other, "John Doe," is an eerie drama with a stylish, if unknown,
star. The series reflects Berman's push to cut costs while producing
expensive-looking programs; it is being shot in Canada, where
production costs are lower.</TE>
<TE>   The network also saves money on its evergreen shows, "Cops" and
"America's Most Wanted," which continue to perform well at modest
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Berman will be relying on "American Idol" to fill in the schedule
gaps in January. "For the first time in a long time, this summer
[with 'American Idol'] we had a lot of young women [viewers]," Berman
said. In an emergency, she said she can turn to other non-scripted
shows such as "30 Seconds to Fame" and new versions of "Bachelorettes
in Alaska," "Temptation Island" and "Celebrity Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   An unlikely network executive, Berman, 45, spent most of her
career on the other side of the table, making shows. Before joining
Fox in 2000, she was an executive producer on "Buffy" and its spinoff
"Angel." As president of Regency Television, she was responsible for
"Malcolm in the Middle." Regency also produces Fox's "Bernie Mac" and
"John Doe."</TE>
<TE>   Regency founder Arnon Milchan said Berman's model for building
Regency was to do the opposite of whatever former agent Michael Ovitz
was doing at Artists Television Group. While Ovitz was breaking the
bank by paying top dollar for big names, Milchan said, Berman "went
to the creative people we could afford."</TE>
<TE>   Berman takes chances. Last season, off-color comic "Bernie Mac"
worked. "Greg the Bunny" and "The Tick" didn't. This season the
keeper is "Cedric the Entertainer Presents," a sketch comedy
half-hour with June Taylor-style dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our show was a tough sell," Cedric the Entertainer (born Cedric
Kyles) said in a recent interview on the set of his show.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the networks were interested in me doing a sit-com with a
family," he said, adding he wanted to do a sketch comedy and only Fox
has succeeded in that area, in prime time, with such shows as "In
Living Color." "Gail is a fan of that era of television -- Carol
Burnett, Jackie Gleason. With the network's young demo and the sports
programming, we thought I could find my audience."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who will be watching Fox closely are Wall Street
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The network is the key driver of News Corp.," said John Tinker,
managing director of Blaylock &amp; Partners, who noted that Fox's large
group of television stations is the company's biggest single source
of profit. "The stock is going to languish until they fix the
network."</TE>
<TE>   On the upside, Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said this
year's surge in television advertising sales is filling the coffers
at the network and the company's 35 television stations.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss at the network will be cut in half this year," Reif
Cohen said. Fox network lost $263 million last year, when low ratings
were compounded by a depressed advertising market.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers caution, however, that the network remains troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox, to some degree, has an identity crisis," said Steve
Sternberg, a TV analyst with Magna Global, a division of advertising
behemoth Interpublic. "There used to be something called the Fox
audience. But it lost its hits, got stuck with baseball and its new
shows aren't working. So what is the Fox audience?"</TE>

<HD>Health Net Earnings Up 32% Over Year Ago</HD>
<DH>Woodland Hills-based insurer benefits from increasing
premiums and dropping unprofitable lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health Net Inc., a leading managed-care company in California, on
Thursday reported robust earnings growth for the third quarter as it
continued to cull unprofitable accounts and benefit from strong
premium increases.</LD>
<LD>   Like other health insurers, Woodland Hills-based Health Net kept
its premium increases at or ahead of medical cost trends and pursued
an aggressive strategy of getting out of risky markets and lines of
business.</LD>
<LD>   Health Net's membership declined about 5% from a year ago, to 3.8
million nationwide, about two-thirds in California. Its Medicare HMO
rolls dropped 19% in the last year, and the company cut in half its
exposure in Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Health Net boosted its HMO enrollment in
Medicaid -- the government insurance for the poor and the disabled --
which has been profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net's third-quarter earnings were $69 million, or 55 cents
a share. That compares with a profit of $2.3 million, or 2 cents a
share, in the same quarter a year ago, when the company took special
charges of $79 million, mostly for a restructuring that included a
cut of 1,500 employees. Excluding special items, Health Net said its
third-quarter earnings were up 32% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter was $2.58 billion, about the same as a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expected earnings of $2.10 to $2.12 per share
for all of this year and $2.42 to $2.47 for 2003. Those projections
are in line with previous analyst consensus estimates.</TE>
<TE>   David Olson, a Health Net spokesman, said the company's premium
increases across the country will average 12.5% next year -- about as
much as expected health costs.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Health Net benefited from a surprisingly big
drop in the medical cost ratio, the amount spent for health services
divided by the premium collected. But that isn't expected to
continue.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net released its earnings after the close of markets
Thursday. Its shares were off 44 cents at $25.80 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slide on Outlook Concerns</HD>
<DH>Cautious guidance from firms is seen as a threat to
market's revival. The Dow index sheds 2.1%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slid Thursday, knocking the Dow index down 2.1% amid growing
unease about the outlook for corporate profits -- a concern that
threatens to thwart the market's recent revival.</LD>
<LD>   Third-quarter earnings have been beating Wall Street's greatly
reduced expectations, on average, but many corporate executives have
been cautious or outright dour in their outlooks for the fourth
quarter and for 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "Companies are making their earnings numbers through cost cutting,
which you can't do forever," said Russ Koesterich, equity strategist
at State Street Global Markets in Boston. "What's most troubling is
that in their guidance, companies are not showing any optimism that
revenue growth is going to return. To get anything approaching a bull
market you need top-line growth."</LD>
<TE>   In Thursday's trading, the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average
sank 176.93 points to 8,317.34. Analysts said short-term profit
taking also contributed to the drop: Through Wednesday, the Dow had
surged 16.6% from the five-year low it reached Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index shed 13.64 points, or
1.5%, to 882.50, and the technology-oriented Nasdaq composite sank
21.52 points, or 1.6%, to 1,298.71.</TE>
<TE>   In moderate trading, losers outnumbered winners 9 to 7 on the New
York Stock Exchange and about 8 to 7 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The setback for stocks spurred nervous investors toward government
debt, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
to 4.12% from 4.23% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In this week's crush of third-quarter earnings reports, companies
such as AT&amp;T and Xerox have been recording profit achieved largely
through cost reductions, while others such as United Parcel Service
and chip-equipment maker KLA-Tencor have warned that fourth-quarter
results could be disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit for the S&amp;P 500 is likely to be up about 6%
over a year earlier once all the company reports are in, according to
data tracker Thomson First Call. But analysts' expectations for the
fourth quarter are falling fast: Profit growth now is pegged at 17%,
down from 28% at the beginning of July. First Call expects those
projections to keep sliding.</TE>
<TE>   After cutting back on costs, companies have leverage that will
serve them well if and when the U.S. economy gathers steam,
strategists say, but the economic outlook remains questionable.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporate America has been on a treadmill for the last couple of
years, and I don't know how much leaner it can get," said Joseph
Kalinowski, chief investment officer at New York-based brokerage
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "Unless we see some decent economic
growth, we could be in for another lackluster reporting season in the
fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Duke Energy dropped $1.06 to $19.08 on Thursday after the utility
giant said earnings in the last quarter plummeted and warned of a
potential shortfall in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Microchip Technology fell $2.97 to $22.68 after a profit report in
which Chief Executive Steve Sanghi offered the kind of conservative
outlook that has become common.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry environment continues to be weak," Sanghi said,
citing flagging consumer confidence, the threat of a U.S.-Iraq war
and the effect the West Coast port lockout might have on holiday
sales.</TE>
<TE>   In the biotechnology sector, MedImmune fell $3.05 to $24.30 after
reporting a narrower-than-expected third-quarter quarter loss and
reducing fourth-quarter projections.</TE>
<TE>   In the hard-hit leisure sector, Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
Worldwide eased $1.20 to $22.72 after matching profit forecasts but
lowering guidance for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The profit picture is not all bleak. Market optimists call the
choppy, mild economic recovery reasonable, considering that last
year's recession was relatively tame. Custom chip maker LSI Logic
rose 77 cents to $5.81 after reporting late Wednesday that
third-quarter earnings beat expectations, thanks to a robust sales
gain. AT&amp;T Wireless  gained $1 to $6.45 after reporting an 18% rise
in customers from a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Gates May Consider Resolving Complaints</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr. and Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said Thursday that
he may consider making changes to the software giant's licensing
practices if they are necessary to bring its 4-year-old legal battle
with federal antitrust enforcers to a close.</LD>
<LD>   Gates' unusually accommodating remarks came after the Los Angeles
Times reported Thursday that the Justice Department is looking into
complaints that Microsoft may be violating provisions of a proposed
settlement with the government by withholding details about its
flagship Windows operating system from Sun Microsystems Inc., Red Hat
Inc. and other competitors.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry centers on whether Microsoft is using unduly
restrictive agreements to limit the amount of technical information
it shares with rivals, preventing them from creating software that
works as well with Windows as Microsoft's products. Windows runs on
more than 90% of all personal computers. U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly is expected to rule on the settlement any day.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview, Gates characterized the Justice Department's
examination as routine and said it posed no serious threat to the
company or the year-old tentative agreement. Gates added, however,
that he is open-minded about adjusting Microsoft's business practices
to resolve any complaints if the Justice Department insists.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is a very predictable event," Gates said. "A
competitor has an appointment to meet with the Justice Department" to
complain about the nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we've talked through with Justice what the NDAs are,"
Gates said. "All of that was crafted as part of an ongoing dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the Justice Department settlement, Microsoft
was required to make some technical disclosures through licensing
agreements, but there were few guidelines on the terms of those
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said both Microsoft and federal authorities were
motivated to preserve the settlement. That would explain why the
sometimes defiant Gates would be open to further negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But Ken Wasch, a Microsoft critic who heads the Software and
Industry Information Assn. in Washington, said the provisions in the
nondisclosure agreements indicate that Microsoft hasn't changed its
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no one in the industry who believes the competitive
landscape has changed one iota," Wasch said.</TE>
<TE>   In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares fell $1.97 to $51.23.</TE>

<HD>Mondavi Regains Profitability on 22% Increase in Revenue</HD>
<DH>The winemaker performed well despite competition from
imports that forced it to sell at a discount.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winemaker Robert Mondavi Corp. posted a fiscal first-quarter profit
Thursday after a loss in the year-ago quarter, when the Sept. 11
attacks depressed sales and the company took a charge for withdrawing
from its winery exhibit at Disney's California Adventure.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakville, Calif.-based company reported net income of $8.2
million, or 50 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 30,
compared to a loss of $2.5 million, or 15 cents, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The loss included $3.8 million in charges to write down inventory
and $11.2 million in restructuring when it turned over control of its
winery attraction to Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue grew 22% to $98.6 million from $80.9 million, reflecting a
25% increase in sales volume, albeit at slightly lower prices.
Mondavi's margins were trimmed as more wine was diverted into the
lower-priced jug wine market, and the company was forced to spend
more to promote its luxury wine brands.</TE>
<TE>   Mondavi stock rose 86 cents to close at $31.39 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, analysts said Mondavi fared well, given the amount of
lower-priced foreign wine flooding the U.S. market. To better
compete, and stave off having to discount, the company will launch a
new advertising campaign in coming weeks, a move analysts say could
have been made sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are moving in the right direction," said Leonard
Teitelbaum, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities. Company
executives are "putting more marketing muscle behind their brands."</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, Mondavi reported net income of $9.5
million, or 58 cents a share, up from $8.2 million, or 50 cents, a
year earlier. These results exceeded analysts expectations by about
10 cents</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, Mondavi still expects to earn $2.55 to $2.60
per share, in line with analysts' forecasts.</TE>

<LD>Tyco International Ltd. restated $133 million in profit, primarily at
its ADT security-systems unit. Its shares rose 11% after attorney
David Boies said his accounting review isn't likely to uncover "a
very large fraud."</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Tyco, which reported a $1.7-billion quarterly loss, have
plunged amid allegations that the company misled investors about its
earnings and liquidity. Tyco's shares rose $1.55 to $15.49 on the New

<LD>Negotiators for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and
the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, sat down with a federal mediator for the first
time since contract talks broke down last month, leading to a
crippling 10-day shutdown of all West Coast commercial ports.</LD>
<LD>   Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, called the two sides together in San Francisco
and asked them to agree not to discuss negotiations with the media.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations, which began in May, bogged down on the introduction
of labor-saving technology. The port closure, which followed alleged
union slowdowns, resulted in a massive backlog of container ships,
which terminals are still trying to clear.</LD>

California retailer that caters to young women, after the company
said earnings plunged 21.5% and offered sales projections that caused
at least one analyst to lower his earnings expectations for the year.</LD>
<LD>   Brisbane, Calif.-based Bebe said earnings fell to $5.1 million, or
20 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. That
compares with $6.5 million, or 25 cents a share, in the same period
last year. Analysts were expecting earnings of 22 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 3% to $73.8 million, from $73.6 million the year
before. Same-store sales, a key industry indicator, dropped $10.3%.</LD>
<TE>   The company blamed the lower-than-expected sales on lower prices.
Bebe's shares fell 61 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq.</TE>

contrasted with a loss of $10.7 million a year earlier.</LD>

<HD>AT&amp;T, PacBell Duke It Out</HD>
<DH>War of words comes as the phone companies vie for customers
that traditionally belonged to the other -- often by using lines
leased from their rival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gloves came off Thursday as AT&amp;T Corp. pounded rival SBC
Communications Inc. for "whining" and offering "chicken little, sky
is falling rhetoric" about regulations that SBC blamed for much of
its 15% drop in third-quarter net income.</LD>
<LD>   The long-distance giant also said it was "absurd" for SBC to
challenge regulatory scrutiny "in a year when it hit a shameful
milestone of $1 billion in announced fines, penalties and consumer
overcharges."</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T's unusually harsh comments came after SBC, which owns Pacific
Bell and local networks in 12 other states, said its quarterly
earnings fell to $1.7 billion largely because federal and state
regulations force it to lease local lines to competitors at prices
well below maintenance costs for those lines.</LD>
<TE>   SBC said in a follow-up statement that AT&amp;T's reaction is
unsurprising given its "self-interest in preserving an unsustainable
model where it invests nothing, leases a network at below cost and
pockets all the money."</TE>
<TE>   The competitive heat is rising as SBC prepares to offer
long-distance service in California, the nation's biggest such
market, valued at up to $12 billion. AT&amp;T already has started
offering local service to PacBell customers.</TE>
<TE>   SBC, Verizon Communications Inc. and other local phone service
providers launched an aggressive lobbying campaign last spring to
persuade federal officials and state agencies across the country to
change the rules that govern competition and rates.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Chairman Edward E. Whitacre Jr. told Wall Street analysts in a
conference call that the "destructive effects" of such rules have
allowed the two biggest long-distance carriers -- AT&amp;T and WorldCom
Inc. -- to invade SBC territories in California and four Midwest
states and "cherry-pick high-revenue customers," those most likely to
order extra services.</TE>
<TE>   Those five states, each with local networks controlled by SBC,
have the country's lowest lease rates, he said, and the two companies
have won 75% of the 751,000 local lines SBC lost in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for instance, PacBell must lease its local home
lines and switches to competitors at a wholesale rate of about $13.50
a customer while, it contends, it costs PacBell as much as $27 a
customer to maintain those lines and switches.</TE>
<TE>   "In every case," Whitacre said, "we keep the cost of maintaining,
repairing and provisioning the network."</TE>
<TE>   But AT&amp;T would hear none of it, stating that SBC has "continued
its laborious drumbeat of whining about laws that Congress put in
place to bring competition, choice and lower prices to local
telephone consumers."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, PacBell never provided a cost study that state regulators
had demanded before they set interim lease prices in May.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T said SBC's complaints failed to highlight its 65% growth in
high-speed telephone lines "and the 318,000 long-distance lines
gained from AT&amp;T and other long-distance companies."</TE>
<TE>   "This quarter, SBC also took multimillion-dollar charges against
earnings for work force reductions and unprofitable international
investments," AT&amp;T said. "It's time for SBC to start competing and
stop blaming others for its self-imposed business failures."</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T spokesman H. Gordon Diamond said that whereas his company
pays wholesale prices for local customers, regional phone companies
such as SBC get discount prices for long-distance lines that AT&amp;T and
other long-haul carriers must provide.</TE>
<TE>   Some California Public Utilities Commission members are openly
skeptical of SBC's claim that onerous regulatory policies are to
blame for the company's flagging performance.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 1 letter to Whitacre, PUC President Loretta M. Lynch
and member Carl W. Wood said, "We have not seen any evidence in
California that regulation is causing SBC PacBell financial
hardship."</TE>
<TE>   Whitacre said a poor economy and other pressures also hampered
SBC's third-quarter earnings, which amounted to 51 cents a share. The
San Antonio-based company earned $2 billion, or 59 cents a share, for
last year's third quarter. Sales dropped 5.5% to $12.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding SBC's proportionate share from its 60% stake in its
Cingular Wireless joint venture, the firm earned $1.8 billion, or 53
cents, on sales of $10.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, on average, expected earnings of 54 cents a
share, according to a Thomson First Call poll.</TE>
<TE>   SBC shares fell 20 cents to $25.65, and AT&amp;T dropped 29 cents to
$13.11. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>SEC Expected to Select Webster to Head New Oversight Panel</HD>
<DH>Sources say ex-chief of FBI, CIA will be chosen over John
Biggs for the accounting board post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster has been tapped to
lead the new accounting oversight board designed to clean up the
epidemic of accounting scandals, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   With the selection of Webster, Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt hopes to close a clumsy selection process
that already has brought criticism over the public consideration,
then rejection, of retiring TIAA-CREF Chairman John Biggs.</LD>
<LD>   Webster's appointment will be confirmed today when SEC
commissioners are scheduled to vote publicly on the new five-member
Public Corporation Accounting Board, people familiar with the process
said.</LD>
<TE>   SEC Commissioner Harvey Goldschmid requested the public vote so
the selection of the board's other members would be held in open
session, officials said. Pitt, criticized for his handling of the
selection process, had said he expected the vote to be in private.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt earlier this week asked Webster, 78, to consider taking the
accounting job. Democratic commission members Goldschmid and Roel
Campos -- who have been pushing Biggs for chairman -- are outnumbered
by the SEC's three Republicans, who are backing Webster, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based TIAA-CREF is a big pension and mutual fund company
that has been a leading voice in the corporate reform movement, which
is pushing for tighter controls over the relationship between
accountants and the companies they audit.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of chairman became a political battleground as
Democrats backed Biggs, 66, an advocate of stricter accounting rules,
while the accounting industry and some Republicans said he would
burden the industry with too many rules.</TE>
<TE>   Congress created the accounting board to restore investor
confidence after financial scandals at Enron Corp. and other firms.
It will have the power to discipline accountants, inspect accounting
firms and consider new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats say disarray over the accounting board shows that
Pitt and the Republicans are wavering on the crackdown on corporate
malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday with The Times, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.) said the vote was a big test for Pitt because it would show
whether he wants real reform. Voting for Webster would indicate that
Pitt has caved in to the accounting industry, said Sarbanes, chief
architect of the legislation that created the oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing Webster over Biggs would be a "big blow" to investors, he
added. Though well-respected, Webster lacks accounting expertise, the
senator said.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Bill Webster," Sarbanes said.</TE>
<TE>   "But he's certainly not an expert in this field."</TE>

<HD>Unocal Profit Falls on Charges</HD>
<DH>A decline in North American production also helps push net
income down 2.9%. But the explorer is aided by higher oil prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Segundo-based Unocal Corp., which explores for oil and natural gas
around the world, reported slightly lower third-quarter income
because of a decline in North American production and charges for
environmental cleanup and litigation.</LD>
<LD>   Net income slipped 2.9% to $99 million, or 41 cents a share, from
$102 million, or 42 cents a share. Net income for the latest quarter
included $22 million in charges from environment cleanup and
litigation and $5 million related to hedging activities. The year-ago
quarter included a similar level of charges.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal posted operating earnings, excluding special items, of $126
million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $127 million, or 52 cents
a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted after-tax operating
earnings fell just short of the 54-cent average of analyst
predictions by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Third-quarter revenue dropped nearly 19% to $1.29 billion from
$1.58 billion. After the report was released, Unocal's stock dipped
83 cents to close at $28.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal said it benefited from higher oil prices and increased
production at international oil and gas properties. But earnings were
hurt by depressed natural gas prices during the quarter and a drop in
North American production of natural gas and natural gas liquids to
an average of 237,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 288,000
barrels in the third quarter of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Production fell primarily because of a continuing depletion of
natural gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico and temporary shutdowns from
gulf storms, Unocal President Timothy H. Ling said.</TE>

<HD>Viacom Swings to Profit on Ad Sales</HD>
<DH>The media giant reports strong advertising growth at its
stations and networks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant Viacom Inc. reported Thursday a steep improvement in net
income for its third quarter, fueled by broad advertising increases
at its TV and radio stations and broadcast and cable networks.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom's net income was $640.3 million in the quarter, or 36 cents
a share, contrasted with a loss of $190.4 million, or 11 cents, in
the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the company had relatively easy comparisons to beat
because of last year's anemic third quarter, when advertisers pulled
back on spending after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Viacom's results also were helped by changes in accounting rules
this year that lowered its amortization expenses and by a
$355-million charge in last year's third quarter against operating
income. Excluding these items, net income increased 17% in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company derives about half of its revenue from advertising,
making it more reliant on Madison Avenue than any other entertainment
conglomerate. And questions about Viacom's ability to sustain
advertising growth amid the current economic uncertainty and the
potential for war with Iraq contributed to a cool reception on Wall
Street. Viacom Class B shares fell $2.88, or 6%, to $44.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company owns the CBS and UPN networks; cable
channels MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, BET and Showtime; radio powerhouse
Infinity; Paramount Pictures; publishing house Simon &amp; Schuster; and
Blockbuster. In the last year, Viacom has become the world's most
valuable entertainment company in stock market value, surpassing
rival AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom President Mel Karmazin said during a conference call with
analysts Thursday that advertising would continue to rebound in 2003,
when Viacom expects its revenue growth percentage to be in the
mid-single digits.</TE>
<TE>   "Our growth is very sustainable," Karmazin said. "In 2002, we are
rocking big time. We'll be able to make some ... acquisitions."</TE>
<TE>   The company would not elaborate on its acquisition plans, but
Chief Financial Officer Rich Bressler noted that, with cash flow of
$1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, "we'll be taking
advantage of our balance sheet and other people's woes."</TE>
<TE>   Cable networks are one of Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone's
favorite businesses, and operating income at the cable group rose 21%
to $510.8 million in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin said advertising was up across all the company's
operations. He also singled out the growth potential in the TV
station group. Karmazin said profit margins at its station group,
historically the worst-performing among the large network owners,
jumped to 33% this quarter, up from 21% last year.</TE>
<TE>   He said CBS' strong ratings and the stunning success of the crime
drama "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" would continue to drive up its
advertising rates.</TE>
<TE>   For the first nine months, Viacom's net income was $73.3 million,
contrasted with a loss of $181 million for the corresponding period
last year. Revenue increased slightly to $17.8 billion for the nine
months from $17.2 billion a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Blocked by Union Lobbying</HD>
<DH>Grocery workers persuade the Inglewood council to ban the
nonunion retailer from building a 'super center' in the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland and Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organized labor won a key battle this week in an all-out effort to
limit Wal-Mart's expansion in California, successfully lobbying the
Inglewood City Council to block the nonunion retail giant from
building a super center in that city.</LD>
<LD>   The union representing local supermarket clerks, which recently
hiked dues to create a $3-million war chest to fight Wal-Mart's
expansion in Southern California, is now pushing a similar effort in
the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "The battle is on," said Rick Icaza, president of Local 770 of the
Union of Food and Commercial Workers, which represents 20,000 local
supermarket workers. "We're not going to give up what it's taken us
40 years to achieve."</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently announced plans to build at least 40
super centers in California over the next four to six years, bringing
the company's giant discount-plus-grocery stores to the state for the
first time. The food workers union says those stores directly compete
with union supermarkets and could erode the high wages and benefits
paid to its members.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart officials said they have not yet determined how they will
respond to the ordinance passed on a 4-1 vote by the Inglewood
council Tuesday. The measure does not specifically name Wal-Mart but
bars construction of retail stores that exceed 155,000 square feet
and that sell more than 20,000 nontaxable items, such as food and
pharmacy products -- criteria that apply to few if any retailers
other than Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not accepting that this ordinance is permanent yet," said
Robert S. McAdam, Wal-Mart's vice president for state and local
government relations. "It may mean that we'll launch a referendum or
that we will seek its repeal."</TE>
<TE>   Council members who voted for the ordinance could not be reached
for comment. Inglewood Councilwoman Judy Dunlap said she opposed the
measure on procedural grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood ordinance is the first of its kind in Los Angeles
County, Icaza said, but Wal-Mart has fought similar battles
elsewhere. The Martinez, Calif., City Council passed a like measure
last month.</TE>
<TE>   In Inglewood, Wal-Mart opened discussions for a store in a new
development near the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to tailor it [the ordinance]," Icaza said, "so that it
wouldn't impact someone like Costco," which operates a union store in
Inglewood. "We're really aiming at the super centers. A Wal-Mart
comes in and uses the grocery items as loss leaders to get the people
to come in."</TE>
<TE>   Costco Wholesale Corp. President and Chief Executive James
Sinegal, however, said his company opposes the measure on principle,
saying government should not restrict the retailing options open to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Unions have long argued that Wal-Mart stores depress local
economies because many workers are part-time and are paid slightly
above minimum wage. About two-thirds of Wal-Mart employees do not
receive health benefits, taxing local health services, Icaza said.</TE>
<TE>   In its ordinance, Inglewood cites the larger stores' greater
burdens on city services and negative effect on the "community's
character and aesthetics" as the reasons for the measure.</TE>
<TE>   But McAdam said those claims are a cover for a pro-union agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard all of these various arguments a million times,"
McAdam said. "There is no evidence that crime or any other issue is
somehow more attendant to a large-scale business than a series of
small-scale businesses."</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart has fought referendum campaigns across the country to
beat back what it sees as union-sponsored laws restricting consumers'
options.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Wal-Mart sponsored and won a referendum in Calexico,
Calif., overturning a measure aimed at preventing retailers from
opening a Wal-Mart-size discount and grocery store. And in Las Vegas,
after Wal-Mart battled the city's 1999 anti-super-center law, the
city repealed the measure and passed a far less restrictive one.</TE>
<TE>   "As a general principle, we don't like to be told what kind of
merchandise we can offer our customers," McAdam said. "We would
probably look at serving those same customers in a different location
outside of that community."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the supermarket clerks union pushed aggressively
for a state law that would have prohibited stores 150,000 square feet
or larger from devoting 10% or more of their space to groceries.
Although the measure eventually passed the state Legislature, it was
vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>

<HD>Ultimate Sacrifice, Ultimate Insult</HD>
<DH>Struggling for benefits, a fallen Marine's mom wonders:
Must the little people always pay?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John W. Flores</AU>
<BD>John W. Flores is writing a biography of Marine Sgt.
Alfredo Gonzalez.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was 34 years ago that 21-year-old Marine Sgt. Alfredo Gonzalez of
Edinburg, Texas, died while defending his platoon from enemy rocket
fire during an ambush in Hue City, Vietnam. It was the opening
volleys of the horrific Tet offensive. Gonzalez was posthumously
awarded the Medal of Honor a few months later in a ceremony at the
White House.</LD>
<LD>   He was Dolia Gonzalez's only child; she had reared him as a single
mother, and since his death she has lived alone.</LD>
<LD>   She works even now as a waitress in the restaurant at a motel, the
Echo, in her little border town. Photographs and newspaper stories
about Sgt. Gonzalez are all over the walls of the restaurant dining
room, and she is something of a celebrity among the townspeople.
Recently, she has even been a spokesperson for Tony Sanchez, the
first serious Latino candidate for governor in Texas history.</LD>
<TE>   With the Bush administration coiled and ready to strike against
Iraq, Gonzalez remembers what happened to her boy. And she offers a
solemn, frequent refrain: "My boy was killed in Vietnam, and so were
many young men from south Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. Freddy was
proud to be a Marine and he gladly put his life on the line. Later,
many years later, the truth about Vietnam came out -- that many of
those young Americans should not have had to die as they did. It was
not an essential sacrifice, we've been told by former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is not bitter. She learned decades ago to roll with the
sometimes cruel blows of life. She is somehow resilient and hopeful,
even in the midst of the chaos and confusion that have permeated much
of American society since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   She worries about the 300-plus sailors on board the U.S. destroyer
Gonzalez, a highly advanced warship carrying Tomahawk missiles that
was named for her son several years ago. Over the years she has come
to view these sailors as a part of her family. "I call them 'my boys'
and they call me Mom. I don't want anything to happen to them. That's
why I hope [authorities] will find a diplomatic solution to this
problem with Saddam. Let the United Nations do its work. But for
God's sake, let's not do what they did in Vietnam."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has never experienced war as a soldier, airman,
sailor or Marine. He was one of many privileged sons of power able to
secure havens in the stateside National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Young men like Freddy -- Latinos and blacks, mostly poor, with
little or no political influence -- were sent in waves to fight. Some
called them "cannon fodder" because of the disproportionately high
casualty rate among minorities on tours of duty in war zones. These
men also racked up a much higher percentage of Medals of Honor,
Silver Stars, Bronze Stars and other top awards for valor in combat.</TE>
<TE>   Dolia Gonzalez says she has no quarrel with those like Bush who
come from wealthy families. But she is upset about a couple of things
these days: Not only is the administration gearing up for a
potentially catastrophic conflict in the Middle East, but it also is
pushing to cut vital veterans' benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, when Bush's father was president, the Veterans
Administration cut off the survivor benefits that she had been
receiving since her son's death, saying she could not both work and
receive benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "I have appealed over and over to have them restored, but nobody
will work with me. They just basically always shut the door in my
face," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Without these benefits, Gonzalez must work full time. "I am 73
now, and I work as a waitress. It's the only job I know. But my
health won't hold out forever. Then what?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is also concerned that she won't be able to afford the
expensive medications that come with the maladies of time, especially
if Bush has his way in cutting Medicare, as has been proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like these rich people want us poor people to just dry
up and blow off into the sunset like tumbleweeds or something. I
guess then we'd be out of their way," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez still firmly believes in the clarion call to volunteerism
and patriotism from President John F. Kennedy in his 1961 inaugural
address: " ... ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you
can do for your country."</TE>
<TE>   It was a statement of purpose that helped propel millions of young
men and women into national volunteerism and the service of their
country, including her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not want anything handed to me. That is why I work and do
not ask for anything other than what I work for, and what my son
earned by giving his life," she says. "Before he died he sent me a
letter and said he was going to come back and take care of me and
build a big house for us to live in. He never got that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Dolia Gonzalez hopes to spread the word that people can
empower themselves to bring about change.</TE>
<TE>   "We -- the common, average Americans -- are the ones who suffer
when war is declared, not those who declare it. We are the ones who
give our children, never to see them again. We are the ones who pay
the bills of war. And we are the ones who will keep on paying," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the soldiers and Marines in that daily battle. We can
either stand up and fight with honor and courage and defend our loved
ones and ourselves, or run away in disgrace and lose everything."</TE>

<HD>Ammunition to Fight the NRA</HD>
<DH>Foes of easy access to guns get new firepower from sniper
and new movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail
address: arianna@ariannaonline .com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In mayhem-happy Hollywood, it's axiomatic that the road to big box
office is paved with dead bodies. But what becomes of this cinematic
bleed-motif when the blood being spilled is all too real -- and the
film being screened is a withering indictment of the American culture
of violence?</LD>
<LD>   We're about to find out, thanks to the eerie synchronicity that
has the nation's attention riveted on the capture of two suspects in
the sniper shootings at the same time that Michael Moore's "Bowling
for Columbine" opens in movie houses across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The horror in Maryland, Washington and Virginia over the last
three weeks makes every frame of "Bowling," Moore's blistering
exploration of the U.S. obsession with guns, resonate with relevance,
frustration and rage.</LD>
<TE>   If you've ever found yourself watching the news and wondering what
kind of insane country makes it so easy for a madman to arm himself
with weaponry that allows him to blithely mow down his human prey
from up to 500 yards away, take a look at this film.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring Moore's trademark blend of provocative social satire and
deadpan humor, it's filled with memorable moments that, in their own
absurd way, make a dent in the formidable task of answering that
question.</TE>
<TE>   These moments include: a stop at a Michigan bank that gives away
high-powered rifles to customers opening accounts; a barbershop that
sells ammo; and an ambush interview with National Rifle Assn.
President Charlton Heston.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the most trenchant -- and timely -- aspect of the film is
its look at the NRA's in-your-face tactics, brought chillingly to
life with footage from a pro-gun rally that the group defiantly
decided to hold in Colorado just 10 days after the Columbine
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA's mind-set is particularly pertinent today as we watch the
organization -- and its gun-loving pals in the White House -- use
every weapon in its arsenal to try to stop the sniper-inspired push
to create a national database of ballistic "fingerprints."</TE>
<TE>   Despite powerful evidence that such a system would be a boon to
law enforcement, the NRA has adopted a scattershot approach to
bringing down the idea. The technology isn't foolproof, the
organization's mouthpieces argue. Ballistic fingerprints can be
tampered with. Guns get stolen. And the always popular: "Guns don't
kill people, people kill people."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer parroted this bumper sticker
cop-out when he helpfully explained why the president didn't support
a federal ballistic fingerprinting database. "In the case of the
sniper," he said, "the real issue is values."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, like the value of being able to pick off unsuspecting
victims at long range with a military-style weapon versus the value
of sending your kids to school without having to worry about whether
they'll come home.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over this bullet-tracing system has quickly turned into
what the NRA wants: a case of dueling studies. Yet even opponents of
the system concede that it is effective at least some of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Why not give the idea a fighting chance by committing whatever
resources are necessary to improve the promising technology?</TE>
<TE>   Does the NRA's paranoid brain trust really believe that millions
of innocent sportsmen will have their hunting rifles confiscated if
they make this tiny, public-spirited concession?</TE>
<TE>   No matter, Team Bush would rather consign the program, which has
the support of many elected and law enforcement officials, to the
political graveyard of "further study."</TE>
<TE>   It's funny how the president turns into a raging Luddite when the
technology in question runs counter to his -- and his financial
benefactors' -- political aims. I'll be sure to remind him of that
the next time he asks for an additional $7 billion to fund his
pie-in-the-sky missile defense shield. "Mixed results" don't seem to
have given him many qualms there.</TE>
<TE>   The nexus linking art and a breaking news story can be a very
volatile thing. In the wake of the sniper attacks, Fox wisely decided
to pull "Phone Booth," a sniper-themed thriller, off the fall release
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Yet those same attacks have made "Bowling for Columbine" essential
viewing for anyone who thinks schoolchildren should be able to play
outside without fear of being gunned down.</TE>
<TE>   I understand the White House has a very comfortable screening
room.</TE>

<HD>Is Big Oil Lubricating War Drive?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeremy Rifkin</AU>
<BD>Jeremy Rifkin is the author of "The Hydrogen Economy:
The Creation of the World Wide Energy Web and the Redistribution of
Power on Earth" (Tarcher/Putnam, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does the Bush administration have a hidden agenda? If you want to
know how utterly estranged Europe and the United States have become,
listen to the talk in the streets over the possible U.S. invasion of
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In the U.S., most Americans believe President Bush when he says we
have a moral obligation to protect the world from Saddam Hussein's
pathological desire to build and employ weapons of mass destruction.
In Europe, by contrast, most people believe that the U.S. is planning
to invade Iraq to secure its oil fields.</LD>
<LD>   So, while most Americans think that we are planning an attack on
Iraq to save the world from a madman, most Europeans think that Bush
is the madman, with the evil intention of grabbing a foothold in the
oil-rich Middle East to extend the "American empire." And the media
on both sides of the pond are pandering to the political
sensibilities of their respective regions.</LD>
<TE>   Still reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, most Americans
believe Bush when he says Iraq poses a potential danger to their
security. Many buy the White House notion of preventive action
against political terrorism. And they are incredulous that our
supposed allies are not taking the global terrorist threat more
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one can't help but be surprised by the almost total silence
on the question of the "oil connection." Is it possible that U.S.
political leaders and reporters, columnists, editors and producers
are so naive that they really believe there is no other White House
agenda in the Middle East except the one that the administration is
extolling? Do they really believe that oil plays no role in the
strategic thinking of the inner circles at the White House?</TE>
<TE>   This national silence is even more deafening when we look at the
key players in this unfolding drama. Both Bush and Vice President
Dick Cheney come out of the oil industry. Their careers have been
shaped by oil interests. Their political fortunes have been boosted
by the oil lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was the No. 1 recipient of energy industry money, collecting
more than $1.8 million in contributions, more than any other
candidate for federal office received over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   If there was any reason to be suspicious of the White House's
intentions in regard to Iraq, certainly the fact that Cheney held
closed-door meetings with the leaders of the energy industry
immediately upon taking office -- and then refused to release the
record of those discussions or the names and corporate affiliations
of the participants -- should at least raise a few eyebrows in the
media. That's not to suggest that these private discussions related
to American security interests in Iraq and the Middle East. Rather,
what it says is that the interests of the oil companies are never far
from the thoughts of Bush and Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it is incredible that no one in Congress or the media has
bothered to ask: Does the desire to secure the second-largest oil
fields in the world play any strategic role in White House thinking?
Of course, it is understandable that neither American politicians nor
the media want to appear unpatriotic. Still, there is enough
circumstantial evidence to at least take seriously what the Europeans
and most of the rest of the world believe is the real U.S. intention
in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly this "second motive" could dramatically change the
public debate. For Americans who already have doubts about the extent
of the Iraqi threat and the need to commit troops, the prospect that
we might be doing this, even in part, to secure the oil interests of
giant companies would not be welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Of one thing I am sure: The American people would never support
any invasion to grab oil fields. After all, we fought the last
Persian Gulf War to stop Iraq from capturing the oil fields of
Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   It might be that Europe and the rest of the world are simply
wrong. But to have virtually no public discussion in the U.S. of what
the rest of the world suspects is the White House's real reason for
wanting to depose Hussein makes me feel that there is indeed more to
Bush's Iraq obsession than we are being told.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a compelling, weird way, the arrest of two suspects in the
Washington-area sniper shootings seems like the cancellation of an
awful reality-TV show that we hated but couldn't resist watching. The
terrible deaths and injuries to innocents, made worse by a
bewildering randomness, terrorized that area while TV instantly
home-delivered matching fears across the land. The manhunt now
becomes a process story in more familiar legal forums, allowing us to
see institutions determining facts, innocence or guilt and
punishment.</LD>
<LD>   The nation has had serial killers and mass murderers before, but
none so ongoing, so quickly and deeply penetrating the nation's
psyche. That's a measure of two things. It re-demonstrates TV's
permeation of life, especially the all-news cable channels with their
own peculiar, at times perverse, competitive drives. And it exposes
lingering scars and latent fears persisting even 14 months after the
9/11 attacks. Having witnessed that dramatic devastation, also on TV,
we're simply more prepared to be scared now -- be the threat a
sniper, foreign fundamentalist, domestic child abductor or marauding
shark. That's a normal reaction, not bad if it instills a new kind of
rational caution.</LD>
<TE>   As a member of the industry, we hesitate to offer unsolicited
advice to the ubiquitous media. But this case, involving cryptic
messages from police to culprit through the media, demonstrates that
news reporters can become participants in the news they're covering.
Several times the sniper appeared to react to coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Each news outlet should reexamine its decisions. Were they true to
a mission of delivering news, not speculation, of reporting facts,
not hyped promotional opportunities? Though marketable, is it proper
to give a disturbed, unidentified killer the same blanket celebrity
coverage as less lethal personalities? Must we speculate on targets
or offer dramatic rifle-scope cross-hair images, as nifty as they
probably looked in draft form?</TE>
<TE>   Cable news knows that ratings jump with continuous coverage of a
story. Fine. TV is great at relaying facts and sights. But cable's
"blabocracy" is awful at pondering and proportion. Here's the real
decision: Are there enough facts to warrant continuous coverage? The
sniper story often had little news. But countless hours were filled
with obsessive speculation by "profilers" and "security experts"
unearthed by program bookers needing to fill time. If these folks are
so expert, why aren't they on the case?</TE>
<TE>   Dinner table speculation is one thing; on national TV, it's
something else, possibly incendiary. It's hard to envision CBS'
Walter Cronkite on the afternoon of President Kennedy's assassination
asking experts to guess the unidentified assassin's nationality,
religion or motive. As we've all seen recently, much has changed in
American society. News consumers now need to factor worthiness and
wisdom, not just entertainment value, into their viewing decisions.</TE>

<HD>U.N., Speak Clearly to Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The United Nations' nickname is "the Hall of Words," so it's no
wonder John D. Negroponte, the United States' ambassador to that
body, demanded "an added sense of urgency" in the debate over sending
weapons inspectors back to Iraq. Translated from the diplomatic, the
phrase means, "Get off the dime." The solution: today's planned
debate by all 15 Security Council members of the strong resolution
the U.S. introduced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In addressing the U.N. on Sept. 12, President Bush warned that the
organization was jeopardizing its credibility by failing to hold Iraq
to past agreements. Since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the
Security Council has passed 16 resolutions requiring the country to,
among other things, give up its weapons of mass destruction. Since
1998, Saddam Hussein has refused to let in inspectors who could
determine whether he is complying. And the U.N. has remained cowed,
even while insisting that Iraq is indeed dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   Before his speech, Bush appeared ready to simply round up an ally
or two and invade. Instead, he took the wiser course and sought U.N.
backing. The United States has made concessions in trying to win
support, especially from the other four permanent members, which also
hold veto power. Britain is supportive, China worried, France and
Russia at sword's point with Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. backed down from insisting that armed guards accompany
inspectors and that the five permanent Security Council members be
allowed to join inspection teams to guide them to sites where weapons
development is suspected. Ostensibly, France and Russia's remaining
objections center on what would trigger military action against Iraq.
Can it begin if Baghdad hampers inspections, or must the U.N. have
another chance to consult and perhaps pass yet another resolution?</TE>
<TE>   Part of the concern in Paris and Moscow is economic. Both nations
are owed billions of dollars by Iraq and could lose lucrative
contracts if Hussein is replaced by new leaders upset by past French
and Russian support of Baghdad. Another motivation, says U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State A. Elizabeth Jones, is both nations'
desire to "stay in the game with the big boys" and ensure they are
consulted when important international decisions are made.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council will debate into next week, but its members
should not allow themselves to dawdle beyond that. The French and
Russians will probably amend the U.S. resolution, making some phrases
vague and more open to interpretation. The U.S. would be wise to
shrug and accept minor softening. What must remain clear is the
warning that Iraq will suffer "serious consequences" if it continues
to defy the United Nations -- and that those consequences will be
more than another round of Security Council chitchat. Let Baghdad
understand that it must open all facilities to inspection at a
moment's notice, with no interference, from the most ramshackle
building to the most opulent presidential compound.</TE>

<HD>Ill-Advised Water Giveaway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>States have the legal right to their own water with one major
exception: The federal government can keep the rights to water
springing from federal lands -- Indian reservations, national parks,
forests, wildlife refuges and the like -- if it is needed to serve
those lands.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton administration applied the rule strictly, reserving
the right to a maximum amount of water to protect the environment as
needed. But now the Bush administration is backing away from tough
enforcement of the rule, opening the way for the states to claim
increasing control over water that should remain in federal
jurisdiction. This is a mistake. Last year, the Department of the
Interior abandoned a claim to Snake River water surrounding a
wildlife refuge in Idaho. This fall, the administration indicated it
would reduce its hold on the Gunnison River in Colorado even though
national park officials said reservation of the full flow was needed
to protect the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park downstream.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Bush administration says it will get by with considerably
less water, freeing up supplies for urban areas. Environmental
critics say there are other sources to meet demand without tapping
the federal water. If the federal rights were transferred to the
state, the water would not be available when needed for wildlife,
fisheries and river bank vegetation.</LD>
<TE>   If there's not enough water for the Colorado monument at some
point, the government can buy water elsewhere, an Interior Department
official said. What kind of logic is that -- give it away and then
buy it back?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there is little immediate threat to federal waters in
California, although there is a bitter dispute along the Klamath
River on the California-Oregon border over the allocation of water to
area farmers, a wildlife refuge, Indian reservations with treaty
rights and the salmon fishery. The problem: not enough water.</TE>
<TE>   In California, state, federal and municipal projects take much of
the water arising from the national parks, forests, wildlife refuges
and other federal lands. Congress decreed that part of the federal
Central Valley Project supply must go to protect the environment,
although farmers bitterly disputed the amount of water taken for this
purpose. Cal-Fed, a new state-federal water venture, establishes an
environmental water account to safeguard waterfowl and fish.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no guarantee the environment will be protected if the
administration becomes too generous in giving away federal -- the
people's -- water.</TE>

<HD>Those Heavenly Angels Reward the Faithful</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks so much to Joe Mathews for his heartfelt "Through the Rabbit
Hole to the Angels' World Series" (Oct. 22), about the Anaheim Angels
and their faithful, finally rewarded fans. As one of those fans since
1968, I have seen some of the most thrilling games -- no-hitters,
record-setting performances, last-minute wins -- more than enough to
fill a lifetime. I can't count the nights I went to sleep with
headphones tuned to a late game, hoping to nod off with an Angel win.</LD>
<LD>   My best birthday and graduation presents were Angels tickets. My
dad would invariably yell insults at players he thought were dogging
it. He also gave unsolicited advice to the likes of then-Manager Gene
Mauch, who was too polite to go into the dugout in time to avoid his
persistent lecture on the merits of playing Jack Howell at third
base. I wouldn't trade those memories for anything.</LD>
<LD>   But now I have a cup overflowing with new images: David Eckstein,
with his Brian Downing-like persistence; Scott Spiezio and his
ever-present grin and Bobby Grich-like reflexes; the sight of Tim
Salmon going "upstream" and the image of Gene Autry's smile from
center field. Just like the baseball that Doug DeCinces tossed to me
at a freeway series (just for booing the Dodgers), this Angels team
is a real keeper. Win or lose, it has already given us the journey of
a lifetime. Go Angels!</LD>

<LD>Re your series on China becoming the factory floor of the world, Oct.
20-22: Thanks for the detailed description of the ongoing transfer of
American know-how and jobs to communist China.</LD>
<LD>   After seeing the "American Talib" sentenced to 20 years for being
a traitor to our nation, I wonder when we can expect to see some
politicians and captains of industry brought to justice for being
traitors on a much grander scale. The unpatriotic, strictly
profit-driven decisions of these people have cost millions of
Americans their livelihood and damaged the security of this country
to a degree that no terrorist, domestic or foreign, ever could.</LD>

<TE>   Re China, the economic blockbuster. I've seen this coming for
years with a great deal of trepidation. I don't see how the U.S. can
survive this onslaught, fueled by China's basement-level wages,
gigantic population and our country's gluttony for goods, whether
needed or not.</TE>
<TE>   Your series of articles did mention that some jobs have been
created in America by this shift of manufacturing, but they are all
related to importing and exporting -- lawyers, truckers, etc. Will
there be anybody left in America who knows how to make a bicycle or a
pair of shoes?</TE>
<TE>   Isn't this troubling? That we are losing our manufacturing base,
our factories, our know-how, our skilled workers? What if -- as seems
more and more possible -- some horrible world conflagration breaks
out? Where do the shoes for our soldiers come from? The microchips
for our instruments?</TE>
<TE>   Even if that doesn't happen, every worker is a consumer. When we
buy something that has been made in China, we most likely support the
few people at the top of some large international business and/or
some Chinese workers and not our neighbor, who needs to eat too and
also may in turn use or buy our service or product. Can someone make
me feel any better about this situation?</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Silveira</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your articles on trade in China should be a wake-up call to all
American workers, blue- and white-collar alike. Our so-called free
trade is really one-way trade, fostered by our own multinational
corporations in collaboration with a bought-and-paid-for "special
interest" government in Washington. Wake up, Americans, before our
own workers will have to live on 40 cents an hour.</TE>

<TE>   Re "China's Next Challenge: Mastering the Microchip," Oct. 22: For
the Chinese to really succeed in microchip production they would need
to establish the kind of infrastructure already found in existing and
successful companies. I doubt that they can easily do that.</TE>
<TE>   More than five years ago, China used designs from expired
copyrights to build camera and film factories. One of their first
cameras was a model of the Kodak "Brownie" camera of the 1940s
vintage. They had to subsidize almost every step of the way to
develop this industry. Throwing resources at any opportunity will not
necessarily ensure success. The chips the Chinese are producing seem
to be "old" ones. Better and cheaper models are already available.</TE>

<LD>Kenneth Ebmeier's Oct. 22 letter stated that President Clinton gave
North Korea a nuclear power plant for a promise -- with no
verification, no nothing. Ignorance with a set of blinders truly must
be a trait among the anti-Clinton neo-cons.</LD>
<LD>   Let's set the record straight. The two proliferation-resistant
nuclear reactors offered in '94 have never been built, and the agreed
framework had the needed verifications built in. As Secretary of
State Colin Powell implied during his confirmation hearing and
recently reiterated by State Department spokesman Richard Boucher:
"We will abide by and agree to the commitments made under the agreed
framework, provided that North Korea does the same."</LD>
<LD>   But, as President Clinton warned North Korea in 1993, using
nuclear weapons will be the end of their country as they know it. I'm
sure the currently appointed commander in chief would have no problem
in the execution of that threat.</LD>

<LD>Re "Teacher Put on Leave Over Letter About Black Students," Oct. 23:
I am dismayed by the Pasadena Unified School District's action to
punish science teacher Scott Phelps for speaking his mind, based on
his observations and beliefs. The school district should investigate
if what Phelps said is true and try to correct the problem, and thus
improve the learning environment for all students.</LD>
<LD>   Removing a talented science teacher with 12 years' experience for
speaking his mind won't accomplish anything other than losing a
much-needed good science teacher. Is there any wonder that our public
schools are having a hard time finding qualified math and science
teachers?</LD>
<LD>   Joe Lin</LD>
<TE>   Gardena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to deflect blame from teachers for lowered academic
scores, Phelps has made public his views that blacks would be to
blame for low Academic Performance Index scores next year at John
Muir High School in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt he has had these views for some time, so I'm not
surprised he might find some of his African American students
disruptive. Expressions of disapproval don't have to be verbal to be
noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Racism isn't what you think as much as what you do, and Phelps has
only exacerbated the delicate race conditions that have worsened
since President Bush commandeered the White House.</TE>

<LD>Re "14 Killed in Israeli Bus Attack," Oct. 22: The government of
Israel had just lifted the curfew in Jenin. What was the Arab
response? Two murderers thought to be from Jenin drove an
explosives-laden car into the back of a civilian bus in Israel
proper, murdering 14 civilians and maiming 50 more. This is a
consistent pattern by Palestinians in the West Bank. Each time Israel
eases restrictions Jews are horrifically murdered.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps there will come a time when Arab terrorists will renounce
violence and Israel can step back from imposing curfews. Until then,
perhaps the Palestinians who are so unhappy about their present
situation ought to examine the simple concept of cause and effect.</LD>

<TE>   Once again we see an example of needless civilian deaths in Gaza
following the Israeli attempts to eradicate militant groups ("Israeli
Firefight With Gunmen in Gaza Kills Six," Oct. 18). Routine
expressions of regret by Israeli politicians follow, and we await the
next incident.</TE>
<TE>   The Israel Defense Forces are clearly out of control. When such
incidents occur, IDF officials either deny knowledge or claim an
investigation will be made, but these appalling collateral deaths and
injuries continue.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, they appear to be unable to prevent Palestinian
suicide bombers from their equally tragic missions. If a cease-fire
is to ever take place and peace negotiations resume, it will require
a U.N. peacekeeping force, no matter how much the Israelis protest.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. forces have been in place on the Lebanese and Egyptian
borders for many years. Having a professional military force under
U.N. mandate is likely to be much more successful than relying on
young and nervous conscripted Israelis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Swallowed by Urban Sprawl," Oct. 18: Riverside County Supervisor
Tom Mullen says the solution to the sprawl problems in Riverside and
San Bernardino is to spend $13 billion on four new highways. This is
his "innovative way to deal with" the problem. His solution is like
suggesting a heavy wire brush is the solution to poison oak.</LD>
<LD>   More highways lower the time and cost of travel. Demand increases
as costs are reduced. When people can travel farther in the same
amount of time, they will live farther away. This will mean the
demand for cheap houses on the current edge will increase, and sprawl
will only get worse.</LD>
<LD>   To those stewing in their own exhaust in Riverside while commuting
to jobs in Orange County: Quit whining. That's why your house was so
cheap.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The implication in an Oct. 17 letter that Proposition 47 would mostly
serve a few large school districts in the state is not correct. In
Orange County alone, there are 21 districts that would receive a
total of nearly $500 million in new construction and modernization
funding from Proposition 47. And Orange County is not alone.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the state, virtually all counties would immediately
receive a substantial infusion of new construction and modernization
funding that would exceed $4 billion. Proposition 47 is good for all
of California -- urban, suburban and rural -- and would significantly
address school facility needs for our students for generations to
come.</LD>

<HD>Man Pleads Not Guilty in Slaying of Transgender Bay Area
Teenager</HD>
<DH>Two others accused of committing a hate-crime killing do
not enter pleas and will return to court Nov. 8.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FREMONT -- An Alameda County man pleaded not guilty Thursday in the
slaying of transgender teenager Eddie "Gwen" Araujo, who will be
buried today in this Bay Area community dressed as the woman he
wanted and appeared to be.</LD>
<LD>   Jaron Nabors, 19, stood next to his two co-defendants during an
arraignment hearing at the Fremont Hall of Justice but denied any
wrongdoing in the death of Araujo, a 17-year-old boy who thought of
himself as a girl.</LD>
<LD>   Nabors and his friends, Michael Magidson, 22, and Jose Merel, 24,
each face a count of murder with a hate-crime enhancement. They are
due back in court Nov. 8, when Magidson and Merel are expected to
enter pleas.</LD>
<TE>   "As far as my client is concerned, the plea is not guilty to the
charge of murder," said Robert Beles, the attorney representing
Nabors, adding that his client "adamantly denies" the allegations of
a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Merel delayed his arraignment because his court-appointed attorney
said he needed more time to review the evidence. But during a
jailhouse interview with The Times late Wednesday, Merel insisted
that he was not guilty. Without elaborating, Merel said he had
nothing to do with the crime and he was confident that, once the
truth came out, he would be cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that I am innocent, and I shouldn't even be in here
right now," Merel said. "I should be home with my family."</TE>
<TE>   Magidson, who put off entering a plea because he was still looking
for an attorney, said during a separate jailhouse interview that he
had been advised by his family not to talk about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I would love to talk about this, but I can't," he
said. Asked simply whether he was innocent, Magidson responded: "I
can't even say."</TE>
<TE>   The three men are accused of killing Araujo after learning of his
biological sex during an Oct. 3 party at Merel's Newark home. Police
say Araujo was knocked unconscious, then dragged into the garage,
where he was strangled with a rope. His body was found buried in a
shallow grave two weeks later and 150 miles away in the Sierra
wilderness, dressed in the denim skirt he had worn to the party, his
wrists and ankles bound.</TE>
<TE>   The murder has struck a nerve among members of the transgender
community and given new momentum to their causes. The legal
proceedings have been overshadowed by a series of memorials and other
events being planned over the next few weeks by a coalition of
national gay and lesbian organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's mother, Sylvia Guerrero, has retained a high-profile Los
Angeles attorney, Gloria Allred, who represented the family of Nicole
Brown Simpson and has been honored for her work on behalf of women's
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse Thursday, about two dozen relatives and
friends of Araujo wept as they held photographs above their heads,
showing the teenager as a smiling young boy in his early years and as
the beautiful woman he became. They stood behind Allred as she
disputed arguments that the murder had not been a hate crime, and
promised to ensure that Araujo did not die in vain.</TE>
<TE>   She said hate crimes "must be of particular concern to the entire
community, because it means that a person has been targeted and
placed at risk because of his gender and/or sexual orientation,
factors over which a person has no control."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said she cries every night over Araujo's slaying and does
not understand how "anyone else thought they had the right to take
the life which I gave him</TE>
<TE>   "I want justice for Eddie because this should never have happened,
and I never want it to happen to any other child or any other
family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo will be buried in makeup and women's clothes, Guerrero
said, and "Gwen" will be engraved on the headstone. Araujo chose the
name because he liked singer Gwen Stefani of the band No Doubt.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a private viewing at Fremont Memorial Mortuary and
the public is invited to attend the funeral at St. Edwards Catholic
Church in Newark. Allred discouraged anyone who plans to be
disruptive from attending.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Fred Phelps, who has outspokenly argued that God hates
homosexuals, and members of Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church in
Kansas, have promised to picket the services.</TE>

<HD>Bamieh to Open His Own Law Firm</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven months after a bitter campaign, former district attorney
candidate Ron Bamieh is leaving the prosecutor's office to open his
own civil and criminal defense firm.</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh said he told superiors of his decision last week. Once a
top trial lawyer, he has not prosecuted a serious felony case since
the March election won by Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to run the biggest firm in Ventura," Bamieh said,
referring to the district attorney's office. "Now I want to grow the
biggest firm in Ventura."</LD>
<TE>   Bamieh, 36, will be joined by attorney Philip Erickson, 43, who
has spent the past decade defending law enforcement and government
agencies in state and federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The new firm of Bamieh &amp; Erickson will open Dec. 2 at a historic
building in downtown Ventura. In addition to criminal and civil
cases, the lawyers intend to take on employment, business and family
law matters.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said that he and Erickson, a longtime friend, will offer
the community a new choice in legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh earned his bachelor's degree from USC and his law degree
from Loyola University School of Law in Chicago. He practiced civil
law before joining the district attorney's office in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson earned his bachelor's degree from UCLA and his law degree
from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson tendered his resignation at the Oxnard law office of Alan
Wisotsky this week.</TE>

<HD>Orange Schools to Sell Barham</HD>
<DH>District accepts the county's sweetened offer of $4.5
million for the undeveloped area. Critics said the schools should get
more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a nightlong debate, the Orange Unified school board Thursday
approved the sale of a large swath of oak-filled hills to the county
for park space, ending a decade of wrangling.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-2 vote came after Supervisor Todd Spitzer told board members
the county would increase its offer for the property to $4.5
million--a $300,000 increase over the county's previous proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The 509-acre Barham Ranch property is surrounded by Irvine
Regional, Santiago Oaks and Weir Canyon parks.</LD>
<TE>   Area residents have fought for years to keep it from being
developed.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors, led by Spitzer, voted in August
to set aside $4.2 million to buy the prime open space.</TE>
<TE>   But an appraisal completed for the school district in September
put the value of the land at $10.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "History will be the judge of how and what we decided tonight,"
said school board president Bob Viviano, who voted against the
county's offer.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the school district should hold out for more money.</TE>
<TE>   "It is irresponsible to sell Barham Ranch for a mere $4 million,"
said Deborah Pauly, a Villa Park Elementary School parent.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel almost like the county is stealing out of the mouths of
our babes, the children who attend schools in this district," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   But school board member Kathy Moffat, who voted in favor of the
measure, said the county's proposal was fair, and that no higher
offer had come in.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the school business," Moffat said.</TE>
<TE>   "The sale of this land to the county for a decent monetary return
will give us money to use for desperately needed facilities, and
return to our true mission."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people in the standing-room-only crowd agreed with
Moffat.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Chrystie, a father of twin 1-year-old girls, said he has
enjoyed hiking in the rugged hills for years, and that the board
should acknowledge the county's offer is reasonable and realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a win-win solution. The public will enjoy this land in
perpetuity and the school district will get $4 million. The county's
offer is real," Chrystie said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Orange Park Acres resident Theresa Sears, who
helped spearhead efforts to preserve the land, said the latest
appraisal was flawed because it did not include comparable values of
area properties, instead relying on sites in Topanga Canyon and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the audience said the money was badly needed for new
schools, and to improve aging, overcrowded facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Facing competition from Thursday night's Angels-Giants World
Series baseball game, the school board brought in a television so the
audience to keep track of both events.</TE>
<TE>   A committee convened by the board this summer concluded the Barham
Ranch property should be disposed of because it was not suitable as a
school site.</TE>
<TE>   It sits behind a dam in a flood plain, and is inaccessible to
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of building a road and bringing in utilities would be
prohibitive, the panel found.</TE>
<TE>   The now-defunct Carpenter Irrigation District sold half the ranch
to the school district in the 1970s for $80,000, with the stipulation
that it would be used for educational purposes. To meet that
requirement, the county will offer outdoor educational programs on
the site.</TE>

<LD>A father convicted of raping and beating to death his 3-month-old
daughter was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole by a
Superior Court judge who called the crimes possibly the worst he had
seen in his 30 years in the legal justice system.</LD>
<LD>   "None of my colleagues have ever seen anything this bad," Judge
Terry A. Green said.</LD>
<LD>   Ramon Garcia Jr., 28, held back tears as he apologized for the May
2000 rape and killing of his daughter, Arianna.</LD>
<TE>   "I apologize to everyone for everything I've done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors last month convicted Garcia of murder, assault on a child
under 8 causing death, rape with a foreign object, and a special
circumstance allegation of murder during the commission of rape with
a foreign object.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica College, known for sending many students on to four-year
universities, especially UCLA, last year raised its transfer rate to
all University of California campuses by 32%.</LD>
<LD>   College officials credit the increase, which was well above the
9.6% record growth last year for such transfers statewide, in part to
a larger counseling staff, more courses transferable to UC and
aggressive efforts to attract well-prepared students.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001-02, officials said, Santa Monica sent 938 students to UC
campuses, up from 709 the year before. About 1,000 more headed to Cal
State campuses. Those figures made the college the year's overall
leader in sending students to the state's two public university
systems.</LD>

<HD>Keeping Football Season Afloat</HD>
<DH>Catalina Island team travels for hours by boat and bus to
reach its away games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the scrappy Avalon High School football team, more than honor was
at stake on this bleak autumn Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Catalina Island Lancers had taken a bumpy boat ride to the
mainland, then a bumpy bus ride inland, to a Riverside private school
where odds were excellent they'd be creamed.</LD>
<LD>   The Bloomington Christian boys were bigger. They had grown up
playing Pop Warner. Prep football is just 5 years old on the island.
The Bloomington boys win league titles. The island boys assembled
from a puddle of a talent pool -- 239 students. A few play offense
and defense.</LD>
<TE>   When nobody could kick a football this season, the Lancers wooed
their school's soccer star, whom they call "the Miracle Toe." There
was also, this gray morning, the small matter of the casualty left on
their field last year by these Bloomington Ravens.</TE>
<TE>   "This," Coach Earl Schrader dryly reminded the boys, "is the
revenge of Colby's finger game."</TE>
<TE>   As the finger saga will later illustrate, mordant humor and true
grit define this odd and endearing squad of unlikely small-town
winners. So does the fact that living on an island requires the home
team or visitors to travel 64 miles round-trip by boat.</TE>
<TE>   Prep athletes from Catalina can miss up to 25% of their class time
due to travel, said phys ed teacher and cheerleading coach Debra
Hunt. Because their season is year-round, cheerleaders clock more
miles than any sports team, said Hunt, who travels with them -- and
her Dramamine.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Avalon's athletes suffer seasickness, but accept boat
travel as a necessity of island life. Being surrounded by seaweed
forests swaying in teal waters? Home field advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players went on a two-hour boat ride to Catalina the first
year and several kids got sick," Bloomington High football coach Mike
Dennis recalled. "We questioned whether to even stay for the game.
Some of the other schools felt Catalina was too far and too expensive
to travel to. But if our league didn't let them play, who would they
compete with?"</TE>
<TE>   Later, after this day's game ended, Bloomington and Avalon players
knelt side by side, black jersey, white jersey, and Dennis led them
in a prayer for a safe journey home to the island. "It takes a lot of
time and determination," he said, "for these kids to play sports,
which I really admire."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scene: Saturday morning, Oct. 12, desert landscape, a freeway exit
somewhere near Riverside. After more than two hours traveling,
someone needs a bathroom. The bus lumbers up to a Jack in the Box,
where uniformed workers can actually be seen grimacing inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Awright! Only people who actually need to go should be getting
off this bus," bellows the commanding authority figure on board,
cheerleading coach Hunt. "Only use the bathroom. No food. I don't
want to see any food. None."</TE>
<TE>   This may seem overstated except that she's surrounded by 50
teenagers who live on an island with no fast-food burger joints. They
can't stop because kickoff is at noon. As with each away game, they
must keep moving.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Earl, clutching a Styrofoam cup, climbs back aboard the bus.
"We got 20 kids standing in line for the restroom and we bought one
cup of coffee. Nice."</TE>
<TE>   This trip to Riverside, 59 miles from the dock in Long Beach, will
be one of the least arduous this season. And football has among the
easiest travel schedules this year, nine league games with only three
away.</TE>
<TE>   To compete in the Liberty League with equally small schools,
Avalon's athletes must travel to mostly private schools. Next year it
will be Avalon's turn to play at Kings Christian, student population
87, near Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   During basketball season, the teams play two games per trip to
save money.</TE>
<TE>   "I play point guard for the basketball team," says Jose Perez, 16,
who plays tight end and linebacker on the football team. "Two games a
trip. It's pretty hard."</TE>
<TE>   But back to this road trip. It launches with the 8 a.m. departure
of the Catalina Express hydrofoil. Earl -- nobody calls him Coach
Schrader -- passes out boat tickets, and about 27 players, two
coaches, perhaps a dozen cheerleaders, two parents and some siblings
board.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, the boat docks in Long Beach. Only about half of
the team and cheerleaders are aboard the bus when it becomes apparent
it is already full. This bus has no underbelly luggage compartment,
so the players hoist their gear on board. The overflow is stuffed
into civilian cars.</TE>
<TE>   When the game finally begins hours later, the seafaring Lancers
are dominated but stay in the game.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of five straight defeats by the Ravens, the Lancers
persevere and play tough. How tough?</TE>
<TE>   Early in the game, starting quarterback Chris Bogard gets hit so
hard near the end zone that he has to be carried off the field. He
goes back in. Later, he gets hit so hard near the other end zone that
he staggers to stand. He manages to signal a time out. Then he throws
up, hobbling off the field. Moments later, he goes back in.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see that kid? He about threw up his whole stomach,"
marveled Debbie Dennis, wife of the Ravens coach. "These guys never
give up."</TE>
<TE>   The paucity of Avalon fans in the bleachers is largely because of
the cost of travel, and the cost of living on the island of 3,129
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "People think that because it costs a lot to visit the island that
people who live here have a lot of money," Hunt said. "But someone
has to work in all the hotels and restaurants and service industry,
and that's us."</TE>
<TE>   To afford high housing and food prices on an island where most
goods are shipped or flown in, players said, their parents work
second or third jobs on weekends, and the boat fare is $42
round-trip, which adds up.</TE>
<TE>   In this, the Lancers' fourth season game, they fight in every
possession for enough yardage to reach field goal range, and soccer
forward turned kicker Gerardo Cisneros repeatedly boots in three
points.</TE>
<TE>   With four seconds to spare, the Lancers tie the score -- thank
you, Miracle Toe -- and go on to beat the best team in their league
23-20. On this day, the Lancers are 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   And thus, Colby's finger was avenged. It seems that last year
Colby Cushing, at defensive end, went up for a pass. Two Bloomington
helmets smashed together over his hand so hard they pinched off his
fingertip.</TE>
<TE>   "Colby was saying, 'Well, I gave those guys the finger,'" Coach
Earl recalled. Colby did not finish the season, but in keeping with
the Lancer tradition of resilience, he played in the league All-Star
game that June.</TE>
<TE>   All kidding aside, there were no hard feelings about what most
considered an unfortunate accident. The Avalon players even invited
the Bloomington squad over for a fishing trip.</TE>
<TE>   "To show them," the coach explained, "that this is all about more
than football."</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Bloomington's turn to be gracious losers. The
team delivered a plastic pumpkin full of candy to the victors. Aboard
the bus home, the pumpkin was empty after five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Chugging down the Riverside Freeway crossing the Los Angeles
County border, Hunt makes an announcement to her starved passengers
who have subsisted on Krispy Kreme doughnuts and granola bars.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have time to stop for food,
but we are going to stop anyway because we know you are hungry," she
hollers over barreling traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of fries seems to make the team happier than its
hard-fought victory.</TE>
<TE>   At the corner of Willow Street and Pacific Coast Highway in Long
Beach, the team gets a fast-food trifecta: a McDonald's, Taco Bell
and El Pollo Loco at one intersection. Nobody will need to cross a
street, which would suck up enough time to render the stop
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The bus door opens and the islanders fan out. All passengers
return in 10 or 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   At 5:45 p.m., the Avalon students are giddily riding the hydrofoil
home to the island.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Lancers will be back at their dock, ready to make
another voyage across the Catalina channel. This trip, 113 miles away
at Desert Chapel High School in Palm Springs, will be their last away
game of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   But if they make the playoffs, it's back to the boat and bus.</TE>

<HD>4 Accused of 'Sham Church' Scheme</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted four men for allegedly
bilking $11 million from contributors by setting up several phony
churches in Orange County whose sole purpose was to solicit funds.</LD>
<LD>   The men are accused of pocketing the contributions from hundreds
of donors who thought they were giving to causes such as AIDS
research and programs for families of police officers killed in the
line of duty.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment was unsealed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
and charged the defendants with 48 counts of mail fraud, money
laundering and other federal violations.</LD>
<TE>   Named in the indictment were Timothy James Lyons, Gabriel Bernardo
Sanchez, Roger Nolan Lane and Steven Lawrence de la Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Ellyn Lindsay said Thursday that Lane and de
la Torre were in custody. She said Sanchez is expected to surrender
to FBI agents today, but Lyons was still being sought.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay said the four concocted a scheme in which Sanchez and De
la Torre established phony charities that were then used by Lyons and
Lane to raise money that was distributed among the four men.</TE>
<TE>   She said the alleged scam began in 1993, when Sanchez established
the First Church of Life in Costa Mesa with no members or sanctuary.
According to the indictment, he began using the facility in 1994 to
register numerous phony charities that did not have tax-exempt
status.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and De la Torre allegedly established three other
facilities, all of which were labeled "sham churches" by prosecutors,
to establish at least 12 organizations that prosecutors labeled "sham
charities."</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually none of the funds ... was spent for charitable
purposes," prosecutors said in the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hiring telemarketers, the four also used mass
mailings to raise money. No telemarketers or mailing firms were named
in the indictment, but Lindsay said they may be charged in other
jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   Donors were told their contributions were tax deductible, but none
of the charities had received tax-exempt status from the IRS,
according to records. The Franchise Tax Board revoked First Church's
tax-exempt status in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It's morally egregious to take money from the generous public
supposedly for charitable causes and instead use it for somebody

<HD>4 Indicted in Alleged Fake-Church Scam in O.C.</HD>
<DH>The men are accused of bilking $11 million from people
seeking to give to charities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted four men for allegedly
bilking $11 million from contributors by setting up several phony
churches in Orange County whose sole purpose was to solicit funds.</LD>
<LD>   The men are accused of pocketing the contributions from hundreds
of donors who thought they were giving to charitable causes such as
AIDS research and programs for families of police officers killed in
the line of duty.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment was unsealed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
and charged the defendants with 48 counts of mail fraud, money
laundering and other federal violations.</LD>
<TE>   Named in the indictment were Timothy James Lyons, Gabriel Bernardo
Sanchez, Roger Nolan Lane and Steven Lawrence de la Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Ellyn Lindsay said Thursday that Lane and De
la Torre were in custody. She said Sanchez is expected to surrender
to FBI agents today, but Lyons was still being sought.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay said the four concocted a scheme in which Sanchez and De
la Torre established phony charities that were then used by Lyons and
Lane to raise money that was distributed among the four men.</TE>
<TE>   She said the alleged scam began in 1993, when Sanchez established
the First Church of Life in Costa Mesa with no members or sanctuary.
According to the indictment, he began using the "church" in 1994 to
register numerous phony charities that did not have tax-exempt
status.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and De la Torre allegedly established three other
churches, all of which were labeled "sham churches" by prosecutors,
to establish at least 12 organizations that prosecutors labeled "sham
charities."</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually none of the funds ... was spent for charitable
purposes," prosecutors said in the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hiring telemarketers, the four also used mass
mailings to raise money. No telemarketers or mailing firms were named
in the indictment, but Lindsay said they may be charged in other
jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   Donors were told their contributions were tax deductible, but none
of the charities had received tax-exempt status from the IRS,
according to records. The Franchise Tax Board revoked First Church's
tax-exempt status in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It's morally egregious to take money from the generous public
supposedly for charitable causes and instead use it for somebody
else's cause," Lindsay said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the phony charities allegedly established by the defendants
was the Children's AIDS Council. According to literature, the aim of
the council was to "provide funds to infant AIDS wards and promote
compassion for children who have contracted HIV."</TE>
<TE>   Donors were also told another of the defendants' groups, the
Police and Sheriff's Support Fund, provided "monetary support to
families of officers hurt or killed in the line of duty."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and De la Torre allegedly changed the name of First Church
of Life to Christian Outreach Ministries, Mercy Ministries and Glory
Ministries to perpetrate the fraud, Lindsay said.</TE>

<HD>2 Prosecutors Ordered Reinstated</HD>
<DH>Panel says attorneys, who allege they were demoted for
backing the wrong D.A. candidate, weren't just transferred. County
fights back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Civil Service Commission on Thursday ordered Ventura County to
reinstate two prosecutors who contend they were demoted for backing
the wrong candidate for district attorney, or explain why they were
reassigned.</LD>
<LD>   The order, which requires a response by Nov. 25, finds that Adam
Pearlman and Mark Pachowicz were removed from their jobs as felony
prosecutors, and not just transferred to the county's Child Support
Division.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the hearing room Thursday, the two embattled lawyers
praised the unanimous ruling and said they hope to return to trying
criminal cases by the end of next month.</LD>
<TE>   But their fight may be a long way from over.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys filed Superior Court papers Wednesday accusing
the Civil Service Commission of overstepping its authority. The writ
contends the commission has no jurisdiction to hear the employees'
grievances.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't follow the normal rules," said Leroy Smith, assistant
county counsel. "We hope that between now and Nov. 25 we can get a
court ruling that they don't have jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   County lawyers and retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury insist
that Pearlman and Pachowicz were reassigned, not demoted. And they
contend the commission has no authority to hear employee appeals of
such reassignments.</TE>
<TE>   The county's personnel rules generally define a demotion as a
change in employment that results in a lower salary.</TE>
<TE>   Smith contends Pachowicz, Pearlman and Vivian Rackauckas, a third
prosecutor who was transferred to child support two years before the
election, were reassigned without suffering a reduction in pay.
Rackauckas appealed the transfer because she fears she will lose
employee benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But Pearlman and Pachowicz contend they were transferred to child
support, now a separate county agency, as punishment for backing the
candidate who challenged Bradbury's hand-picked successor.</TE>
<TE>   Both attorneys publicly backed Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron
Bamieh, who lost to Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten in the
March 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bradbury and Totten referred questions to the county
counsel's office.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury has previously denied retaliating against the two
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pearlman and Pachowicz accused the county and their
former boss of trying to prevent a hearing on the election issue by
challenging the commission's decision in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that the county doesn't want a hearing, and the
question everyone has to ask is 'why?' " Pachowicz said. "They are
going to do everything in their power to make sure the public doesn't
know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith countered that if the two lawyers want to allege
retaliation, they should put those claims in a lawsuit and not raise
them before the Civil Service Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In their writ, county lawyers argue that if employees were allowed
to dispute transfers to the commission, it "would paralyze the
ability of department heads to operate the machinery of government."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he hopes the court will take up the writ before Nov.
25.</TE>
<TE>   If not, he said, the county could choose not to respond to the
order, allow the commission to reinstate the three lawyers and then
appeal that ruling in court by arguing the commission abused its
discretion.</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman and Pachowicz said they hope Totten, the incoming
district attorney who takes over Nov. 1, will simply reinstate them
rather than fight the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get what we've asked for, and the sooner the better,"
Pearlman said.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Deputy Faces Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was charged Thursday with six
felony counts for allegedly filing a false workers' compensation
claim.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Justin, 36, who prosecutors say was hurt playing football
rather than while on duty, was booked at County Jail with bail set at
$30,000. If convicted, he faces up to five years in state prison,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office charged Justin with five counts of
insurance fraud and one count of grand theft in connection with his
June 2001 claim for workers' compensation benefits.</LD>
<TE>   "This is probably the first time I am aware we've ever charged a
sheriff's deputy for workers' comp fraud," said Tom Higgins, head
deputy of the district attorney's workers' compensation fraud unit.
"I think this arrest is very important for Los Angeles County and
specifically the Sheriff's Department. It shows vigor to pursue these
cases that was not there before."</TE>
<TE>   Justin filed a claim last year, saying he was injured when his
sheriff's all-terrain vehicle was struck by another deputy's ATV.
Higgins said, however, that prosecutors will present evidence showing
that Justin was injured during a football practice.</TE>
<TE>   "There were witnesses at both events, and those witnesses
contradict the statements of the deputy," Higgins said</TE>
<TE>   A Sheriff's Department internal probe led to an investigation by
the state Department of Insurance, and the subsequent decision to
file the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We have cooperated fully through this investigation, and again
say that it was this department -- the L.A. County Sheriff's
Department -- that uncovered the wrongdoing and sought out
prosecution," said Sheriff's Sgt Joe Efflandt. He said he was unsure
of Justin's status with the department, but any deputy charged with a
felony can be suspended without pay.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Deputy Deron M. McBee, who resigned from the force and
applied for a permanent disability pension while working as a
Chippendales exotic dancer, was sentenced to three years' probation
and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service for attempted
grand theft.</TE>

<HD>1 of 3 Plane Crash Victims Was Agua Dulce Attorney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Thursday identified one of three people killed in the
weekend crash of a small plane in northern Los Angeles County as
attorney William Thomas Perry of Agua Dulce.</LD>
<LD>   Perry, 52, was a passenger in the twin-engine Piper Aerostar 601,
which took off about 1 p.m. Sunday from Agua Dulce Airpark headed for
Nevada, according to friend Art Brewer.</LD>
<LD>   "They were just going to Laughlin for an hour and turn around and
come back," Brewer said. "Now there's a hole in our hearts."</LD>
<TE>   The names of a 51-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man also killed
in the crash have not been released. The plane was owned by George
and Rosalie Willard of Encino, but authorities would not say if they
were on board.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash is not known.</TE>
<TE>   An arbitrator and volunteer judge for Los Angeles Superior Court
who moved to Agua Dulce in 1995, Perry was active in numerous local
organizations. He was a former president of the Agua Dulce Chamber of
Commerce and a vice president of the Vasquez Rocks Nature Center
Associates, Brewer said.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff that doesn't get reported
... that no one else wants to do," said Brewer.</TE>
<TE>   Perry is survived by his wife, Milady, and daughters Milady, 16,
and Shani, 7. A memorial service is scheduled at 3 p.m. today at Agua
Dulce Vineyards, 9640 Sierra Highway.</TE>

<HD>Santa Barbara's Loyalties Are All Over the Map</HD>
<DH>Because home isn't quite north or south, baseball fans
don't follow the same road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>If this World Series is a war between California's north and south,
then  its Mason-Dixon line zig-zags through the heart of O'Malley's
Sports Bar, a dark-wood, open-fronted tavern on State Street with 13
television sets and more satellite links than the White House
situation room.</LD>
<LD>   Like a lot of places in the middle of California, Santa Barbara is
an uneasy bystander in the rivalry between San Francisco and Los
Angeles. This week, at O'Malley's, loyalties are divided between the
Giants and the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Back in April when the baseball season was still young and even
the San Diego Padres had a chance, the line here mostly separated
Giants fans from Dodgers fans. But the L.A. team's pennant run
fizzled in September, and loyalties of the Giant-haters have shifted.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger blue has gone Angel red, and the rally monkey is looking
cuter all the time to die-hards  such as Daran Lewis, a 34-year-old
Santa Barbara limousine driver who grew up in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels are a Cinderella team, and people like an underdog,"
said Lewis,  noting that the Angels have the added cachet that they
aren't the Giants. "That's why people are climbing on the bandwagon."</TE>
<TE>   Spend time here on the dividing line and you realize the
California split is more than north versus south. It's less a marital
spat than a family feud, more like the Balkans than Korea, complete
with a disputatious past -- over water, mostly.</TE>
<TE>   California has five Major League teams, enough to form a single
division. And each team claims tribal lands, some broader than
others. There is no official map, of course, but booster club rosters
and anecdotal accounts from sports bars and other knowledgeable
observers provide a rough guide.</TE>
<TE>   Four out of five Angels Boosters Club members live within 50 miles
of Edison International Field in a zone that swings from Camp
Pendleton northeast into Riverside and San Bernardino counties, then
cuts back to the coast through Bellflower and Lakewood. Padres fans
have their own corner down in San Diego County, and Oakland Athletics
fans have carved a niche east of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the state is dominated -- in more ways than just baseball
-- by Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' fan base extends from Northern California out into the
Central Valley to include Fresno -- home to a minor-league team
affiliated with the Giants -- then eastward to the Sierra Nevada and
south to Santa Barbara, where Dodgerland begins.</TE>
<TE>   They bump into each other here in Santa Barbara, a city that likes
to think of itself as part of a distinct "Central Coast." In reality
it marks the northern edge of L.A.'s cultural sphere of influence,
much as Monterey anchors the southern reach of San Francisco's.</TE>
<TE>   But there are overlaps. Earth-friendly electric shuttle buses --
so Nor-Cal -- course through downtown Santa Barbara, where the
sidewalks are lined with SoCal-style outdoor cafes and a massive
open-air mall.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara's geographic isolation forces fans to consume
baseball from a distance.</TE>
<TE>   The closest major-league ballpark is Dodger Stadium, a frustrating
two-hour drive to the south, with the Angels' Edison International
Field yet another 45 minutes down Interstate 5 , on a good day. The
Giants are even farther out of reach, a six-hour drive to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the distance, passion for baseball -- and other sports --
runs strong on these flatlands between the Santa Ynez Mountains and
the ocean. O'Malley's bartender Toby Daily, 26, a Giant fan, ties it
to Santa Barbara's slower pace: People who don't spend hours a week
creeping along Los Angeles and Bay Area freeways have more time to
follow sports.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a life, and they're passionate about sports because
they don't have other stuff to worry about," said Daily, who was born
in the East Bay city of Pleasanton but has lived in Santa Barbara for
six years.</TE>
<TE>   For some, picking a team in the Series is more personal and comes
down to one figure: Barry Bonds, the Giants giant so deadly at the
plate that many teams simply walk him rather than risk giving up a
home run. But Bonds also has become a target among fans alienated by
what they see as an ego-mad ballplayer who can't get along with his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   At O'Malley's, Bonds' face on TV elicits a raucous chorus of
catcalls and cheers, the boos notably coming from fans of teams for
which Bonds does not hit his towering blasts.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, if it wasn't for Barry Bonds, I'd probably be for San
Francisco," fumed Dodger-turned-Angel fan Charles Kirkby, 27, a Santa
Barbara shipping manager who was born in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   For others, loyalties are shaped by pure pragmatics: It's easier
to get to a game in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Cary Seyle, sales supervisor for Budweiser distributor Pacific
Beverage Co., said Santa Barbara is primarily Dodger country, with
Giants a healthy second, and Angel fans amounting to a quaint and
slight minority.</TE>
<TE>   "Most everybody I grew up with were Dodger fans," Seyle said. "I
don't know too many Angels fans. I don't know if it's because it's
Orange County and for us going to a game is a lot easier at Dodger
Stadium than driving all the way down to Anaheim. Plus, the Dodgers
have always been winners."</TE>
<TE>   A telling stat: He said only 10% of the bar owners' requests for
baseball ad tie-ins are for Angel material, although that's changed
lately. "There were very few Angels followers back in June."</TE>
<TE>   Like much of California, Santa Barbara is composed of legions of
people from other parts of the country who come together in a stew of
team passions.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night,  O'Malley's customers  watched the World
Series, hockey games from Minneapolis and Pittsburgh, and college
football games between UCLA and Cal at Berkeley and Notre Dame at Air
Force in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "The passion is rooted in home turf," said Daily, the bartender.
"People connect to their home town."</TE>
<TE>   Following a team also serves as the planting of a metaphoric flag,
and here at the crossroads declaring a favorite team is an act of
alignment, which is one reason Dodgers fans here are now rooting for
the Angels, a team they usually ignore.</TE>
<TE>   The embrace is fickle, an extension of the Giant and Dodger fans'
tradition of wishing each other's teams ill health and bad stock
portfolios, part of a rivalry that spans a century and a continent.
In this rivalry, the Angels are mostly a tool.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Dodgers Web site, usually awash in blue, last week
featured Angel Manager Mike Scioscia in his red Angel uniform along
with an article exploring Dodger fans doing the
"unthinkable"--rooting for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "To Dodger fans, the Angels have always been, sort of,
irrelevant," the Web site said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants, of course, have always been hated."</TE>

<HD>Island Eagles Outsmart Capture by Helicopter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in three months, a cadre of golden eagles on
Santa Cruz Island has outfoxed a helicopter crew trying to capture
them, leaving frustrated wildlife managers to fall back on more
traditional trapping methods.</LD>
<LD>   The helicopter, aided by 20 spotters on the ground, spent the week
chasing the powerful birds across steep ridges, into canyons and
along sheer sea cliffs. But whenever the helicopter closed in, the
eagles slipped away, ducking for cover beneath trees and ledges. The
effort -- intended to help the endangered island foxes -- was finally
called off Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Compounding the problem was the discovery that there are seven
golden eagles on the island rather than the three recorded in July.</LD>
<TE>   "One eagle managed to give birth and the others probably came from
the mainland," said Kate Faulkner, chief of resources management at
Channel Islands National Park. "They are masterful fliers and can
come across the channel with ease. They see other eagles circling
above and think it's good feeding territory."</TE>
<TE>   The birds are being removed from Santa Cruz, the largest of the
Channel Islands, because they prey on the island fox. Many of the
cat-sized foxes have been trapped and put in pens until the eagles
are captured. There are now 91 foxes living in captivity on Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands. The golden eagles nest on
Santa Cruz but can roam to the other islands.</TE>
<TE>   With the failure of helicopter trapping, park officials will
return to bow nets, with which 22 golden eagles initially were caught
starting in 1999 but which have since proved ineffective. The folding
traps are baited with feral pig carcasses and buried. When hungry
birds step into them, the traps snap shut.</TE>
<TE>   Bow nets were abandoned after the last few birds, having watched
others get gradually picked off, learned to avoid them.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials then borrowed a technique used in Wyoming. It
involved chasing eagles with a helicopter until the birds tired and
landed. The aircraft then hovers above, and a biologist perched in
the door launches a net from what resembles a modified shotgun.
Another crewman then leaps out and subdues the floundering animal.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Cruz Island, with plunging valleys and mountains rising
to 4,000 feet, has proved more formidable than the open grasslands of
Wyoming. Along with rugged terrain, foggy island weather has made
helicopter netting almost impossible.</TE>
<TE>   During the most recent effort, the helicopter closed in on an
eagle that had landed. The net was fired, missing the bird by inches.
The crew never got close again, park officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going back to the tried-and-true capture technique,"
Faulkner said. "It should work on several of these birds that are
immature. But it's possible we may have to live with a small number
of golden eagles on the islands. The real goal is to remove the feral
pigs, their primary food source."</TE>
<TE>   After capture, the eagles, which can stand 3 feet high with
wingspans of 8 feet, are transported 800 miles to Goose Lake in far
northeastern California and released.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to try every trick we have," said Erik Aschehoug, project
ecologist for the Nature Conservancy, which owns 76% of Santa Cruz
Island. "We tried techniques used in other places and discovered they
didn't work here. We are going through all the steps in one of the
largest environmental restoration efforts in the world."</TE>
<TE>   With so few eagles left, Aschehoug said there are discussions
about whether to release the island foxes. He added that none of the
75 to 100 foxes in the wild on Santa Cruz have been killed by eagles
in the last six months.</TE>

that dig holes, uproot trees and are the chief food source for golden
eagles. The park plans to begin shooting the pigs this spring.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the restoration efforts, 12 bald eagles were released
on Santa Cruz this year. The birds are native to the Channel Islands;
they chase off golden eagles and they don't eat island foxes.</TE>

<HD>Eglash Quits L.A. Inspector General's Job</HD>
<DH>The Police Commission official will leave the oversight
position in November. The panel plans an extensive search for his
successor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Lait and Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeffrey C. Eglash, the Los Angeles Police Commission's inspector
general, said Thursday that he has accepted an offer to work for a
private law firm and will resign from his civilian watchdog position
by the end of November.</LD>
<LD>   Eglash, a former federal prosecutor, said he has made significant
strides in strengthening the role and authority of the inspector
general's office during his 3 1/2 years on the job, but more still
needs to be done to enhance civilian oversight of the historically
insular Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I've accomplished some good things here, but I'm
anxious to get back to the practice of law," Eglash said. "I'm
looking for some new challenges."</LD>
<TE>   Eglash's tenure as inspector general coincided with a turbulent
time for the LAPD, marked by the Rampart corruption scandal and the
subsequent insertion of a federal monitor to oversee sweeping
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Eglash expanded the staff of the inspector general's office from
12 to 32, spearheaded the commission's investigation into the Rampart
allegations, highlighted problems with departmental investigations
into police shootings and produced numerous audits on discipline, use
of force and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph A. Gunn, the commission's executive director, said he would
miss working with Eglash, whom he described as a man of high
integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a real passion for the job. He really believed in its
mission," Gunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso said the panel plans a
comprehensive search for Eglash's replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to find the best person out there for this job,"
Caruso said. "We're going to start collecting resumes right away."</TE>
<TE>   Other city leaders praised Eglash's efforts and said they were
disappointed to see him leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tremendous loss for public safety and civil rights in Los
Angeles," said City Councilman Jack Weiss, who once worked with
Eglash in the U.S. attorney's office. "Jeff Eglash came into the
inspector general's position at a time when it had been marginalized
and there were many who did not want that model of oversight to
succeed. Through his hard work and innate fairness, he turned the
ship around."</TE>
<TE>   Though he sought to maintain a low profile on the job, Eglash
clashed frequently with department commanders, former Chief Bernard
C. Parks and even his own commission bosses. Much of the tension
centered on his access to information and authority to independently
investigate complaints.</TE>
<TE>   At times, he was excluded from LAPD meetings, even ones attended
by commissioners or representatives from other city agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The working relationship was strained, but I think it's
improving," Eglash said. "It's still not to the point where I'd like
it to be."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Eglash's reports and findings put him at odds with Parks,
forcing the five civilian police commissioners to choose between
supporting their inspector general or supporting their chief.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, in a 3-2 vote, sided with Eglash when they ruled
that the 1999 fatal shooting of Margaret Mitchell, a homeless woman
stopped by officers while trying to retrieve her shopping cart, had
been unjustified. The chief said the shooting was within departmental
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a similarly divided commission rejected Eglash's
recommendations that Parks be disciplined for allegedly making false
and misleading statements when he denied having withheld information
on the Rampart scandal from the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't always agree with us on every issue, but we were a
voice and the voice was heard," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   His effectiveness as inspector general was, to some degree,
limited by his poor relationship with the chief and other department
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Parks openly distrusted Eglash, refusing to talk to him or even
shake his hand at meetings. The chief and his top commanders
attempted to enlist the support of commission members several times
when Eglash requested information that the department did not want
released.</TE>
<TE>   According to several LAPD observers, Eglash has grown weary of his
battles with the department officials and has been looking for a new
job for many months. At one point, he reportedly considered returning
to the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Eglash decided to join the Washington D.C.-based law
firm of Howry, Simon, Arnold &amp; White. He will work at the firm's Los
Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   Eglash said he plans to stay on until the end of next month to
finish several projects, including an investigation into the LAPD's
handling of allegations that a deputy chief was involved in
laundering money for the officer's son's multimillion-dollar
drug-trafficking ring.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jeff did an excellent job, faced with monumental
impediments and frustrations," said Merrick Bobb, a consultant who
monitors the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "I think it's
particularly sad that he's leaving at this juncture, because I
believe the new chief's administration would have worked harder to
establish a constructive relationship with the inspector general."</TE>
<TE>   The incoming chief, William J. Bratton, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm personally disappointed that he is stepping away at this
time," said Bratton, adding that the department's relationship with
the inspector general's office would improve significantly when he
takes over because he believes there should be "more openness and
cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview about his departure, Eglash said the federal
consent decree, which mandates reforms for the department, has
created a huge amount of work for his office, but has helped "cement
the role of the I.G.'s office in a very positive way in the
governance of the department."</TE>
<TE>   He said the consent decree has forced cooperation between the LAPD
and the decree's monitor.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that, when the consent decree is over and the
independent monitor goes away, the I.G.'s office will assume the role
of the independent monitor," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he supports an often-discussed proposal to make at least
some of the commissioners' jobs full-time, paid positions. And Eglash
argued that it might be wise to have the inspector general report,
not only to the commission, but also to the City Council. Finally,
Eglash said, information about disciplining officers and other police
matters should be much more public.</TE>
<TE>   "I think civilian oversight is strong now," Eglash said, "but it
could be stronger."</TE>

<HD>State Revises Foster Care Standards</HD>
<DH>Changes settle a lawsuit with child advocacy group and call
for audits of relatives caring for foster children to ensure health
and safety.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Francisco child advocacy group sued the state of California
Thursday, saying it had failed to ensure that foster parents who are
related to their children meet federal health and safety
requirements. The group then immediately agreed to settle the suit in
exchange for reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which will be monitored by the court, requires
uniform, statewide standards for foster parents who are related to
the children in their custody. It also calls for audits and requires
counties to help unqualified relatives meet the standards, rather
than simply not considering the relatives or taking the children away
from them. The state will set aside $1 million a year to help those
families.</LD>
<LD>   "What the relatives get out of this is help from the counties --
if they're basically good homes," said Carole Shauffer, executive
director of the Youth Law Center, which filed the suit. "And they get
due process, so it's not as arbitrary a process as it's been in the
past."</LD>
<TE>   The settlement may also help the state in a dispute with the
federal government, which earlier this year began reducing grants to
California to pay foster families, alleging that the state was not
properly screening relatives, who care for 38% of the state's foster
children.</TE>
<TE>   "What this is doing is really part of convincing the feds that we
are in fact ensuring that the relative homes are in compliance with
[the Adoptions and Safe Families Act]," said Blanca Castro,
spokeswoman for the California Department of Social Services, which
oversees the counties' child welfare programs.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, the state will immediately audit 620
foster cases involving relatives across the state and will require
counties to use the same assessment form. The oversight, and creation
of an appeals process for relatives, will cost about $3 million a
year, Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal rules have required states to hold both relatives and
nonrelatives to the same standards since January 2000. For much of
the ensuing two years, California and the federal government have
been arguing in letters about whether or not the state meets the
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The state held that it was sufficient to require counties to
assess relatives and unrelated foster parents against health and
safety standards, even if those standards are different. The state
passed emergency legislation a year ago that raised some of the
standards for relatives, but did not create a mechanism to oversee
the counties' reassessment of those homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a quick answer ... for why we didn't do it two years
ago," Castro said. "To be honest with you, we thought that we were in
compliance."</TE>
<TE>   In March, Los Angeles County released a study of 200 randomly
selected foster homes involving relatives. The study found that only
1% would meet the health and safety standards that the state imposes
on foster parents who are not related to the children they raise. The
violations ranged from crowding to unsanitary or hazardous
conditions. Weapons and ammunition were not secured in eight homes,
and 25 relatives were not checked for criminal records or against the
state's child-abuse registry.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were significant because Los Angeles County is home
to more than a third of the state's foster children who live with
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the federal government has withheld $37 million
in grants, which California claimed as reimbursement to support
foster families. The state is challenging the reduction, asserting
that every foster home for which it billed the federal government met
federal standards, Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said many counties have already reassessed all of their
relatives, including Orange County, and many others expect to finish
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials said earlier this year that it had
begun using the stricter standards for relatives in new cases and
intended to hire a staff to reassess those relatives who are already
getting paid to care for children.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Auditor Investigates D.A.'s Office</HD>
<DH>The probe focuses on allegations that a Rackauckas aide
used law-enforcement funds for food and alcohol while lobbying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's auditor launched an investigation Thursday into
accusations that district attorney's officials misused funds
earmarked for law enforcement activities to buy food and alcohol
while lobbying.</LD>
<LD>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom sent Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas a letter Thursday demanding that he provide receipts and
other documentation for expenses billed to the Special Appropriations
Fund that were not related to criminal or civil investigations.</LD>
<LD>   In June, the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report that, among
other things, accused one of Rackauckas' top aides, Donald
Blankenship, of using more than $4,600 intended for law enforcement
to buy alcohol and meals for politicians, lobbyists, law enforcement
officers and others. Office policy allowed the fund to be used only
for investigative expenses, such as witness protection and undercover
operations, the grand jury said.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Sundstrom's duties are to see that the law and county
policies are complied with when county money is being spent," said
John Nakane, chief assistant auditor-controller.</TE>
<TE>   Nakane said his office will seek reimbursement from the district
attorney's office if the investigation determines that expenses were
inappropriately billed to the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The use of a special fund has emerged as an increasingly heated
issue this week, with several members of the Board of Supervisors
saying they were concerned.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury recommended that Rackauckas follow the policy that
required the special fund be used only for law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   But Rackauckas changed the policy to allow the fund to be used for
any "matter of interest," including legislative lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   He changed his mind a few weeks later, saying lobbying expenses
will be billed to the office's general fund, not the special witness
fund.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose office helped the grand jury
prepare its report, criticized Rackauckas in a letter last week for
initially ignoring the grand jury's recommendation on the issue. He
said the action "held [his] office and all of law enforcement up to
ridicule."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer added: "I commend you for making this revision, which I
hope you will keep in effect throughout your administration."</TE>
<TE>   County rules prohibit employees from billing for alcohol, except
for the unusual occurrence when an undercover officer drinks alcohol
during an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the grand jury accused Blankenship of billing the
county twice for some expenses, collecting a $32 per diem for meals,
then billing the special witness fund for meals.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship repaid the county $209.65 to cover the double-billing,
according to Rackauckas' written response to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom asked Rackauckas Thursday to provide an explanation and
receipts for all expenses Blankenship billed to the fund that were
not related to investigations. He also asked the district attorney to
provide documentation for any "meals, alcohol or lobbying expenses"
that were billed to the fund during the 2001-2002 fiscal year by any
district attorney employee.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom asked Rackauckas to respond to the request within two
weeks.</TE>

<HD>Adolph Green, 86; Lyricist and Partner Won 7 Tony Awards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adolph Green, who with writing partner Betty Comden won seven Tony
Awards in a Broadway career that stretched from "On the Town" in 1944
to their longest-running show, "The Will Rogers Follies," in 1991,
died Thursday at his home in New York City. He was 86, and the cause
of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Setting words to the music of composers such as Leonard Bernstein,
Jule Styne and Cy Coleman, Comden and Green helped create an
indelible song list that includes "Neverland" from "Peter Pan"; "Make
Someone Happy," a hit despite its beginnings in an unsuccessful 1960
show, "Do Re Mi"; and "New York, New York," the boisterous
show-opener from "On the Town."</LD>
<LD>   Comden and Green also wrote the script for "Singin' in the Rain,"
one of the most-praised of all movie musicals. They wove the story
about Hollywood's transition from silent pictures to talkies around a
number of unrelated songs written years earlier by Arthur Freed and
Herb Nacio Brown.</LD>
<TE>   Green "was the quintessential New Yorker: buoyant, optimistic and
resilient," Broadway producer-director Hal Prince said in a
statement. "And he shared all that, not only on Broadway and in film,
but with his friends. To the end, he remained a generous kid."</TE>
<TE>   Though they were close friends and creative partners, Comden and
Green were never romantically involved. Green had been married to
actress Phyllis Newman, his third wife, for nearly 43 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Adolph was a genius, brilliant in many ways," Comden said in a
telephone interview from her home in New York. "He was a funny,
inventive person, and very learned."</TE>
<TE>   Green's death caught her by surprise, she said. Just a few days
ago the two had gotten together at his apartment to work on a new
musical -- the last in a series of regular, often daily writing
klatsches dating back to the late 1930s. Comden said she was always
the scribe -- the one who held the pad and pen, then manned the
typewriter and later the computer, as the technology of writing
changed. But their aim -- writing lyrics and stories with snap --
stayed the same. She says she has never written with anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Green was born in the Bronx on Dec. 2, 1915, to Hungarian
immigrants. After high school, he went to work as a runner on Wall
Street, while trying to break into the theater as an actor. In 1938
he met the Brooklyn-born Comden, seven months his senior, who had
earned a theater degree at New York University. Another of Green's
friends, Judy Tuvin -- later famous as Oscar-winning actress Judy
Holliday ("Born Yesterday") -- scrounged an invitation to perform at
the Village Vanguard. She recruited Green, he brought in Comden, and
with two other friends they debuted, for $5 each per night, as a
satirical cabaret act called the Revuers, working up their own songs
that lightheartedly spoofed Hollywood and the press. Comden and Green
started writing to fuel the act.</TE>
<TE>   The group prospered for a time, landing a weekly NBC radio gig and
engagements at Radio City Music Hall in New York and the Trocadero in
Hollywood. The Revuers' swan song in 1944 was a fleeting appearance
in the 20th Century-Fox film "Greenwich Village."</TE>
<TE>   Back in New York, Comden and Green were approached by Bernstein, a
big fan of the Revuers. He and choreographer Jerome Robbins wanted to
expand their ballet, "Fancy Free," into a musical. Comden and Green
supplied lyrics and the book for the story about three sailors on
24-hour shore leave in Manhattan, with a return to the war ahead of
them. They also included a couple of nice parts for themselves as
actors. Green played Ozzie, a sailor, and Comden was Claire de Lune,
the anthropologist Ozzie meets at the Museum of Natural History.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Adolph has an outgoing personality, we thought we'd make
both characters kind of obsessive," Comden told the Washington Post
in 1989. "They're both people who get carried away, although she
tries to hide it. That became the basis for their big number,
'Carried Away.' "</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times review of "On the Town" trumpeted the musical
as "a perfect example of what a well-knit fusion of the respectable
arts can provide for the theater.... Everything about it is right."</TE>
<TE>   Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the film rights before the show opened
on Broadway. But adapting "On the Town" for the screen -- with Gene
Kelly and Frank Sinatra topping the credits for the 1949 film -- was
not a happy experience.</TE>
<TE>   Studio bosses "thought the Bernstein music was too difficult,"
Green told the Los Angeles Times in 1991. "And that was very sad. But
the opening's very good, because it's the only thing left of the
score, practically, and it's what most people remember most about the
film."</TE>
<TE>   Comden and Green's tenure in Hollywood also yielded their scripts
for "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) with Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, "The
Band Wagon" with Fred Astaire (1953) and "It's Always Fair Weather,"
again with Kelly (1955).</TE>
<TE>   As the movie-musical era faded in the late 1950s, Comden and Green
turned their energies fully to Broadway, where they had reaped their
first Tony in 1953 as lyricists for "Wonderful Town" -- the winner as
best musical.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, they garnered two more Tonys for "Hallelujah, Baby!,"
which featured music by Styne, starred Leslie Uggams and told the
story of black America's struggle for equality.</TE>
<TE>   "Applause," a vehicle for Lauren Bacall adapted from the film "All
About Eve," was honored for best book in 1970, and "On the Twentieth
Century" won Tonys for best book and score in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "The Will Rogers Follies" earned a 1991 Tony for best score, with
music by Coleman and lyrics by Comden and Green. It ran for 983
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Tune, who worked with Green as director-choreographer of
"The Will Rogers Follies" and remained "a dear friend," said Thursday
that Green's work had a buoyant quality that was also a hallmark of
his personal style.</TE>
<TE>   "He carried that childlike whimsy with him always," Tune said. "He
would walk the sartorial edge and never fall off -- just the
snazziest dresser, putting green and blue and yellow and purple
together without being ostentatious. He was always the guy whose feet
never touched the ground -- he had this sort of lightness of being."</TE>
<TE>   The Comden-Green song list also includes "The Party's Over" and
"Just in Time." As performers, in 1958 they mounted their own
two-person Broadway show, "A Party With Betty Comden and Adolph
Green."</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual detour, they wrote book and lyrics for "A Doll's
Life," an attempt at a musical sequel to Henrik Ibsen's drama "A
Doll's House." It closed after just five performances in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most beloved work with which Green was associated was
"Peter Pan." He and Comden were called in, along with Styne, by
Jerome Robbins to help doctor the original Mary Martin-led show with
several additional songs before it opened on Broadway in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Tune fondly recalled how Green loved to regale audiences at
charity benefits with a vigorous turn as Captain Hook: "He really got
into it. It was just abandoned madness. He would flick his arms in
these grand operatic gestures and turn and whip himself around and
end up balanced on one foot" -- all the while gesticulating with a
finger in lieu of a metal hook.</TE>
<TE>   Quoted in a 1990 Chicago Tribune article, Green commented: "I
think, at its best, our work is warm, lighthearted and throwaway,
satirical without ever being brutal, and rarely slippily sentimental.
Never bathetic. And always with a bubble."</TE>
<TE>   Comden and Green held the spotlight as performers as recently as
1999, when they did a cabaret stand at Joe's Pub in New York, drawing
not just from their Broadway hits but from their early Revuers
material.</TE>
<TE>   "He could seem elderly until he hit the stage, and then he was
literally like 23," recalled Faith Prince, who starred last year in a
revival of "Bells Are Ringing," a Comden-Green-Styne hit from 1956.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing what performing did to him. I feel about him the
way I feel about Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein," she added.
"They should live forever. I thought he would."</TE>
<TE>   Green is survived by his wife; a son, Adam Green, who is a
comedian; and a daughter, Amanda Green, who is an actress and singer.</TE>

<HD>Harry Hay, 90; Gay Liberation Pioneer, Communist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Hay, who died Thursday of lung cancer at 90, earned an unusual
distinction as a founder of the gay liberation movement and a member
of the Communist Party, which banned homosexuals.</LD>
<LD>   From the 1950s on, in frequent lectures and essays, Hay chronicled
his transition from a married man with two children in the 1940s to a
gay activist who founded the Mattachine Society, a national support
group for gays, in the early 1950s. After he was expelled from the
Mattachines several years later for his extreme politics, he went on
to help launch the Radical Faeries, a gay spirituality movement that
started in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   For these bold steps, Hay is credited with making Los Angeles the
first home to one of the most controversial social movements of the
last century. "Hay is right up there with a handful who made the gay
movement possible," said Professor Martin Duberman, who founded the
Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies at the City University of New
York's school of graduate studies. "He was the pioneer for gay men's
rights."</LD>
<TE>   Hay spent most of his life advocating a coalition of all
minorities and arguing that each group's cause was part of a larger
progressive movement. In the 1970s he supported equal rights for
women, as well as Native American issues. In the '80s he helped to
found the gay caucus of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   His dual identity as a Communist and a gay activist set Hay apart
among leaders of the gay movement. His separate-but-equal stance
forced an early debate within the movement that still continues.
Should gays and lesbians assimilate into mainstream society, or not?
Hay was against it and emphasized his position by his gender-bender
style of dress. He wore the knit cap of a macho longshoreman, a
pigtail and a strand of pearls.</TE>
<TE>   "Assimilation absolutely never worked at all," he declared in an
interview with the Progressive, a magazine about social causes, in
1998. "You may not think you are noticeable but ... you are." He
favored openness and used the words of William Shakespeare to support
his point of view, quoting the familiar line from "Hamlet": "This
above all, to thine own self be true."</TE>
<TE>   Hay was born in Worthing, England, the son of a mining engineer.
From the age of 11, he knew that he was attracted to boys, not girls.
In those years, he later explained, the term "homosexual" was not
included in most dictionaries. "We had no words to describe
ourselves," he said. He referred to homosexuals as, "temperamental
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Hay's father moved the family to Los Angeles in 1919 and Hay
entered Stanford University in 1930, but soon dropped out and
returned to Los Angeles to pursue his interest in acting. He met Will
Geer, an actor and political leftist best remembered as Grandpa on
the 1970s television series "The Waltons."</TE>
<TE>   Geer introduced Hay to the city's Communist Party, and by 1935
both men were members. Soon after, Hay stumbled on his life's work
when he joined a maritime strike in San Francisco that turned
violent. The National Guard was called in, two people were killed,
many others were injured, and Hay's twin passion for political
activism and community organizing was ignited.</TE>
<TE>   In those years he supported himself by teaching part time at the
People's Educational Center, a Marxist-oriented school in downtown
Los Angeles, acting, and doing odd jobs. "Harry was always led by the
seat of his pants to make ends meet," says Hay's biographer, Stuart
Timmons. "Activism was his primary calling."</TE>
<TE>   His attraction to communism took root in the party's claim of
solidarity with all underprivileged people. Hay included homosexuals
in that group, and referred to them as an "oppressed minority." That
vision soured as the party grew virulently anti-homosexual by the
mid-1940s.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 25 years old, alone and lonely, Hay met with a
psychiatrist. "I had been looking for another guy who would share my
political feelings and my passion to organize," he later explained in
an interview. His doctor suggested that he have a heterosexual
relationship, saying it might change his sexual preference from men
to women.</TE>
<TE>   The following year he married Anita Platky, an activist in the
party. They stayed together for 13 years and adopted two daughters,
Hannah and Kate. But marriage didn't change him. "I knew I was gay in
every bone of my body," he later said. The couple divorced in 1951,
on the grounds of extreme cruelty. His family was deeply wounded by
Hay's politics and his ongoing gay affairs. One daughter never spoke
to him again; the other remained cordial but distant.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1951, Hay resigned from the Communist Party. By then,
Russia's strongman Josef Stalin was shipping homosexuals to Siberia
as social deviants. In the U.S. two years later, President Eisenhower
barred homosexuals from all federal employment including the
military. "Homosexuality became equated with being a traitor,"
Duberman said. "The thinking was that if you were gay and you did any
type of government work, you were susceptible to blackmail by
communist agents."</TE>
<TE>   Hay met Rudi Gernreich, a fledgling fashion designer, in 1950 at a
dance studio in Los Angeles. Gernreich was destined for fame as the
inventor of the topless bathing suit for women in the mid-1960s. The
two men shared political ideals, and Gernreich encouraged Hay to
start the Mattachine Society, which he had first envisioned in the
late 1940s. Hay chose the name from a secret all-male society of 15th
century Europe and structured it after the Communist Party's cells.</TE>
<TE>   When the Mattachines met for discussions, members brought a
"cover" girl, a female friend or relative. It was against the law in
California for gay men to meet in groups.</TE>
<TE>   "The possibility of a police raid ... required that their meetings
be held in secret," Timmons wrote in the biography "The Trouble With
Harry Hay" (Alyson Publications, 1990). When someone new was invited,
Timmons wrote, "it was standard procedure for him to meet a
Mattachine member in public, then be driven around for a few blocks
before being taken to the meeting place."</TE>
<TE>   Timmons compares the Mattachines to an early gay consciousness
raising group. "For homosexuals to meet and share with each other in
a nonsexual environment was rare," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, the group caught public attention when one of its members
was arrested in an entrapment case and charged with lewd conduct. The
trial ended in a hung jury; charges were dismissed. Hay later said
the case attracted several thousand new members from across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of that trial, Hay was forced out of the society he
had founded. An increasingly conservative majority of its leaders
considered him a liability. "Homosexuals did not want leadership that
represented communist ideas," said Walter L. Williams, a professor of
anthropology and gender studies at USC. "Harry withdrew, embittered."</TE>
<TE>   Not without a few choice words. "Harry could be fiery, prickly at
times; he had a temper" said Timmons, who met Hay when he spoke at
UCLA in the mid-1970s. "He could make people very upset."</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Hay was called before the House Un-American Activities
Committee, and although he was not charged with any crime, he dropped
out of the limelight after that. In 1963, at age 51, he met John
Burnside, the inventor of the teleidoscope, a variation on the
kaleidoscope, who became his life partner. They moved to New Mexico
in 1970 and managed a trading post on a Pueblo Indian reservation
north of Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles in the '80s after a fire destroyed Burnsides'
teleidoscope factory, they shared a book-laden house on Melrose
Avenue in Hollywood. By 1999, Hay was ailing, but he accepted an
invitation to be the grand marshal of the annual gay pride parade in
San Francisco. The gay community took him in and he never returned to
Los Angeles. He spent his last years in a Victorian house, painted
pink.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his two adopted daughters, Hay is survived by his partner,
Burnside.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in his name may be made to the Southern California
Library for Social Studies and Research, 6120 S. Vermont Ave., Los
Angeles, CA 90004.</TE>

<HD>Officer in Beating Loses Job</HD>
<DH>Inglewood's police chief fires Jeremy J. Morse, who was
videotaped roughing up a teenager in July. Morse will fight the
decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy J. Morse, the Inglewood police officer facing a criminal trial
in the videotaped beating of a handcuffed 16-year-old, has been
fired, Inglewood Police Chief Ronald Banks said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I conducted a hearing, and I made my final decision," Banks said.</LD>
<LD>   Morse's rough handling of a teenager after a police stop in July
was caught on videotape by a bystander, and its broadcast caused a
nationwide outcry, claims of police brutality and local protests. A
number of law enforcement agencies investigated, and U.S. Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft criticized the officer's actions.</LD>
<TE>   Police were questioning Donovan Jackson and his father at a gas
station. The tape showed Jackson face down with his hands cuffed
behind his back. Morse lifted him from behind and slammed him onto
the trunk of a car and later punched him in the face. Jackson's
injuries were not serious. He has sued the city.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was indicted by a Los Angeles County Grand Jury on a charge
of assault under color of law, and his partner was indicted on a
charge of filing a false police report after the incident. Both
officers have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The termination was effective Oct. 14, ending Morse's paid
administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney asked Wednesday that the city begin a process of
arbitration, which is a standard option for terminated employees,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the nonbinding process, the city and the Inglewood Police Assn.
will pick an arbitrator to review the case and then forward an
opinion to City Administrator Joseph T. Rouzan Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan then will either validate the chief's decision or recommend
another action.</TE>
<TE>   The other officer facing criminal charges relating to the July 6
incident, Bijan Darvish, will meet with Chief Banks today for a
hearing on disciplinary charges.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan said Darvish is facing a 10-day suspension without pay for
"omission of information" on a police report.</TE>
<TE>   The city's actions were taken after a Superior Court judge issued,
then lifted, a restraining order in late August, clearing the way for
Banks to fire Morse. Banks on Aug. 1 initiated the process that led
to the termination.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of due process rules," Rouzan said. "They can
still wind up appealing this to a state court, and perhaps even
further, if their attorneys decide to fight it."</TE>
<TE>   Morse's lawyer in the city employment case, who does not represent
the officers on their criminal charges, could not be reached for
comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish's lawyer, Corey Glave, said his client would challenge any
disciplinary action against him.</TE>
<TE>   "We are challenging the recommendation of discipline; at some
point in time there will be a predisciplinary hearing," Glave said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Inglewood police union, who said the city's
discipline action violated the officers' rights under state law,
could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's defense had argued that the Police Department failed to
advise him of his constitutional rights before he was questioned, and
that Morse had not been allowed to have his attorney present at an
interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Morse also said that investigators had kept important documents
from his defense.</TE>
<TE>   A judge had halted the disciplinary process, but then ruled that
the internal investigation had been proper and allowed the city to
proceed.</TE>

<HD>British Lord Chancellor's Son Pleads Guilty to Stalking</HD>
<DH>Alastair Irvine is sentenced to 16 months in prison. He
will be deported when he's free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The son of Britain's top law enforcement officer pleaded guilty
Thursday to stalking and threatening the boyfriend of a woman he
wanted to date.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Christopher Strople sentenced
Alastair Irvine, 25, to 16 months in state prison and ordered him
deported upon his release. The judge also issued a 10-year
restraining order prohibiting the defendant from making contact with
the victims.</LD>
<LD>   The deal marks the end of a case that has been aggressively
covered by the British media, which flocked to Orange County this
summer after Irvine's arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine's father is Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine, who administers
the British court system and advises on the appointment of judges. He
is one of Prime Minister Tony Blair's oldest and most trusted
advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office had criticized some
British reporters for mobbing the courtroom and seeking out the
victims. But on Thursday, the sentencing occurred without incident.</TE>
<TE>   Alastair Irvine, a bodybuilder and athlete, met Nicole Healy, 19,
in June while getting a tan at the Newport Beach salon where she
worked. Several British newspapers reported that Irvine was in Orange
County after completing a stint at a drug rehabilitation center in
San Diego for cocaine addiction.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Healy about starting a romantic relationship but she
turned him down, telling Irvine she had a boyfriend, police said.
Irvine continued bringing flowers to the shop.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-page declaration written to the court, Irvine said he
went to the apartment complex where Healy and her boyfriend, Karel
Taska, lived on June 6 and poured paint stripper on Taska's truck,
causing $5,700 in damage.</TE>
<TE>   About a week later, Irvine went to the woman's workplace with a
gun in his belt, threatening Taska's life.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney James Riddet said Thursday's settlement was "very
good, despite the fact that the district attorney's office wouldn't
budge."</TE>
<TE>   "The family of Alastair Irvine is very grateful that we have
closure in this case," Riddet said. "Alastair is relieved that he
didn't face [a longer] sentence. He can never come here again, and
it's fine with him. It's closure for him."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's brothers have visited him several times, but his parents
remained in England, Riddet said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Mike Fell said of the outcome: "It was a firm and fair
sentence."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was happy he didn't get phone calls from the lord
chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate he left us alone," Fell said. "He let us handle a
job in a fair, judicious way regardless of who he was."</TE>
<TE>   British reporters said the case won't make front page news. "I
doubt there's much sympathy for him," said David Gardner, a freelance
reporter for the Daily Mail. "He's a rich kid, you know."</TE>

<HD>Jesse Greenstein, 93; Astronomer Gave Insight on Quasars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jesse L. Greenstein, a Caltech astronomer and authority on the
evolution and composition of stars, has died. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Greenstein died Monday in Arcadia from complications of surgery to
repair a hip he broke in an fall on Oct. 18.</LD>
<LD>   During a 72-year career, Greenstein helped discover some of the
strangest denizens of our universe, from extremely bright quasars to
faint, burned-out stars called white dwarfs. His research helped
shift a long-held view of the night sky as a serene, twinkling
tableau of stars to one of a violent, swirling space filled with
black holes, exploding stars and jets of scalding gas.</LD>
<TE>   "These were explosive, wild phenomena that had never been dreamed
of," said Marshall Cohen, an emeritus professor of astronomy at
Caltech who worked closely with Greenstein.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein earned a doctorate from Harvard in 1937, when
astronomers were limited by what they could see through relatively
small optical telescopes. In 1955, he took up the emerging field of
radio astronomy, which offered astronomers some of the first views of
a hot and violent universe.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein helped start the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and the
National Radio Astronomy Observatory; the latter operates major radio
telescope facilities around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things he leaves in his legacy are the bread and
butter of today's astronomy," said a Caltech astronomer, Anneila I.
Sargent. "They are part of the fabric of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Truly captivated by star-gazing, Greenstein spent more than 1,000
nights -- not a world record but close -- sitting at telescopes and
developing photographic plates to unlock the secrets of the stars he
called "inaccessible but convenient experimental laboratories."</TE>
<TE>   At age 85, Greenstein returned to Caltech's Palomar Observatory
north of San Diego for one last night of observing. He gamely climbed
into the small observing cage suspended above the Hale telescope's
200-inch primary mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "You also had to have a tough bladder," he recalled of his past
observing exploits. "If it was a good night, you stayed up [in the
cage] from 7 o'clock to 5. That's 10 hours!"</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein, who had broad interests, is credited with piecing
together the physics of many astronomical objects. He measured the
most basic makeup of stars, helped determine that nuclear reactions
within stars could produce all naturally occurring chemical elements
and probed magnetic fields strung out across interstellar space.</TE>
<TE>   He is credited, along with Caltech astronomer Maarten Schmidt,
with helping to decipher the nature of quasars, one of the biggest
astronomical mysteries of the last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists, who once thought quasars were strange, bright stars
within our own galaxy, realized by 1963 that they were the most
distant objects in the universe. The scientists surmised that quasars
therefore had to be much brighter than stars and were perhaps
galaxy-sized objects.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein and Schmidt concluded that the objects were far more
compact and energetic. This key insight is considered one of the 53
most important astronomical findings of the 20th century by two
leading journals. It helped lead to current thinking that quasars are
powered by super-massive black holes that emit light as they gobble
vast amounts of matter.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein came to Caltech in 1948, just as the university was
finishing construction of the Hale telescope, the largest of its kind
for more than 40 years. As the founding member of the Caltech
astronomy department, he taught all of its courses during his first
year and oversaw the growth of the department into one of the most
prestigious in the world.</TE>
<TE>   He was a father figure to several generations of astronomers who
still recall his presiding over the intense lunch gatherings at the
Caltech Athenaeum.</TE>
<TE>   "He was mentally very quick and could do back-of-the-envelope
calculations right in front of you. It was very entertaining," Cohen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Sargent, president of the American Astronomical Society: "I
wouldn't be the astronomer I am today without him."</TE>
<TE>   A native of New York City, Greenstein began his lifelong interest
in astronomy when he was 8 years old and received a brass telescope
from his grandfather. He went on to build his own prism spectroscope
in his family's basement.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Harvard University as an undergraduate, but gave up
his studies to help run his family's real estate business during the
Great Depression. He returned to Harvard in 1934 and completed his
doctorate three years later.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein worked for the University of Chicago for 11 years
before joining Caltech, where he remained until his retirement in
1979. He published an average of 8 1/2 papers per year, a phenomenal
rate that continued long after his formal retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1957, was
named California scientist of the year in 1964, was awarded the NASA
Distinguished Public Service Medal in 1974 and won the Gold Medal of
the Royal Astronomical Society in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein's wife of 68 years, Naomi Kitay Greenstein, died
earlier this year. They met when Greenstein was a 16-year-old
undergraduate at Harvard. Her renowned hospitality and party-giving
were long considered a major part of the Caltech astronomy
department's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein is survived by two sons, Peter of Oakland and George of
Amherst, Mass.</TE>

<HD>Bill Tackles Klamath River Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Wading into the Klamath River fight, a California
congressman is pushing for $200 million to buy farmland, boost river
flows and bankroll conservation measures so more water goes to
imperiled fish.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) introduced legislation this week
that would provide $20 million for emergency financial assistance to
help California Indian tribes and commercial fishermen hit hard by a
fish kill late last month that claimed up to 30,000 adult salmon.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson also wants to put quarreling parties on the river's upper
and lower reaches on equal footing by merging two competing task
forces that represent each side. He contends that the Bush
administration has favored farmers in the upper Klamath over tribes
and commercial fishermen in communities along the lower river.</LD>
<TE>   "It is time we work together to find workable solutions that take
all affected communities into consideration," Thompson said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He added that his legislation would encourage conservation while
bringing all sides together "to find feasible solutions for years to
come."</TE>
<TE>   But his measure, while unlikely to be debated in earnest until
next year, flies in the face of positions taken by farmers in the
Klamath Basin, a swath of more than 200,000 acres of agricultural
land on the upper Klamath along the border between California and
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers there adamantly oppose the blanket purchase of farm land
and water rights in the basin, saying such actions are too drastic
and would undermine the local farm economy.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Keppen, executive director of the Klamath Water Users Assn.,
said farmers are concerned about using legislation to set higher
river flows.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to legislate this before the science is out on what's
best," Keppen said, adding that the study Thompson uses to justify
the higher flows is "fatally flawed."</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen, Native Americans and conservation groups contend
Thompson's approach would restore balance to a process that, they
maintain, has for several years favored farmers over fish and the
people who depend on them.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Masten, chairwoman of the Yurok Tribe, said water management
along the Klamath has come down to "who has the best political
connections. Native Americans and people who depend on a healthy
river have been left high and dry. This legislation will give
everyone a fair shake."</TE>

<LD>Bullet holes marred the picture frames and door jamb of the real
estate office Thursday, and drops of blood still speckled the floor
where a Laguna Beach police officer and a store clerk had been
wounded.</LD>
<LD>   At the BMW repair shop, chalk circles marked where pieces of
evidence had lain, and numbered tags identified bullet holes in a
motor home.</LD>
<LD>   Yet tiny Herb Import Co. between the two businesses looked
virtually untouched despite an attempted robbery there Wednesday that
turned into a fatal shootout on the sidewalk of this beach town,
where lawbreaking usually means shoplifting or speeding.</LD>
<TE>   As police investigators tried to determine why the ski-masked
robber killed in the gunfire chose the small purveyor of herbal
medicines, incense and smoking paraphernalia, local business owners
and curious residents expressed relief that the city's officer and
the young clerk would recover.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Bammer, the first Laguna Beach cop to be shot on duty since
the 1950s, remained in the intensive care unit Thursday at Mission
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo with a wound on the
left side of his abdomen. Lt. Mike Hall said Bammer was expected to
be released as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   "He's young, he's energetic, he loves his profession and likely
won't be off too long," Laguna Beach Police Chief James Spreine said.</TE>
<TE>   The clerk, Jaques Nenijian, 26, of Laguna Beach, was in critical
but stable condition at the same hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not release the name of the 26-year-old gunman
because his relatives had not been notified.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said investigators have not determined why the man shot
Nenijian, whom he was handcuffing when he fired. A female clerk in
the store was unharmed. One nearby store owner said the woman was
Nenijian's girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the robber was seen an hour earlier a block north on
South Coast Highway walking on the sidewalk. He said there was no
evidence a second person was involved.</TE>
<TE>   Police found two pistols on the robber, the .357 he used to shoot
the officer and the clerk and a .22 in his backpack.</TE>
<TE>   A duffel bag the robber carried with him was filled with an
undisclosed amount of cash and merchandise he had taken from the
store, including several $67 scales and glass bongs.</TE>
<TE>   Locals expressed puzzlement about why the man would try to rob a
small shop that probably carried only a minimal amount of cash and
was miles from the nearest freeway on which to make an escape.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody said you had to be smart to be a crook," said Mike
Hendrix, owner of the repair shop next door.</TE>

<TE>   Late Wednesday night, after the streets in the area had emptied,
police took a Ford key they'd found in the robber's pocket and tried
it on parked cars. It belonged to a green Ford Explorer Sport parked
on Oak Street, a block away. The vehicle had been stolen Sept. 20 in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Locals expressed puzzlement about why the man would try to rob a

<TE>   "Nobody said you had to be smart to be a crook," said Mike

<TE>   Hendrix was working on a vehicle when the robbery occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's going on, and all of the sudden there's a shootout," he
said. He dived to the ground. "It was over as quick as it started.
I've never been in a war. If that's what war is like, I don't want to
have anything to do with it."</TE>

<HD>Tale of Two Vastly Different Cities Has Giant Role Reversal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Game 4 was in my living room, Angels and Giants in a dogfight, and
I'm not going to lie to you.</LD>
<LD>   I was going with the Giants.</LD>
<LD>   I grew up on Mays and McCovey, dressing like an Eskimo to go see
ballgames, and then kicking around in the city afterward. I spent my
first 30 years in the Bay Area, where Giant fans set Dodger pennants
on fire at Candlestick Park, and where all good children were taught
to hate Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Frankly, I haven't lived in the Bay Area for years, and I really
like the way the Angels play. As if they don't know they aren't
supposed to be in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But let's be honest here.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco or Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   Paris or Bakersfield?</TE>
<TE>   Come on.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco is, was, and will be, one of the most beautiful,
dreamy, forward-thinking cities in the entire universe. I was
enchanted from the moment I first set eyes on it, and part of rooting
for the Giants was rooting for the city.</TE>
<TE>   When the World Series began last week, the barbs started flying at
Southern California from up north. They took aim at Orange County and
Anaheim in particular, and although it stung a little bit, the
criticism was hard to refute.</TE>
<TE>   We're a bunch of car-loving, tract-house-buying mopes, and if
we're not riding the Matterhorn at Disneyland, writing inane scripts
or getting our boobs done, we're either at the Reagan library or a
John Birch Society meeting.</TE>
<TE>   OK. So it's an exaggeration, but only by a bit.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, on the other hand, is San Francisco, home of
sophisticates, poets, revolutionaries. Sure, the yuppies took the
place over for a while, doing combat with those who would love to
maintain the city as a progressive theme park.</TE>
<TE>   But the city's soul is intact, which I can attest to from periodic
trips back home. I wanted evidence I could hold in my hands, though,
so I did some reading and studied the latest census figures.</TE>
<TE>   Can this be right?</TE>
<TE>   I should have left well enough alone.</TE>
<TE>   Guess which city is conducting an all-out war on its most
destitute citizens -- the homeless: proudly progressive San Francisco
or backwater Anaheim, which sits in the heart of historically
conservative Orange County?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is San Francisco, which has no fewer than 33 billboards
screaming for a crackdown on its lost souls.</TE>
<TE>   I was shocked myself.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another.</TE>
<TE>   Which city stiffed its public transit system, creating hellish
traffic jams and inciting crazed motorists to run eco-friendly
cyclists off the road: European San Francisco or car-crazy Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   Again, San Francisco. Although in fairness, Anaheim doesn't have
much in the way of mass transit unless you count the Monorail.</TE>
<TE>   Which city is more diverse: Famously eclectic San Francisco, or
white-bread Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   The answers are clear as day in the 2002 census figures, and they
must be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, Latinos make up 43% of the population. In San
Francisco, it's 12.2%, if you can trust the U.S. Census Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   I was sure it was higher than that. This might lead critics to
assume that before its campaign of terror on the homeless, San
Francisco successfully crushed Latino immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos are practically everywhere else in California,
constituting 32.4% of the state's residents. Based on these stats,
there might be more Latino characters in Disneyland's "It's a Small
World" attraction than in all of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has it over Anaheim on Asians, 31.1% to 12.3%. But
then I made the mistake of looking at the numbers for whites.</TE>
<TE>   A mere 35.9% of Anaheim is white, compared to 43.6% for San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Has Anaheim become the new San Francisco, openly embracing
everyone and anything?</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. But San Francisco, home of the American pinko movement,
appears to have given up on socialism and now excludes by class, as
well as by race.</TE>
<TE>   The median S.F. income is $55,221, compared to $47,122 for
Anaheim. And when it comes to high rollers, 24.6% of San
Franciscans--nearly one-fourth!--rake in more than $100,000 a year,
as opposed to only 14.6% in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   While I wasn't looking, San Francisco became a city of
millionaires and panhandlers. I suppose this explains why
fixer-uppers in gentrifying neighborhoods go for more than $1
million. San Francisco has apparently come to resemble Newport Beach,
but with different sailors. Given the real estate prices up there,
it's no surprise the San Francisco Giants make $16 million more as a
team than the hungry upstarts from Anaheim, city of the people, city
of the future, se habla espanol.</TE>
<TE>   Go Angels.</TE>

<HD>3rd Agency Probes Pine Grove Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following on the heels of state and county investigations, a national
agency that inspects hospitals opened a new inquiry Thursday into
sexual misconduct at Pine Grove Hospital in West Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
asked officials at the private psychiatric hospital to provide
information on four of the five reported instances of sexual
molestation involving Pine Grove patients and former patients that
have occurred since 2000, said Mark Forstneger, spokesman for the
Illinois-based commission.</LD>
<LD>   "We take these instances very seriously," Forstneger said. "We are
going to follow up on all of them."</LD>
<TE>   Pine Grove administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment
Thursday. But in previous interviews, he noted that the hospital has
made a number of changes to ensure patient safety.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a 17-year-old boy who was a patient raped a 13-year-old
girl in Pine Grove's adolescent ward. An inquiry by the state
Department of Health Services found the hospital violated its own
rules by failing to place a monitor in the hallway. The boy pleaded
guilty to one count of a lewd act with a child.</TE>
<TE>   Two former Pine Grove employees have also been convicted since
2000 for having sex with underage girls who were patients at the
hospital. Los Angeles police detectives investigated two other former
employees accused of molesting patients, but did not file charges.</TE>
<TE>   Forstneger said his agency would scrutinize all reported episodes,
except one involving the August 2000 rape of an underage girl in a
hospital bathroom, which the agency has already investigated.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit commission currently lists Pine Grove as a fully
accredited hospital "with full standards of compliance," its highest
rating.</TE>
<TE>   However, the hospital's accreditation was downgraded after a May
2001 inspection found that Pine Grove was underperforming in three
areas: staff training, assessment of employee competence and "special
procedures" -- a category that includes such sensitive treatment
methods as restraint, seclusion and psychosurgery.</TE>
<TE>   The commission would not elaborate on the nature of the problems.
The hospital showed that it had resolved the problems that led to the
citations by December 2001, and its status was upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   The current inquiry, Forstneger said, will determine the severity
of the episodes and allegations. The commission will then determine
whether the hospital thoroughly revised its rules and procedures to
prevent any recurrence, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Results of similar investigations by the state Department of
Health Services and the Los Angeles County Department of Mental
Health are due to be released in the next few weeks.</TE>

<HD>Simon Chips In for Final TV Spots</HD>
<DH>Short on donors and time, Davis' challenger lends his
campaign an additional $1.25 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey L. Rabin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far behind in resources needed to broadcast his message to California
voters, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. reported
Thursday that he has lent an additional $1.25 million to his
financially struggling campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The businessman-candidate's latest loan brings his personal
investment in his candidacy to more than $10.25 million.</LD>
<LD>   Simon made the loan Wednesday, just a day before the filing of
final preelection campaign finance reports showed that Gov. Gray
Davis had 10 times more money on hand than Simon.</LD>
<TE>   Flush from the fund-raising that has become a hallmark of his
governorship, Davis reported having $12.1 million in his campaign
treasury at the close of the reporting period Saturday, compared with
$1.2 million for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign strategist Garry South said the war chest, combined
with additional money the governor has raised since, will pay for
television commercials in English, Spanish and Asian languages, plus
a direct-mail and get-out-the-vote telephone campaign.</TE>
<TE>   South said the Davis campaign is spending more than $3 million on
television commercials this week and may increase that amount before
the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Simon campaign spokesman Mark Miner declined to discuss how much
broadcast time the GOP contender will buy in the days ahead. "We will
be on the air from now until the election," he said. Miner said there
is no way that Simon can compete with Davis in fund-raising. But he
insisted the campaign will have the resources needed to communicate
with the state's voters.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a Los Angeles investment banker making his first foray into
electoral politics, is the largest single contributor to his
campaign. His loan Wednesday comes atop earlier loans both before and
after the March primary.</TE>
<TE>   Simon told reporters Thursday in Long Beach that he had not
decided if he will put more money into the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy with where we are right now, in terms of our media
buy," the underdog challenger said." We think now that we definitely
will run a very strong campaign through November the fifth."</TE>
<TE>   The latest campaign finance reports showed that both candidates
spent far more than they raised in the first three weeks of October,
as the costs of reaching voters in the nation's most populous state
mounted.</TE>
<TE>   With far more money available, Davis spent $12.2 million compared
with Simon's $5.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Davis raised $3.4 million in the first 19 days of the
month, while Simon collected $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to $10.25 million in loans to his gubernatorial
effort, Simon also reported making $49,380 in contributions to the
campaign, in part to pay for chauffeur services and food and
beverages at a reception.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Simon, the Republican National Committee topped the list
of major donors to the Simon campaign in recent weeks, providing the
nominee with $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Coors, a member of the Colorado brewing family, gave
$100,000 to Simon during the latest period. Stockton developer Alex
Spanos made $76,380 in cash and nonmonetary contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Univision Chairman Jerry Perenchio donated $50,000 to Simon's
campaign, along with $100,000 to Davis'. The nation's largest Spanish
language broadcaster, a routinely bipartisan donor, has given
substantially more money to Davis over the course of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's receipt of $50,000 from the Firearms Freedom Fund of
Fullerton reflects the support the candidate is receiving from gun
owner groups.</TE>
<TE>   While the Davis campaign supplied a summary sheet listing its
income and expenditures, the complete list of the governor's
contributors was not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   Based on daily reports of large contributions, it was expected
that labor unions will be among the governor's top donors in this
period, as has been the case throughout the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Communication Workers of America gave $200,000 to Davis in early
October. The Democratic incumbent also received $120,000 from the
union that represents state engineers. Service employees and
ironworkers gave $100,000 each.</TE>

<HD>Deputies Stop Inmate Melee Between Latinos and Asians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fight between Latino and Asian inmates at the Theo Lacy Branch Jail
last week led to a small-scale riot that was quickly quelled by
deputies, officials said Thursday. Orange County sheriff's spokesman
Jim Amormino said deputies restored order in less than five minutes
and no one was injured.</LD>
<LD>   Amormino said the disturbance occurred Oct. 18 after several
Latino inmates beat an Asian prisoner. Other Asian prisoners
retaliated by attacking a Latino. This prompted deputies to search
the cells for weapons, which angered about 100 Latino prisoners, said
Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   The Latino prisoners barricaded themselves behind doors, but they
were quickly overpowered by about 25 deputies, Amormino said. During
the search, deputies recovered six weapons, most of them shanks and
"saps" made from bars of soap inside socks, he said.</LD>

<HD>Unusual Items Will Be Flying Off the Shelves at Space and
Aviation Auction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the items on the block in this weekend's Space and Aviation
Memorabilia Auction in Santa Monica is an "ejection seat ... complete
with seat belt and power cables. Excellent overall condition."</LD>
<LD>   Just the thing to activate when you're trapped in a SigAlert on
the San Diego Freeway!</LD>
<LD>   Spacey stuff (cont.): Other unusual collectibles to be auctioned
at the Santa Monica Museum of Flying include:</LD>
<TE>   * A Russian-made "wooden ashtray studded with 10 rifle/machine gun
shells and an airplane made from bullets" (see photo). Nobody will
dare tell you to stop smoking if they see you using this!</TE>
<TE>   * "Early Space Food Lot," a decades-old package of "freeze-dried
apricot juice with pulp, freeze-dried yogurt, dehydrated vegetable
soup and a tube (leaking) of meat spread." I think I have one of
those tubes in my refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Just a pedicure, thanks: Rosemary LeForte of Huntington Beach
noticed an ad from a nail salon that seems to dabble in birth control
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Handy tips: Joanne Austin of Camarillo quipped that "it was
difficult to put together this shelving unit -- I couldn't seem to
find the correct tools" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. I wonder if I was using that "screwdriver" when I broke the
family toilet I was attempting to fix. All I know is my wife would
have strapped me into an ejection seat if she'd had one handy.</TE>
<TE>   Stupid criminal tricks: An LAPD officer, sipping a latte (with no
doughnut) in a coffee shop, saw a car swerving down the street and
took off in pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the driver struck a parked car and continued down the
street, leaving a trail of debris.</TE>
<TE>   The officer followed the debris to a cul-de-sac, where he found
the driver passed out at the wheel, with a can of beer in his hand,
reported the Thin Blue Line, a police union newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Photos of the driver were taken to mark the occasion and then he
was given a ride to jail. Oh, yes, what was the driver's pillow when
he was found? A 12-pack of beer.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In the spirit of Halloween, the Art Deco Society of
L.A. will conduct its 19th annual walking tour at the Hollywood
Forever Cemetery on Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The society's Suzanne Cooper promises to dig up the dirt on such
stars as Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks and such mysteries
as the cemetery's Atlas rocket grave site (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   A shame that the space auction and the rocket grave briefing have
to overlap.</TE>

<HD>Future Lawyers Get a High-Tech Education</HD>
<DH>'SmartVideo' helps Loyola students learn the nuts and bolts
of litigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The videotape catches the two would-be lawyers scratching their heads
as they interview a client. They mutter "um" and "like" probably a
little more than they had ever noticed before. One tosses in the word
"tort."</LD>
<LD>   "What's a tort?" the client demands.</LD>
<LD>   Challenged to describe the basic idea of a legal wrong, the
students freeze. Their classmates erupt in laughter.</LD>
<TE>   The students attend Loyola Law School. The "client" is actually a
hired actor. On just about any school day, instant replay-style
videos allow students to test their lawyering skills before actors
who pose as clients and judges.</TE>
<TE>   "Be prepared to explain every legal concept," professor Arnold
Seigal warns the two students.</TE>
<TE>   So-called SmartVideo technology, which is easier to edit and
maneuver than standard VHS video, is not new to law schools. But
since its introduction to legal education, the role-playing
possibilities have made the technology increasingly important at law
schools across the country.</TE>
<TE>   At Loyola, cutting-edge equipment in nearly every classroom is
just one sign of the school's growing sophistication in -- and
enthusiasm for -- what's known as trial advocacy. Trial advocacy
programs teach students the nuts and bolts of litigation skills: how
to successfully and ethically advocate their cases before judges,
juries, the media and one another.</TE>
<TE>   The urban campus in Pico Union, the school that taught such
well-known lawyers as Robert Shapiro and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.,
recently opened the multimillion-dollar Albert H. Girardi Advocacy
Center, a state-of-the-art building designed by internationally
acclaimed architect Frank O. Gehry.</TE>
<TE>   The distinctive square, red structure features a trial courtroom,
an appellate courtroom, a jury deliberation room, several classrooms
and video training labs and a who's who gallery of famous alumni and
donors. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy attended
opening ceremonies last month.</TE>
<TE>   The center's courtrooms, said director and professor Laurie
Levenson, are expected to host real trials on a regular basis, and
there are plans to get some of the biggest names in law to take up
litigator-in-residence posts -- among them "the tobacco lawyers, the
asbestos lawyers, the Enron lawyers," she said. "Whoever's hot, we
will be inviting. And if it were an impeachment year, the impeachment
lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   In two courtrooms, the judge sits at a bench equipped with
touch-screen panels that make it easy to switch among live feed,
video evidence and electronic graphs -- no more easels, markers and
butcher paper.</TE>
<TE>   There are video-monitored "interview" rooms where students meet
"clients," who are sometimes intentionally difficult, even
confrontational. Sometimes they simply refuse to cooperate. In
another room, fellow students can watch and critique. And after
filming, students watch themselves, like football players studying
pass techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "Students can't be afraid of technology," Levenson said. "For all
the judges that complain about cameras in the courtroom, we think
it's helpful.... There's no better way to learn than to see
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Just a month old, the Girardi center is already turning heads.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an expensive way to teach law students. There is lots of
technology, computer graphics, hardware and software; rooms
themselves have to be set up in a way that is not traditionally
classroom-ish," said University of Miami law professor Lawrence Rose,
who also is executive director of the National Institute for Trial
Advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   "To see schools like Loyola produce centers like this, frankly, is
very progressive, and very enlightening," Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola has for years produced videos teaching litigation skills
that have been widely used by law schools and bar associations. The
school's central metropolitan location means a large proportion of
its students end up working at Los Angeles' downtown law firms.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and others said that there's more than high-tech legal
learning aids in the school's approach to teaching law.</TE>
<TE>   As law schools across the country devote considerable resources to
attract top students and professors, Loyola's strategy is taking
learning back to what professors say students take most for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of law students think they're just naturals when it comes
to dealing with people. The truth is that law students until now have
been woefully unprepared" for litigation, said Levenson, a former
federal trial attorney. "I think we've learned that book learning is
not good enough. There's just been a disconnect between what's
learned in the classroom and what's needed in the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola students must "have one foot inside the ivy walls and one
foot inside the practice of law," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, more and more Southern California law schools
have bolstered their offerings in trial advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles
announced that it had acquired $1 million in federal money to help
build its own teaching courtroom and trial advocacy center.</TE>
<TE>   Professors at other Southland law schools said their curricula
also have changed to reflect the growing interest in litigation
skills. USC's law school has added more litigation courses and has
developed clinics that heavily rely on advocacy training, said
professor and associate dean Scott Altman.</TE>
<TE>   Though UCLA's law school also has boosted its already strong trial
advocacy offerings, professor Paul Bergman, who has written two books
on the subject, said the school is not "rushing" to make trial
advocacy its curricular crown jewel.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we think about it is to continue to develop the theory
and learning about trial advocacy, rather than to put money into
buildings and flashy courtrooms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trial advocacy has caught on. National mock trial competitions
draw student teams, usually coached by trial advocacy professors,
from all corners of the country. Teams from Loyola brought home two
national championships in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Allred, a prominent lawyer and radio show host, said the
trial advocacy training she got at Loyola before she graduated in
1974 helped her forge relationships with district attorney litigators
and even her future partners. Now, she said, what Loyola has to offer
is several times more sophisticated, and Los Angeles' future lawyers
-- and clients -- stand to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge of the advocacy center will help toughen up the
students and let them know what they can do, what's expected of
them," she said. "Some of them have doubts, and the only way to
resolve those doubts is to get in there and do it."</TE>

<HD>Park Pavement Breaks New Ground</HD>

<LD>A group of people will gather in a park today to chip away at the
notion that concrete is the bane of nature.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion could mark a watershed event -- literally -- in
environmental thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Regional and state officials will break ground for a
state-of-the-art gateway to the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, the nation's largest urban park.</LD>
<TE>   The big draw will be a poured sample of "environmentally friendly"
concrete that will be used to pave parking and walkway areas of the
parkland on Mulholland Drive, just off of Topanga Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first large-scale use of the material by a state
agency in California, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unbelievable stuff," said Stephanie Landregan, chief
landscape architect for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which
owns the new park. "It's just the coolest thing to watch water go
right through it."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentally friendly concrete may sound like an oxymoron, but
environmentalists are going gaga over it, Landregan said.</TE>
<TE>   It consists of dun-colored porous pavement that looks like a
combination of soil and gravel. The difference is that it stays
put--it doesn't "give" like dirt or crunch like gravel. And it looks
natural, Landregan said. "If you didn't look too hard, you wouldn't
realize that it's artificial."</TE>
<TE>   Traditional concrete sheds water that in turn digs gullies or
collects in puddles. Porous concrete allows water to percolate into
the ground. It recharges ground water, prevents erosion, filters out
harmful substances and, if it is used in urban settings, decreases
the amount of water that flows uselessly to the ocean in storm
sewers, Landregan said.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents the merger of green infrastructure with
traditional construction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new 61-acre portal to the vast national recreation area
straddling the Santa Monica Mountains has been chosen as a showcase
for the new material. "This is the first state-sponsored project in
California to do this," Landregan said. Porous concrete will be used
to pave the mile-long entry road, a 70-car parking lot and walkways.</TE>
<TE>   The new parkland is also important, officials said, because it
will provide San Fernando Valley residents with easier access to the
recreation area, which is a patchwork of parks stretching from Point
Mugu in Ventura County to Griffith Park in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors from north of Mulholland currently have to make a long
drive through winding Topanga Canyon to get to the most popular parts
of the recreation area.</TE>
<TE>   By next summer, the added parkland will allow nature lovers to zip
south from the Ventura Freeway on a short stretch of Topanga Canyon
Boulevard and be in the wilderness in record time.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not a big hiker or mountain biker, you might not want
to go the long route," conservancy spokeswoman Dash Stolarz said.
"This is a very easy-to-get-to place." The newly acquired land is
surrounded on all sides by trails leading to the heart of the
recreation area.</TE>
<TE>   When visitors arrive at Mulholland Gateway Park, they'll be
greeted by state-of-the-art facilities, including solar-powered
lighting, self-composting restrooms and a half-mile interpretive
nature trail accessible by wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   The land was purchased with $6 million in state funds from a
voter-approved bond measure after years of efforts by activists to
prevent residential development, Stolarz said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dignitaries expected to attend today's ceremony are
state Resources Secretary Mary Nichols, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman
Oaks), Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) and Los Angeles
City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>

<HD>But Are You Fans Prepared to Lose?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tired of reading about the Angels? Me too.</LD>
<LD>   Think for one second we're going to let up? No chance.</LD>
<LD>   But look on the bright side: Early in the last century, the World
Series was best-of-nine. Now, it's only best-of-seven. It'll all be
over soon. We can all get back to our lives, minus the excitement.</LD>
<TE>   That's why I want to do a little hand-holding today. As local
preachers ask every Sunday in one way or another: Are you prepared
for the end?</TE>
<TE>   You'd better be, because this weekend, out there on the normally
sedate greenery of Edison Field in Anaheim, you Angels fans are going
to experience either rapture beyond your wildest dreams or one giant
bummer.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, you'll want to be ready.</TE>
<TE>   If it's the rapture, you know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Just lift your arms skyward and begin shouting and laughing. Hug
the guy next to you, even if it means that he slops his beer on you.</TE>
<TE>   It's the bummer scenario that worries me.</TE>
<TE>   Some of you will be able to handle it. However, based on hundreds
of phone conversations and letters over the years, I realize many of
you are deeply troubled and not up to the task of accepting a World
Series loss.</TE>
<TE>   You will feel the need to telephone TV's Dr. Phil and ask him what
to do, to ask how you possibly can handle the pain.</TE>
<TE>   He'll tell you that "life goes on" and that "lots of things are
more important than winning the World Series," but you'll know
instinctively he's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   He'll ask why you're investing so much in a baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   You'll want to pluck his mustache, hair by hair.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not worried about longtime Angel fans, the ones who go back 20
years or more. You already understand the unique pain that baseball
can inflict.</TE>
<TE>   My concern is you new fans -- the innocent children or
bandwagon-hopping adults who have been die-hard Angel boosters since
about mid-September. The ones who have seen in this brilliant
three-week burst in October how exhilarating and fulfilling baseball
can be -- when your team is doing everything right -- and think
that's the way it always is.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the final act beckons. On either Saturday or Sunday, these
new fans know the Angels will win the Series, because they're such
good guys and Gene Autry would be so happy and David Eckstein is so
cute and we beat the Yankees and Twins already.</TE>
<TE>   To those fans: The Angels could lose.</TE>
<TE>   Not saying they will, but they could. I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't alert you to that.</TE>
<TE>   That said, I can't begin to prepare you for the pain. Oh, yeah,
and it lasts a lifetime, too.</TE>
<TE>   I've been a Pittsburgh Pirates fan for more than 40 years. Twice
they led games going into the bottom of the ninth inning that, had
they held on to win, would have sent them to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   One of those losses was 30 years ago, the other 10. I haven't made
peace with either one.</TE>
<TE>   The memory of the physical and emotional pain those games caused
bubbles up every October. All that emotional investment, the fervent
hopes ... dashed in an instant. Dashed with a finality that hits you
right in the gut.</TE>
<TE>   That, Angel fan, is the risk you're running. In short, you're
exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you'll be lucky.</TE>
<TE>   On what remain three of the most blissful days of my life, the
Pirates won the World Series -- each time in the seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   May the Rally Monkey cast his divine light on you this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   May you feel the rapture.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Halos lose and, worse yet, do so in an especially
excruciating manner ...</TE>
<TE>   Remember, there's no crying in baseball.</TE>

<HD>Father Guilty in Pet Death</HD>
<DH>Jury convicts Oxnard man who dissected daughter's guinea
pig because he thought it was a spy robot. He faces up to three
years.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man who dissected his young daughter's guinea pig because
he thought it was a government spy robot has been convicted of animal
cruelty for starving the rodent to death, a prosecutor said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   After a day of deliberations, a Ventura County Superior Court jury
Wednesday night also convicted Benny Zavala, 34, of being under the
influence of methamphetamine, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Redmond said.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors acquitted Zavala of a second animal cruelty count of
torture because the guinea pig was already dead when dissected.</LD>
<TE>   Zavala, who is free on bail, faces up to three years in prison
when Superior Court Judge Donald Coleman sentences him Nov. 20.
However, he will most likely receive time in Ventura County Jail or
probation because he has no serious criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Zavala was at home with his father the
night of Sept. 13, 2001, when he invited a neighbor to his house. In
front of his father and the neighbor, Zavala allegedly poked at
"Guinea" with a knife and talked about a hidden camera inside. Zavala
was accused of beating the guinea pig on the head with a screwdriver
after the neighbor left and then cutting it open.</TE>
<TE>   After the dissection, Zavala called his neighbor again and told
her he now realized the animal wasn't a robot. The neighbor notified
mental health officials, who contacted police.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Zavala's attorney argued his client was not high on
methamphetamine and that his bloodshot eyes were the result of
smoking marijuana. The defense also said the guinea pig had died from
starvation. A necropsy confirmed the starvation.</TE>

<HD>PUC Orders Utilities to Buy Power Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Over the objections of investor-owned utilities, the
California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday took what
officials called the final procedural step to get the state out of
the power-buying business by New Year's Day.</LD>
<LD>   "The utilities will be back in business," PUC President Loretta M.
Lynch declared as the commission unanimously approved a decision
requiring Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric to resume buying power next year.</LD>
<LD>   The commission also imposed a surcharge on utility customers to
cover the cost over the next two decades of a record $12-billion bond
sale to finance the state's past and future power tab. Officials said
the surcharge, about $2.50 a month for the average customer, would
not result in a rate increase, but could delay any future rate
reduction by a couple of weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The actions were the latest in a series of tortuous maneuvers the
PUC has taken to shape the future delivery of electricity to millions
of Californians and help replenish the state treasury, which was
drained of billions of dollars after financially ailing utilities
stopped buying power during the 2000-01 energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's actions did not come without resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and PG&amp;E have said they cannot resume full procurement of
electricity without Wall Street ratings that would allow them to
effectively buy power. And although SDG&amp;E has an investment-grade
rating, the company argued that it should not be required to resume
procurement until at least one of the other utilities does so too.</TE>
<TE>   Casting aside those arguments, the commission said Edison and PG&amp;E
are in a good position to conduct business, with strong cash flow and
earnings, plus hundreds of millions of dollars in cash on hand.
Edison reported $1.1 billion in cash on hand as of Aug. 31, after
using $3 billion to pay creditors. The PUC said PG&amp;E, which filed for
Chapter 11 protection from creditors in April 2001, had almost $4
billion at the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the commission said 90% of the energy needs of
customers already is covered by the utilities' power generation,
their existing contracts and long-term pacts entered by the state
Department of Water Resources after it started buying power in
January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recently gave the utilities permission to use more
of the state's credit, interest free, to cover their projected
procurement needs for the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E spokesman John Nelson said there are serious obstacles to
resuming power procurement, because the utility will need either an
investment-grade rating or adequate collateral. "Being in bankruptcy,
all of our cash on hand is pledged to pay off creditors," he said.
"Without Bankruptcy Court approval, you can't start dipping into cash
on hand to start purchasing power."</TE>
<TE>   An Edison spokesman said the utility would have no immediate
comment until it had reviewed the PUC's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC voted 3 to 2 to establish a surcharge that would pay for
the energy bonds and interest, which will amount to more than $18
billion. The surcharge will be about a half-cent per kilowatt hour.</TE>
<TE>   The decision exempts low-income customers and those with special
medical conditions, as well as customers of SDG&amp;E who consume less
than 130% of a baseline amount. Officials say they are exempting
SDG&amp;E to avoid a rate increase there.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood voted against the surcharge
decision after Lynch argued that it could jeopardize the state's bond
because it would invite litigation. She said it conflicts with
Assembly Bill 1x because it imposes a surcharge on usage under 130%
of baseline.</TE>
<TE>   "We should exempt those baseline customers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Jeff Brown, who sponsored the alternative measure,
said he was trying to spread the burden to as many ratepayers as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson of PG&amp;E said he is concerned that the decision may be
unfair to PG&amp;E customers. "Everyone who uses energy ought to pay
their fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network,
said the surcharge will appear on utility bills for two decades and
is legally questionable. "This will be paid by people who were not
even here during the energy crisis," she said.</TE>

<HD>Beulah Quo, 79; Actress Started East West Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beulah Quo, a film and TV character actress who co-founded one of the
first Asian American theater groups in Los Angeles in the 1960s, died
of heart failure Wednesday in a hospital in La Mesa, Calif. She was
79.</LD>
<LD>   Quo, who was also a respected community leader, had roles in more
than 20 feature films, including "Flower Drum Song," "Gypsy," "Girls!
Girls! Girls!," "Chinatown," "Into the Night," "Bad Girls" and
"MacArthur."</LD>
<LD>   She also appeared in 16 movies for television and more than 100 TV
shows. Most notably, she played Kublai Khan's empress in the NBC
miniseries "Marco Polo," co-starred as a Vietnamese orphanage
director in the CBS TV movie "The Children of An Lac" and played a
stern Chinese university dean in the CBS TV movie "Forbidden Nights."</LD>
<TE>   She received an Emmy nomination in 1978 for her performance as
Tzu-hsi, dowager empress of China, in an episode of Steve Allen's
"Meeting of Minds" series.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Quo began a six-year-run in the recurring role of Olin,
the hip-talking, wise housekeeper and confidant on ABC-TV's "General
Hospital."</TE>
<TE>   "As an actress, she blazed a trail in terms of the depiction of
Asian American woman in the various roles she played, and she never
accepted roles that might tarnish the Asian American image," said
actor George Takei, a longtime friend who appeared with Quo on
various TV shows and collaborated with her on other projects.</TE>
<TE>   Quo hadn't planned on an acting career. Born in Stockton in 1923,
she earned a bachelor's degree in social welfare from UC Berkeley and
a master's degree in sociology at the University of Chicago. She
taught in China after World War II. She and her husband, Edwin Kwoh,
escaped on a U.S. destroyer with their month-old son just as the
communists took over.</TE>
<TE>   She was teaching sociology at a community college when she heard
that director Henry King was looking for a dialect coach for Jennifer
Jones, who played a Eurasian in the 1955 film "Love Is a
Many-Splendored Thing." The director instead hired Quo to play a
small role in the film as Jones' aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Quo then set aside her teaching career to study acting. "As I got
into it, I got more interested because, you know, most teachers are
hams," she told the Washington Post in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, she changed her married name, Kwoh, to Quo "because
I got tired of being asked, 'Is [Kwoh] a radio station?' "</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, she became the first Asian American to produce
TV public affairs programs on the Asian American community.
"Expressions East West" aired on KNBC-TV Channel 4 and was moderated
by Takei. She also produced "James Wong Howe: The Man and His
Movies," a documentary for KNBC-TV that earned her a local Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, Quo co-founded East West Players, the nation's first
Asian American repertory group, and served as board president for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she worked frequently on the stage, receiving a
DramaLogue Award for outstanding performance for her 1997 role in
"Ikebana," an East West Players production.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, she helped organize the Assn. of Asian/Pacific
American Artists, formed to create opportunities for Asian/Pacific
American artists in front of and behind the scenes, as well as to
promote balanced images of Asian/Pacific Americans on camera and on
stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Frequently when Hollywood won't even consider an Asian actor for
a leading role, we hear that the Asian is not 'bankable,' " Quo told
The Times in 1985. "I would like to refute that statement." She said
the work of Haing S. Ngor, in "The Killing Fields" and Pat Morita in
"The Karate Kid" -- Ngor won a best supporting actor Oscar and Morita
was nominated for one -- "made those films what they are, and those
films are bringing in box-office dollars -- because those actors are
'bankable.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the Assn. of Asian/Pacific American Artists presented Quo
with its lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   "Those organizations probably would not have been, except for
Beulah," said Takei. "She was so alive. She was a doer and an
inspirer and an achiever."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Quo and Takei co-chaired a capital fund-raising
campaign that raised $1.7 million to move the East West Players from
a 99-seat theater on Santa Monica Boulevard into a new 240-seat
theater -- the David Henry Hwang Theater -- in a historic building in
downtown L.A.'s Little Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Quo also was responsible for a number of theater productions that
depicted the experiences of Asians in the U.S. Appointed to the
Sesquicentennial Commission, commemorating the state's 150 years of
statehood, she commissioned "Heading East," a musical celebrating the
history of Asian Americans in California. She also was a driving
force behind the 1999 production of "Carry the Tiger to the
Mountain," playing the mother of Vincent Chin, a young Chinese
American who was beaten to death in 1982 by two autoworkers in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Quo is survived by her husband, her son Stewart Kwoh, her daughter
Mary Ellen Shu and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Rape of Monroe High Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 18-year-old Los Angeles man who was arrested Thursday in
connection with the abduction and rape of a Monroe High School
student has been linked to at least eight other sexual assaults or
attempted attacks in the San Fernando Valley, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect is believed to be responsible for attacks since
December in areas covered by the Los Angeles Police Department's
Devonshire, Foothill and Van Nuys divisions, said Det. Jesse
Alvarado. The man's identity is being withheld as police investigate
his ties to the other crimes.</LD>
<LD>   In the abduction on Oct. 18, a man in a white Honda Accord
approached a 14-year-old Monroe High student walking in the 9000
block of Willis Avenue. The girl was on her way to the North Hills
school and the man offered her a ride.</LD>
<TE>   When the girl refused, the man drove farther up the block. After
parking his car, he again approached the girl, simulated pointing a
gun at her and forced her into the car. He then drove to an alley
about two blocks away where he assaulted her, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was the latest in a string of assaults allegedly
carried out by the suspect involving victims who range in age from 14
to 26, Alvarado said. Five of the victims were under 18, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the case has been tough to solve because the assailant
committed a variety of crimes, including kidnappings and child
annoyance acts. The assailant also drove up to his victims in
different vehicles, police said, making it more difficult to detect a
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, investigators released a composite sketch of
the assailant, described as an Asian man in his early 20s, 5 feet 3,
120 pounds, with brown eyes, black hair and pock-marked skin. He was
wearing a white hooded sweater, black or gray shorts and white shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said at least two dozen people from Whittier to Santa
Clarita called with information needed to break the case.</TE>
<TE>   At Monroe High on Thursday, Principal Greg Vallone said the arrest
would help calm nerves. But he warned that students should always be
cautious when walking to and from school. Teachers on Monday
distributed 5,000 fliers with safety tips for students, advising them
to walk with a friend or in a group on well-lighted streets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad he's off the street," Vallone said. "It's a horrible
thing he has done. To be honest, the cooperation with news media,
making this a focus, truly helped in solving this crime. I know he'll
be off the streets for a long time."</TE>

<HD>Jury Selection Begins in Ryder Shoplifting Trial</HD>
<DH>Potential jurors are sworn in and asked how they feel about
the actress.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jury selection began Thursday in the shoplifting trial of actress
Winona Ryder, with 33 prospective jurors handed a three-page
questionnaire asking if they had heard about the case and how they
felt about the Hollywood star.</LD>
<LD>   The jury panel, which was sworn in after more than two hours of
closed hearings in the Beverly Hills courthouse, is due to return at
1:30 p.m. today for continued proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   The jury questionnaire focused on publicity surrounding the case,
in which Ryder is accused of stealing about $6,000 worth of
merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors were asked whether they have read articles or viewed
television coverage about the case and whether they have any sympathy
or antipathy toward Ryder, the Oscar-nominated star of movies such as
"Little Women" and "Girl, Interrupted."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elden Fox ordered the potential jurors not to
watch television coverage or read newspaper articles about the Ryder
case. He told them not to talk to friends or family about the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors will not be sequestered during the trial, which is expected
to last up to seven days, but will be escorted to and from the
courtroom by sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, wearing a pink top and a floral print dress, sat next to
her attorney, Mark Geragos, and took notes at the hearing Thursday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Before the jury pool entered the courtroom, Fox held a lengthy
closed hearing on what a Superior Court spokesman later said were
pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   Fox did not explain what was discussed in closed session. He
refused to hear arguments from an attorney representing The Times
regarding the closed hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said
Ryder entered pleas of not guilty to the three felony counts on which
she is charged: grand theft, burglary and vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, who was arrested in December, could be sentenced to three
years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Opening statements are scheduled to start Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The actress is free on $20,000 bail.</TE>

<LD>Developer, vintner and former "Davy Crockett" star Fess Parker has
revised plans once again for an already-approved 150-room ocean view
hotel.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are minor. They include landscaping changes to the
interior courtyard and angling of the buildings to create a
continuous green space on both sides of Calle Cesar Chavez. Some of
the hotel rooms have been moved farther from the railroad tracks.</LD>
<LD>   Parker is asking the city to conclude that his revisions don't
have to undergo another round of full review. The hotel could open by

<HD>Hahn Raises $5.5 Million to Fight Secession</HD>
<DH>Valley and Hollywood cityhood groups have received about
$1.5 million combined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession drive reported
Thursday that it has raised $5.5 million, nearly four times the
combined amount collected by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
cityhood committees.</LD>
<LD>   The financial figures were released as leaders of the two sides in
the secession campaign clashed in a Valley debate that focused on
utility rates and public safety.</LD>
<LD>   In the last report of its kind before the Nov. 5 election, Hahn's
L.A. United committee said it raised $781,000 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19,
pushing the organization's total above its goal of $5 million.
Another $1 million has been raised by anti-secession committees
controlled by City Council members and City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the money has come from companies, individuals and labor
unions that have contracts with or other business before the city. It
has paid for an advertising blitz that the secessionists have been
unable to counter.</TE>
<TE>   Major new contributors to the Hahn campaign include Jerry
Perenchio, the head of Univision, who gave $318,000 in cash and
television air time, and Beverly Hills Construction Management, which
gave $175,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Service Employees International Union contributed $125,000,
Panda Restaurants gave $50,000, and Fleishman-Hillard, a public
relations firm with city contracts, donated $30,000. Verizon Services
Group and Police Commission President Rick Caruso gave $10,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Safety Coalition, an anti-secession group formed by
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, reported raising $614,496, of which
$19,000 came in the form of billboard space donated by Viacom
Outdoor.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Alex Padilla's anti-secession committee, One Family,
One L.A., reported taking in $162,000, including $43,404 in billboard
space provided by Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   An anti-secession committee formed by Delgadillo received
$247,000, including $10,000 from Majestic Realty Co., the firm
involved in building Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   On the pro-secession side, the Valley Independence Committee
reported raising a total of $609,364. Since Oct. 1, the committee
received $10,000 each from Lodwrick Cook, vice chairman of Pacific
Capital Group, and Clay Lacy, who runs an aviation firm at Van Nuys
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Giving $5,000 each were Valley VOTE leader Richard Close, Auto
Stiegler Inc., the Auto Gallery and property owner Guy McCreary.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley campaign ended the period with $100,000 in debts,
including $52,000 owed to a consulting firm that quit the secession
effort because its bills were not being paid.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Independence Committee reported raising $912,313,
including $806,000 from chairman Gene La Pietra. La Pietra, a
Hollywood nightclub owner, reported having $307,645 for his Hollywood
city council campaign, all but $250 from his own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   As the numbers rolled in, a debate at the Universal Sheraton
provided the day's fireworks. State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar),
a secession opponent, squared off with Valley Independence Committee
co-chairman Richard Katz, an old political rival.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, who defeated Katz by 29 votes in a bitter 1998 contest
for the Senate seat, said Los Angeles would find a legal way to
increase utility costs to the Valley and Hollywood if secession wins.
A state commission has ruled that Los Angeles, under a contract
arrangement, could not charge customers in the breakaway areas more
for water and power than it does its own residents.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe politicians will fight for their community first,"
Alarcon said, adding that Los Angeles would be obliged to give its
own residents a better deal on utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said the commission's requirement would hold, and that Valley
and Hollywood cities would work well with Los Angeles in negotiating
service contracts, including for police and fire protection.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Richard is wrong ... " Katz said. "I think that kind of
rhetoric and war-gaming is just the wrong approach."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the debate panel were Council President Alex Padilla and
Valley mayoral candidate Keith Richman, a Republican assemblyman from
Northridge. Richman, who accused Hahn's campaign of "fear-mongering,"
said a Valley city would get more police patrols and other service
improvements from L.A. under a contract than it gets now.</TE>
<TE>   But Alarcon said Los Angeles would increase the Valley's costs for
those services.</TE>
<TE>   After Katz said voters want smaller council districts, Padilla
noted that voters rejected an expansion of the Los Angeles City
Council during the 1999 charter reform process.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters then said, 'We don't necessarily want more
politicians. We want politicians who are doing their job.' It's the
quality of the representation that counts, not the quantity," Padilla
said.</TE>
<TE>   The forum drew about 50 people. It was organized by Town Hall Los
Angeles and the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola
Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Hahn took his campaign to Sherman Oaks, where he
joined affordable-housing advocates to warn that secession could harm
L.A.'s efforts to create a $100-million trust fund to tackle the
housing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The city has put $52 million into the fund so far, with the rest
pledged for next year. The money will help build 1,500 units of
affordable housing annually, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We made this commitment to the housing trust fund on the basis of
being a united city, including the Valley and Hollywood, and the
revenues that come from those areas," Hahn said. "If we don't have
those revenues, everything on the table at City Hall could be in
jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain later dismissed the mayor's
contentions.</TE>

<HD>District, Teachers Reach Accord</HD>
<DH>State-mediated negotiations in Capistrano Unified produce a
tentative agreement. Details will be released next week.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's third-largest school district reached a tentative
contract with its teachers Thursday after a marathon 19 hours of
state-mediated negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement appeared likely to end a rancorous, protracted labor
dispute that has had many of Capistrano Unified School District's
2,300 teachers picketing and distributing fliers at trustee meetings
and school events in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Details will be released Tuesday after the Capistrano Unified
Education Assn. informs its members about the new multiyear
contract's provisions.</LD>
<TE>   Union members and trustees for the south Orange County school
district must ratify the contract before it becomes final.</TE>
<TE>   Chief union negotiator Vicki Soderberg said the union's executive
board unanimously approved the agreement. If the union's
representative council approves it, the accord will go to members for
a ratification vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't agree to a tentative agreement unless it's a good one,"
Soderberg said.</TE>
<TE>   District spokesman David Smollar declined to discuss details of
the agreement but expressed relief that an accord had been reached.</TE>
<TE>   The state Public Employment Relations Board administered the two
days of fact-finding, during which district and union officials made
presentations to a neutral arbitrator acceptable to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The 46,760-student district had been the last in the county to
reach a contract agreement. Teachers, who have been in negotiations
with the district for more than a year, have been working without a
contract since July.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks earlier this month, some teachers withdrew voluntary
services such as serving on committees, decorating bulletin boards
after school and writing college recommendation letters at the
union's request.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to go to those kinds of extremes," Soderberg said. "But
we had been bargaining for more than a year ... so we didn't have a
choice. Classroom instruction was never compromised."</TE>
<TE>   The sticking points between district officials and the union have
been salary increases and their timing.</TE>
<TE>   The union had been seeking a 4.11% raise retroactive to last year
while the district offered a 2% raise for last year with another 2%
increase for the current year.</TE>

<HD>Initiative Foe Cited in Theft of Sign</HD>
<DH>The Ventura hillside resident contends the 'Yes on Measure
A' placard was illegally posted on public property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 46-year-old Ventura woman has been cited for allegedly stealing a
"Yes on Measure A" sign posted by supporters of the controversial
ballot measure, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Camille Donnelly, who opposes Measure A, was issued a
misdemeanor citation after she removed one of several campaign signs
-- placed by both camps -- from the shoulder of Foothill Road near
Skyline Drive about 4 p.m. Wednesday, Cpl. Mike Foster said.</LD>
<LD>   A witness, who was not identified, watched Donnelly put the sign
in her car and drive away, then reported the theft to police,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Foster contacted Donnelly at her home, where he recovered the sign
and issued the citation.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A is an initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot that would allow
1,350 homes to be built in six neighborhoods in the foothills and
canyons above Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, reached Thursday, said the sign she took down was
illegally posted on public property.</TE>
<TE>   She said that she is being accused because of public pressure to
punish someone -- because so many "Yes on Measure A" signs have been
stolen. About 1,200 signs were initially posted, according to measure
supporters, but they don't know exactly how many are missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been overwhelmed by the money spent [promoting the
measure], and we are all volunteers," Donnelly said. "I think the
people of Ventura see it as their civic duty to get out there and
take the signs down."</TE>
<TE>   But it's unfortunate that people feel as if they must steal signs
to fight the measure, Donnelly added.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has lived in the hillsides for 27 years, and worries
that Measure A, if passed, would destroy her quality of life. "I just
felt sick to my stomach, so I took the sign down," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Merryman, spokeswoman for the Measure A campaign, said
the incident helps explain why there are so few "Yes on Measure A"
signs posted around Ventura. "Obviously, they're being stolen," she
said. "It's a shame someone wants to take away our rights to free
speech."</TE>

<HD>Couple's Killer Left in Wife's Car, Police Say</HD>
<DH>The abandoned vehicle was discovered a few blocks away
after the Santa Paula pair were found bludgeoned in their bed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The person who bludgeoned to death a Santa Paula couple in their bed
this week left the crime scene in the wife's car and abandoned it a
few blocks away at a local shopping center, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said officers are scouring
Joann Wotkyn's 2001 black Chevy Monte Carlo for clues.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an important link to solving this, and I hope we get what we
need," Gonzales said.</LD>
<TE>   There was no obvious evidence found inside the car, with the
exception that the keys were left in the ignition, Gonzales said.
Officers plan to collect hair, fiber and fingerprint evidence from
the interior and search the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   The car is the best clue detectives have so far in solving the
slayings of Wotkyn, 55, and her husband, John M. Ramirez, 59.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Gonzales said investigators have concluded the killer knew
the victims, because the killer came inside the couple's home through
an unlocked back door, apparently stole nothing and killed them in a
manner that could indicate a personal vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were found slain late Monday in the upstairs master
bedroom of their upscale home on Corte La Brisa. Both had been beaten
and died from massive head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Wotkyn's car was found about 10 p.m. Monday in a nearby Kmart
parking lot, about an hour after police found the bodies. A relative
called police when the couple failed to show for work at the
Camarillo computer firm where they had both been employed for about
three decades.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 50 interviews, detectives have cleared the
couple's children of any suspicion, Gonzales said. Only two of the
five children, Ramirez's two sons, live in the area, and none has an
idea why their parents were killed. "They are at a loss," Gonzales
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators today and next week plan to interview several more
neighbors, friends and co-workers to try to establish a motive.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's marital life and finances also are being researched
for possible clues, Gonzales said. So far, a search of the couple's
house, backyard and a Chevy Suburban driven regularly by Ramirez has
not turned up a murder weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The chief is asking that anyone who may have seen someone driving
Wotkyn's two-door Monte Carlo between 10 p.m. Sunday and 10 p.m.
Monday call Santa Paula police. The car is black with black-and-white
checkers on the sides, and has a white Tasmanian devil decal on the
right rear trunk area.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Alleged Molestation</HD>

<LD>A carpeting business owner was arrested in Orange on Thursday for
allegedly molesting a 6-year-old girl, and police are trying to
determine if other children may have been assaulted, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Wayne Stepp, 56, was taken into custody about 7 a.m. at his
home in the 11400 block of Orange Park Boulevard, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "The girl complained to her mother, the mother came forward, we
investigated and today we arrested him," said Jim Amormino, a
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   "The girl was visiting him at his house. We don't know what their
relationship was," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on interviews with neighbors, investigators believe there
may be other young female victims, Amormino said. "We'll see if
anyone else comes forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, a woman at Stepp's home on Thursday expressed shock and
skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a friend of Gary's for more than 10 years," said the
woman, who declined to give her name but said she rents a room in his
house. "I've been so close to him lately, and we've had
heart-to-hearts. This is just too weird to consider. My gut instinct
says it couldn't be true."</TE>
<TE>   Because she is disabled and rarely leaves the house, it would be
almost impossible for Stepp to have had visitors without her knowing
about it, the woman said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "There have never been any little girls around here, unless he
snuck them in in a briefcase," she said. "Nothing goes on in this
house that I'm not privy to."</TE>
<TE>   Stepp was being held at Orange County Jail with bail set at
$50,000. He is scheduled for arraignment today at Central Court in
Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>MTA to Take Safety Campaign on the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After serving the entertainment capital of the world for so long, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority now wants to get into show
business, too.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA's board of directors agreed Thursday to buy a $400,000
portable multimedia theater, once used to showcase television's Power
Rangers, to hold free 3-D film screenings across Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than candy-colored teenage superheroes, the stars of
this road show will be the MTA's Blue and Gold line trains. Agency
staff members are planning to launch a new public education campaign
on light-rail safety.</LD>
<TE>   "Just sending out brochures and fliers isn't what makes an
impression on the community," said Lynda Bybee, deputy officer of
community relations for the transit agency, which hopes to begin the
3-D shows next year. "We want to get folks' attention."</TE>
<TE>   The glitz and cost of the theater, equipped to blast wind and emit
scents for dramatic effect, are raising some eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   It's a high-tech "Punch and Judy" puppet show, said transit
advocate John Walsh of Hollywood. "It's an absolute waste of money."</TE>
<TE>   But others believe it can be a smart investment in public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds so L.A. to have such a show-bizzy thing. It makes me
chuckle," said Roger Christensen, a board member of Train Riders
Assn. of California. "But if it takes bells and whistles and smoke
bombs to make kids aware of the dangers of rail tracks, it's all
worth it."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Line, identified a couple of years ago by the California
Public Utilities Commission as the deadliest rail line in the state,
has had more than 620 accidents and 60 fatalities since it opened in
1990, according to the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Though some deaths are believed to be suicides, most of the
accidents involve vehicles crossing the street-level tracks. There
has been one fatality this year on the Blue Line.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials believe that's due to their stepped up public safety
campaign. The Gold Line, which is scheduled to open next summer, will
also intersect streets, prompting concerns that its trains could pose
hazards to pedestrians and cars.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staff members believe the 16-seat theater, which is inside a
double-wide trailer, will take the agency's rail safety message to
the next level by hooking audiences with hold-on-to-your-seat special
effects.</TE>
<TE>   They envision an extravaganza similar to Disneyland's now-defunct
Captain EO ride, in which viewers wearing 3-D glasses, buckled into
computerized armchairs, will move up and down and side to side in
synchronous motion with images projected on a giant screen. But
instead of bopping with Michael Jackson through outer space, the MTA
audience will feel the bumps of a train ride.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed story line for the yet-to-be-written script: the
suspense of a train coming to an emergency stop when a pedestrian or
car suddenly crosses the tracks. There's no word yet on what
train-related odor the MTA plans to reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staff members believe the shows will attract children and
young adults who might tune out conventional safety programs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at what we need to compete against nowadays to get
the attention of a young person, we're competing with Play-Station 2,
with Xbox," said Yoon Ham, a senior community relations officer for
the MTA. "[The theater] will be an effective tool to get the message
across to young people that if you treat a train or rail crossing
with disrespect, there's a chance you'll be killed."</TE>
<TE>   Once staff members obtain board approval, they plan to develop a
storyboard with scenes, Ham said.</TE>
<TE>   The virtual reality den, custom-built 18 months ago by
Chatsworth-based Provision Interactive Technologies, toured the
country last year to promote the Power Rangers series and action
figures. The MTA already has funds from a safety grant to buy the
multimedia theater.</TE>
<TE>   "MTA's taken a lot of hits in the past for not being responsive to
the community," said Kymberleigh Richards, spokeswoman for Southern
California Transit Advocates. "This could be good for their image."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors have unanimously agreed to lower -- to 20%
-- the percentage of in-home care providers who must agree to be
represented by a labor group before a union can begin collective
bargaining.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Hammitt, leader of Service Employees International Union
Local 998, had argued the county's earlier requirement of 30% was too
high because home workers are hard to reach.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Stenslie, a Human Services Agency director, recommended that
supervisors agree to the change so the union can begin negotiating
wages and benefits for the estimated 1,600 workers affected
countywide.</LD>
<TE>   "Our purpose is to get us to collective bargaining, not to set up
any barriers," he said.</TE>

<HD>Political Rookies Point to Crime, Jobs as Priorities</HD>
<DH>The candidates for 6th district in a new Valley city lack
experience but they share resolve in wanting to improve quality of
life in the area.</DH>

<LD>The half a dozen candidates for the 6th district seat of the proposed
San Fernando Valley city council are making their first run for
public office. The problems they want to solve -- gangs, graffiti,
broken roads and a weak job market -- are more than enough to test a
political rookie.</LD>
<LD>   The district includes Panorama City and part of Arleta. The
candidates have different ideas for reducing crime and increasing
investment in the area, but all agree that creating a Valley city
must be the first step. The winner of the race will take office only
if voters approve Valley secession on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "What I want to do is run an efficient city. It's in my heart. I
really want to do it," said Christopher C. Trujillo of Panorama City,
whose next-door neighbor is also vying to represent the mostly Latino
district.</LD>
<TE>   Trujillo, who ran a 500-employee manufacturing company for 28
years, said his administrative experience is exactly what the
district needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how to make the bottom line, to be efficient with money,"
said Trujillo, 59, who now is a drug counselor with Family Harmony in
Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   He said a Valley city should work with businesses to bring more
manufacturing jobs to the area. Trujillo also wants to lower utility
costs for consumers and provide low-interest loans to help homeowners
buy natural gas generators to conserve electricity.</TE>
<TE>   His neighbor, James Stewart, advocates a broad program of low- or
no-interest loans to residents and small business owners to clean up
neighborhoods and restore buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, a board member of the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley, also said he would allow fewer exemptions to the
General Plan, the area's current blueprint for development.</TE>
<TE>   He said land-use planning should begin with a determination of
neighborhood needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Figure out what [type of business] is needed, approve it and go
out and get a developer," said Stewart, 51, a self-employed
management consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin Silon, a longtime Arleta resident and retired print shop
owner, said he would cut business taxes to attract companies to the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Silon, 72, one of the original members of the secession group
Valley VOTE, said the district also needs more senior citizen centers
and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, it shouldn't have taken 3 1/2 years to get a street
light installed in his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The city is now "fixing up the streets and the potholes, but one
way or another it will stop after the election," said Silon.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Noel S.V. Omega of Panorama City said he would make
children a priority and push for safer parks and a public swimming
pool open year-round. He also called for more community policing and
improved trash collection.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I have the people skills and the background to deal with
complex issues and get people together," said Omega, 42, a
self-employed computer system consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Arleta native Robert J. Edwards said the district's "people,
places and problems have become nothing more than a file number"
under the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I will work on streamlining and reconstituting the bureaucracy,"
said Edwards, 48, an independent environmental consultant. From 1995
to 1999, he led LEARN, a group focused on bringing reforms to the Los
Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said Los Angeles has ignored the Valley's need for
economic growth. He also said a Valley city should clean up the East
Valley aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Edwards wants to overhaul the neighborhood council
program to eliminate seats for businesses and other special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Alvord, 41, is also running for the district seat. The
self-employed plumbing engineer said he would add police officers,
increase penalties for graffiti vandals and speed up street and
sidewalk repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to improve our way of life," said Alvord of Panorama City.
"I want local government that is closer to the people."</TE>

<HD>Water Rates Key in Westminster</HD>
<DH>For voters, the restructuring of charges and a proposed
$15-million cultural center are hot topics, in addition to mayoral
and City Council races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian Le Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed and Janet Pace don't own a swimming pool, and they were careful to
conserve water by installing water-efficient toilets in their
Westminster home.</LD>
<LD>   So when their latest water bill arrived, the Westminster couple
couldn't understand why their bill was $106--nearly double what they
typically pay.</LD>
<LD>   "I was surprised, and I'm upset by it," said Ed Pace, 73, who has
never paid such a high water bill in his 46 years in Westminster.
"We're conscious of how much water we use, and we try not to be
wasteful. But the city's really sticking it to homeowners."</LD>
<TE>   Rising water rates have emerged as one of the top issues in
Westminster, along with plans for a $15-million cultural center.</TE>
<TE>   Six candidates will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot: two are vying for
the mayor's seat, and four others are seeking two City Council seats.</TE>
<TE>   The city this year changed the way it calculates water rates in an
effort to encourage conservation. Some residents found that their
rates almost doubled.</TE>
<TE>   Some candidates back the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The restructured water rates is something that had to be done to
get people to think about conservation with California at the threat
of a drought," said Councilman Russell Paris, who is running for his
first full council term.</TE>
<TE>   But another candidate, Navy veteran Bob Crossley, said the rates
are unfair and should be changed.</TE>
<TE>   Crossley also questions the wisdom of the cultural center project
during a poor economy. The project, to begin 2003, includes a
425-seat live theater and a 500-seat banquet hall.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents agree.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the economy is right now, this cultural center is not a
good way to spend taxpayers' money," said Jim Evans, 79. "It annoys
me that they're taking our money for this center when they can use it
for other necessities. We need to vote on this to be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, believe the center would provide important
services for the public.</TE>

<HD>Courage of 3 Female Reporters Honored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John L. Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an international journalism organization gathered in Beverly Hills
on Thursday night to honor three female reporters for risking their
lives covering world events, one of the honorees was instead
returning to Russia, at the specific request of Chechen rebels
holding hundreds of hostages.</LD>
<LD>   Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist with the Russian newspaper Novaya
Gazeta, was scheduled to receive a Courage in Journalism Award from
the International Women in Media Foundation. Instead, she left for
home at the behest of the terrorists who stormed a Moscow theater
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "They have confidence in her, and I hope that she will be let in,"
Maria Shkolnikova, a hostage, told the Russian Interfax news agency
by mobile telephone.</LD>
<TE>   The other journalists who received the awards Thursday at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire are Canadian Kathy Gannon, the Associated
Press bureau chief in Pakistan and Afghanistan, who covered the
Taliban's reaction to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and Sandra
Nyaira of the Daily News in Harare, Zimbabwe, who won for coverage of
government corruption there. Nyaira was forced to find refuge in a
safe house after her newspaper's offices were bombed three times.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving out these awards so we can recognize the women on
the front lines fighting for press freedom," said Sherry Rockey,
executive director of the 12-year-old foundation. Hopefully, she
said, the awards also offer a "mantle of protection" by signifying to
the journalists' communities that the world is watching.</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya was honored for balanced reporting that has prompted
threats from both the Russian government and the Chechen rebels.</TE>
<TE>   She has been arrested in Chechnya by Russian security forces and
accused of entering Chechnya without proper credentials and of not
registering with the military.</TE>
<TE>   She has had to travel with bodyguards and was forced for a time
into exile.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement to the foundation, Politkovskaya said, "It
is a great honor for me to receive the Courage in Journalism Award.
However, and I think you will agree with me, it is an even greater
honor for me to respond when destiny offers the opportunity to help
people when a crisis strikes."</TE>
<TE>   Her response, Los Angeles Times publisher John P. Puerner told the
awards gathering, demonstrates "the true measure of her courage." The
rebels, he said, "know her and they trust her, because she is one
Russian journalist who is not afraid to tell both sides of the story
in the Chechnyan war. With the lives of so many at risk, Anna didn't
hesitate. She had to go."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also paid special tribute to the nine journalists
killed this year in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Judea and Ruth Pearl, parents of slain Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl, joined in that tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory received the foundation's
Lifetime Achievement Award.</TE>

<HD>Audit Finds Ineptitude in Use of City Bond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pattern of ineptitude -- delays, disputes, cost overruns and lax
management -- is dogging the use by the L.A. Zoo and the Recreation
and Parks Department of a $750-million bond passed by voters in 1996,
according to an audit released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The audit was done for City Controller Laura Chick at the
direction of Kurt Sjoberg, the former state auditor general.</LD>
<LD>   The bond issue envisioned 30 years of work; many of the hundreds
of projects have not begun.</LD>
<TE>   The audit found that, by May, of $106 million in projects set for
the first five years, only $34 million worth had been completed and
$90 million worth should have been. Project delays ranged from one to
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Cost estimates for a great deal of work have been too low, the
audit said, requiring use of other city funds, or, in the zoo's case,
donations to finish the jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen Recreation and Parks projects are on hold. In some
cases, the initial contractors have failed to perform their work or
have been terminated.</TE>
<TE>   As the audit was being prepared, responsibility for many of the
construction projects called for in the bond issue was transferred
from the two departments to the city's Bureau of Engineering, where
Chick said she hopes for better management.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Mayor James K. Hahn, Chick wrote, "The city must
have skilled, qualified, top-notch management experts in place on all
construction projects." She contended that the city is overexposed to
"construction delays, cost overruns, shoddy work and lawsuits."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel A. Mollinedo, who recently went from directing operations
at the zoo to becoming general manager of Recreation and Parks, on
Thursday called the audit an accurate report of past shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo said he hopes that in the future, his department will be
"more realistic, and not make commitments unless we are sure we can
be on budget and on time" with projects.</TE>

<HD>After Paying Dues, She'll Get Her Due</HD>
<DH>Trainer Laura de Seroux, a former 'Charlie's Angel' protege
of Whittingham, will have horses in three Breeders' Cup races
Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The first racetrack job Laura de Seroux had was at a track in East
St. Louis, Ill., that's not there anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Cahokia Downs, about 300 miles south of here, might not have been
the ideal career launch for a college English major who was driving
cross-country from California in her Volkswagen. For at Cahokia, you
could leave after the night's last race and find your whole car, not
just the hubcaps, missing. That's what's known as a bad night at the
races.</LD>
<LD>   Cahokia is also where a couple of bartenders, heading home, got
into their car and were blown into eternity.</LD>
<TE>   "Please be careful driving home, and please be careful starting
your cars," track announcer Tod Creed intoned as the crowd moved
toward the exits a night later.</TE>
<TE>   But heck, about 25 years ago, De Seroux was only halfway to
Belmont Park and there wasn't much money left in her kick. At Cahokia
Downs, they were paying $2 a head and she was able to exercise 16
horses a day. A veritable windfall.</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux eventually landed in the big leagues at Keeneland, where
she worked for the veteran trainer Del Carroll, who, like the
California nonpareil Charlie Whittingham, preferred the reliability
of female help around the barn. "From Cahokia Downs to Keeneland," De
Seroux said. "Quite a contrast."</TE>
<TE>   After some time with Carroll, a homesick De Seroux heard
California's clarion call. She phoned Whittingham, whom she had never
met, and asked for a job. The Hall of Fame conditioner told her to
come out to Santa Anita for a tryout.</TE>
<TE>   The way De Seroux remembers it, Whittingham said hello and asked
her to mount the toughest horse in the stable.</TE>
<TE>   "I galloped him straight, kept his head down and got him back to
the paddock, where Charlie was waiting," De Seroux said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Whittingham said. "You're in."</TE>
<TE>   On a rainy, bone-chilling morning at Arlington Park in suburban
Chicago, De Seroux recalled that story and many others from her
formative years. The 19th Breeders' Cup--eight races worth $13
million--will be run Saturday. De Seroux, a newcomer to this scene,
will take a shot at three races--the $1-million Distaff with Azeri,
the $1-million Filly &amp; Mare Turf with Dublino and the $2-million Turf
with Ballingarry, a sturdy Irish colt that her husband, international
bloodstock agent Emmanuel de Seroux, bought for Chicagoan Sidney Port
and others less than a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux's late mentor, Whittingham, would say, "I didn't bring
them here to be watchdogs," and with just as much confidence but not
as much bravado, the little girl who grew up in Alhambra feels that
she has license to have a big day. Her best chance, the oddsmakers
would say, is Azeri, virtually an unerring filly who is the 6-5
favorite in her heat.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been in a Breeders' Cup, but I know how they work," De
Seroux said. "I can remember when [trainer] Bob Baffert went to
Florida, supposedly loaded with several horses, a few years ago. He
didn't win a race."</TE>
<TE>   Another California trainer, Jenine Sahadi, is the only woman who's
saddled a Breeders' Cup winner. Sahadi won the Sprint twice, with Lit
De Justice in 1996 and Elmhurst in 1997. Only eight female
conditioners have run horses, a total of 22 in all.</TE>
<TE>   To De Seroux, this is no more than minutiae.</TE>
<TE>   "Gender is not an issue," she said Thursday. "There's a big pie
out here, and I'm happy that some of us are able to get our slice."</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux got her trainer's license only three years ago, because
after working six years with Whittingham -- the workout brigade got
to be known as "Charlie's Angels" -- she moved on to other facets of
the business. She had a major hand in upgrading Bruce McNall's racing
interests, and syndicating Nelson Bunker Hunt's yearling crops.
Posthaste, De Seroux was orchestrating the futures of more than 300
horses.</TE>
<TE>   One day, when she still was Laura Lubisich, McNall handed her the
business card of one Emmanuel de Seroux, whose Narvick International
bloodstock service was humming on both sides of the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   "Give him a call, he's a nice guy," McNall said. "But I don't
think you'll ever speak French, and I don't think you'd ever marry
him."</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, at De Seroux's 50th birthday party, the guest of
honor began her remarks in fluent French. McNall, free from federal
prison, where he served four years after pleading guilty to bank and
wire fraud, roared. With Laura de Seroux, he had been wrong on both
counts. The Charlie's Angels grad and the French bloodstock agent
have been married since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Emmanuel de Seroux is the No. 1 advisor for Michael Paulson, the
son of the late Allen Paulson, who bred and raced Cigar, a two-time
horse of the year. Allen Paulson bred Azeri, who runs in the name of
his living trust.</TE>
<TE>   Doing some early campaigning, Laura de Seroux tossed Azeri's hat
into the 2002 horse-of-the-year ring. The 4-year-old filly has been
beaten once in eight tries this year, and has earned $1.1 million.
She would need to hit a Breeders' Cup home run, in only her second
start outside California, to even have an outside chance in the
year-end voting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think horse of the year implies who's the best all year, and
not a horse who's best in just one race," De Seroux said. "What this
filly has done, in my mind, is the best performance by any horse over
the course of the year. She could have won the only race she lost, if
a couple of things had gone differently, and many of her wins were
the opposite of hair-pulling performances. She's shown a dominance
over her rivals, and I think she should strongly be considered."</TE>
<TE>   In a lengthy interview, trainer of the year didn't come up. A
woman has never won, never come close. It might be a subject for
another day. Sunday, perhaps, if De Seroux bats 1.000 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The rain that was supposed to end Wednesday night was still around
Thursday, with a 60% chance of more showers today and 30% Saturday.
The temperature hasn't reached 50 degrees since last weekend, and the
high Saturday will be in the low 50s. The soggy grass course will
agree with most of the Europeans, and a muddy main track will send
all handicappers back to Square 1.</TE>

<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Here's a quick, race-by-race look at Saturday's eight Breeders' Cup
races -- $13 million worth -- at Arlington Park (in the order they'll
be run):</LD>
<LD>   $2 million</LD>
<LD>   8 horses, 1 1/8 miles on dirt</LD>
<TE>*--*
DISTAFF</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Allen Paulson, who died in 2000, bred and raced Ajina and Escena,
who won this race in 1997 and 1998. Paulson, now represented by his
son Michael and a family trust, also bred Azeri, the 6-5 morning-line
favorite based on seven wins in eight starts this year. Summer
Colony, who beat Azeri by a length in the La Canada at Santa Anita in
February, is also running, at 5-1. Since the La Canada, Summer Colony
has run at six tracks, winning three times with two seconds and a
third, which came in her last race, the Beldame on Oct. 5. Imperial
Gesture beat her that day and seems well-suited for Saturday's
distance. Since running sixth in last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies, Take Charge Lady has won five of seven starts, the most
recent victory coming in the Spinster at Keeneland, where nine of the
previous 18 Distaff winners have prepped. A forgotten horse is Farda
Amiga, who has done nothing wrong away from Santa Anita, winning the
Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs and the Alabama at Saratoga. Trainer
Paulo Lobo's filly was 20-1 in the Oaks and will be double digits at
post time Saturday. This will be Farda Amiga's first start in more
than two months.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JUVENILE FILLIES</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $1 million</TE>
<TE>   10 horses, 1 1/8 miles on dirt</TE>
<TE>   The Breeders' Cup's 2-year-old races, usually 1 1/16 miles, are
longer this year because the shorter distance at Arlington, a 1
1/8-mile dirt oval, would have forced the fields into too quick a run
into the first turn. Ivanavinalot, who had won five of six
exclusively at Calder, was scratched Thursday morning because of a
high temperature. None of the remaining contenders has run as far as
1 1/8 miles, so handicappers will be especially mindful of stamina,
but Storm Flag Flying looks unbeatable at any distance. She's won all
three of her starts, in New York, and is a pedigree pick as well: Her
dam, My Flag, won the same stake in the mud at Belmont Park in 1995.
There's another posthumous breeding angle here: Storm Flag Flying
comes from the Phipps Farm, whose owner Ogden Phipps was 93 when he
died in April, and the filly is now campaigned by Dinny Phipps, the
breeder's son. A win for Storm Flag Flying would be No. 8 in the
Breeders' Cup for trainer Shug McGaughey, which would leave him with
half as many as Wayne Lukas (providing Lukas doesn't win Saturday's
Sprint). After even-money Storm Flag Flying, the early odds go to the
4-1 Santa Catarina, who was second, beaten by two lengths, when
McGaughey's filly won the Frizette on Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>*--*
MILE</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $1 million</TE>
<TE>   14 horses, on turf</TE>
<TE>   More than any other Breeders' Cup race, post positions are a
factor. Half of the 18 winners broke from the four inside stalls.
Forbidden Apple, Beat Hollow, Medecis and Good Journey will occupy
those spots, with Beat Hollow, at a generous 6-1, given the best
chance to beat Rock Of Gibraltar, who, like the insurance company's
hoary symbol, is a solid presence. The Irish-based Rock Of Gibraltar,
who drew No. 10, has won 10 of 12 starts and is on a seven-race run
in Group I stakes. Over there, they've already ascribed the
3-year-old colt to Europe's pantheon. Beat Hollow, one of seven
Breeders' Cup entrants for trainer Bobby Frankel, was beaten by
Landseer, like Rock Of Gibraltar an Aidan O'Brien trainee, but
Landseer drew the 13 hole, near the dreaded outside.</TE>
<TE>*--*
SPRINT</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $1 million</TE>
<TE>   13 horses, 6 furlongs on dirt</TE>
<TE>   This is no typo: Wayne Lukas, who has started 136 Breeders' Cup
horses, three times more than the next guy, and has won 16 of the
races, more than any two other trainers, is represented only in this
race this time. Lukas has two runners, the 5-2 favorite Orientate and
the longshot Day Trader. Orientate is cut from the same cloth as
Gulch, Lukas' Sprint winner in 1989. In one of his best training
jobs, Lukas made a sprinter out of Gulch, who had routed for his
previous trainer, LeRoy Jolley. Orientate won the Indiana Derby, at 1
1/16 miles, late last year, and although he beat only one horse three
weeks later in the Breeders' Cup Classic, it took a while before he
was shortened up. On dirt going short since June, he has reeled off
four impressive wins, the last two with jockey Jerry Bailey, who has
12 Breeders' Cup wins, the same as Pat Day. Two of Orientate's
rivals, the brilliant filly Xtra Heat and the longshot
Disturbingthepeace, are to be sold at auction in Kentucky on Nov. 3.
Xtra Heat's owners, who buy horses to run, not breed, paid only
$5,000 for the filly, who has won 24 of 31 races and earned $2.2
million. Xtra Heat, second to Squirtle Squirt in last year's Sprint,
will be consigned with a reported reserve -- minimum bid -- of $2.4
million. Disturbingthepeace, winner of both of Del Mar's sprint
stakes, which extended his streak to six wins, will be part of owner
David Milch's dispersal. Since winning the 2000 Sprint in a record
1:07 3/5 at Churchill Downs, Kona Gold has four wins in eight starts.
But he has won only one of his last five and, as an 8-year-old, will
be hard-pressed to become the sixth horse with multiple Breeders' Cup
wins.</TE>
<TE>*--*
FILLY &amp; MARE TURF</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $1 million</TE>
<TE>   12 horses, 1 1/4 miles on turf</TE>
<TE>   The only race to be added to the Breeders' Cup menu since the
inaugural in 1984, this stake has a formful limited history.
Short-priced horses have done well. Banks Hill, last year's winner,
is not favored this time, however, having been beaten by Golden
Apples and Voodoo Dancer in the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita three
weeks ago. Golden Apples, who won the Beverly D. at Arlington on Aug.
17, is the 5-2 favorite on the morning line. Voodoo Dancer was
scratched. Banks Hill, ridden by Corey Nakatani in California, gets
the estimable Bailey for the first time Saturday. With Soaring Softly
and Perfect Sting, Bailey won the first two runnings of this stake.
Kazzia, the German-bred filly who races for Sheik Mohammed of Dubai,
won the Flower Bowl at Belmont Park in her U.S. debut, and while a
short price her training has been compromised by a foot abscess.
Michael Stoute, who has come from England to twice saddle the winners
of the Breeders' Cup Turf, is running Islington here. The Irish-bred
filly, whose record is perfect in two starts at this distance, was a
close-up fifth against males in the Arc de Triomphe this month.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JUVENILE</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $1 million</TE>
<TE>   14 horses, 1 1/8 miles on dirt</TE>
<TE>   Sky Mesa, the 3-1 favorite, will be challenged by trainer Bob
Baffert's trio -- Vindication, Kafwain, Bull Market -- and Toccet,
winner of the Champagne, and Whywhywhy, first in the Belmont
Futurity. Aidan O'Brien, winner of last year's Juvenile with
Johannesburg, who successfully made the switch from grass to dirt, is
back Saturday in numbers, with Hold That Tiger, Tomahawk and Van
Nistelrooy. The latter is named after one of Manchester United's best
Premier League soccer players, who's injured and might not play in
England Saturday.</TE>
<TE>*--*
TURF</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $2 million</TE>
<TE>   8 horses, 1 1/2 miles on grass</TE>
<TE>   The scratch of Blazing Fury (tendon injury) has reduced the Turf
to its smallest field. High Chaparral comes by his 8-5 favoritism
quite legitimately. He was third in the 'Arc de Triomphe, beaten by 1
1/4 lengths, and O'Brien confessed that he didn't have his colt sharp
enough for 1 1/2 miles that day. Before the 'Arc, High Chaparral won
the English and Irish Derbies, part of a six-race winning streak.
Trainer Jonathan Sheppard is in here with his gray 7-year-old
gelding, With Anticipation, who has assembled a consistent record
since running seventh in last year's Turf, but Sheppard feels he
might be running for runner-up money. "The last two years," he said,
"I think the European horses have been a cut above the ones the U.S.
has been running." Golan, the Michael Stoute-trained colt who has
been running this marathon distance since his third career start, has
won only one of his most recent four tries, but the victory deserved
bold letters, under 133 pounds at Ascot. His 126-pound impost
Saturday will feel like balsa. Ballingarry, under new ownership and
saddled by Laura de Seroux for the first time, won the Canadian
International in his finale for trainer Aidan O'Brien. There will be
soft ground Saturday, the kind of course that agreed with Denon in
the Turf Classic at Belmont.</TE>
<TE>*--*
CLASSIC</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   $4 million</TE>
<TE>   12 horses, 1 1/4 miles on dirt</TE>
<TE>   You ask handicappers to assess the richest race in the U.S. and
many begin inversely, by throwing out horses: War Emblem's best races
are behind him; Medaglia d'Oro, Came Home and War Emblem are what's
left of a modest 3-year-old crop; Hawk Wing won't transfer his grass
form to dirt; Evening Attire's recent wins are an illusion. Well,
some horse has to win. While advertised as the career climax for War
Emblem, the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner, there are whispers that
the colt might run in the Japan Cup before he's shuffled off to stud.
Makes sense. After all, it was the Japanese who paid $17 million for
him as a stallion prospect. No questions asked, this is really
supposed to be the windup for Came Home, who'll win horse-of-the-year
honors with a victory. He has been beaten only twice, but the losses
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and this year's Derby are the crosses
he has had to bear. Harlan's Holiday, winner of the Blue Grass and
Florida Derby, got a trainer change after a dull Preakness, and his
last race, which produced a third in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, gave
die-hard supporters renewed hope. No Breeders' Cup race has been
dominated by such a small group of jockeys. All but one of the last
nine have been won by Bailey, Day and Chris McCarron. Leaving Came
Home for Mike Smith, McCarron retired in June. Bailey's mount is
Medaglia d'Oro and Day rides Dollar Bill, who's listed at 30-1. It's
up to Bailey to preserve the trend.</TE>

<LD>Vin Baker has played only a handful of exhibition games as a Boston
Celtic, but Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe already has shredded
the welcome mat.</LD>
<LD>   "The early line on Baker is not good, and the excuses have been
flying," Shaughnessy wrote. "He's learning the system. They aren't
calling any plays for him. Not enough touches. He hurt his ankle and
his pinkie. These are only exhibition games. He's allergic to Red's
cigar. Thomas Hamilton ate his homework.</LD>
<LD>   "How else to explain the sorry stat line that shows Baker
averaging 4.7 points and 4.2 rebounds in 19.7 minutes per game?</LD>
<TE>   "He also has been fouling at a [Greg] Kite-like rate -- a whopping
30 personals in six games. He has more fouls than points (30-28).</TE>
<TE>   "None of this will even be remembered if Baker returns to his old
form. But here in New England we are cynical and we worry."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which UCLA quarterback holds the school single-game
rushing record?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boo! Dave Newhouse of the Oakland Tribune said the most
frightening man in Oakland last week was 59-year-old San Diego
Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who is 20-5 against the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't admit it, but no horror movie scares the Raiders half
as much as Schottenheimer. So frightening a presence, he even has Al
Davis hiding under the covers.</TE>
<TE>   "Marty the Monster is the Raiders' worst nightmare. No matter
where he's coaching, Schottenheimer can beat the Raiders merely by
walking into the stadium. He proved it again Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill of Rights: Fans deserve certain rights when they attend a
game, says Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly:</TE>
<TE>   "A good seat being necessary to the pursuit of happiness, any fan
[should be able to] move down to a better one after halftime,
including courtside, and not get the hook from a 17-year-old,
$5.15-an-hour-making, Clearasil-jonesing usher who thinks a spiffy
jacket suddenly makes him a member of the Marines Security Guard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thrash talk: Al Morganti of ESPN.com said the Atlanta Thrashers
are hockey's most embarrassing franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from the financial chaos in places such as Buffalo, the
biggest on-ice mess in the NHL right now appears to be Atlanta, where
the Thrashers are beginning a prove-it-to-us fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, the Thrashers aren't proving anything to the fans of
Atlanta who expected far better. Last Saturday night, with the Braves
again banished from the baseball postseason, the Thrashers drew only
13,653 for a home game. It is time for a be-on-alert notice to Coach
Curt Fraser."*</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: John Sciarra had 178 yards rushing for UCLA in a
17-17 tie against Tennessee in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Stanford has had an awful football season, going 2-4,
surrendering 65 points in a loss to Arizona State and prompting Bud

<HD>Gerber Saves Ducks Again</HD>
<DH>Backup goalie stops 29 shots in 2-2 tie with Vancouver.
Oates suffers broken hand on slash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Goalie Martin Gerber is only here to be a caddy. Mighty Duck Coach
Mike Babcock has made that perfectly clear on many occasions.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere is the Ducks' No. 1 goalie.</LD>
<LD>   "Martin is here to be Jiggy's helper," Babcock said last week.</LD>
<TE>   Babcock reiterated that Thursday morning, saying, "Giguere is our
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, this Gerber keeps saving the Ducks. He did so again
Thursday in a 2-2 tie with Vancouver in front of 18,422 at the
General Motors Place.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber, a 28-year old rookie, stopped 29 of 31 shots, including a
blast by Sami Salo with the Canucks on a power play in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   His performance and Paul Kariya's short-handed goal allowed the
Ducks to take away a point in a game they easily could have lost.
What it didn't do was take the sting away from losing center Adam
Oates.</TE>
<TE>   Oates, the Ducks' marquee free-agent signee this summer, suffered
a broken left hand in two places when he was slashed in the second
period. Oates will return to Southern California today to be
re-examined.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't feel any pain," Oates said. "But when I got to
the bench, I took my glove off and my finger was really twisted."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will not make a move until after Saturday's game at
Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   This was far from the way Babcock wanted to begin a five-game road
trip. The Ducks will also play 10 of their next 13 games away from
home. Babcock isn't happy about it, but he put a positive spin on it.</TE>
<TE>   "When your team is trying to find itself, it's way easier to find
that on the road," Babcock said. "The next nine days is a great
chance for us to get to know each other."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that bonding thing is a little easier when your goalie
stands on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber, who played for Switzerland in the 2002 Olympics, started
his first NHL game on Sunday and was sharp in a 3-2 overtime victory
over Colorado. The Ducks provided him plenty of support that night.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot of experience," defenseman Fredrik Olausson said.
"He has played in he Olympics and the world championships. But that's
not the same as the NHL. He's just doing a fine job out there."</TE>
<TE>   The only two goals he gave up followed turnovers, one scored by
Brendan Morrison in the first period and the other by Todd Warriner
in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "You got to give him credit," Babcock said. "He did a real good
job tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Good enough to start again Saturday?</TE>
<TE>   "I have to think on that," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   With Gerber as their backbone, the Ducks did not give up a
power-play goal, despite nine penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were killing a penalty, trailing, 2-1, when Steve
Rucchin brought the puck into the Canuck zone. He slid a pass to
Kariya, who somehow managed to get off a back-hander with a defender
draped on his back. The shot zipped past goalie Dan Cloutier's
shoulder, tying the score, 2-2, at 8 minutes 28 seconds of the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been working a lot on backhands," Kariya said. "I got a
little luck there. I guess practice makes perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 1-0, Andy McDonald got the Ducks even in the second
period, as he managed to sweep the puck into the net while diving
five minutes into the period.</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks claimed Mike Brown on waivers from the Vancouver
Canucks on Oct. 11, hoping that the left winger could fulfill the
potential that made him a No. 1 draft pick in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Brown has played in only 16 NHL games the last two seasons. At 6
feet 4, 225 pounds, he has the potential to be an enforcer.</LD>
<LD>   "He is going to get introduced to [strength coach] Sean Skahan,
[and] when Sean tells me he is close, we're going to give him an
opportunity," Coach Mike Babcock said. "He's a big tough kid, a big
talent, who hasn't taken advantage of the opportunity through his
conditioning and his commitment to it."</LD>
<TE>   Brown practiced with the Ducks for the first time Thursday. He was
delayed in Vancouver, waiting for his visa to be arranged.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya and Vancouver's Ed Jovanovski were awarded their rings
Wednesday night for being part of Canada's gold-medal team in the
2002 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "This brings back a lot of terrific memories," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Pavel Trnka tested his injured groin during the Ducks'
morning skate but was not sure when he would be ready to play. He has
been on injured reserve since the season began.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt a lot better today," Trnka said. "This has been
frustrating. But I pushed it too hard last week."</TE>

<LD>Trevor Ariza, a 6-foot-8 All-City forward at Westchester High, has
committed to UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   He averaged 12 points and 12 rebounds a game last season for the
Comets, who won the City Section and state Division I basketball
titles. Ariza, who has not achieved a qualifying test score, is the
first Bruin commitment for the 2003-04 season. He chose UCLA over
Washington and Indiana.</LD>

<TE>   Former NBA player Mack Calvin has resigned after one season as
boys' basketball coach at Compton Dominguez, said Christine Sanchez,
director of communications for the Compton Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin, 54, guided the Dons last season to a 15-12 record and the
second round of the Southern Section Division III-AA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The former USC guard, who played four of his 11 pro seasons in the
NBA, did not return repeated phone messages seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury recently awarded Calvin $210,000
after ruling he was the victim of discrimination based on race while
coaching Cal State Dominguez Hills' men's basketball team during the
1996-97 season. Calvin, who is African American, had his one-year
renewable contract terminated after one season. Cal State Dominguez
Hills is appealing the decision.</TE>

<TE>   Undefeated Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge took eight seconds
off the Irvine Regional Park course record in winning the boys'
sweepstakes race of the Orange County cross-country championships
last Saturday, but he is not expected to run in the sweepstakes race
at the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on Saturday. Haddan, a
junior, will run in the Division II race as he did last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that he does not race hard too often during
the regular season and thus hopefully be more effective at the end of
the season for the [Southern Section] and state championships,"
Woodbridge Coach George Varvas wrote in an e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Orange County girls' champion Anaheim Esperanza is the
defending team sweepstakes champion at Mt. SAC, but none of the
Aztecs' top runners will compete Saturday because Coach Rich Medellin
also feels it would be one too many hard races this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach forfeited its nonleague football victory over
Fountain Valley Los Amigos for using a 14-year-old player without
filing the proper documentation, the Southern Section reported.
Huntington Beach's record falls to 3-3 and Los Amigos' improves to
5-1.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>To King Coach Andy Murray, the NHL season is like a feast, available
to be savored however one chooses.</LD>
<LD>   So Murray, ever the optimist, sees only the good in the Kings
playing 13 of 15 games away from home over the next month, among them
tonight's game against the New York Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   "The more we play on the road now, the less we play later," Murray
said. "I'm like that when I eat. I always eat the stuff I don't like
on my plate first, and then I know I've got the good stuff to look
forward to."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze, whose failure to score a goal in his last 27 games
with the Kings last season led to last month's demotion to the
minors, netted his first in five games with the Kings' American
Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H., on Wednesday night -- but
just barely.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran winger, guaranteed $2 million this season, scored with
one second to play in the Monarchs' 6-1 victory over the Springfield
Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Chris McAlpine, signed by the Kings as an unrestricted
free agent last summer but a scratch in all six games so far, was
reassigned to Manchester on a conditioning assignment.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to play games tonight and Saturday with the
Monarchs before rejoining the Kings on Sunday in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Kings 3-1-2, Rangers 2-4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Rangers (2001-02) -- 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Jamie Storr stopped 34 shots in a 4-0 victory over the
Rangers on Jan. 9, giving the Kings their first shutout in 57 games
at Madison Square Garden and ending their 10-game winless streak in
the building. Murray hasn't forgotten. He said Thursday night that
Storr, who defeated the Mighty Ducks in his only start this season,
could get the call tonight in place of Felix Potvin: "We haven't made
our mind up for sure. It's a possibility. We've been talking about
it."</TE>

<HD>Herron Opens With a 63 to Lead at Buick Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Herron figured he was on the verge of a great round. He just
didn't know it would be his lowest score in three years, a
nine-under-par 63, or that it would come Thursday in the first round
of the Buick Challenge at Pine Mountain, Ga.</LD>
<LD>   After warming up in the rain, Herron got on a roll by taking only
23 putts on the soft greens of Callaway Gardens for a two-stroke lead
over Phil Mickelson and six others.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson, playing the Buick Challenge for the first time in 10
years, also had a good day on the greens, but most of the focus was
on the club in his hands -- a new putter that looked like a branding
iron.</LD>
<TE>   It was designed to get the ball rolling immediately, and it helped
Mickelson to a 65. He was tied with Rocco Mediate, Bob May, David
Gossett, Ben Crane and Michael Long, an alternate who didn't know he
was playing until 20 minutes before he teed off.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms was among those at 66.</TE>
<TE>   Herron started on No. 10 and played the back nine in only two
under, but an eagle on the 508-yard second hole -- he hit a six-iron
to four feet -- got him going. He played his last nine holes in 29,
tying the record on the Mountain View Course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rain, temperatures in the low 40s and winds of 10-15 mph led to
the first round of the season-ending Senior Tour Championship being
suspended at Oklahoma City. Play was scheduled to resume this morning
and tournament officials hope to complete the first two rounds.... As
expected, Hal Sutton was introduced as the 2004 Ryder Cup captain for
the United States.</TE>

<TE>   Andre Agassi's bid to win the ATP Champions Race was dealt a blow
when he was upset by Karol Kucera, 6-4, 6-4, in the second round of
the St. Petersburg Open at Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi led, 4-1, at the start before losing six consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi remains 43 points behind No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, who lost in
the second round of the Stockholm Open on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In another upset, two-time defending champion Marat Safin lost to
wild-card entry Vladimir Voltchkov, 6-4, 6-4. Elsewhere, Dominik
Hrbaty beat fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 7-6 (1), 7-5, and
Nikolas Kiefer defeated eighth-seeded Max Mirnyi, 6-3, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Rios advanced to the quarterfinals of the Stockholm Open
when American Jan-Michael Gambill was forced to retire because of a
knee injury after losing the first set, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Rios' Chilean countryman, Nicolas Massu, also advanced after
defeating eighth-seeded Rainer Shuettler, 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, Morocco's Hicham Arazi beat hard-serving Taylor
Dent, 6-4, 6-2, and Tommy Robredo of Spain scored a hard-fought 6-4,
3-6, 7-6 (2) win over Todd Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick eliminated U.S. Davis Cup teammate James Blake, 7-6
(6), 6-3, in the second round of the Swiss Indoors at Basel.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick next plays home favorite Roger Federer, the No. 3-seeded
player, who beat qualifier Alexander Waske of Germany, 6-3, 7-6 (1).</TE>
<TE>   In another match, defending champion Tim Henman came back to
defeat Nicolas Escude, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Unseeded Alexandra Stevenson beat sixth-seeded Anastasia Myskina,
6-3, 7-6 (5), to advance to the quarterfinals of the Generali Open at
Linz, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, fourth-seeded Justine Henin defeated Russia's
Tatiana Panova, 6-2, 6-1, fifth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova beat
Barbara Schett, 6-1, 7-5, and American Chanda Rubin beat Russia's
Nadia Petrova, 6-2, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Amanda Coetzer lost to qualifier Virginie Razzano,
6-3, 6-0, in the second round of the Seat Open at Luxembourg. In
other matches, American Laura Granville beat sixth-seeded Anne
Kremer, 6-2, 7-6 (2), and seventh-seeded Elena Bovina beat American
Amy Frazier, 7-6 (5) 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Roscoe Tanner is to face extradition to Florida to answer
allegations of fraud. The Florida State Attorney's Office announced
that it would ask German authorities to take Tanner into custody to
begin proceedings to bring him to Tampa, where he is alleged to have
swindled a broker out of $36,000 over the purchase of a yacht.</TE>

<TE>   Racing was called off today in the America's Cup challenger series

were forecast to sweep across the Auckland region.</TE>

<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>Boris Becker was convicted of tax evasion Thursday but avoided jail
time, sentenced instead to a fine and probation.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a free man, that's the important thing," Becker said in a
prepared statement after he left the Munich state court without
commenting. The three-time Wimbledon champion smiled briefly and
shook hands with his lawyers when the verdict was delivered.</LD>
<LD>   Becker, 34, was given two years' probation and fined $500,000,
ending a 10-year investigation that he called "brutal" and said
helped prompt him to quit tennis in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm happy and relieved that this chapter is finally closed," his
statement said. "This was my most important victory."</TE>
<TE>   State attorneys had demanded Becker be sentenced to 3 1/2 years in
jail for avoiding $1.7 million in taxes. Becker's lawyers argued that
advisors, not their client, had misled authorities over his finances.
Prosecutor Matthias Musiol said he hadn't yet decided whether to
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Becker avoided serving time, the sentence added to his
well-publicized problems since retiring from tennis in 1999. Those
include a divorce from his wife, Barbara, fathering a child out of
wedlock with a Russian model and a string of business failures.</TE>

<HD>Chechnya Policy Gives Russians Pause Amid Crisis</HD>
<DH>Theater takeover brings war closer to home and poses a
leadership test for Putin. Some question why troops remain in the
republic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The hard-line policy of President Vladimir V. Putin in Chechnya had
earned him political dividends, even if there was no sign of clear
victory and thousands were killed. To many Russians, he had restored
the country's honor.</LD>
<LD>   But the takeover of a theater Wednesday in the heart of Moscow by
a gang of Chechen men and women prepared to die for their cause looks
as if it could deplete Putin's political capital.</LD>
<LD>   It could even force a reexamination of whether Putin badly
miscalculated in thinking that a war in the separatist Russian
republic would be winnable for Moscow in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   Like President Bush after Sept. 11, Putin faces a leadership test.
His effectiveness will be judged by how he handles this crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Since the rebels' takeover of the theater, muted criticism of the
Chechen war on the streets of the Russian capital has broken into the
open. Political figures and relatives of the hostages are asking why
Russian troops are still in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, family members of those inside the theater gathered
hundreds of signatures supporting an immediate end to the war. A
five-minute "instant" poll of 3,000 callers by the Echo of Moscow
radio station found 69% in favor of settling the conflict by peaceful
means.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary Russians are now asking whether Putin can save the lives
of the 700 mostly Russian hostages without making humiliating
concessions to the rebels. Can he somehow wrest the initiative from
the rebels and redeem a policy that seems as if it has accomplished
little beyond inflicting misery for both sides?</TE>
<TE>   After three years during which more than 3,000 Russian soldiers
have perished and 80,000 troops have remained tied down in the tiny
Caucasian republic, Putin finds himself at almost the same place his
predecessor and mentor, Boris N. Yeltsin, was six years ago. In the
first Chechen war, which ended in 1996, Yeltsin's government lost
control and was forced to concede de facto independence after
military humiliations and terrorist attacks by separatists.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot will depend on the final outcome of the hostage situation,"
said Nikolai Petrov, head of the Center for Political and Geographic
Research at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a private think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "However, it is clear that this terrorist act will first and
foremost change public sentiments and public opinion about Chechnya,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Petrov noted that for Moscow and Muscovites, the war had been very
remote and obscure. Now, he said, "the war has already come to their
doors. Their perception of it will be firsthand and more intense."</TE>
<TE>   "Public concern over the war in Chechnya and the level of popular
involvement in deciding what to do about it will rise," Petrov said.
And Putin -- who promised to put an end to terrorism and bring back
stability and security -- will have to try something different, like
negotiations, if he hopes to succeed, Petrov said.</TE>
<TE>   Could it lead to a shift in the political winds? Petrov and other
analysts think so.</TE>
<TE>   Putin moved from being prime minister to the Russian presidency in
2000 largely because of the popularity of his sending in troops to
restore Moscow's power over the breakaway republic. That won the
gratitude of Russian nationalists and, even more so, the army and
police, who were given free rein to root out and eradicate separatist
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Putin managed to ignore or deflect Western criticism of
human rights abuses in Chechnya, particularly after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks: He said that the Chechen rebels had become an
extension of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   For most of Putin's presidency, Russian opinion was quiet about
the war. It is not on the front pages here, with most people
seemingly resigned to a steady toll of slain soldiers as a price to
be paid against Islamic militancy and lawlessness in the Caucasus and
to keep Chechnya within the Russian federation.</TE>
<TE>   With the war out of sight, it also was out of mind for ordinary
Russians, except the families of the volunteer "contract" soldiers
from the provinces who do the bulk of the fighting in exchange for
the opportunity to earn decent salaries and, for some, whatever can
be extorted from the Chechen population.</TE>
<TE>   After the theater takeover a few miles from the president's
Kremlin office, however, the public will no longer be able to ignore
Chechnya. And with presidential elections only a little more than a
year away, the war may again become a political hot potato for Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, how Putin addresses the fate of the hostages --
through negotiations or through force -- presents problems for the
president. And the government's claims that the war has been won have
even more of a hollow ring now.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chechen rebels also may have hurt themselves and their
cause.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing a theater full of innocents -- in the glare of
round-the-clock media coverage -- the militants seem to only prove
Putin's assertions that separatists are nothing but bandits and
terrorists. In other words, their takeover did nothing to shed light
on any legitimate grievances and the suffering of the people under
Russian military authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The hostage drama will become a turning point in the world's
attitude toward the conflict in Chechnya," predicted Russian military
analyst Alexander I. Zhilin, who said the rebels' tactics clearly put
them in the same category as Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "From now on, the world will view the war in Chechnya not as
purely Russia's domestic problem, but as part of a large-scale war
against terrorism," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Willing to Listen to N. Korea</HD>
<DH>Dismantling nuclear weapons program is priority. But the
Bush administration does not want to appear to be appeasing regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico -- The Bush administration hasn't cut off
contact with North Korea, but the only subject Washington wants to
discuss is an immediate, verifiable dismantling of the Communist
regime's nuclear weapons program, a senior State Department official
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not ruling out direct contact or direct communication with
the North Koreans," said the official, adding that the diplomatic
channel from the North's mission at the United Nations to the State
Department is still open.</LD>
<LD>   "If they call us, we'll listen, and I hope vice versa -- but
that's not negotiating," the official said. The official, who was
traveling here with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, requested
anonymity based on State Department protocol.</LD>
<TE>   The distinction between "negotiating with" and "listening to" the
North Koreans may seem obscure, but it is crucial to the Bush
administration's diplomatic dance.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policymakers are in a political quandary, Asian security
experts say, because they have long blasted the Clinton
administration for "appeasing" what they see as a dangerous rogue
state by, in effect, paying North Korea not to misbehave and by
appearing to pay for talks with aid packages timed around negotiating
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   But now the Bush administration, facing anxious Asian allies and
unpalatable military options against North Korea, will probably have
to offer something to persuade the regime's leader, Kim Jong Il, to
abandon his nuclear aspiration, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a face-saving solution could be thorny.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters more difficult, China, the country that has perhaps
the most leverage over North Korea, appears to be urging the U.S. to
have direct talks with Kim's regime based on the Clinton
administration's 1994 agreement that North Korean officials have told
U.S. diplomats is now nullified. Under that pact, the North promised
to freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a 20-year
supply of fuel oil and the construction of two nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Bush administration is publicly committed to the
basic principle that bad behavior should not be rewarded with U.S.
policies of engagement.</TE>
<TE>   It has no intention of trusting a regime that Washington says has
violated five written agreements aimed at keeping the Korean
peninsula free of nuclear weapons. "We bought that horse one time
before," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, for political reasons, the Bush administration must
clearly differentiate its approach from that of the previous
administration, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Bush camp, "the fourth element of the 'axis of evil' is
the Clinton administration," Kurt Campbell, who was charged with
Asian affairs at the Pentagon under Clinton, quipped earlier this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell and other security experts said the Bush team will have
to find some face-saving way to deal with the North without opening
itself up to charges of appeasement or hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be easy to attack the administration for lack of
consistency" over threats to invade nuclear aspirant Iraq if it then
takes a soft line on North Korea, Campbell said. "But the
consequences of that are to lead the administration down the road of
less diplomacy and more brinkmanship, which is not in our [national]
interest."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had no preconditions for improving
relations with North Korea before it discovered evidence of the
secret uranium program last summer, the senior official said. Now the
U.S. has demanded a rollback of that program as a precondition of
further dealings.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea said today that it would make a deal with the U.S. if
it gets a "nonaggression treaty." The state-run news agency KCNA
quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying that the
U.S. must recognize the North's sovereignty and assure it of
nonaggression.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, meeting Thursday with fellow foreign ministers at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering at the Mexican resort
town of Cabo San Lucas, was urging North Korea's neighbors to
pressure Kim to roll back its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   Powell met with South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Sung Hong.
Another senior State Department official said the two agreed that
"this is a very serious matter" that should be resolved peacefully
and that "the ball is in the North Koreans' court."  However, Chinese
officials reportedly have been telling the administration that little
progress can be made without direct talks with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   And on Thursday, a senior Chinese official repeated Beijing's
position that the Korean peninsula should remain nonnuclear, but went
on to say that the nonproliferation agreements signed in 1993 and
1994, including the Agreed Framework, "have not come easily, and
these agreements should continue to be followed."</TE>

<HD>Landmark Bahrain Election Overcomes Call for Boycott</HD>
<DH>Turnout passes 50% in Persian Gulf nation's first
parliamentary poll in nearly 30 years. It is seen as victory for
king's pro-Western views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain</DL>
<LD>In what was hailed as a victory for the pro-Western views of the
king, more than 50% of voters on this Persian Gulf island went to the
polls Thursday in the first parliamentary election in nearly 30
years.</LD>
<LD>   Islamic leaders had waged a vigorous campaign urging voters to
boycott the election to show their disapproval of the limited
power-sharing plan devised by the king, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa.</LD>
<LD>   But election officials -- backed by international observers --
reported voting was strong even in Shiite Muslim neighborhoods, where
disaffection is highest with the king and the royal family, who are
Sunnis.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big success for his majesty's way for democracy that he
has presented to the people," said government spokesman Nabeel Hamer.</TE>
<TE>   Hamer suggested that the king may name Shiites to the second
legislative chamber, an appointive body created by the new
constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "He will not select on the basis of Shiite or Sunni, we are all
Bahrainis," Hamer said. "We invite [the boycott leaders] to join us
in the march to democracy."</TE>
<TE>   One Islamic leader had predicted the turnout would not exceed 30%.
The king's eldest son, Crown Prince Sheik Salman ibn Hamed Khalifa,
had sought earlier in the week to downplay the significance of
turnout.</TE>
<TE>   With tabulations still underway, turnout was 53.2%, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   All Bahrainis who meet the criteria for voting are eligible to
vote, without the need to register.</TE>
<TE>   The king, his wife and the crown prince had used television to
stage an American-style campaign to counter the boycott. The drive
included an infomercial, a rally with entertainers and sports stars,
a press conference by the crown prince and an election eve speech by
the king.</TE>
<TE>   The balloting marked the first parliamentary election in an Arab
Persian Gulf state in which women could both vote and run for office.
Eight women were among the 170 candidates for 40 spots.</TE>
<TE>   Early indications were that none of the women had been elected,
but at least one appeared headed for a runoff. In races where no
candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a runoff will be held next
week.</TE>
<TE>   In front-page editorials, Arabic and English-language newspapers
in this country of 600,000 had said that refusal to vote would be
seen as a vote of no confidence in the king.</TE>
<TE>   "How many other rulers in the Persian Gulf would take a chance on
such a referendum?" said one Western diplomat. "Not many. This king
has guts."</TE>
<TE>   While much of the election campaign dealt with local issues such
as unemployment, education and health care, there was an undercurrent
of dissent among some voters about the king's staunch support for the
U.S. Navy base here.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. support for Israel and President Bush's threat to use force
to topple Iraq's Saddam Hussein have led to calls among some Islamic
leaders for Bahrain to oust the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   A teenager who was killed in a scuffle with police during a
rock-throwing protest at the U.S. Embassy has become a martyr in many
Shiite homes, which now display his photo.</TE>
<TE>   Bahrain has not had a parliament since the king's late father
disbanded it in 1975 after only 18 months. Since succeeding to the
throne in 1999, Hamed has launched a modernization drive to turn
Bahrain into a tourism, banking and insurance center.</TE>
<TE>   Boycott leaders were angry that, under the new constitution, the
second legislative body, with members appointed by the king, will be
able to block legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Even if no women are elected to the parliament, the king, 52, has
promised to appoint women to the second legislative body -- as well
as at least one Jew, one Christian and one Indian.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bahraini constitution assures equal rights to women,
Islamic traditions prevailed on election day. At most polling places,
men and women stood in separate lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a better future for my children and my grandchildren,"
said Naeema Bloushi, who runs a women's health spa. "Next time I will
vote for myself as a candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Bahrain faces serious social and economic problems, including
double-digit unemployment and friction between the Shiite majority
and the Sunni minority.</TE>
<TE>   "What this country needs is some smoke-filled rooms where deals
can be cut and compromises made," one Westerner said.</TE>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>CAIRO -- At first glance, it seems absurd to ask Ahmad Mohammed Afifi
whether he is participating in an Arab boycott of American goods. A
17-year-old freshman at the prestigious American University of Cairo,
he is sitting in a banquette in a sleek new coffee bar in one of
Cairo's most Westernized neighborhoods, sipping a Sprite and smoking
a Marlboro.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, he says, he is boycotting.</LD>
<LD>   Like nearly everyone here, he is angry about American support for
Israel and apprehensive about any U.S.-led attack on Iraq. He wants
to show his displeasure and has joined the boycott that sprang up two
years ago, shortly after the start of the Palestinian uprising in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   It's just that Afifi, like many people, has his own rules, full of
nuance, about what's off-limits. Marlboro and Sprite, he has decided,
are OK, because they are made in Egypt by Egyptian workers. Any
product stamped "Made in U.S.A." is taboo.</TE>
<TE>   However, American books, movies and music are exceptions, he says,
because they are cultural items, not purely commercial products.</TE>
<TE>   Afifi's rules hint at some of the complexities behind the
anti-Americanism that has swept through the Arab world in the last
two years and has found expression in demonstrations, some violent,
and in the boycott, which has attracted adherents throughout the
Middle East. Scholars and diplomats here say the Palestinian uprising
has fired up the Arab world as have few events in recent memory. A
poll released this month by Washington-based Zogby International
found overwhelming disapproval in Arab countries of U.S. foreign
policy, even as it noted continuing admiration for American values
and technological prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Rana Ballout, a 28-year-old Lebanese journalist, has lived in
Boston, New York and Washington, and has happy memories of her time
in the U.S., including a glorious road trip down California's Highway
1.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the States," she said, "but I wouldn't go back." She is
furious that the U.S. continues to support Israel and doesn't like
the way the Bush administration has responded to the Sept. 11
attacks. So, she said, "I do what I can, and it's very personal."</TE>
<TE>   She still eats at McDonald's, drinks Coke and wears Nike sneakers.
But U.S. vacations are out, and she has quit smoking because, she
said, she doesn't want an American company, Philip Morris, "to own my
cravings."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly given such idiosyncratic behavior, it is difficult to
measure the boycott's impact. Targeted companies have declined to say
how much they have been hurt; moreover, the boycott has coincided
with a general economic downturn, so declines in sales can be
partially attributable to that.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the consensus among American government and business
officials in the region seems to be that some sectors, particularly
fast food, have been hurt significantly but the bulk of American
investment has remained untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "Boycotts have no effect whatsoever on the American economy, or a
negligible effect," said Neil MacDonald, editor of Business Monthly,
a magazine published by the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Many American consumer goods in the Mideast are produced locally
-- and, in many cases, the companies are owned locally, as franchises
-- with only a small slice of income returning to the parent company.
And consumer products account for a fairly small portion of American
business in the region.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, for instance, the single largest import from America is
wheat, most of which is baked by Egyptian companies and marketed as a
domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Still, MacDonald said it "might not be too far off" to estimate
that McDonald's restaurants and Procter &amp; Gamble--the two most
prominent targets of the boycott--have lost as much as half of their
business in Egypt this year. And there have been reports that the
boycott has had greater success in Saudi Arabia and other Persian
Gulf nations.</TE>
<TE>   There also is apprehension about what the future might bring for
American businesses here, particularly if the United States leads an
attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what could happen in the next few months," said a
jittery executive with one Fortune 500 company in Cairo, who would
speak only on the condition that neither he nor his corporation be
named. "We don't want anybody to think about us," he said. "We want
to play it low-key."</TE>
<TE>   Abdulaziz Husseini, the coordinator of the boycott in Egypt, said
the movement began spontaneously but eventually was organized under
the umbrella of the Syrian-based Arab Boycott Bureau, created by the
Arab League in 1951 to boycott Israeli products.</TE>
<TE>   "We are calling on people to hold on to the idea of not
cooperating, not aiding, and not normalizing with Israel," Husseini
said. "And we're also sending a message to the American
administration and to corporate America that their policy goes
against Arab security and Arab hopes for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Husseini insisted that although the boycott is anti-Israel and
anti-American, it is not anti-Semitic. But that distinction has
apparently eluded some grass-roots organizers. A leaflet circulated
in a Cairo mosque urges followers: "Do not buy items which are
Jewish, American or British." It also repeats a regional myth: Pepsi,
it says, is an acronym for "Pay Every Penny to Save Israel." Pepsi
was created more than half a century before the state of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Although the movement targets both Israeli and American goods,
Israel does a negligible amount of business with Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   Boycott advocates acknowledge that they are unlikely to bring the
U.S. to its knees economically. That, they say, is not the point.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is the stand -- the issue itself," said Emad Shahin, a
professor of political science at American University in Cairo. "The
message is that people have a right to say no."</TE>
<TE>   Maher Nahhas, a 22-year-old Jordanian who is studying in Cairo and
has joined the boycott, said he still likes some aspects of America.</TE>
<TE>   "We all look up to their lifestyle, and we wish we could follow
that kind of life," he said. But he has given up McDonald's and
Kentucky Fried Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "America encourages what happens in Israel. It hates us," he said
as he waited for a shwarma sandwich outside an Egyptian fast food
restaurant. Boycotting, he said, "is the least we can do."</TE>

<LD>Libya has decided to withdraw from the Arab League, Moammar Kadafi's
government announced. No reason was given, but Libyan officials cited
the Arab League's inefficiency in dealing with the crises over Iraq
and the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement by the Libyan news agency, the Ministry of African
Affairs said an official notification had been sent to Arab League
headquarters in Cairo. Arab League spokesman Hisham Youssef confirmed
that the 22-nation organization had received the official notice from
the Libyans. The withdrawal does not take effect for a year.</LD>

Predators fly in conjunction with Air Force fighter jets that have
been patrolling a "no-fly" zone over southern Iraq for more than a
decade, said Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>In the hours since Chechen fighters took over a Moscow theater where
about 700 people were watching a production of the musical romance
"Nord-Ost," only a few dozen people have been fortunate enough to
flee or be released from the guerrillas' terrifying grip.</LD>
<LD>   If the Wednesday night takeover of the theater had happened five
days later, Olga Treiman would not have been there. The 18-year-old
is so far along in her pregnancy -- barely a month from her delivery
date -- that she felt she could no longer work behind the refreshment
counter that serves champagne and chocolate before the opening
curtain and at intermission.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd of theater-goers had just gone back inside the
auditorium for Act 2 of the musical, and Treiman wearily hauled
herself to the bathroom situated just off the lobby.</LD>
<TE>   "It was one of my last nights at work. I was planning to go into a
maternity home on Monday," she said Thursday after she was reunited
with her husband and mother. "When the shooting began, I was in the
toilet."</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed, she stuck her head out the door just quickly enough to
spy armed men running about "shouting in a tongue I did not
understand." At that, she locked herself inside the bathroom and
started to pray.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped me for about two hours, which seemed like eternity,"
she said. But "at that point, someone came to the door and tried to
open it, and then went away. Then someone came again and started to
bang on the door with a hard object -- probably a gun....</TE>
<TE>   "He shouted, 'Open up! Or I will break the door!'</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to get off the toilet seat, but I could not bring myself
to do it. I literally could not stir. Fear paralyzed me completely."</TE>
<TE>   For a few agonizing minutes she just sat there, listening to the
door gradually coming loose and the latch breaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, he broke the door in and came in slowly, gun first. The
only thing I could whisper was, 'Don't shoot. I am pregnant.' "</TE>
<TE>   She described her abductor as a tall young man wearing a black
mask that exposed his face only above the nose. But he spoke to her
softly: "Come with me. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   She was led into the performing hall, where many people were
gathered in the level called the "dress circle" and more were below
on the main floor.</TE>
<TE>   There was a huge crowd of captives, she said. "Mostly they were
young adults, but I saw a lot of children too. My guard pointed to a
seat and I obediently slumped into it. I sat for what seemed like
several hours, looking about."</TE>
<TE>   She said she did not see the guerrillas beating anyone but
observed two hostages with blood on them.</TE>
<TE>   "One had his shoulder bandaged with a cloth, with dark blood
seeping through it, and had a bloodied face. The Chechens were
walking around, mostly talking to each other in their own language."</TE>
<TE>   She said some captors were sitting on the stage where the play had
been performed, but most of them were just wandering around. In the
auditorium itself, she counted 12 men and six women among the rebels,
who are demanding an end to Russia's war on separatists in the
southern republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Lemon-shaped grenades were hanging from their camouflage jackets,
and the women had oblong plastic bags tied about their waists. You
could see through and see something inside that looked like gray
metal objects, many of them, in the bags," she said. "When someone
asked one of the women what it was, she said simply, 'Explosives.' "</TE>
<TE>   The mood among the captives was one of barely suppressed panic.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people were on the verge of a nervous breakdown," Treiman
said. "And it was very stuffy. Some people would be led to the
windows so they could breathe some fresh air. They also would lead
people to toilets and wait for them by the door."</TE>
<TE>   During this time, she heard from fellow hostages that the
guerrillas had freed two pregnant women earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided that this was my chance; now or never," she recalled.
"I called to my guard and told him that I felt my water breaking,
that I might give birth right there and then. My guard shouted to
another in Chechen, and then he turned to me and said, 'Let's go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Before releasing her, he gave a speech, intending her to repeat it
to the outside world. He gave his name as Aslan and told her: "My
people are being killed by the dozens every day in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we are not going back; we will die here," he added. "But
we will die with all these hostages -- if they don't stop the killing
in Chechnya and pull the troops out."</TE>
<TE>   If they do, he continued, "We will free them -- all of them. If
not, then we will all die together. Remember this and tell them," he
instructed her.</TE>
<TE>   Then Aslan led her to a door and slowly cracked it open.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to raise my arms over my head and keep waving them and
walk slowly, so they [the police] would not shoot me," Treiman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt very, very eerie walking 200 yards along a totally
deserted street with my hands over my head and my big belly bulging
out. The Chechens had not let me take my coat or bag.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it must have been very cold, but I could not feel it
because I was so happy."</TE>
<TE>   After she was safe, however, she began to fear for a co-worker who
is still captive.</TE>
<TE>   "How I wish they would stop this war forever," she said. "Or else
the killing will never stop."</TE>

<HD>Chechen Rebels Free 7 More in Standoff</HD>
<DH>Guerrillas who invaded a Moscow theater and seized 700
hostages also say they'll let 75 foreigners go. One woman is known
dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Chechen guerrillas who took over a theater here in mid-performance
shot a woman to death, authorities said Thursday, increasing fears
for the safety of about 700 remaining hostages.</LD>
<LD>   But in a hopeful sign, seven hostages were released early this
morning, the Federal Security Service said, bringing the total freed
so far to 45. Later, an agency spokesman said the rebels had agreed
to free all 75 foreigners held captive.</LD>
<LD>   Embassies were asked to send representatives to meet their
citizens, but the hundreds of Russian hostages were not to be freed.</LD>
<TE>   The situation remained tense.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 relatives of the hostages demonstrated against the
Chechnya war outside the theater early today after some of the
hostages telephoned to warn that the rebels were threatening to blow
up the building unless they did so.</TE>
<TE>   With the theater cordoned off at a distance of several hundred
yards and a few armored vehicles visible on streets leading to it,
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin issued a statement saying that
the main aim of security forces should be "to release the hostages
and ensure their maximum safety."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators spoke with the heavily armed rebels, who seized the
hostages Wednesday night and have demanded an end to the Russian
government's war on separatists in the southern republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified relatives of the captives gathered in the gymnasium of a
nearby technical school. Most grimly watched news reports on
television, while some quietly sobbed and others told reporters that
the captors' demands should be granted.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why this simple, understandable and
justifiable demand of the terrorists cannot be met," said Liana
Okhapkina, 41, a doctor whose daughter, Zhenya, 19, is among the
hostages.</TE>
<TE>   "This war has been going on for eight years," she said. "It killed
thousands of people and what is the result? I don't need this war. I
don't know anybody who really needs this war. Maybe those who started
it. But their children are not among the hostages, so what do they
care?"</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow told reporters that President
Bush spoke with Putin and "expressed our condemnation of the
terrorist act that is still unfolding here in Moscow, and he offered
any support and assistance that the United States could provide."</TE>
<TE>   "We call upon the terrorists to release all hostages -- American,
Russian and other nationalities -- immediately and without
conditions," Vershbow said.</TE>
<TE>   Three U.S. citizens and a Russian citizen holding U.S. permanent
resident status were among the hostages, Vershbow said. British
officials reported that a dozen of their citizens were inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to underscore the solidarity of our nation with the
Russian people at this difficult time," Vershbow added. "I don't
think this is in any way going to help the Chechen cause, but only
create more outrage toward anyone who tries to use terrorism for
political ends."</TE>
<TE>   Chechens won a degree of autonomy for their republic in the
Caucasus region after defeating Russian troops in a 1994-96 war.
Russian forces marched back into the republic in 1999 and have
battled guerrillas there ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Movsar Barayev, leader of the 30 to 50 guerrillas holding the
hostages, rejected the label "terrorist" in an interview with London
Sunday Times correspondent Mark Franchetti, who entered the theater
Thursday with a Russian negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   Franchetti told reporters that Barayev had said: "We aren't
terrorists, because terrorists ask for money and planes. All we ask
for is to pull out the troops from Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   Barayev's uncle, Arbi, was a warlord who gained notoriety as a
kidnapper and trader in Russian captives in Chechnya until he was
killed last year.</TE>
<TE>   An Internet site believed linked to the rebels -- www.kav kaz.org
-- posted a statement declaring: "The Chechen moujahedeen have taken
over a Moscow theater with 1,000 hostages. The Chechen detachment is
led by Movsar Barayev .... In addition to the moujahedeen, there are
also 40 widows of Chechen fighters. The building has been mined. All
the participants in the operations are also wearing explosives....</TE>
<TE>   "Barayev said that those who have attacked Moscow are kamikaze
rebels. The only demand is that the war should end and that an
immediate withdrawal of occupation troops from Chechnya should
begin.... Barayev also said that the Chechen moujahedeen came to
Moscow not to survive, but to die."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Ignatchenko, a spokesman for the Federal Security Service,
or FSB, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB, said Thursday night that
about 700 hostages were still being held, including 30 children and
the 75 foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   The hostage-takers released the body of the dead woman Thursday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a Russian girl, about 20 years of age," Ignatchenko said.
"Doctors said she died of a fatal gunshot wound into the chest 16 to
18 hours ago." The woman also had broken fingers on one hand, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters for the Russian television station NTV later accompanied
Red Cross doctors into the theater to deliver medicine. They reported
that the hostages had been fed and did not seem panicky.</TE>
<TE>   Two women fled the theater early Thursday evening, a Moscow police
spokesman said. The hostage-takers fired two rounds from grenade
launchers at them as they ran, but missed, he said. At the nearby
school gymnasium, relatives of hostages said they understood the two
women had jumped out a window.</TE>
<TE>   Okhapkina, the doctor, said her hostage daughter telephoned
Thursday afternoon and told her "the terrorists gave them food and
water and allowed them to use the toilet, but they could see how the
whole place is mined."</TE>
<TE>   Galina Artyomova, 58, whose daughter-in-law, Anna, 33, was among
the hostages, said the younger woman telephoned her Thursday evening
and said: "It's getting worse and worse. Everything is mined here, so
these people are really ready to die. I have no doubt about that, nor
does anybody else here. If the storming of the place begins, that
will be the end of us. We'll all be dead in no time."</TE>
<TE>   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko party in parliament, had
entered the theater late Thursday evening to begin another round of
negotiations with the hostage-takers.</TE>
<TE>   An aide said the party leader was taking proposals to the rebels
that he believed could help resolve the situation. Yavlinsky left the
building again about midnight and went directly to the nearby
security operation headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether more than one hostage might have died. A
man who requested anonymity for himself and his wife, a hostage, said
she had telephoned him and said: "I don't know if I'll be able to
call again, but don't take everything you hear for granted. Things
are much, much worse than you may imagine. They have already killed
four people."</TE>
<TE>   The man said he asked, "Did you see them?" and she replied, "I
know."</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana Baranova, 40, an engineer whose son, Ivan, 18, is a
hostage, said hundreds of hostage relatives signed a petition to
Putin asking that he end the war in Chechnya as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that Putin reads it, considers our plight and lets these
Chechens go," Baranova said. "If they don't want to live with us, why
should we force them? After all, it's a small chunk of rocky land.
Who needs it?"</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Strelkov, 25, a taxi driver, said he had been planning to
attend the performance of the Russian musical "Nord-Ost" with his
wife, Tatyana, 22, but had been delayed by work and couldn't join
her.</TE>
<TE>   "How I wish I could go back to that moment, drop off my client and
join her," he said, holding his head in his hands and trembling. "I'd
rather be there with her and face this danger together. The last time
I talked to her was last night, when she said what happened, and then
she said, 'Look, there's something I want to tell you,' and the phone
went dead. What did she want to tell me? Now I know only what I want
to tell her. I hope I will."</TE>
<TE>   Ignatchenko, the FSB spokesman, said that with the batteries of
most of the hostages' mobile phones running low, negotiators had
offered to supply chargers to keep them working or other means of
communication such as satellite phones, but the hostage-takers
refused.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very suspicious, and they are afraid that we will try to
plant some bugging devices on them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "During our contacts with the terrorists, they at some point
opened their jackets and showed explosives tied to their bodies,"
Ignatchenko added. "The impression is that all of them have
explosives on them."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Karaganov, a prominent analyst who heads the Foreign and
Defense Policy Council, said in an interview Thursday with Ekho
Moskvy radio that Putin might use force against the hostage-takers if
he thinks such an action could succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is possible to effectively destroy terrorists with minimum
casualties, our leadership, above all President Putin, will have to
make a decision," Karaganov said. "I am not sure that such a
possibility exists theoretically in this situation.... Terrorists and
bandits may be scattered around the entire premises. I don't
understand how they can be found if shooting begins. But if such a
possibility exists, this option may be considered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that negotiations must be conducted and a way out must be
found to minimize casualties," Karaganov said. "But I am afraid that
there is not such a way out. My impression is, and I hope I am wrong,
that this is a group of suicide bombers ... who want to repeat the
Sept. 11 events on a smaller scale."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>An explosive device blew up at a shopping mall and injured two people
Thursday, worsening jitters in Indonesia, while the world moved to
isolate a Southeast Asian terrorist group allegedly linked to Al
Qaeda that is suspected in a deadly bombing in Bali.</LD>
<LD>   Australia said 47 nations back its campaign to get the United
Nations Security Council to declare Jemaah Islamiah a terrorist
organization, and Britain banned the group and ordered its bank
accounts frozen.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. State Department added Jemaah Islamiah to its list of
terrorist groups Wednesday, thus freezing its assets, making it a
crime to contribute funds to the organization and barring its members
from traveling to the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The actions showed that the international community has put Jemaah
Islamiah in its sights since the Oct. 12 Bali bombing, which killed
more than 180 people and injured hundreds, most of them foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's explosion at
the shopping mall in Bandung, 75 miles southeast of Jakarta, the
capital, but police described the device -- and two others defused at
another mall -- as being like large firecrackers. Wrapped like a
gift, the device blew up as a janitor tried to move it from a
cleaning cart. Two people suffered slight injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The devices appeared intended to frighten, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Indonesia vowed to support efforts at the U.N. to list
Jemaah Islamiah as a terrorist organization, but backers of its
alleged leader, Abu Bakar Bashir, dismissed accusations against the
group as lies.</TE>

<HD>Abductees to Remain in Japan</HD>
<DH>Five people taken by North Korea decades ago hope families
they left there can join them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OBAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The drama of the Japanese abducted to North Korea took a new turn
Thursday with the announcement that the five who are visiting Japan
will stay indefinitely and hope that their families can join them.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by Japan intensified the tug of war between Tokyo
and its Communist neighbor. It threatened to add diplomatic
complications to an extraordinary human tragedy that has left the
abductees torn between the families they left in Japan decades ago
and the families they formed in exile.</LD>
<LD>   The five left children in North Korea while they revisit their
homeland this month, and they were to have returned within two weeks.
Their visit hit a snag, however, when their families in Japan began
pressuring the government to keep them here. The families also
demanded that Tokyo press North Korea to let the abductees' children
join them permanently in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Together, the abductees have seven children -- all in their teens
or 20s -- in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the return of all family members to Japan "indispensable
and urgent," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said the Japanese
government would work to settle them here.</TE>
<TE>   "The five abductees will stay in Japan," Fukuda said. "We will
strongly urge North Korea to ensure the safety of families remaining
in North Korea and their early return."</TE>
<TE>   When the governments meet next week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for
talks on establishing diplomatic relations, Fukuda said, Tokyo will
ask North Korea to set a date for the abductees' families to come to
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Family members were ecstatic. "The dream I have hoped for over the
last 24 years has finally come true," said Tamotsu Chimura, whose son
Yasushi was kidnapped in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Yuko Hamamoto, whose sister Fukie was seized with Chimura and
later married him in North Korea, praised the government's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The five are the only known survivors of 13 Japanese whom North
Korea acknowledges abducting in the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>

<DL>PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Hurricane Kenna strengthened to a Category 5 storm packing 160-mph
winds and veered toward Mexico's Pacific Coast on Thursday night,
prompting authorities to begin evacuating thousands of people in
areas that include major tourist resorts.</LD>
<LD>   A Category 5 storm is the most dangerous, capable of causing
catastrophic damage.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a potentially devastating hurricane if it comes in at
this intensity or even if it weakens a little bit," said Ed
Rappaport, deputy director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in
Miami. "Based on the records, which go back 40 or 50 years, this
would be one of the two or three strongest" hurricanes to hit
Mexico's Pacific Coast, Rappaport said.</LD>
<TE>   A hurricane warning was posted for the southwestern coast from
Mazatlan, a tourist resort, southward to the port city of La Fortuna.
On its current track, forecasters said, the hurricane's center was
expected to hit shore south of Mazatlan early this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricane Center forecast some weakening but said that "Kenna
is expected to be an extremely dangerous hurricane at landfall."</TE>
<TE>   Emergency officials evacuated about 10,000 fishermen and residents
from 30 coastal communities around Mazatlan and ordered schools and
docks closed across the area.</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, troops and civil defense authorities evacuated
5,000 people from Puerto Vallarta neighborhoods built along a river
and on hillsides in case there is flooding or mudslides.</TE>
<TE>   Even in areas not directly affected by its winds, Kenna was
expected to bring 6 to 10 inches of rain and possible flash floods,
as well as storm surge flooding of 6 to 10 feet above normal tide
levels and dangerous waves.</TE>
<TE>   In Puerto Vallarta, boat owners were stripping their yachts and
wrapping extra ropes around dock pylons in an attempt to ensure that
their vessels wouldn't be swept away.</TE>

<HD>2 Sides Cool to Mideast Plan</HD>
<DH>U.S. proposal draws security concerns from Israel and
political ones from Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERICHO, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinians must take decisive action against militants and get
serious about internal reform if they want to move toward statehood
as outlined in a new Mideast peace plan, a U.S. envoy told senior
Palestinian officials Thursday. But the Palestinians and Israel have
expressed reservations about the plan.</LD>
<LD>   The document envisions a gradual Israeli troop pullback to
positions held before the outbreak of fighting two years ago. It also
calls for Palestinian elections by May 2003, followed by a
provisional Palestinian state by the end of next year and a final
peace deal and full Palestinian independence by 2005.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat noted that the plan only
refers to parliamentary and not presidential elections -- an apparent
attempt to circumvent Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   "This ... is not acceptable," Erekat told reporters after a
meeting with the envoy, Assistant Secretary of State William Burns,
in the West Bank city of Jericho.</TE>
<TE>   Adhering to a U.S. boycott of Arafat, Burns is not meeting with
the Palestinian leader. Arafat's popularity has plummeted, but if
elections are held he is widely expected to be reelected as
Palestinian Authority president.</TE>
<TE>   The peace plan also calls for naming a prime minister to handle
day-to-day affairs of government. Arafat opposes the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Burns said the Palestinians won't be able to end occupation unless
they end terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Burns met with Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, who said the new plan did not address all of Israel's
security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel reserves the right to self-defense and will not accept any
constraints by this or any other road map," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, hundreds of Israeli soldiers entered the town of
Jenin early today in response to a deadly Palestinian suicide bombing
Monday, the military said.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Spy Case Causes Furor</HD>
<DH>The allegation that a Bedouin army officer aided Hezbollah
could drive yet another wedge between Jewish and Arab communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>For generations, men of the small Bedouin village of Beit Zarzir have
proudly volunteered to serve in the Israeli army, which prized them
for their battlefield bravery and their phenomenal ability to read
terrain. On Thursday, the scion of the village's most prominent clan
-- a Bedouin lieutenant colonel who lost an eye fighting for Israel
in Lebanon -- stood before a military court, indicted on charges of
espionage.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Omar Heib and his nine alleged accomplices, who are
also Bedouins, is causing a furor in Israel. The men are accused of
providing sensitive military information, in exchange for drugs and
money, to the Muslim fundamentalist group Hezbollah, which is sworn
to Israel's destruction. Heib, if found guilty, would be the
highest-ranking Israeli military officer known to have been recruited
to spy on the group's behalf.</LD>
<LD>   Since the earliest days of Israel's statehood, the courage and
loyalty of its Bedouin troops, who as Muslims and Arabs are not
subject to Israel's military draft, have been cited as proof that the
state's Arab minority can be fully integrated with the Jewish
majority into the nation's most venerable institutions.</LD>
<TE>   Now it is feared that this case will drive yet another wedge
between the two communities, whose relationship has become
increasingly fraught with tension and mistrust as the Palestinian
intifada, or uprising, drags into a third year.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israeli Arabs believe that they are unfairly tarred by
terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinian militants, and point out
that they too suffer casualties in suicide bombings and other
assaults inside Israel. Israeli Arabs were among the dead and injured
when an explosives-laden SUV slammed into a crowded bus in northern
Israel on Monday, killing 14 passengers, some of whom were burned
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Some Jewish Israelis, however, perceive Israeli Arabs' sympathy
for their Palestinian brethren as a worrisome threat from within.
Israeli Arabs have been implicated in the planning and execution of
several attacks, and there was an outpouring of anger in Israel this
year when a young Israeli Arab woman and her companion, who were
warned by the Palestinian bomber, got off a bus before it blew up
without attempting to raise any alarm.</TE>
<TE>   In such a highly charged atmosphere, these spy allegations are
both divisive and damning. Laying out their cases Thursday, Israeli
prosecutors depicted a seamy drug underworld intersecting with the
shadowy realm of espionage, in which Hezbollah-linked traffickers
proffered drugs and cash, and the Bedouin gang in return provided
information about army troop movements, coded maps and other
operational details.</TE>
<TE>   As Heib was being indicted in a special military court in Tel Aviv
and four of his alleged accomplices appeared in criminal court in the
Israeli Arab city of Nazareth, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the Israeli
army's chief of staff, sought to portray the case as an isolated one,
even if wrongdoing is proven.</TE>
<TE>   "People must not draw conclusions against the Bedouin community,
whose sons have contributed greatly to the country and its security,
and continue to do so," Yaalon said. "The community has paid a heavy
price for this service."</TE>
<TE>   Bedouin soldiers have a storied tradition as "trackers," or guides
and scouts whose keen powers of observation have made them an
invaluable asset in Israel's many wars.</TE>
<TE>   "They see a small stone if it's turned the way it wasn't before,
or a twig that's bent in a way it shouldn't be, and they know who has
passed that way, and when," said Joseph Ginat, a University of Haifa
professor who has lived among Bedouins and written extensively about
them. "You can't study this skill in the university. You have to be
born to it, smell it, see it, grow up with it."</TE>
<TE>   This legacy is kept alive today on the frontier with Lebanon,
where Israeli troops remain locked in a standoff with the guerrillas
of Hezbollah, and trackers are used to help counter constant attempts
to infiltrate northern Israel. In March, six Israelis were killed in
one such suspected infiltration.</TE>
<TE>   It is because Hezbollah is considered such a dangerous foe that
the case is sending shock waves through Israel, said Yossi Melman, an
Israeli author and journalist specializing in espionage and
intelligence matters.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of real damage to Israel's national security interest,
the information thought to have been passed to them would have only a
very limited impact," Melman said. "But Hezbollah is not just defined
by law as a hostile organization -- by its very nature it is a
vicious enemy of Israel, maybe the most vicious."</TE>
<TE>   In their long campaign during the 1980s and 1990s to drive Israeli
troops out of southern Lebanon, the guerrillas bloodied the far
stronger Israeli army again and again with unconventional tactics and
the effective use of relatively low-tech weaponry, such as
radio-triggered roadside bombs. Israel withdrew its troops in May
2000.</TE>
<TE>   During the Lebanon conflict, Hezbollah killed a number of
high-ranking Israeli military officials in carefully planned attacks,
and the indictments suggested that it was still searching for ways to
do so. Among its demands to the spy ring, authorities said, were
requests for detailed information about the movements and schedules
of senior Israeli officers.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Heib denied all the charges against him. "Would he
betray the country he paid with his body to defend?" asked his
attorney, Amnon Zichroni. Heib lost his eye in an explosion in
southern Lebanon in 1996, while on a tracking mission.</TE>
<TE>   In Heib's hometown of Beit Zarzir -- a village of several thousand
people in the foothills of the Galilee area, where the Bible says
Jesus spent his boyhood and early manhood -- the allegations hit like
a thunderbolt.</TE>
<TE>   Army service is a way of life for the young men of the village,
with many of them deployed in Bedouin tracker units. Beit Zarzir's
latest combat loss was just six weeks ago, when a 24-year-old
lieutenant from the village was killed in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The Heib clan has been living in the Galilee area since the 17th
century, when drought drove successive waves of Bedouin tribes from
the Syrian desert. Virtually all of Omar Heib's extended family, old
and young, made the two-hour trek from Beit Zarzir to Tel Aviv for
his indictment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   One of Heib's brothers -- Hassan, who is the mayor of Beit Zarzir
-- expressed deep worry that whatever the outcome of the case, the
entire Bedouin population of Israel, an estimated 250,000, would
suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the gravest affairs the Bedouin community in
Israel has ever been through," he said. "But we as Bedouin leaders
will do everything so we may continue in the same course we have
followed since the establishment of the state of Israel."</TE>

<HD>Kurdish Dream of Nation Is a Nightmare for Turkey</HD>
<DH>Ankara, a key U.S. ally, fears that a war against Baghdad
could spur the ethnic minority in Iraq and brethren in the region to
secede.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Many messy sideshows are expected in a war to topple Saddam Hussein,
but few will be more dangerous than in the mountains of northern
Iraq, where Turkey's national security will collide with Kurdish
dreams of a homeland.</LD>
<LD>   As diplomats bicker over the language of U.N. resolutions,
tensions are hardening along the 220-mile Turkish-Iraqi border. Tents
are being shipped in for refugees as the Turkish government prepares
for possible deployment of thousands more troops. These forces,
according to Western diplomats and Turkish military analysts,
probably would seize control of northern Iraq shortly after missile
strikes on Baghdad, to prevent the creation of a Kurdish state.</LD>
<LD>   The focus is on the future of 3.5 million Kurds who are protected
from Iraqi troops in the "no-fly" zone in the north. For generations,
the Kurds have wanted their own country, and, with the protection of
U.S. planes, they have formed a de facto state in the mountains. The
prospect of an independent Kurdistan emerging from war's ashes,
however, is unacceptable to Turkey, which has spent billions fighting
separatists among its own 13 million Kurds.</LD>
<TE>   "If the Kurds declare an independent entity, it wouldn't last more
than a couple of days," one Western diplomat said. "The Turkish army
will go in and shut it down. How would the U.S. respond? What's more
important to the U.S. -- an independent Kurdistan or a valuable,
strategic ally like Turkey?"</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma is sensitive for Washington. More than 50,000 Iraqi
Kurd fighters could help defeat the Iraqi president. But Washington's
relationship with the Kurds is angering Turkey, a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization partner with airbases and staging grounds for
U.S. forces. Turkey is pressuring the U.S. to make participation in
the war more palatable by reining in the Iraqi Kurds and by providing
economic aid to offset costs Turkey cannot afford.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army Gen. Tommy Franks met with Turkish military officials
this week to discuss what role their nation would play in an Iraq
invasion. The talks came as Turkish leaders expressed reluctance to
join a conflict that would destabilize the region and create more
economic turmoil. And they complained that Washington has sent mixed
messages about its intentions for war and has provided no plan for
the aftermath of any ouster of Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   The Turks want a clear signal from Washington that the Iraqi Kurds
will be held in check. Turkey already has 3,000 to 5,000 troops in
northern Iraq to contain the remnants of the Kurdistan Workers Party,
or PKK, rebel group that fled Turkey after a cease-fire in 1999. In
one possible scenario, these soldiers, along with thousands of
others, would seal off northern Iraq, preventing the escape of Iraqi
soldiers and allowing the Turks to crush any Kurdish move toward
independence.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi Kurds appear to sense the risks of declaring
independence too soon after a war. Members of their two main
political parties -- the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the
Kurdistan Democratic Party -- have been shuttling to Ankara, the
Turkish capital, in recent weeks in efforts to calm tensions. The
Kurds say they are only seeking an autonomous enclave in a postwar
Iraqi federation.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a federal structure to safeguard our people so that no
government in Iraq can conduct war or genocide against us," said
Safeen M. Dizayee of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. "We want to keep
Iraq unified.... So long as Kurds do not have the ambition of an
independent state, it should not bother our neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   But it does. Turkey worries that the Iraqi Kurds will claim
independence in the chaos of war. "That is the nightmare scenario,"
said Ilnur Cevik, editor of the Turkish Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds are this region's orphans. Nearly 22 million Kurds are
scattered across Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. They have longed for
an independent homeland, but language, political infighting and the
Middle East's existing borders have made it impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey fears that if Iraqi Kurds are granted too much autonomy or
independence, it will stoke similar aspirations among its own Kurdish
population. More than 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, were killed and
hundreds of villages were destroyed in Turkey's 15-year war with the
PKK. Iran also is worried that its 6 million Kurds will become
restive.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of granting Iraqi Kurds a special status could incite
unrest among ethnic populations across the region, said Hasan Koni, a
political science professor at Ankara University.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the Middle East, you are looking at a place of
ethnic tribes," Koni said. "If one tribe gets a federation, they'll
all want federations and this means a whole resettlement of the
Middle East will occur. If you give something to one ethnicity, you
have to give it to all. This is the danger."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government is also loath to accept an independent
Kurdistan carved out of Iraq that would include the oil-rich towns of
Mosul and Kirkuk, once part of the Turkish Ottoman empire and a
rallying cry for Turkish nationalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey will not tolerate the Kurds controlling the oil fields
because that will give them economic power, which will lead them to
independence," said Armagan Kuloglu, a retired Turkish general and
Middle East analyst. He is urging that Turkish forces push 200 miles
into northern Iraq to protect Kirkuk.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey doesn't like the idea of another war in its neighborhood.
Lost trade from economic sanctions against Iraq has cost Turkey
between $40 billion and $60 billion over the last decade. This nation
of 67 million has a 35% inflation rate and a $210-billion debt. The
economy will suffer further if war brings an estimated 350,000 Iraqi
refugees streaming toward Turkey, most of whom will be kept in camps
the Turkish military will control within Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "So," Kuloglu said, "Turkey has to have something from the U.S.
for taking part in this costly war."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Turkish officials are negotiating a $4-billion to
$6-billion military aid package for Ankara. Turkey is requesting more
U.S. investment. And it has asked for Washington's help in Turkey's
entry into the European Union and in securing low-interest loans from
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</TE>

<HD>New Police Chief Won't Be Wasting Any Time Taking Command
of LAPD</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh from a celebrity-studded going-away party in New York, William
J. Bratton jetted to Los Angeles on Thursday, was fitted for his LAPD
chief's uniform, and said he will quickly name three top aides to
oversee the department.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton will take the oath of office in a private ceremony at 8
a.m. today from City Clerk J. Michael Carey in Mayor James K. Hahn's
office. He will then hop into a helicopter with Hahn to fly to an
emergency management workshop in Lake Arrowhead.</LD>
<LD>   "I am certainly looking forward to the professional challenge. I
was anxious to get off the plane and get going," Bratton said
Thursday. "I need to get the team in place to make organizational
changes necessary to get us back in the crime game."</LD>
<TE>   Even before Bratton's official swearing in, Cmdr. Jim McDonnell --
a lifelong friend who, like his new boss, served in the Boston police
force -- had directed all 114 members of the Los Angeles Police
Department's command staff to submit resumes, photos and lists of
their top accomplishments, as well as written plans for the
department's future</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's first move, he said, beyond a public oath-taking on
Monday at the Police Academy and a slew of networking and protocol
events, will be to select three assistant chiefs, who will carry out
his vision for the department. The chief-designate stressed that he
has yet to make any final decisions on personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Since Hahn picked him, Bratton has relied on McDonnell and Cmdr.
Sharon Papa, whose friendship with the new chief dates back to the
early 1990s when both were respective chiefs of the transit police in
Los Angeles and New York.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to sit down and look at recommendations of who the
stars are and who are the nonperformers," said Bratton, who plans an
inventory of officers and assignments.</TE>
<TE>   The command structure Bratton is considering would be less
top-heavy, with more power devolved to those in the department's
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Out of respect for their decades of service, Bratton does not plan
to summarily remove several assistant and deputy chiefs appointed by
former Chief Bernard C. Parks, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are going to retire. Some will be asked to retire,"
Bratton said, adding that Civil Service rules limit his ability to
remove people immediately.</TE>

<HD>Bratton Is Planning a Clean Start</HD>
<DH>The police chief, who will be sworn in today, sees fighting
graffiti as key to reducing crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When William J. Bratton is sworn in today as the Los Angeles Police
Department's 54th chief, he inherits an agency accused in recent
years of corruption and brutality.</LD>
<LD>   Crime is up and arrests are down.</LD>
<LD>   Topping his list of priorities? Graffiti.</LD>
<TE>   Far from trivial, Bratton said, fighting graffiti is the key to
reducing crime overall and solving more serious offenses -- from drug
dealing to murder.</TE>
<TE>   It is so bad here that after touring the city, Bratton, former
head of the New York Police Department, called L.A.'s graffiti the
worst he's ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate it with a passion," he said of the painted blight that
scars walls, sidewalks, awnings, windows, mailboxes, signs, freeway
overpasses, even trees.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 million square feet of graffiti were painted over or
sandblasted in L.A. last year, more than New York City officials
cleaned up over four years at the height of their anti-graffiti
battle.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like he's proposing invading Russia in winter," said
Mike Davis, a UC Irvine history professor who once found the inside
of his mailbox tagged when he was living in Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton said fighting graffiti is key to the so-called broken
windows philosophy of policing that he plans to import to Los
Angeles. The idea is that eradication of petty crimes and unkempt
properties creates safer cities.</TE>
<TE>   The new chief's anti-graffiti push comes at a time when more is
being done to combat tagging in Los Angeles than ever. But will
Bratton -- strapped by budget constraints -- be able to wring
improvement without more money or personnel?</TE>
<TE>   On his side are a host of recent initiatives: A 2-year-old law
lowers the threshold for felony graffiti offenses from $5,000 in
damage to $400. The reward for graffiti tips that lead to convictions
was doubled to $1,000. Community-based groups are buying digital
cameras to record graffiti -- evidence for police and prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, graffiti fighters say they have lost ground in the war with
street vandals. Over the last 18 months, they say, tagging has gotten
worse -- even with money to remove graffiti at an all-time high and
felony graffiti arrests rising dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to go after graffiti," said Cara Gould, operations
director of Homeboy Industries, which holds a city contract for
graffiti abatement in some of the hardest hit East L.A.
neighborhoods. "We've seen kids die because of graffiti," Gould said.
"If one gang goes into another's neighborhood and writes graffiti, it
makes them mad and their impulse is to grab a gun and get even."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has written extensively about local politics and gangs,
acknowledged that L.A. has a graffiti problem. But he questions
whether, in a city with more territory and only a quarter of the
police officers of New York, a war on graffiti might do more harm
than good. Homicides are up, he said, well past 500 people so far
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine anything worse than declaring no tolerance of
graffiti in terms of mismanaging police manpower," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   To permit vandals and gang members to deface property is
"effectively surrendering the authority of government to them," he
said. "You cannot let them control your streets. If they're trying to
do it by marking the streets with graffiti, then get rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton sees himself as anti-graffiti's "chief cheerleader." He
said the city can be cleaned up with greater coordination, as well as
a change in attitude by citizens, police and prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   His approach would mark a shift in LAPD thinking. Even activists
who fight graffiti each day say they understand police have more
important work.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton said he wants "all officers to take cognizance of
graffiti and to make arrests when appropriate." He said he may create
a specialized division or two within the LAPD to combat graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's policy is a form of "social jujitsu," said Joel Garreau,
who wrote "Edge City: The New Frontier," a book about modern
communities. Graffiti is not about aesthetics, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the notion that you can demonstrate you are taking back the
streets," Garreau said. "It's looking for a place where you can have
some social impact quickly so it doesn't seem hopeless to the cops or
citizenry."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton may make headway by better coordinating the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is spending more money on graffiti abatement -- an
eleven-fold jump from a $500,000 pilot program in 1994 -- but police
and the district attorney's and city attorney's offices do not track
graffiti arrests or prosecutions. (The district attorney's office
calculated the number of prosecutions after a request by The Times.)</TE>
<TE>   There also is confusion over who is doing what.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's Web site touted its Graffiti Habitual Offender
Suppression Team in a news release last year. But LAPD public affairs
officers said recently that they were only vaguely aware of what it
was.</TE>
<TE>   And when Bratton first inquired about graffiti suppression this
month, none of his department tour guides knew about the San Fernando
Valley-based community tagger task force.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department headquarters, a
public relations officer said there is no centralized graffiti
command. He referred questions about enforcement to each of the 23
county stations.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Yglecias, who heads the district
attorney's community prosecution division, said the agency has "no
organized approach or method" for graffiti offenders. Yglecias
conceded that he still thinks of graffiti as a misdemeanor crime,
despite the passage in 2000 of a juvenile crime bill that made $400
in damage prosecutable as a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Felony prosecutions have grown from 67 adults and 160 juveniles in
1999 to 322 adults and 546 juveniles so far this year. About 150
people have been convicted of felony graffiti offenses this year.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, tens of millions of square feet of graffiti are
painted over each year.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'd like to see is not just the arrests increase," Bratton
said. "It's not going to do any good to make arrests if the courts
don't have a mechanism for punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Interrogating graffiti vandals, he said, will help authorities
solve other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   New York police officers are believers.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a decade of aggressively pursuing taggers in New York
-- the district attorney in Queens, for example, has a special team
-- NYPD officers say graffiti arrests have led to the clearance of
unsolved murders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to ask the right questions in the right way,'
said NYPD Sgt. Bernard Adams, a community supervisor in Queens.</TE>
<TE>   When taggers are arrested, Adams said, a special Vandal Squad
interviews the suspects. "Unless you know the lingo, these guys won't
even talk to you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said such efforts proved a "phenomenal way to gather
intelligence on the gangs in terms of who's using what handles. In
some respects, it's like the CIA trying to figure out what Osama bin
Laden is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Some doubt that what worked with graffiti in New York will have
the same effect in Los Angeles. There remain dramatic differences in
the size, shape and nature of the nation's two largest cities.</TE>
<TE>   New York City goes up. Los Angeles spreads out -- with seemingly
endless chances to spray paint at eye level -- from downtown walls to
the concrete expanse of the L.A. River.</TE>
<TE>   New York is a city with building superintendents living in many
neighborhoods -- part of the line of defense against vandals. Los
Angeles is known for disjointed communities where people may not know
their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, graffiti was unavoidable for both rich and poor. The
graffiti-covered subways carried millions of daily riders from all
walks of life. When the markings were eliminated, everybody noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the worst of the graffiti is concentrated in poor
neighborhoods west of downtown, in South Los Angeles and parts of the
city east of the L.A. River. Even if dramatic progress is made there,
many Angelenos may never see it.</TE>
<TE>   But those in the harder-hit areas say giving up is not an option.</TE>
<TE>   Sharyn Romano, who started the Hollywood Beautification Team a
decade ago, said, "Living with graffiti is oppressive." Residents are
afraid to clean it up themselves because they've been threatened, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She rejected the argument made by some critics of graffiti
abatement that painting graffiti over just creates a fresh canvas.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had crime for every day in this city for the past decade
too," Romano said. "Would anyone propose just getting rid of the
police because they've failed to get rid of crime?"</TE>
<TE>   In a stairwell at Hollywood High, her alma mater, Romano surveys
the hallways. Running her hand over a banister, she brushed over gang
symbols painted and scratched into the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to sand this down," she said, her jaw set with
determination.</TE>

<DH>The integration of disabled students in San Francisco
classes brings results and resentment. L.A. Unified must do so on a
much larger scale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Moji Duenas cannot read and may never learn to. Nor can the 18-year-old
walk or speak or feed herself. She is incontinent. Convulsions sometimes
rattle her body.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Moji is a high school student in the San Francisco Unified
School District, taking most of her classes with teens en route to
university. She is part of San Francisco's ambitious -- and sometimes
painful -- effort to integrate most disabled students into regular
classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco began its program eight years ago, making it one of
the first urban school systems in the nation to do so. The results
have profoundly affected the district, and offer insights for the Los
Angeles Unified School District, which is wrestling with a federal
consent decree requiring a similar transformation.</LD>
<TE>   Many parents and school officials say San Francisco's changes,
which now are implemented in half the public schools there, give
disabled children a chance to thrive. They have fewer limits placed
on them and have nondisabled children as behavior models. Even some
parents of regular students say their children are learning valuable
lessons in compassion and tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the transition has not been smooth. Some
teachers and administrators resent having to work with disabled
students. Special education teachers are scarce. A number of
handicapped youngsters find it difficult to fit into regular classes
-- sometimes they are neglected by teachers, or picked on by
schoolmates. And a growing segment of educators says the effort,
known as "inclusion," is proving to be more expensive than having
separate classrooms for the handicapped.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Unified, with its 7,100 special education students,
is much smaller than Los Angeles Unified, which has about 81,800,
more than half of whom already are mainstreamed for at least part of
the day. Los Angeles is under court order to integrate those
youngsters further and start desegregation of another 30,000 over the
next four years. Los Angeles is seeking to reduce the consent
decree's scope, and recently won a concession keeping 4,800
youngsters in separate, special schools.</TE>
<TE>   Both districts have money troubles and a large number of students
who are from poor families or are not fluent in English, or both.
Both districts have a daunting array of handicapped children, including
those with autism, emotional problems, learning disabilities, cerbral
palsy, paralysis, blindess and deafness.</TE>
<TE>   "We all -- whether we are general ed teachers or special ed --
share responsibility for educating all the children," said Deborah
McKnight, San Francisco's special education director.</TE>
<TE>   Even Moji, who was born with multiple severe disabilities,
including brain damage. Her case is testing the limits of inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Her teachers at George Washington High School, a 1920s-era campus
with views of the Golden Gate Bridge, said she has little hope of
ever being communicative, much less independent. Still, her mother,
Juno Duenas, insisted that Moji (whose given name is Marjorie) spend
most of her time in regular classes with a full-time special aide --
and also be given speech and physical therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Because of stress and a $12-an-hour wage, turnover for special
education aides is high. In a recent three-week period, Moji had
three different aides. The school reported one of them to the police
after students witnessed her beating Moji on the head.</TE>
<TE>   But Duenas said her daughter had similar problems when she was in
separate special education classes. Mainstreaming, Duenas said, is
more likely to improve Moji's communication and social skills.</TE>
<TE>   "As severely disabled as she is, Moji is in the first wave of
students being included. I know the risks involved," she said. "But
my daughter will not be the last one ... so the district and the
schools need to learn how to educate them."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the benefits for Moji, her presence clearly increased the
workload for her Washington High teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Moji's favorite class, Duenas said, was drama. Teacher John
Propster said he sometimes worked Moji into scenes by asking her
schoolmates to wheel her around the stage and recite lines for her.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent class on Shakespeare, he had his hands full with
several disruptive teens -- most of whom did not have disabilities.
"If anyone else talks I'm going to take points off!" he yelled. Moji
sat silently at the back of the stage for the entire period.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Principal Andrew W. Ishibashi respects the district's
policy regarding parents' wishes on inclusion where possible. But he
doesn't think it's realistic in the case of severely disabled
students like Moji.</TE>
<TE>   "She's mentally untrainable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy with that assessment, Duenas recently moved Moji to
another public high school in San Francisco, Wallenberg Traditional
High. She said her daughter's situation has improved.</TE>
<TE>   The special education teacher there holds monthly strategy
meetings with Duenas and Moji's other teachers. When other children
in art class are drawing faces, an assistant will help Moji draw a
circle and then help her place paper eyes, noses and lips.</TE>
<TE>   A more typical student is Tyronne Keith, 16, who has cerebral
palsy. A devoted wrestling fan, Tyronne often wears a T-shirt with a
picture of his favorite rumbler, Goldberg, and is greeted warmly
throughout the school. Despite a speech impediment, Tyronne has a
quick wit. When his special education aide was late one day, Tyronne
jokingly told him: "I'm firing you."</TE>
<TE>   Tyronne was in segregated programs in lower grades and still
spends most of his day in a special class because his mother,
Beatrice Keith, said he receives more attention there. He is
mainstreamed for some other classes, such as gym and drama.</TE>
<TE>   "With so many kids in the classroom, the [general education]
teacher can't take time out for two or three handicapped kids," Keith
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Joyce Chisholm, the now retired founder of San Francisco
Unified's inclusion program, predicts that more parents will place
their children in regular classrooms as much as possible. She calls
inclusion an "educational belief system."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco reformed its special education programs, in part, to
reduce the number of African American children who were unnecessarily
labeled as disabled. The hope was that mainstreaming would build
their academic and social skills.</TE>
<TE>   Chisholm tried to woo parents and educators with an aggressive
information campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The faculty at Alamo Elementary School, nationally recognized for
academic excellence, was among the most resistant. Located in the
Richmond Unified School District, Alamo was designated an inclusion
campus a decade ago. But it took eight years and the ouster of a
principal to get the school to begin integration in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Ferrante, who became principal two years ago, said some
parents and teachers described the placement of disabled children in
regular classes as a "dump and hope" program. But the more training
Ferrante offered, she said, the less trepidation teachers felt.
"People were resistant to special education because of fear of the
unknown," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Chisholm's plan included hiring innovative staff from as
far afield as Florida. Special education teachers are scarce. Of the
26,454 positions in California, a third are either open or are filled
by teachers without full credentials. In San Francisco, as many as
60% of special education teachers lack full credentials, according to
the district.</TE>
<TE>   Retaining those teachers is tough too. The jobs are demanding and
pay no more than teaching children without handicaps.</TE>
<TE>   Floating between classes, the best inclusion specialists are
teaching virtuosos who can supervise classroom assistants,
collaborate with regular teachers and tailor general education
subjects to several disabled students -- all on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kent Mitchell, head of San Francisco's teachers union: "The
difficulty of their task is inventing the airplane while they are in
the air."</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Lombardo cuts a nimble figure at Hoover Middle School,
striding up stairs and down hallways to spend time with a dozen
disabled children in nearly as many classes. It's hard to juggle so
many kids, Lombardo said, but dealing diplomatically with territorial
teachers can be even harder.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning at the Sunset District campus, Lombardo walked
into an eighth-grade math class in which an autistic student and
another student with a learning disability were mixed in with
nondisabled children. She found them struggling with math exercises,
and a chair was left empty next to each of them, evidently meant for
Lombardo. She was furious; to Lombardo it sent the message "that
special education children are my problem."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lee, the no-nonsense teacher of the math class, gave Lombardo
a gruff greeting.</TE>
<TE>   "How long will you be here?" he demanded. Lee was teaching
fractions, a hard subject that required his students to concentrate.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo bristled: "A few minutes -- you want my watch?"</TE>
<TE>   Lee supports inclusion in theory, he explained later, but he finds
it obtrusive in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "My classroom is like a ship, and I'm the captain," he said. "I've
got to time my class down to the second, and you're never sure when
the inclusion teacher is coming in. Sometimes I might be giving a
test, and the [special education] student is yelling and screaming."</TE>
<TE>   Collaboration between teachers fell by the wayside that day --
Lombardo spent all of her time explaining the lesson to the two
special education students while Lee worked with the rest of the
class.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion model is an outgrowth of the 1975 Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, which mandates that disabled children
receive "free, appropriate public education." The same law led most
school districts in the 1980s to create "special day classes" for
handicapped students. Increasingly, it is being interpreted to mean
that separate classes should be the last resort, and inclusion the
first.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Wong pulled her 7-year-old autistic son, Aaron, out of a
segregated special education class because "his behavior was going
negative," she said. Now he is in a regular second-grade class at
West Portal Elementary School in southwest San Francisco and doing
better.</TE>
<TE>   "Most autistic kids are visual learners, and they will do what
they see," Wong said. "I want him to see good models all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Like many autistic children, Aaron can be more physical
than verbal. So, special education teacher Tiffany Kendall recently read
to Aaron's class a book called "Tobin Learns to Make Friends," which
is about a train that shoves his way past other characters. Kendall
linked the story to Aaron, saying he "is a little different, but what
helps Aaron so much is that he has really good friends in this
classroom."</TE>
<TE>   A boy named Jonathan raised his hand and said he politely reminds
Aaron about school rules when the autistic boy pushes or cuts in
lines. Kendall applauded Jonathan and advised him: "And when Aaron
does not shove you, you can tell him, 'Thank you Aaron for not
pushing me.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Terri Bookwalter, an English teacher at Lowell High School on
San Francisco's west side, said the district places too much emphasis
on inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very stressful for special ed students," she said.
"The normal day can be highly distracting" for children with special
needs.</TE>
<TE>   Bookwalter speaks as a general education teacher who has taught
disabled students in regular classes -- and as a parent of a son with
Charge syndrome, a combination of birth defects that often includes
heart problems, hearing loss and stunted growth.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to threaten to take the district to court" to get her son
out of regular classes and into a separate special education class,
Bookwalter said. "And I'm a teacher."</TE>
<TE>   There her son stayed until he graduated and went off to college.</TE>
<TE>   Special education costs now account for about 13% of San Francisco
Unified's budget and about 10% of Los Angeles'. Of that, the federal
government provides less than one dollar in 10. Many special
education experts think the federal share should be four times as
high.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Los Angeles nor San Francisco Unified has done a cost
analysis for inclusion versus segregation.</TE>
<TE>   "On a gut level, we know the cost of special education has gone up
with inclusion," said Victor Milhoan, a San Francisco Unified budget
official.</TE>
<TE>   A study this year by Arun Ramanathan, a Harvard University
researcher, said San Francisco relies too heavily on
paraprofessionals, aides who push children's wheelchairs, tutor them
and help them in bathrooms. He said that the district should spread
those aides among several children at once -- especially when the
youngsters have relatively mild disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Ramanathan estimated that the district has increased spending on
special aides from $200,000 a year in 1994, the year integration
began, to about $5 million a year. That is equal to about 5% of the
district's total $88-million special education budget.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified would have to spend perhaps $50 million a year
to reach San Francisco's staffing level. L.A. Unified officials say
that is impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Other extra expenses for inclusion include more special computers
and other technology to help disabled children follow along in
classes, and to make campuses more accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled students who say San Francisco's schools are not
accessible enough have filed a class-action lawsuit against the
district. Broken sidewalks and "alpine gradient" wheelchair ramps
have left some children with bruises and broken bones, said Guy
Wallace, the lead attorney in the case. Elevators frequently break
down and many toilet stalls are too small for wheelchairs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Logan Hopper, an architectural consultant for the district, said
it is "too expensive to do accessibility for accessibility's sake."</TE>
<TE>   He wants comprehensive building projects instead of piecemeal
upgrades for special education. That way, Hopper said, "the schools
will be better for all children, not just special education
students."</TE>

<HD>Arthritis Found to Be Widespread</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Arthritis and other chronic joint problems are far more widespread
than estimated five years ago, affecting one-third of U.S. adults,
about 69.9 million people, the government said Thursday in the first
comprehensive survey of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials said the numbers -- and related health-care costs
-- are expected to continue to rise as the baby boom generation
reaches old age.</LD>
<LD>   The survey shocked even advocates for arthritis sufferers.</LD>
<TE>   "We just think that's alarming in terms of the number," said Tino
Mantella, president of the Arthritis Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers were 63% higher than a 1997 estimate that said about
20% of U.S. adults, or nearly 43 million people, had arthritis and
other chronic joint problems.</TE>
<TE>   The survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention here reflects, in part, a real increase in arthritis,
connected to baby boomers aging. But it also reflects a more thorough
survey, the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   Previous estimates were much lower because many people do not tell
doctors about their joint pain, and others do not consider their
aches and pains to be arthritis, officials said. The latest survey
asked more penetrating questions.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 212,000 people from all 50 states were interviewed by
telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people with chronic joint symptoms who don't see a
doctor," said Dr. Chad Helmick of the CDC's arthritis program. The
latest survey "is a better way of capturing people who have always
been out there with arthritis or different symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   The arthritis level ranged from 17.8% of adults in Hawaii to 42.6%
of adults in West Virginia. States in the central and northwestern
parts of the country had the highest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, arthritis patients cost the country about $80 billion
in medical care costs and lost time from work, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   People can reduce their risk of arthritis through exercise, weight
management and a healthy diet.</TE>

<KH>ARRESTS IN SNIPER CASE</KH>
<HD>Alabama Officials Also Hoping Homicide Solved</HD>
<DH>A phone caller takes credit for shootings in state's
capital and the Washington spree. His tip leads to the arrest of two
suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Officials said Thursday they believe that at least one of the two
people arrested in the Washington, D.C.-area sniper case was involved
in a liquor store shooting here in September that left an employee
dead and another gravely injured.</LD>
<LD>   "We still have a case to prove. I'm very optimistic," police Chief
John Wilson told reporters during a briefing outside the liquor
store. "I think we've got a lot to work with here."</LD>
<LD>   Asked later whether he deemed the pair taken into custody in
Maryland early Thursday morning as the main suspects in the Sept. 21
liquor store shooting, Wilson said: "I do. I feel very confident
about it."</LD>
<TE>   Wilson declined to go into detail on the links between the two
cases, saying that federal charges against 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo
remained under seal following his arraignment in a federal court in
Baltimore. The man arrested with Malvo, 41-year-old John Allen
Muhammad, faced a federal firearm charge stemming from a 2000 court
order in Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson declined to comment on reports that Malvo's fingerprints
were found at the state-run liquor store after the shooting.
Montgomery Mayor Bobby Bright said during an interview earlier in the
day that fingerprints were recovered from a firearm publication found
in the parking lot near where the women fell.</TE>
<TE>   During the late-afternoon briefing, Bright told reporters that
evidence from the liquor store case "could very well" prove to be the
critical link in leading investigators to Muhammad and Malvo, who
were arrested as they slept in a car at a highway rest stop in
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators assigned to the sniper case became interested in the
month-old liquor-store assault Sunday after receiving a telephone
call from someone suggesting he was involved in the sniper shootings.
In an apparent bid to be taken seriously, the police chief said, the
caller also mentioned having been involved in the Alabama assault,
going as far as to cite details about the crime, such as the name of
a nearby street, Ann Street.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the sniper task force contacted Montgomery police,
confirmed that the incident had occurred and asked for evidence
gathered by Wilson's investigators. Wilson declined to specify what
evidence was handed over from the liquor store shooting, which took
place more than a week before the Washington-area sniper attacks
began.</TE>
<TE>   In the Montgomery incident, a gunman approached the store
employees as they closed for the evening and opened fire. One
longtime employee, 52-year-old Claudine Parker, died. Kellie Adams,
24, was seriously injured. Two police officers on patrol nearby heard
the shots. When they came upon the scene in front of ABC Beverages,
the suspected gunman was standing over the two women, rifling through
a purse, before he saw the police and ran.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers gave chase over a 20-foot-wide concrete ditch,
around cars and through fast-food restaurant parking lots along the
commercial strip next to Interstate 85. At one point, Wilson said,
the officer came within two feet of capturing the suspect but lost
him after being cut off by a car.</TE>
<TE>   Following news of a possible connection to the subsequent sniper
shootings, the officer was "heartsick," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery investigators posted a composite drawing of the gunman
and issued press releases on the case in hopes of generating leads.
The police chief characterized the liquor store investigation as a
"very hot case" even before the latest development, though he
declined to specify what evidence his detectives were able to gather
before they were contacted by federal investigators from the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms this week.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he thought the composite drawing, which was created
largely from the recollection of the police officer who gave chase,
bore "very good similarities" to photographs of Malvo shown on
television Thursday. Wilson said the weapon used in the liquor store
assault was not the one used in the sniper shootings.</TE>
<TE>   He said there seemed to be little to explain any connection
between the Washington, D.C., suspects and Montgomery. The men did
not seem to have ties to the city, he said, and may have been passing
through.</TE>
<TE>   News of a possible link to the sniper cases sent an added chill
through Montgomery, a state capital of just more than 200,000 that
many residents describe as having a small-town feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from the liquor store, at the Down the Street
Cafe, the lunch crowd ordered up the country-fried steak special and
watched the latest news bulletins flashing on two television screens.</TE>
<TE>   Kindergarten teacher Carole Hancock said one of her four children,
a daughter, had stopped at an automated teller machine near the
liquor store on the night of the shooting and heard the gunfire. A
son passed by on his way to McDonald's around the same time. Both
children saw the shooting victims on the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   The possible link to the sniper case "shows that anybody in the
United States could be affected by this," said her husband, Rusty
Hancock, a self-employed furniture salesman. "That's what's
frightening."</TE>
<TE>   At Brewster's, a wine and beer shop next to the liquor store,
owner Donna Weathers did her best to put up with a visiting army of
reporters. She smiled tightly, granted some interviews and turned
down others, allowing quietly that she'd be glad when the satellite
trucks went home. Weathers had been in her shop with a friend on the
night of the shooting and hid in the bathroom after seeing the
victims on the ground. She trembled as she recounted the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I never, ever, ever in a million years have thought that this
would have anything to do with snipers," she said.</TE>

<HD>Osteoporosis Drug May Be Safe Alternative to Estrogen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A compound that works like estrogen, but with none of the side
effects, has been found to prevent brittle bone disease in mice. The
discovery may offer an alternative for women who stopped hormone
replacement therapy because of the risks of cancer and heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   In a study appearing today in the journal Science, researchers say
experiments with the compound estren increased bone density and
strength in mice that had been surgically altered to mimic menopause.
The scientists said they found none of the dangerous side effects
linked to estrogen.</LD>
<LD>   "This seems to be superior to estrogen in its effect on the bone,
but it has no effect on the sex organs," said Dr. Stavros C.
Manolagas, a researcher at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences and the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, and the
senior author of the study.</LD>
<TE>   Experts on osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease, said that if
estren is found to work as well in humans it could substitute for
hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, that has been used to maintain
bone health in women after menopause.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 20 million American women were regularly taking
hormone supplements to treat post-menopausal symptoms such as hot
flashes and thinning bones. But in July, federal scientists abruptly
ended a study of the combination of estrogen and progestin after
finding evidence that long-term use increased the risk of breast
cancer, strokes and heart attacks. Sales of various formulations of
HRT have dropped 15% to 40% since then.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion Thursday of a two-day meeting at the National
Institutes of Health, officials urged that women not use HRT on a
long-term basis.</TE>
<TE>   NIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni said the therapy should not be
used to prevent chronic diseases because it has more risks than
benefits, but HRT may still be used by some women for relief of
menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a simple, single answer for all women," Zerhouni
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jill L. Carrington of the National Institute on Aging, part of the
NIH, said in an interview that Manolagas' research is important
because he has demonstrated that there are compounds that can safely
replace estrogen hormone therapy for treating the loss of bone
density.</TE>
<TE>   "This opens up a new direction for how to treat osteoporosis with
drugs that can be designed to take advantage of the best effect of
estrogen without adding some of the harmful effects," Carrington
said. "It also opens up the possibility of finding new avenues of
treatment of men with osteoporosis."</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials estimate that 10 million people have been
diagnosed with osteoporosis and another 34 million -- 55% of those
older than 50 -- are at high risk of the disorder. Eighty percent of
osteoporosis patients are women.</TE>
<TE>   As people age and the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone
decline, bones can become porous and brittle. Eventually, an ordinary
bump or strain can cause bone fractures, particularly in the spine
and hip. Officials estimate there are about 1.5 million fractures
annually among osteoporosis patients, leading to medical costs of
about $17 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, Manolagas and his colleagues screened a number of
compounds to find one, which they called estren, that activated the
bone-building action of estrogen without affecting cells in the sex
organs or breasts.</TE>
<TE>   They then tested the compound in an experiment using mice whose
ovaries and testicles had been removed. This surgery mimics menopause
in the females and prevents the male animals from making sex hormones
that maintain bone density.</TE>
<TE>   Manolagas said surgically altered mice that got no drugs lost 6%
bone density and 23% of the strength in the leg bones after six
weeks. The mice receiving estren, however, had a 4% increase in bone
density and a 12% increase in bone strength.</TE>

<LD>The son of a rabbi charged with arranging his wife's killing
testified that his parents had a serious argument that included talk
of divorce two nights before she was slain.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Neulander also said he was stunned at the lack of emotion
exhibited by his father, Rabbi Fred Neulander, the night of Nov. 1,
1994, after Carol Neulander was bludgeoned to death in their Cherry
Hill home.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came in the retrial of Fred Neulander in Monmouth
County. Last year, a jury deadlocked.</LD>
<TE>   The prosecution contends that Fred Neulander paid two men to have
his wife killed. The defense claims that the two men, who have
pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter, are lying about the
rabbi's involvement.</TE>

<LD>   The court unanimously turned down two death row inmates who had

<LD>A proposal to abolish sales taxes on food and medicine doesn't
deceive voters and can stay on the Nov. 5 ballot, the state Supreme
Court decided.</LD>
<LD>   Polls show widespread support for the initiative, which backers
say would eliminate an unfair levy that falls hardest on the poor.
Officials say the measure would hurt residents through loss of
services, and they argued that its wording disguised its effect on
public coffers.</LD>

<HD>Bush Tries to Rouse Southern Voters</HD>
<DH>With president in the forefront, and election day nearing,
GOP tries to keep slight leads in congressional races by emphasizing
turnout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AUBURN, Ala. -- President Bush campaigned frenetically across the
South on Thursday, working to cement the GOP's slight edge in races
critical to Republican hopes of controlling both chambers of
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Bush has been central to the GOP's nationwide
strategy, raising a record amount of money to support Republican
candidates. But with less than two weeks to go before election day,
the president shifted his focus from fund-raising to encouraging the
party faithful to turn out the vote.</LD>
<LD>   "What I hope you do, and I think you're going to do, is go to your
coffee shops and your places of worship and your community centers
and remind people that in America they have a duty to vote," Bush
told a boisterous rally in Charlotte, N.C. "We expect you to vote. We
expect you to do your duty."</LD>
<TE>   The president focused first on two Senate seats being vacated by
Republican stalwarts Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina. The GOP almost assuredly needs to retain both
seats if it is to regain a majority in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a former Cabinet secretary and briefly a
2000 presidential contender, is the Republican candidate hoping to
succeed Helms. Recent polls suggest she has a slight lead over
Democrat Erskine Bowles, former chief of staff to President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina, the GOP candidate is Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, a
House prosecution manager in the impeachment case against Clinton.
Polls show him leading Democrat Alex Sanders, but the former
president of the College of Charleston remains within striking
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the outcome of both races may hinge on turnout --
such as whether the Democrats can spark an outpouring of African
American voters to overcome the GOP's strong base among Southern
whites.</TE>
<TE>   After his appearances in Charlotte and Columbia, S.C., Bush flew
to Alabama to help the Republican cause in two key tossup races: the
governorship and a newly created House seat.</TE>
<TE>   GOP candidate Bob Riley is hoping to unseat Democratic Gov. Donald
Siegelman. Recent polls suggest the two are in a dead heat, with
Riley perhaps holding a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Republican Mike Rogers and Democrat Joe Turnham appear
to be neck-and-neck for an open House seat in Alabama's 3rd District.
The GOP is defending a six-seat advantage in the House, and losing
the Alabama district would hurt the party's cause.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appeared on the stage at Plainsman Park at Auburn University
with Riley and Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of reasons to be for these two," the president
said. "But a really good reason is that they both married well. Like
me, they married above themselves."</TE>
<TE>   In weeks of nearly daily politicking on behalf of GOP candidates,
Bush has honed his stump speech down to a couple of key themes, which
he delivers with few changes at nearly every campaign appearance.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, his speeches on Thursday first dealt with the policy
area where he is seen as weakest: the economy. He avoided mention of
the most specific economic problems, focusing instead on the sweeping
tax cut he pushed through Congress last year, touting it as an
economic stimulus.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to invigorate a sluggish economy, the best way to
make sure that people are able to find work, is to let people keep
more of their own money," Bush said in his Charlotte speech.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year tax cut, he said, will funnel billion of dollars back
to the public "so you can decide what to do with it, so you can help
invigorate the economy by just doing what you normally do, which is
demand a good or a service."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Bush appeared to most relish the second half of his
stump speech, in which he addresses last year's terrorist attacks and
defends his tough new policy toward Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to understand there's an enemy out there that
hates America because of what we love," Bush told the rally in
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "We love every aspect of our freedom, and we're not changing.
We're not backing down, and the enemy can't stand that."</TE>
<TE>   "No longer can we assume oceans will protect us. As a matter of
fact, quite the contrary," he said in Charlotte. "We must assume that
the enemy is coming, and we've got to do everything we can to protect
the homeland. That's why I started talking about the issue of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also generally uses the same jokes as he hopscotches the
country. The joke about marriage is a perennial, but it seemed to go
somewhat astray as he campaigned for Dole, wife of former Sen. Bob
Dole (R-Kan.), the GOP's 1996 presidential nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "She married well and so did I," Bush started out. Then, targeting
her husband, said, "The truth of the matter is, Sen. Dole -- the male
Sen. Dole -- and I married above ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Administration Puts Fiscal Year Deficit at $159 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government ran a $159-billion deficit in the fiscal year just
ended, the Bush administration said Thursday, punctuating one of the
federal budget's worst nose-dives just 12 days before elections for
control of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The figure was not a surprise and largely reflected an ongoing dip
in federal revenue collections. But it was nonetheless noteworthy for
its contrast with the $127-billion surplus -- the second largest ever
-- shown by the government's books a year before.</LD>
<LD>   Though Democrats hope the budget's deterioration will help them in
the midterm elections, many analysts and officials from both parties
believe the return of deficits after four straight years of surpluses
will have a minimal political impact. That is because the public
seems more focused on the flagging economy and the threat of
terrorism and blames those issues -- not politicians -- for the
revived red ink.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important, but nobody's paying attention," said Robert D.
Reischauer, president of the nonpartisan Urban Institute and former
director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, White House Budget Director Mitchell E.
Daniels Jr. blamed the red ink on needed defense and domestic
security expenditures, and the end of a federal revenue surge fed by
the booming economy of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Given these two developments, it is absolutely essential that we
set aside business as usual and keep tight control over all other
spending," he added, repeating a demand the administration has often
made of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the flat economy, stock
market drop and costs of responding to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
"created a deficit. But going forward, I am confident that we are on
the road to recovery and stability."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats tried to blame the fiscal turnabout on Republicans in
hopes of enhancing their chances of capturing House control and
strengthening their hold on the Senate in the Nov. 5 elections. They
have long blamed the budget's decline -- especially in the long-term
-- on the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut that President Bush won
from Congress last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans are responsible for the biggest fiscal reversal in
history," said Thomas Kahn, Democratic staff director of the House
Budget Committee. "The $5.6-trillion surplus has vanished."</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, the CBO projected that surpluses would total $5.6
trillion in the decade from 2002 to 2011, an unprecedented bundle of
federal cash.</TE>
<TE>   But with the recession, the costs of terrorism and the tax cut,
the budget office estimated in August that the surplus for that same
period would be $336 billion. Both the White House and the CBO say
they expect annual deficits to continue for the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts say those projections are optimistic because they
assume that future federal spending will grow by only about the rate
of inflation, when in fact it has grown much faster than that in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also argued the shortfall would look even larger were it
not for last year's Social Security surplus, which was about $160
billion.</TE>
<TE>   This year's shortfall is expected to have a minimal effect on the
country's $11-trillion economy. But if deficits persist, they could
constrict policymakers' abilities to boost spending for priorities
like defense and schools or to cut taxes further, ensuring years of
partisan budget warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials had been predicting for nearly a year
that the government would be back in the red in fiscal 2002 after
running surpluses every year since 1998. Many analysts saw that as an
effort to get the bad news out early and gradually, rather than
dumping it out all at once just before election day.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides had been told to expect the deficit figure to
be released today. White House officials instead provided the number
a day early.</TE>

<HD>The 'Duck in a Noose' Fable Explained</HD>
<DH>Cryptic message refers to a Cherokee Indian story about an
arrogant rabbit, his elusive prey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The last cryptic message from Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief
Charles A. Moose to the Washington-area sniper referred to a Cherokee
Indian story about an arrogant rabbit that was duped by the duck he
tried to catch.</LD>
<LD>   "You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things.
You've asked us to say, 'We have caught the sniper like a duck in a
noose.'</LD>
<LD>   "We understand that hearing us say this is important to you,"
Moose said late Wednesday at a televised news briefing, called so
authorities could release information on two people sought for
questioning in the 13 sniper shootings.</LD>
<TE>   The ancient story has been passed down through generations of
Cherokees.</TE>
<TE>   In it, a rabbit brags that he can catch a duck. He throws a noose
over the neck of a duck, but it flies away with the rabbit hanging
on.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the rabbit must let go, landing in a hollow tree stump.
The conceited animal has to eat his own fur for food and is
embarrassed by his appearance when he finally escapes.</TE>
<TE>   "His boastfulness got him in trouble and eventually destroyed
him," said Tera Shows, spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation, based in
Tahlequah, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   "The rabbit is a trickster that always gets himself in trouble by
his own devices," Chad Smith, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the person who killed 10 people and wounded three
others around the Washington area during the last three weeks may be
less duck than rabbit, Shows said.</TE>
<TE>   John Allen Muhammad, 41, and Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, were arrested
Thursday morning for questioning in connection with the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "It does look like [the sniper] maybe is the rabbit," Shows said.</TE>

<HD>FBI Warns of Transportation System Attacks</HD>
<DH>Al Qaeda prisoners say bridges and train routes may be
targeted. Security is increased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI issued a warning Thursday to state and local law enforcement
officials nationwide about a possible attack soon against
transportation systems, particularly railroads.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the warning, based on information obtained from Al
Qaeda prisoners, suggested that terrorists may try to take out
bridges, key sections of tracks or train locomotives in an effort to
cause derailments and widespread damage.</LD>
<LD>   "Information from debriefings of Al Qaeda detainees as of
mid-October indicates that the group has considered directly
targeting U.S. passenger trains, possibly using operatives who have a
Western appearance," the FBI said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Intelligence officials continue to believe that the terrorist
organization plans to attack targets that would be readily recognized
as representing U.S. economic interests, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Seized Al Qaeda photographs of locomotives, railcars and railroad
crossings have increased concern about the threat, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David Gunn said federal transportation officials
notified him about the warning. "The threat, like a lot of others, is
not specific," Gunn said. "It's not targeted at anything per se."</TE>
<TE>   Gunn said the passenger railroad is taking steps to enhance
security and passenger safety, but declined to describe the measures
except to say they will not be evident to riders.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak has increased patrols and freight railroads have tightened
security, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Around the anniversary of last year's terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Amtrak announced it intended to
enforce tighter identification requirements, including random
identification checks of passengers on trains. But the carrier
decided to reconsider that plan and never implemented it.</TE>
<TE>   Edward R. Hamberger, president of the Assn. of American Railroads,
said the nation's rail system won't be a soft target. Since the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks, railroads developed a security plan that includes
a round-the-clock operations center linking railroad control centers
with law enforcement agencies and increased surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Homeland Security was contacting key state and local
officials to urge their help and vigilance in warding off any such
attack, spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people should still ride our nation's rails and know
that this warning has been provided to state and local law
enforcement, and the appropriate security officials, so they can take
the appropriate steps to increase protective measures," Johndroe
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are threats and those out there who are looking to do us
harm here in the United States," New York Gov. George Pataki said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge did not identify any
specific target in New York. Even so, Pataki said, New York has "put
out an advisory across the state to make sure that the public is
vigilant and we are vigilant in protecting public services and
infrastructure points across this state."</TE>

<HD>Detroit Judge Denies Bail for Terror Suspect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A judge denied bail Thursday for the co-founder of an Islamic charity
that is suspected of funneling money to Al Qaeda, saying the
defendant is probably "a danger to the security of the United
States."</LD>
<LD>   Even if Rabih Haddad is not a threat, he might flee the country,
Immigration Judge Robert Newberry added.</LD>
<LD>   Haddad's attorney, Ashraf Nubani, said he will appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Haddad has been jailed since Dec. 14 on a visa violation. The Ann
Arbor, Mich., resident and Lebanese citizen helped create the Global
Relief Foundation, which the U.S. government has accused of providing
money to the terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Haddad, 42, and his group have denied any involvement in
terrorism, and neither he nor Global Relief has been charged with a
terrorism-related crime.</TE>
<TE>   Haddad is seeking political asylum in the United States to avoid
deportation for himself and his family. The judge has said he expects
to make a ruling on the asylum request within a couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During Haddad's two-day bail hearing, his attorneys argued that
the government failed to show that Haddad is a threat to national
security or is connected to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration and Naturalization Service attorney Marsha Nettles
argued that Haddad might flee, in part because his wife's family owns
homes in other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the Bush administration urged a federal appeals
court to reconsider opening Haddad's deportation hearings to the
public. The government said terrorists might gain information that
could threaten U.S. security.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Lorraine Hale, who headed the world famous Hale House shelter founded
by her mother, was sentenced Thursday along with her husband to five
years' probation for stealing from the charity.</LD>
<LD>   The sentences for Hale, 76, and Jesse DeVore, 70, were part of a
deal in which they pleaded guilty to reduced charges and promised to
give back as much as they could of the $766,000 they were accused of
embezzling.</LD>
<LD>   Hale's lawyer, William Dowling, said the couple had returned about
$125,000 to Hale House, everything they had.</LD>
<TE>   "They are destitute," Dowling said, "They have no assets at all."</TE>
<TE>   Hale and DeVore could have gotten 15 years in prison if convicted
of all 72 charges.</TE>
<TE>   Hale House was created 30 years ago by Clara "Mother" Hale amid
Harlem's meanest streets as a refuge for the sick and abandoned
babies of drug addicts and AIDS sufferers.</TE>
<TE>   The charity attracted the support of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   After her mother's death in 1992, Lorraine Hale became executive
director. DeVore was public relations director.</TE>
<TE>   After they were accused of pocketing donations and other money,
Lorraine Hale was removed from the charity in 2001. A board of
directors chaired by a former federal prosecutor now runs Hale House.</TE>

<HD>New Efforts Needed to Prevent Terrorism, Panel Says</HD>
<DH>Report by bipartisan task force urges better security at
U.S. ports, roads and railways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Enormous logistical challenges and widespread complacency have
stalled homeland security efforts, leaving the U.S. "dangerously
unprepared to prevent and respond" to another terrorist attack, an
independent task force warns in a new report.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Bush administration's preparations for war against Iraq
only increase the likelihood of an attack against Americans involving
weapons of mass destruction, according to the 17-member bipartisan
group, which includes two Nobel laureates, two former secretaries of
State and two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</LD>
<LD>   "If our foreign policy requires that action be taken against Iraq,
we have to be prepared for retaliation," said former Sen. Warren B.
Rudman, co-chairman of the task force, which was sponsored by the
nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations.</LD>
<TE>   The group's report, to be released today, recommends immediate
action to better secure the nation's ports, roads and railways.
Although intensive security measures have been implemented at
airports since last year's terrorist attacks, "a weapon of mass
destruction could well be hidden" in shipping containers, trucks and
trains, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials also must redouble their efforts to prepare
police, fire and emergency medical personnel to respond to a
bioterrorist attack and to better link local, state and federal
authorities, the report says. In addition, it says National Guard
units should be trained and deployed to impose civil order in the
aftermath of such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   While the creation of a Department of Homeland Security has
stalled over disagreements between President Bush and Democratic
leaders in Congress, task force members were careful to avoid
assessing blame for what they consider a dangerous lack of progress
in homeland security efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a serious lack of urgency about moving on homeland
security in some areas that do not require legislation," former Sen.
Gary Hart, the task force's other co-chairman, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Rudman also called on governors, mayors and other local officials
to get more involved in homeland security efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, a Democrat from Colorado, and Rudman, a New Hampshire
Republican, have been calling for similar actions since months before
terrorist hijackers flew commercial airliners into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon and crashed in a Pennsylvania field Sept. 11,
2001, killing about 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier commission led by the two former senators warned in
January 2001 that the nation was vulnerable to a terrorist attack. It
recommended then that the federal government be reorganized around a
homeland security mission.</TE>
<TE>   Now that both the White House and Congress have adopted many of
their proposals, Hart and Rudman clearly are frustrated -- and
concerned -- by the lack of progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we need in this country," Rudman said in an
interview. "It's not a question of if" there will be another, even
more deadly terrorist attack against the United States. "It's a
question of when."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, particularly in the middle of the country, "people think of
this as an East Coast / West Coast problem," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The report decries "signs that Americans are lapsing back into
complacency."</TE>
<TE>   Overcoming such complacency will require more than increased
federal funding, intensive training and improved coordination among
federal, state and local governments, Hart and Rudman said Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Montgomery County, Md., where six of the slayings took place,
would be the logical venue for trying John Allen Muhammad, 41, and
Lee Boyd Malvo, 17.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be fair to assume that we would have every intention of
seeking the death penalty," county prosecutor Douglas Gansler said
before the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   But in May, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening imposed a moratorium
on capital punishment over concerns of racial bias. The two suspects
in the sniper shootings are black.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors in Baltimore said they would hold
Muhammad and Malvo on federal weapon charges, leading to speculation
that federal authorities will take over the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I am certain the U.S. attorney here is anxious to try them, and
capital punishment would not be an issue in the federal system," said
Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland in
Baltimore. "The families will be upset about a prosecution where the
death penalty is in doubt. They will insist on it. And the federal
courthouse is usually a better, more secure place to try a big case
like this."</TE>
<TE>   But it is not clear that the string of killings amounts to a
federal crime.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy J. McVeigh was tried, convicted and sentenced to death in
the federal courts because his bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City killed dozens of federal workers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Greenberger said he believed the two suspects could be
charged with an act of domestic terrorism under the USA Patriot Act
passed last year.</TE>
<TE>   It refers to crimes where "the intent is to intimidate the
civilian population," he said. "That seems to be what was going on
here. These two guys paralyzed the nation's capital area, and if they
had gotten away with it, it was the perfect terrorist crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Compare this to the anthrax scare. Everybody agrees that if
somebody had been caught for that crime, they would be charged with a
terrorism crime."</TE>
<TE>   But others disagree and say ordinary slayings of civilians do not
make for a federal crime.</TE>
<TE>   "A serial killer is not a terrorist, even if the crimes are pretty
terrifying," George Washington University law professor Stephen
Saltzburg said. "I don't see this leading to a federal charge."</TE>
<TE>   Both Maryland and the U.S. government exempt those who are under
age 18 from their capital punishment laws. That eliminates the
possibility of a death penalty charge in Maryland against Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the sniper killings took place in Virginia, and
prosecutors in the three separate counties could file murder charges
that would lead to death sentences against both men.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1976, when capital punishment was reinstated, Virginia has
executed 86 people, second only to Texas. By comparison, Maryland has
carried out only three executions.</TE>
<TE>   And Virginia is one of the few states that continues to bring
capital charges against murderers who are 17.</TE>
<TE>   Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert said he would seek the
death penalty for the Oct. 9 killing of a man at a Manassas gas
station.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to try him as soon as we could, but as a general rule,
the state with the possession of the defendant takes jurisdiction
first," Ebert told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo's age could emerge as a significant and divisive issue, some
defense lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be amazing if they [prosecutors] went shopping around
for a state that kills kids," said David Bruck, a capital defense
lawyer in Columbia, S.C. On Monday, four justices of the Supreme
Court -- one short of a majority -- said they were ready to abolish
capital punishment for those under age 18.</TE>
<TE>   "The practice of executing such [juvenile] offenders is a relic of
the past," wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. "We should put an end to
this shameful practice."</TE>
<TE>   May Spur Prosecutions</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some experts said the sniper crimes could spur a move
for multiple prosecutions geared to winning death sentences for both
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have a full trial and a conviction in Maryland, and
then they will be extradited to Virginia and tried there too,"
Saltzburg said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy bars a second
trial for the same crime, it does not prohibit multiple trials for
defendants who have committed multiple murders.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Maryland will be the center of the legal action at the
start, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tremendous feeling here that Maryland should go first.
The murders started here and ended here," Greenberger said.</TE>

<HD>A Polite Boy, an Angry Mentor</HD>
<DH>John Allen Muhammad is a 'natural born leader,' Lee Boyd
Malvo an insatiable learner. And they are suspected of causing weeks
of terror.</DH>

<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>TACOMA, Wash. -- They were unlikely companions.</LD>
<LD>   From one corner of America to another, John Allen Muhammad has
lived his 41 years by his own rules.</LD>
<LD>   In the Army in Louisiana, where he was a B-student sharpshooter
and went by his given name John Williams, he was twice
court-martialed in the 1980s for disobeying orders and punching out a
fellow sergeant.</LD>
<TE>   As John Allen Muhammad, a converted black Muslim, he violated a
court order in Washington state in the 1990s, terrorizing his wife,
kidnapping his three young children and holing up on the floor of a
Christian chapel in a homeless mission.</TE>
<TE>   And in recent weeks, police now suspect, he lived out of his car
with a 17-year-old Jamaican he variously called his son or stepson,
picking off victims at random with a Bushmaster high-velocity rifle.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager -- there is no record of any family relationship to
Muhammad -- had lived most of his 17 years by the rules of others.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Lee Boyd Malvo to a teenage mother and a 39-year-old
mason in the heart of a virtual war zone -- the Jubilee Hospital in
downtown Kingston, Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up amid the brutal drug wars, record murder rates and
wrenching poverty that endures on the Caribbean Island nation, but
not without deep Jamaican family values -- an abiding and polite
respect with which he greeted any elder "yes, ma'am" or "yes, sir."
He had no police record.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Malvo and his mother, Una James, left it all
behind for a better future. Illegally, they landed on the Florida
shores, smuggled in on a cargo ship.</TE>
<TE>   They migrated to Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   In search of a future, they found John Allen Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Muhammad would take the boy with him to that homeless
mission in Bellingham, Wash., a town near the Canadian border that
one resident describes as "a mecca for people who want to be as far
away as possible from wherever they are from."</TE>
<TE>   Malvo would enroll in the local high school, where he proved to be
an insatiable learner who knew more about U.S. history than his
teacher, classmates recalled. But it wouldn't last; immigration
authorities caught up with him, yanked him from school and detained
him for three months until last February.</TE>
<TE>   It was after his release, and after a cross-country odyssey that
apparently included stays in Baton Rouge, La., and Montgomery, Ala.,
that Malvo and Muhammad found themselves Thursday in a beat-up Chevy
Caprice, surrounded by police officers in the early morning darkness
near Frederick, Md., suspected of being random snipers who have
terrorized Washington, D.C., and environs since Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   That is the picture that emerges from hundreds of pages of court
records and interviews with dozens of state, U.S. and Jamaican
government officials, and friends and relatives of both men.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was born in Louisiana and raised in Baton Rouge, where he
grew up with a cousin, Edward Holiday. Holiday, 38, said Thursday
that Muhammad's mother died when he was young and he was raised by
two aunts, both schoolteachers, and his grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   He has two brothers and two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "He was real happy-go-lucky," Holiday recalled. "We built
go-carts, and we rode them in the park. We'd fix up bikes and ride
them in the neighborhood. We were like brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the protector of the neighborhood," he added. "He would
stand up for anybody. All the kids looked up to him. He was our
hero."</TE>
<TE>   In high school Muhammad played football, tennis and ran track.</TE>
<TE>   Once when Holiday wanted to take a girl on a date, but had no good
shoes or car, Muhammad lent him a pair of shoes and his black '78
Olds Cutlass Supreme.</TE>
<TE>   As a soldier, Sgt. Williams never ranked high among America's
fighting men. He enlisted in the Louisiana National Guard in August
1978, launching a checkered, 16-year military career that would earn
routine ribbons from a stint as an engineer in the Persian Gulf War,
two courts-martial and marksmanship skills that ranked below expert.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Miranda, his commanding officer in the National Guard,
recalled him as distinctly "middle-of-the-road."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very nice guy, liked by all the men," Miranda said. "He
was like tall, athletic, with a million-dollar smile. He was, I would
say, a natural born leader.... But he did have his flashes of anger."</TE>
<TE>   Those occasional rages, which Miranda attributed to marital
problems that have plagued Muhammad throughout his adult life, led to
two convictions for minor infractions of the military code.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982 he was found guilty of failing to report for duty and
disobeying his commanders' orders. He went AWOL for three drills, and
ultimately was fined $100 and busted one rank. A year later, he
slugged a sergeant above the eye.</TE>
<TE>   But he learned welding, combat engineering and metal working,
giving him the skills he would later use to set up shop as an auto
and truck mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   His final ranking as a marksman was sharpshooter, one notch below
expert.</TE>
<TE>   Military records released Thursday by the Pentagon did not specify
the reasons for his discharge in April 1994. But, after a military
tour that included postings at five military bases from Fort Ord,
Calif., to Germany, his last posting at Fort Lewis planted his roots
in Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad married for a second time there in 1988, after his first
marriage collapsed a few years earlier. But it wasn't long after his
military discharge that his second marriage, to Mildred Denice
Williams, would end even more bitterly. During the marriage, which
produced three children, there were charges and counter-charges that
cast Muhammad as a man prone to serious violence.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the couple's neighbors and longtime friends in Tacoma,
Anthony G. Muhammad, put it in an affidavit on file in their divorce
case: "From 1992 until 1999, John and Mildred and the children had a
model family picture." But as Mildred's workload and family pressure
mounted, Anthony Muhammad wrote, the couple began to break apart.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, John Allen Muhammad owned and ran Express Car/Truck
Mechanic Inc., which advertised, "The Future is Here Now," and his
wife had been working there.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually it got ugly. In court filings seeking a restraining
order against him in 2000, Mildred alleged that Muhammad had
terrorized her, threatened her with murder and took their three
children for long periods of time without permission.</TE>
<TE>   She also asserted that her husband's long Army career had made him
a weapons and demolitions expert, which made her fear him. At one
point, she alleged, his threats drove her to hospitalization in May
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mildred did win several restraining orders against him, first in
Tacoma and later in Maryland and Washington, D.C., after she fled
with the children to a relative's home in suburban Clinton, Md.</TE>
<TE>   In the divorce documents, she called Muhammad a "very irrational"
man who regularly threatened to "destroy" her. She said Muhammad
stalked her at home and at work, and tapped her phone. In other court
records, Mildred Denice Williams said her ex-husband engaged in a
pattern of "physical, sexual or ... emotional abuse of a child," and
that his "abusive use of conflict ... creates the danger of serious
damage to the child's psychological development."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Tacoma court agreed to bar Muhammad from
contacting her and the couple's three children, now ages 12, 10 and
9.</TE>
<TE>   The court ordered Muhammad to pay $850 a month in child support a
month. His wife kept their 1987 Nissan 300ZX sports car, a 1985
Jaguar XJ6 and one of their businesses, known as Reality Enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   But none of these court mandates stopped Muhammad from abducting
his three children again in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Williams landed in Bellingham in late October 2001, he
was legally John Allen Muhammad; he'd officially changed his name six
months earlier, according to documents on file in Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   And by then, Muhammad had become well acquainted with the Light
House Mission in a seedy section of town, across from a printing
plant and a car-repair shop. Muhammad had stayed there the previous
August with his three children after spiriting them away from Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   That stay ended when the local sheriff's office, acting on a writ
from Tacoma, took the children out of school and returned them to
their mother.</TE>
<TE>   Run by the Union Gospel Missions out of Kansas City, the
79-year-old nondenominational Christian homeless shelter occupies a
three-story stucco building that houses 100 or so people a night. The
mission housed Muhammad and his children on the floor of the family
area, a 30-by-50-foot chapel in a building that sports wall fliers
for free donated winter coats, pictures of Jesus and videotapes of
"The Story of Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   When Muhammad returned in October with the 17-year-old boy he
called his stepson, he stayed in a large dorm room with 52 beds for
men only.</TE>
<TE>   "On several other occasions, beginning on Oct. 20, 2001 ... John
Muhammad was accompanied by a teenaged male who John claimed to be
his stepson," the mission confirmed in a statement Thursday. "The
individual was using the name Lee Malvo."</TE>
<TE>   By then, Malvo's life had been fuller than his 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   At age 14, he had joined his mother in a smuggling vessel from
Haiti, one of the scores of rickety ships that set out every year
from the impoverished Caribbean island packed with illegal
immigrants. They landed in Florida in June 1999, Malvo would later
tell investigators for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service. And they entered America undetected.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until almost Christmas of last year, though, that the
INS would catch up with them. And by then, Malvo had endeared himself
to many at Bellingham High School, where he enrolled as a junior in
early November. Malvo's name even appears in last year's yearbook,
although he didn't show up for his photo session.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the school district's communications director, Lavelle
Freudenberg, would say only that he attended the school for "a brief
period."</TE>
<TE>   But his classmates and others remember Malvo for his abiding
manners and mind.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew more than the teacher did. He knew way more. He was
always correcting the teacher," said Tami Rearwin, 16, a senior who
had Malvo in her U.S. history class. "He always had something to say
about something."</TE>
<TE>   Crissy Greenawalt, 17, another senior, had college writing class
with Malvo, who told his classmates he'd moved from Florida. "He had
a lot of opinions. They were really thought out," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo showed up for class each day in the same jeans and green
pullover, wearing shirts of flannel or wool. He performed well in
class, but each night he retired to the homeless shelter, and some at
school said his homework suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how one source at the school, who asked not to be named,
remembered the young Malvo: "He was exceptionally friendly, and
polite. He called everybody sir and ma'am. He represented that he
lived in Florida, but that may not have been true.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very intelligent, but he had some problems in turning in
his homework. He used the computers in school. He was doing a report
on global warming; he was fascinated by it."</TE>
<TE>   Through those autumn and winter months, while young Malvo was in
class, there's no evidence Muhammad ever landed a steady job. Down at
the Waterfront Bar, Wally Oyen, the morning bartender, said,
"Muhammad often came in to have one or two two-dollar beers, usually
around 10 a.m., which means he missed the happy hour that ends at 8
a.m."</TE>
<TE>   Many who met the two men assumed they were only temporarily at the
shelter, and that they intended to settle in town.</TE>
<TE>   But one day, Malvo disappeared. His last day at school was Dec.
18. On the 19th, INS agents hauled him away.</TE>
<TE>   Details are sketchy, but Jamaican and U.S. government officials
say police in Bellingham, responding to a domestic dispute that
included Malvo and his mother, grew suspicious about their
immigration status. They called in the INS, who arrested mother and
son and took them to a Seattle detention center.</TE>
<TE>   There, authorities got what ultimately would turn out to be a
crucial piece of evidence in the Washington, D.C., sniper probe.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond telling agents the tale of their journey from Jamaica to
Haiti to Florida to Washington state, Malvo and his mother were
fingerprinted in their routing processing. Malvo's print would match
one found at the scene of a September shooting in Montgomery, Ala.,
and at the scene of one of the Washington-area sniper shootings,
government sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo apparently left behind other clues in Bellingham: The FBI
also showed up at the school this week, reportedly seeking his
handwriting samples to compare with notes left at the sniper crime
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   But at the time they were detained last December, Malvo and his
mother were merely undocumented migrants. They were held for about
three months, then released on bond after a Feb. 20 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing months saw Muhammand and Malvo undertake their journey
that would eventually lead to the Washington, D.C., area. They
visited friends and relatives in Baton Rouge in August, recalled
Holiday, the cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday said he suspected something was wrong because Muhammad was
dirty and sweaty and "his demeanor was so different. I knew something
was going on, but didn't know what."</TE>

<TE>   A Look at 2 Lives</TE>
<TE>   John Allen Muhammad: A veteran of the Persian Gulf War, his Army
shooting skill was rated one notch below expert. He was
court-martialed twice in the 1980s, for disobeying orders and
punching a fellow soldier. In 2001, he changed his name from John
Williams, years after converting to Islam. He has married and
divorced twice.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Boyd Malvo: Born in Jamaica, he came to the U.S. with his
mother illegally three years ago. He attended high school last year
in Bellingham, Wash. At one point, he lived with Muhammad at a
homeless shelter.</TE>

<HD>Where Death Was Dealt, a Wary Sense of Relief</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ASPEN HILL, Md.</DL>
<LD>School bus driver Jacqueline Young hurried home at midday to turn on
the news about the sniper, hoping she could soon tell her riders that
life had returned to normal.</LD>
<LD>   Warren Shifflet, an auto mechanic who watched one of his customers
bleed to death from a sniper's gunshot wound, fantasized about
getting "ahold of these guys -- and I'm not the only one who feels
that way."</LD>
<LD>   And Kenny Walters, a middle-school student, looked forward to
playing basketball outdoors once again, happy that the sniper "can't
kill nobody else."</LD>
<TE>   News that police may have solved the series of sniper murders drew
sighs of relief Thursday from a public that had endured three weeks
of terror.</TE>
<TE>   But relief mixed with wariness as residents struggled to accept
the idea that they could resume the routine acts of life without fear
of a sniper's bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The startling turn of events, just days after the sniper's warning
to parents that their children were not safe, left some almost numb.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like an instantaneous reaction," said Mohinder Gill, a
service station owner who recalled how pigeons flew off their perch
on a wire almost as soon as he heard the gunshot this month. "People
are still waking up to what has happened."</TE>
<TE>   It was in this modest, working-class section of Montgomery County
-- an enclave of apartment complexes, shopping centers and bustling
roadways -- that the sniper episode exploded into public
consciousness with five fatal shootings over the night of Oct. 2 and
the next morning. And it was here, in Aspen Hill, that the last
victim was killed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   During the three-week spree, shootings spread an ever-widening
circle of fear, grazing the District of Columbia and moving south
through Virginia. Because the victims were killed while doing
everyday things like pumping gas and loading groceries, the public's
sense of vulnerability became more acute.</TE>
<TE>   Until Thursday. Suddenly, pictures of suspects and reports of
arrests interrupted what many had thought would be one more day under
a sniper's shadow.</TE>
<TE>   In Spotsylvania County, Va., 60 miles south of the first murder
spree, some residents expressed their relief.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel great," said Raja Abilmona, who owns a Mobil station
across the street from where motorist Kenneth H. Bridges was gunned
down pumping gas Oct. 11. "We feel sorry for the victims' families
first, but we feel very, very relieved for our customers. Hopefully,
it will be over."</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents showed Abilmona pictures of the suspects Wednesday
night, but neither looked familiar, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To the north, in Fairfax County -- where FBI analyst Linda
Franklin was shot outside a Home Depot -- the widely shared release
of tension was accompanied by a residual caution.</TE>
<TE>   "What I hear is great relief," said Paul Regnier, a Fairfax County
public schools spokesman. "But people are still concerned. Are we
sure? They're wondering if we've got this nailed down."</TE>
<TE>   The school system, the metropolitan area's largest, is looking
forward to the return of outdoor recess and sports events.</TE>
<TE>   In Manassas, Va., where Dean Harold Myers was killed pumping gas
at a Sunoco station, more people seemed to be going out Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood is much better -- guests, as well as the people that
work here," said James Rybinsky, host at the Olive Garden restaurant,
noting that business seemed to have jumped more than 10%. "You're not
glued to the radio and TV. You're not worried that someone else is
being shot."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Pumphrey, a teacher at Benjamin Tasker Middle School in
Bowie, Md., embodied the mix of memories and emotions that greeted
news of the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   It was early Oct. 7 when she thought she heard someone bang at the
front door of the school building. She went outside and saw one of
her 13-year-old students on the ground, screaming. He was a smart
kid, at the top of her science class. But she thought at first he was
fooling around.</TE>
<TE>   "He was holding his stomach, writhing around. I said, 'What is
wrong with you?' He said, 'I'm shot.' I said, 'Where?' He said, 'In
my stomach.' I said, 'You'd better not be kidding me.' " Within
seconds, the boy's aunt returned in her car and rushed him to the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, teachers were "euphoric" at word of the arrests, she
said. She said a lot of her students hadn't heard the news.
"Tomorrow's going to be a different story," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Principal John Lloyd said school was "great" Thursday. He said he
couldn't even count how many students stopped him as they got off
their buses in the morning to ask if he had heard the news.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was one, there were a hundred," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents of the Washington area could say they had
patronized a particular store where tragedy struck, or had been
unnervingly near the scene of a slaying.</TE>
<TE>   At a Michaels craft store, cashier Ann Chapman was busy at the
register Thursday. On the night of Oct. 2, the sniper's first shot
had burst through the store window and past her head, ricocheting off
a rack of inspirational prayer books and finally landing in the frame
department, where investigators found it only recently.</TE>
<TE>   In the series of shootings, it was the only one that missed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ready to accept it," Chapman said on Thursday of the
arrests. "Suppose it's not him?"</TE>
<TE>   The mounting death toll had shaken her, she said. "As time goes on
and as more people got shot, I got hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The skepticism was most common inside Aspen Hill, where the
killers returned Tuesday to gun down Conrad E. Johnson, a bus driver
preparing for his morning ride.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they caught the right people," said Craig
Davenport, 21, walking with a group of his friends just a few blocks
from where Johnson was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "For him to get caught that easy -- if they wanted $10 million,
they'd be smarter than that."</TE>
<TE>   Others could not hide their hostility toward killers who shattered
the peace of a community and demonstrated a willingness to randomly
target people.</TE>
<TE>   "They should just give them to Virginia," said Miguel Mercado,
owner of a beer and wine store in Aspen Hill, alluding to that
state's frequent use of the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents were at the store Thursday morning with photos of
the suspects. They took a videotape from a camera in the store,
hoping to place at least one of the suspects in the area in the last
few days.</TE>
<TE>   Mercado said he hoped the arrests "will calm a lot of people down.
When they snapped that guy, who was a customer of mine, everyone got
scared. It put the fear in everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Still, people could not help but feel hope at the news. Young, who
has been driving school buses for 31 years, said she felt less
vulnerable but was wrestling with her conflicting reactions: "I want
it to be over, but I'm kind of skeptical right now. We don't know
what they know."</TE>
<TE>   At the Fitzgerald Auto Mall, where James L. "Sonny" Buchanan was
killed on Oct. 3 while cutting grass, the talk was about the arrests
and the suspects' photos. No one recognized them.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kind of feel a weight has been lifted around here today,"
said Bob Hydorn, an assistant vice president. "I hope and pray it's
right."</TE>
<TE>   Hydorn expressed his longing for the return of routine life, which
so many residents sacrificed after the sniper shootings blanketed the
region in fear.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice if we could get back to normalcy," he said, "if
my son could sell his Cub Scout popcorn outside."</TE>

<HD>2 Captured in Shootings; Gun Linked to 11 Attacks</HD>
<DH>Ex-Army sharpshooter and Jamaican youth were a mobile
sniper team, say authorities, who declare deadly rampage at an end.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The killing rampage that menaced suburban Washington with random
death for three weeks was declared at an end Thursday by relieved
officials who arrested a 41-year-old drifter, who was once an Army
sharpshooter, and a 17-year-old Jamaican youth.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities said Thursday evening they believe the two
suspects acted in tandem as a mobile sniper team that roamed the
Washington region's highways, killing 10 and wounding three in gas
stations, parking lots, on streets and at a middle school. Ballistic
tests on a rifle seized from their car at a rural Maryland rest stop
match the weapon used in 11 of the shootings, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   John Allen Muhammad was arraigned Thursday on unrelated federal
weapons charges in Baltimore and held at a maximum-security federal
detention center. His juvenile companion, Lee Boyd Malvo, was being
held as a material witness in the sniper cases.</LD>
<TE>   Federal agents and detectives from Montgomery County, Md., where
six people were slain, questioned the pair and examined bags of
evidence hauled from the car. Maryland, Virginia, District of
Columbia and federal prosecutors planned to meet today to discuss
whether to file murder charges and other counts against them.</TE>
<TE>   "We now consider them suspects in the string of shootings that
occurred in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia," said
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who in three weeks
went from nonentity to national television fixture.</TE>
<TE>   The denouement was stunning in its banality. Cowed for 22 days by
an unseen carrier of death, the Washington region awoke to learn of
suspects so poor they slept in a disheveled car. The killer taunted
police, warning, "I am God," but those delusions faded. In the bleak
Maryland sunrise, police quickly amassed a trove of evidence and
captured their suspects without incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight, the people in the region are breathing a collective sigh
of relief," said Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan, who had
attended a wearying succession of funerals.</TE>
<TE>   For long, harrowing days and nights, the killer eluded a
law-enforcement juggernaut of nearly 2,000 police and government
agents.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore police officials said Thursday that officers had
questioned Muhammad there the day after a 13-year-old boy was wounded
outside his middle school in Bowie. But the region's obsession with
white vans and white box trucks led officers to set him loose in his
blue Chevrolet Caprice.</TE>
<TE>   But the sniper also made mistakes. Last weekend, frustrated by his
failure to reach police, a man who said he was the killer called a
Roman Catholic priest in Ashland, Va. "He just called this parish,
got a priest and said, 'I'm the Washington sniper and there's this
other murder-robbery in Montgomery, Ala.,' " an official said.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, the sniper wounded a man near an Ashland
restaurant. But the remark led task force investigators to make the
critical leap to a Sept. 21 slaying in Montgomery that gave them the
name of the younger suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Tipped by a trucker who heard a police alert for the pair and
their blue Caprice, teams of federal agents and Maryland state
troopers surprised the suspects before dawn Thursday in their parked
car at a highway rest area near Myersville, north of Frederick.</TE>
<TE>   "The task force made a dynamic entry on the car and there was no
resistance," said Joseph G. Green, a federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agent at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, Muhammad appeared in handcuffs and blue paper
slippers before U.S. Magistrate Beth P. Gesner, responding in a weak
voice as the judge asked him whether he understood the proceedings.
His hair matted, Muhammad hesitated when Gesner asked whether he had
taken liquor or medication over the previous day, then said faintly:
"Yes, ma'am." He was not released. Malvo's hearing as a material
witness was closed because of his juvenile status.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they seized a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle
capable of firing the same hollow-point .223-caliber rounds that
killed 10 people and wounded three over a 100-mile geographical
stretch from Maryland's strip-mall suburbs to a rural Virginia
highway transit town.</TE>
<TE>   Sniper task force officials said they found a ventilation hole
punched through the rear of the Caprice's trunk -- large enough to
allow a rifle to be aimed and fired without exposing the gunman.
Officials also said the car's rear seat folded down, creating a
makeshift sniper's nest in the trunk. A rifle scope and tripod
capable of aiding the sniper's aim and bracing the gun were also
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The seized weapon and other items provide strong evidence,
authorities said, that the car's trunk had been converted into a
mobile bunker to fire the solitary, long-range shots that felled the
sniper's victims. At least three victims were shot from dense woods.</TE>
<TE>   "With that kind of hide-out, no one would see gunfire or the
shooter," one federal official said. "It was pretty effective."</TE>
<TE>   The Caprice was purchased from Sure Shot Autos in Trenton, N.J.,
by Muhammad and a second man. FBI agents and police in Camden, N.J.,
said Thursday they are searching for Nathanel Osbourne, a Jamaican
national who helped Muhammad buy the car. Police want to question
Osbourne to see whether he has any knowledge of the crimes and are
interested in his role in buying the car -- once used as a police
cruiser in Bordentown Township, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to look at the nature of the relationship and what was
going on," Camden Police Capt. Joe Richardson said. "Naturally, if he
was involved, the FBI would bring appropriate charges."</TE>
<TE>   Another federal law enforcement official said detectives were
examining the possibility that the sniper team traded off firing the
14 shots -- the first hitting only a store window. Muhammad, a
Persian Gulf War veteran who qualified as a sharpshooter during Army
training in Louisiana, would have had the skill to make the more
difficult salvos that aimed for the head. Four victims died in that
manner.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy shot for the head, one guy didn't," the official said.
"There were different styles. One killed, the other might not have
been good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that theory, authorities said little about what they knew
about Malvo's alleged role. But the youth's closed-door hearing in
federal court Thursday was a clear sign that he was more than a
fellow traveler.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like the kid was more involved than just driving," a
Justice Department official said. "All the facts have not come out
yet."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were still working Thursday night to establish a
motive for the wanton killings. One hint, they said, came in the
fitful, still-undisclosed communications over the last week between
the killers and FBI and ATF negotiation teams.</TE>
<TE>   A federal official said the two letters left by the killers near
shooting scenes in Ashland last week and Aspen Hill, Md., on Tuesday
morning contained passages indicating a vague domestic terrorism
slant.</TE>
<TE>   While agents have yet to find any evidence of links to domestic or
foreign terrorist groups, they continue to search -- and make
reference to reports from Muhammad's acquaintances in Tacoma, Wash.,
where he once lived, that he espoused "anti-American" views and
expressed some approval for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Witnesses say he was angry and had a gripe against the U.S.," one
Justice Department official said. "Apparently he also sympathized
with the hijackers. He sided with them over us. He made statements
that were anti-American."</TE>
<TE>   Some investigators are considering the possibility that the
killers purposely stalked civilians and killed a smattering of ages,
genders and races to show that the government was impotent to protect
its citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   "There were passages in [the sniper's] conversations [with task
force officials] that expressed arrogance toward law enforcement,
particularly the FBI, in terms of their ability to deal with someone
like this," the official said. "They saw themselves as supermen."</TE>
<TE>   But money seemed to be at least a partial motive. Though a ransom
demand did not surface immediately, the sniper pressed for $10
million in one letter to police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were continuing to interview witnesses to determine
whether Muhammad had ever made overt threats of violence. Already, as
agents fanned out across the country to interview relatives and
friends, they learned that Muhammad's submerged rage often leached
out in violent action.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad terrorized one ex-wife for years, according to court
documents and child custody papers. He threatened her with violence
and death, and he abducted their three children for long periods of
time without permission, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   In those records, Muhammad's wife, Mildred Denice Williams, said
her husband's long stint in the Army made him a weapon and demolition
expert. In May 2000, his accusations prompted her to seek admission
to a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Williams -- who now lives in Prince George's County, Md., where
one of the shootings occurred -- obtained several restraining orders
against her husband, first in Washington state and then in Maryland
and in Washington, D.C. She said her husband was "very irrational"
and regularly threatened to "destroy" her.</TE>
<TE>   She said Muhammad stalked her at home and at work, tapped her
phone and became so irate that he began "threatening to destroy my
life."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid of John," she said. "He was a demolition expert in the
military."</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers filed Wednesday in Seattle that were
used as the basis for the firearms charge against him, Muhammad has
used the names John Williams, Wayne Weeks and Wayne Weekley, and
trained with several rifles and firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The documents said he owned a Bushmaster semiautomatic
.223-caliber rifle, model A-35, which had been shipped across state
lines in violation of U.S. law.</TE>
<TE>   Report of 3 Visits</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, according to the documents, FBI agents interviewed a
man named Robert Edward Holmes, who said he had known Muhammad since
late 1985, when they were stationed at Ft. Lewis, near Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said Muhammad had visited Holmes' residence three
times over the last six months and that during the first visit,
Muhammad and someone else who was not identified displayed an AR-15
assault rifle and another weapon identified as either a .303-caliber
rifle or a .30-06.</TE>
<TE>   On the second visit, according to the affidavit, Holmes saw
Muhammad with an AR-15 with a scope that he carried in an aluminum
briefcase. It said that Muhammad and the unidentified person with him
talked about taking the AR-15 to a range to "zero it" -- aligning the
scope to improve its accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, Muhammad told Holmes: "Can you imagine
the damage you could do if you could shoot with a silencer?"</TE>
<TE>   Authorities with the sniper task force knew none of that
information, and did not even know about Muhammad or Malvo until last
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a prelude to their involvement, it may have come
first in Camden on Sept. 11, when Muhammad bought a used car. It was
a 1990 Chevrolet Caprice, an old police cruiser capable of taking
heavy punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The car was registered with the New Jersey Department of Motor
Vehicles at an address that was used by Osbourne, the fugitive sought
by the FBI, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known whether Muhammad lived at Osbourne's home, but he
did receive mail there. Witnesses have told the FBI that Muhammad was
seen in the Camden neighborhood throughout the fall of this year,
possibly putting him in New Jersey after the shootings in Montgomery,
Ala., that police are still trying to link to Muhammad. Witnesses
said Muhammad frequented a local bar and may have worked there, the
FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Not much is known about Osbourne, except that he "may have
immigration problems," an FBI official said. When police caught up
with Osbourne's brother Thursday, they found that he did not have
valid immigration status, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials could not be sure whether Malvo was with Muhammad at the
time, but 10 days later, Malvo's own trail began, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Montgomery said Thursday they believe Malvo was involved
in a Sept. 21 liquor store shooting that killed one employee and
injured another.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a case to prove. I'm very optimistic," Police Chief
John Wilson told reporters. "I think we've got a lot to work with
here."</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators assigned to the sniper case became
interested in the liquor store shooting last weekend after receiving
a call from a person claiming to be involved in the sniper shootings.
In an apparent attempt to gain credibility, the caller mentioned
aspects of the liquor store assault, including where it took place.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington attacks started with a burst of gunfire into the
window of a Michaels craft store in Aspen Hill, Md., on Oct. 2, with
the first fatal shooting less than an hour later. The killer
dispatched victims with ease, anonymous as the wind, killing, then
retreating into the ether. First in Montgomery County, where four
victims were gunned down in one day along the Connecticut Avenue
commercial strip. Then, as police increased patrols and citizens
began living life indoors, the sniper became more selective, gunning
down victims wherever police presence was minimal and highway access
was easy.</TE>
<TE>   People were killed in isolated gas stations at night and less than
50 yards from a state trooper in daylight. Woman and men, blacks and
whites, were killed indiscriminately.</TE>
<TE>   But he was not untouchable. On Oct. 8, the day after the anonymous
rifleman gunned down a 13-year-old student outside Benjamin Tasker
Middle School in Prince George's County, police in Baltimore had made
contact with one of those arrested.</TE>
<TE>   While authorities were seeking a white van, based on repeated
witness reports from some shooting locations, police approached a
blue Caprice in a gas station parking lot at the intersection of 28th
and Sisson, in west Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The sleeping man inside presented a driver's license and
registration in the name of John Allen Muhammad, according to police
spokeswoman Ragina Avarella. Malvo was not in the car, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad's name was entered into a database of police contacts
with citizens that the city has been keeping for the last two years,
Avarella said. But "everything seemed in order and valid," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That happens a lot," another law enforcement source said. "The
names are in files somewhere, but you don't know it."</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad first showed up at the 28th Street Mobil, just off the
Jones Falls Expressway, after 11 p.m. the night before. The door was
locked and he approached the night window, asking where he could get
a hot meal, according to a cashier at the gas station. The night
clerk suggested a nearby 7-Eleven.</TE>
<TE>   Then he returned and bought a bag of chips. Later the clerk
noticed the Caprice was parked in a lot up on a hill. By 3 a.m.,
"they were just about to call the police when the police came on
their own," the cashier said.</TE>
<TE>   After that incident, the killer struck four more times. But last
Friday, when the priest receives his unexpected call, the death spree
begin to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday, task force detectives were in Alabama, culling old
murder cases.</TE>
<TE>   When agents came across the Montgomery case, they were given a
fingerprint lifted from the pages of a gun magazine at the crime
scene. It matched another print stored on an Immigration and
Naturalization Service computer -- Malvo's, which had been taken for
a deportation hearing in December.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday is when they got the name. "And then it moved just like
lightning," a federal law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   For the next several days, police and killers communicated
fitfully. Moose read veiled messages that hinted of a demand for $10
million and drop-off points.</TE>
<TE>   He laced his pleas with lyrics from the lilting reggae tunes of
the Five Stars, a Jamaican group.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, the noose tightened.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a dizzying day, it ended quietly. The suspects woke up to
police guns.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, Moose, looking more relaxed than the public has
ever seen him, looked into the cameras, unbent and squinting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not given in to the terror," he said. "Yes, we have all
experienced anxiety, but in the end, resiliency has won out."</TE>

<HD>For Victims' Families, Relief Accompanies Grief</HD>
<DH>Heartened by the sniper suspects' capture, relatives find
it difficult to forget their losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For the families of the sniper attack victims, news that the
suspected killers were captured was bittersweet.</LD>
<LD>   "They're sad and happy," said Larry Gaffigan, who knew two of the
victims and is the coordinator of a fund to help the families of all
13 victims. "They're still grieving for their losses, and they're
happy for families who don't have to go through what they've been
through."</LD>
<LD>   "They're thanking God and asking Americans to continue to pray for
them," said Gregory Wims, founder of a group that helps victims'
relatives, after speaking with most of the families Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Phone calls to the families of the victims went unanswered, or
representatives of the families said that the victims' relatives were
not ready to talk publicly.</TE>
<TE>   The family of Linda Franklin, the FBI employee who was killed as
she stood next to her husband in a Home Depot parking lot in Falls
Church, Va., expressed relief in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Franklin family is heartened to learn of the arrest of two
men in connection with the sniper case," the statement said. "If in
fact these are the two responsible for these terrible crimes, it
pleases us to know they are off the street and are no longer posing a
threat to the community."</TE>
<TE>   The victims' families and their supporters expressed hope that
Americans would offer respect to the victims rather than focus on
their grim deaths and suspected killers.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of the past day will help bring to a close this ugly
chapter in our lives," Linda Franklin's family said. "It is time for
our family, our community and our nation to come together, remember
those who were lost and move on with our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Those who wish to help may contribute to a fund to aid all 13
families or to several memorial funds set up for individual victims
who were killed. (A toll-free number, [888] 726-9200, has been
established for information on donations.)</TE>
<TE>   So far, $35,000 has been donated to the group fund organized by
the Victims Rights Foundation, a Maryland group founded by Wims six
years ago to help survivors of violent crime. The money will be
divided equally among the families, and none will be used for
administrative costs, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to honor the victims and take attention away from
this monster," said Gaffigan, who is volunteering as a coordinator
for the foundation and acting as an informal spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Cruz and his wife, Sarah Ramos, one of the early victims,
left good jobs and a comfortable lifestyle in El Salvador to move to
the United States, where she thought life provided more opportunity
for their son.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz has been so upset that their 7-year-old son sleeps with him
to console him, Gaffigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Wims said he worried that the boy, who had not yet cried about his
mother's death, was taking on too much.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old daughter of another victim, Laurie Ann
Lewis-Rivera, 25, apparently did not yet understand that her mother
will not return, Wims said. He spent a whole day with the toddler and
her father this week, and "she asked for her mother several times,"
Wims said.</TE>
<TE>   The father of James "Sonny" Buchanan wants his son remembered as a
volunteer mentor to children. His son was a longtime volunteer and
board member of the Boys &amp; Girls Club in Washington's Maryland
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   The co-workers of Kenneth H. Bridges, 53, a co-founder of a
business designed to boost African American business, pledged to
honor him by making his company more successful.</TE>
<TE>   As the suspects were arrested and arraigned, hundreds of people
were gathered at a hotel in Kearnersville, N.C., for the annual
convention of MATAH, the company Bridges founded. MATAH is a
wholesale and retail distributor that carries 200 products made by
African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In his honor, the distributors at the convention pledged to
"double, triple and quadruple" their sales, said Al Wellington,
co-founder and CEO of MATAH. "That's how we're taking this tragedy
and turning it into a good."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to helping the families cope, Wims and Gaffigan have
their own grieving to do. Wims and Buchanan served together on the
board of the Boys &amp; Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffigan knew two of the victims: Ramos was his maid, and James
Martin, 55, was a close friend.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffigan said he was relieved when the suspects were taken into
custody, because it meant that the families of the victims would be
able to face the alleged killers in court.</TE>
<TE>   For his own part, Gaffigan said, "I try to remember my faith,
which has been really difficult to do. I'm just glad to see him off
the streets."</TE>

<HD>Weapon Found in Car Has a Reputation for Accuracy</HD>
<DH>The Bushmaster -- which has been linked by ballistic tests
to 11 of the 13 shootings -- is a civilian version of the military's
M-16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The semiautomatic rifle that police found in John Allen Muhammad's
car left the factory only this year. But Muhammad has been familiar
with the style of rifle for decades from his service in the Army.</LD>
<LD>   The weapon taken from the car, made by Bushmaster Firearms Inc.,
is a civilian version of the M-16, the military's fully automatic,
standard-issue rifle. Muhammad won an Army marksmanship award for
proficiency with the M-16.</LD>
<LD>   All Bushmaster rifles use .223-caliber ammunition, the same type
used in the Washington-area sniper shootings. The weapon found in the
suspects' car has been linked by ballistic tests to 11 of the 13
shootings, said Michael Bouchard, an agent with the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Dyke, chairman of Windham, Maine-based Bushmaster, said an
ATF official called Thursday morning asking to trace a Bushmaster
rifle that carried a particular serial number.</TE>
<TE>   A check showed that the company sold the rifle in June to a
distributor in Washington state, Dyke said. He would not identify the
distributor.</TE>
<TE>   He said the weapon had a 20-inch barrel and a standard stock,
meaning the stock did not fold or collapse for easier transport. The
rifle typically uses a magazine of 10 rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The weapon is illegal in California under the state's assault
weapons ban, which is more stringent than a similar federal ban, said
Kristen Rand of the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control advocacy
group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Dyke said Bushmaster weapons are favored by target shooters and
hunters of groundhogs and other small game. Military versions of its
rifles have been purchased by the FBI, the ATF and security teams at
U.S. embassies and nuclear power plants, Dyke said.</TE>
<TE>   He said 35 rifles were ordered Oct. 18 by police in Montgomery
County, Md., where the Washington-area sniper claimed about half of
his victims.</TE>
<TE>   But Bushmaster weapons also have turned up in violent crime. The
company made the central shooting portion of a weapon carried by
white supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr. during a 1999 rampage in which
a letter carrier was killed in Chatsworth and five people were
wounded at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bushmaster was initially one of several gun makers sued by a Los
Angeles police officer wounded in a 1997 shootout with two North
Hollywood bank robbers. Dyke told The Times in 1999 that his company
was dropped from the suit because the robbers never took their
Bushmaster weapon out of their car trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Dyke is a Republican political donor whose ties to the company
have created controversy. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Dyke
resigned as the Maine campaign finance chairman for George W. Bush
when reporters asked why candidate Bush was enlisting the help of an
assault-weapon maker.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 Senate race in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton's
campaign accused New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of trying to hide
a $1,000 donation from Dyke. Giuliani had listed Dyke's company not
as Bushmaster Firearms but as "Bushmaster Farms," the Clinton
campaign said.</TE>
<TE>   At least five other companies make civilian versions of the M-16.
Boge Quinn, who runs the online gun magazine GunBlast.com with his
two brothers, said Bushmaster weapons are more accurate and more
expensive than others, with retail prices starting about $700.</TE>
<TE>   "Bushmaster uses a little bit tighter tolerances. They use the
best materials. Their guns are just assembled better than most, and
the result is a very accurate rifle," said Quinn, of Clarksville,
Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   He said he and a brother recently tested two Bushmaster rifles and
were impressed. One model, called the Varminter, put five rounds
within 3/8-inch of each other in a target 100 yards away. "That's an
extraordinarily accurate gun, a very well-made gun."</TE>
<TE>   Dyke said he would prefer that a Bushmaster had not been linked to
the suspects in the Washington-area shootings.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "We know that the other 50 guys in the blue
uniforms that were chasing these people were also carrying
Bushmasters, so we take solace in that."</TE>
<TE>   "We're really proud of what we do, and we think we do a lot of
good in the world."</TE>

<LD>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Florida State by 10.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: Everyone keeps waiting for the luck -- or
whatever it is -- to run out for the unbeaten Irish, who emerged as a
surprising No. 3 in the bowl championship series standings. But if
Coach Tyrone Willingham's players win at Tallahassee, they'll have a
good chance of entering the regular-season finale against USC at the
Coliseum without a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State update: That 28-27 loss against Miami suggested the
Seminoles aren't washed up after all.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: An Irish victory would give Notre Dame a glimpse of
the road to the national title.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Florida State. The Miami game made us believers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 15 USC (5-2)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 14 OREGON (6-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 1.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: The last two trips to Eugene have ended in Trojan
losses on last-minute field goals, last year on Jared Siegel's
32-yard field goal with 12 seconds left and in 1999 on a field goal
by third-string Oregon kicker Josh Frankel in triple overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon update: The Ducks fell from the unbeatens last week in a
rare home loss -- to Arizona State, the Pac-10's surprise team.
Oregon has won 29 of its last 31 games in Autzen Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Here's USC's chance to make a big splash in the Ducks'
pond. Otherwise, the Trojans have to take a seat in the Pac-10 race.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. How many games can Oregon win on late kicks?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 13 IOWA (7-1)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 8 MICHIGAN (6-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Michigan by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa update: Two of the three teams unbeaten in Big Ten play meet.
Iowa hasn't beaten Michigan since 1990, the last year they claimed a
share of the Big Ten title. Key scheduling note: Iowa doesn't play
Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan update: The Wolverines must find a way to stop Fred
Russell, who went to high school 25 miles from Ann Arbor and signed
with Michigan in 1999 but failed to meet NCAA eligibility
requirements and ended up at Iowa. Now he averages 128.1 yards
rushing -- and Michigan is in his way.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: If Iowa has BCS aspirations, now is the time to state
its case.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Iowa. Let's go out on a small limb, for fun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 PENN STATE (5-2)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 4 OHIO STATE (8-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: None.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Ohio State by 4 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Penn State update: Larry Johnson set a school record with 257
rushing yards last week against Northwestern. The Nittany Lions'
losses came in overtime to Iowa and Michigan. Penn State hasn't been
held under 24 points. Ohio State hasn't given up more than 21.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State update: The Buckeyes have only three difficult games
left -- against Penn State and at home against Minnesota and
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Maurice Clarett takes center stage in a battle of the
backs that might have Fiesta or Rose bowl implications.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Ohio State. We still can't get over what the Buckeyes
did to Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEBRASKA (5-3)</TE>
<TE>   at TEXAS A&amp;M (5-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Texas A&amp;M by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska update: With three games against ranked teams ahead,
Nebraska is an underdog at Texas A&amp;M after five consecutive road
losses dating to last season -- and the Aggies are 71-10-1 at home
under Coach R.C. Slocum.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M update: In the four games since Slocum relieved Dino
Babers of play-calling duty and named Kevin Sumlin offensive
coordinator, the Aggies have averaged more than 41 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: If the Cornhuskers are going to pull out of this,
College Station would be a good place to start.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Texas A&amp;M. With Nebraska end Chris Kelsay struggling
because of a hamstring injury, the defense may be without its best
player.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 IOWA STATE (6-2)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 7 TEXAS (6-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: None.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Texas by 12 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State update: Quarterback Seneca Wallace's outsider campaign
for the Heisman can close up shop if he doesn't perform any better
than he did in the 49-3 loss to Oklahoma. (He was four of 22 for 43
yards with three interceptions.)</TE>
<TE>   Texas update: Chris Simms doesn't get another chance for that
first victory over a top-10 team -- but the downside if Iowa State
pulls an upset is huge. The Longhorns need this victory to stay in
the BCS picture.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: This game shouldn't apply as one of the Longhorns'
struggles with "the big ones."</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Texas. Or else Mack Brown really catches what-for.</TE>

<HD>Gentry Switches to Richardson as Starter</HD>

<LD>Quentin Richardson made it through his first exhibition game without
his sprained right knee troubling him. He played 31 minutes during
the Clippers' 115-107 loss Wednesday to the Milwaukee Bucks and
scored 12 points on five-of-11 shooting, getting six rebounds and two
assists.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry on Thursday cleared Richardson to move into the
starting lineup at shooting guard for the opener Wednesday against
the Cleveland Cavaliers. That means Richardson and Eric Piatkowski
will trade places.</LD>
<LD>   Naturally, Gentry reserved the right to change his mind on that.
Or, if things don't work out, at any point during the season.</LD>
<TE>   "More than likely, Q is going to start," Gentry said of
Richardson, who last season made 133 three-point baskets, six shy of
Terry Dehere's team record set in 1995-96. "We'll get scoring off the
bench with Eric.... It's not etched in stone. We'll take a look at it
and we'll see. Andre [Miller], Q and Pike probably will play together
some. We're also happy with the way Marko [Jaric] played with Andre
[Wednesday] night."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry gave Piatkowski a game off to rest various bumps and
bruises and paired his top point guards in the backcourt for most of
the first and third quarters Wednesday against the Bucks. Jaric had
11 points, four assists and four rebounds in 18 minutes. Miller had
21 points, 10 assists and three rebounds in 32 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Competition for playing time figures to be intense at all
positions, and Gentry said he's determined to avoid a 10-man
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be an eight- or maybe a nine-man rotation," he
said. "That's what we're going to go with. Somebody's going to be
angry and is not going to like it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miller, Richardson, Gentry and several other players and team
officials are scheduled attend a reading rally for 150 children as
part of the NBA's Read to Achieve week at the Echo Park Boys &amp; Girls
Club between 1:30 and 3 p.m. today.</TE>

<LD>Freshman T.A. McLendon ran for a career-high 178 yards and two
touchdowns Thursday night as No. 12 North Carolina State remained
undefeated with a 38-6 victory over Clemson in an Atlantic Coast
Conference game at Clemson, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Philip Rivers also ran for a touchdown for the
Wolfpack (9-0, 4-0 in the ACC). Clemson (4-4, 2-3) was held to a
season-low point total.</LD>
<LD>   Terrence Holt had an interception, recovered a fumble and returned
a blocked punt 39 yards for a touchdown as North Carolina State
achieved its best start in school history. The 1967 team started 8-0.</LD>
<TE>   Despite being undefeated, North Carolina State was 11th in the
bowl championship series rankings that were released Monday. North
Carolina State's soft schedule has included games against Division
I-AA East Tennessee and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is, we're one of eight football teams that are
undefeated at this juncture of the season," said Wolfpack Coach Chuck
Amato, a linebacker on the 1967 team. "And that's not easy to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cecil Sapp ran for 164 yards and two touchdowns and Colorado State
converted two turnovers into 14 points to defeat Brigham Young,
37-10, in a Mountain West game at Fort Collins, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams (7-2, 3-0) became eligible for one of the conference's
four bowl berths.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Young (3-5, 0-3), the defending conference champion,
dropped its third consecutive game, during which the usually prolific
Cougars have scored a total of only 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State outgained Brigham Young, 493-213, and the Rams had
342 rushing yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker, the third-leading passer
in school history, was suspended indefinitely for violating team
rules and will not play against Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision was made after consulting with Jeff and others,"
Coach Bobby Williams said in a statement. "It is for the welfare of
both Jeff and this football program that this action is taken
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Smoker declined comment. School officials declined to release the
specific reasons for the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Damon Dowdell will make his second career start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee quarterback Casey Clausen, who missed the 16th-ranked
Volunteers' loss to Georgia because of a shoulder injury, was cleared
by doctors to play against No. 19 Alabama.... Louisiana State safety
Damien James apparently has quit the team, Coach Nick Saban said.
James, a senior starter, has not been at practice this week. "I did
not suspend him," Saban said. "I did not have words with him.
Nothing." James could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen said running back Bruce Perry, last
season's Atlantic Coast Conference offensive player of the year, is
expected to return against Duke. Perry suffered a torn groin muscle
in the preseason.... Auburn kicker Damon Duval, whose clutch field
goals won three consecutive games last season, has lost his job to
Phillip Yost.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Is Cut Down by Crew</HD>
<DH>Four days after winning MLS title, L.A. loses, 1-0, in a
lackluster U.S. Open Cup final before 6,054 at Columbus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>One play, or one series of plays, doesn't always define a game.
Still, in this case, a flurry in the 26th minute painted a larger
picture for the Galaxy on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of seconds, Galaxy forward Chris Albright was shut
down twice in the penalty area, first by Columbus goalkeeper Jon
Busch and then by defender Eric Denton. In between those chances,
Simon Elliott's shot was deflected.</LD>
<LD>   History was blocked, literally and figuratively. The Galaxy's
effort to take the triple this season ended on a windy night at Crew
Stadium, as Columbus won the U.S. Open Cup, 1-0, before a chilled
crowd of 6,054. For the victory, the Crew takes away $100,000. The
Galaxy gets $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   They were attempting to win two major titles in a span of five
days. On Sunday, the Galaxy won the MLS Cup for the first time, and
getting up for another significant contest was never going to be
easy.</TE>
<TE>   During the MLS regular season, they captured the Supporters'
Shield.</TE>
<TE>   "If difficult things were easy, then everybody could do it,"
Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   The Crew won its first championship of any kind. As in the teams'
two previous meetings this season, the margin of victory was one
goal. The lone goal came four minutes after the Galaxy's futile
flurry in front. A Guatemalan striker scored, but it wasn't league
MVP Carlos Ruiz of the Galaxy. Instead, it was his national teammate,
striker Freddy Garcia of the Crew.</TE>
<TE>   In the 30th minute, Garcia volleyed a shot past Galaxy keeper Matt
Reis from about seven yards out. A low cross by Brian West came from
the right wing and Reis got his hands on it, but the ball popped out
front, right to Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out to get it and just couldn't hold it," Reis said. "It
could have went anywhere and it just goes right to the guy's feet."</TE>
<TE>   Said Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas: "I stepped up to take Brian
West, and I pulled out of a tackle. I would have had to foul him and
thought better of it. It was the wrong decision. I probably should
have taken the foul and possibly the card and stopped the play."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy had plenty of chances but, as Schmid noted jokingly,
blocked as many of its own shots as the Crew did.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had chances, we created chances, we just didn't
finish them," Schmid said. "Were we as sharp as I would have liked to
have been? Probably not. A few guys were off a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Thankfully, it happened today rather than happening Sunday. From
that standpoint, the MLS Cup is probably a bigger championship than
the Open Cup. I know U.S. Soccer doesn't want me to say that."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy had plenty to say after the final whistle. Midfielder
Mauricio Cienfuegos and Elliott gave the officials an earful on the
field, and Elliott was seething in the dressing room. So, what did he
have to say to referee Brian Hall?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can write it down," he said. " ... When the
outcomes of the games are affected by things other than 22 players on
the field, that's when it gets extremely disappointing and
frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   It might be argued that the Open Cup will continue to receive
short shrift because of the rapid turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "At the risk of sounding unprofessional -- I don't think it does
-- last year we lost the MLS Cup final and won the U.S. Open Cup,"
Lalas said. "If I had to choose one way to do it, this is a lot
better.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation, coming from the MLS Cup, an
incredible environment, into this. After all the bidding and stuff
like that, this was the best they could come up with for an Open Cup
final?</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think had we gone back to Los Angeles, and played even
in Fullerton, it would have been a much better environment for soccer
and certainly a better way to showcase the Open Cup, which a lot of
people look at as an ugly stepchild."</TE>

<LD>Anaheim Servite wasn't ready for what Santa Margarita brought
Thursday night, but the Friars showed that an ill-prepared Servite is
better than a short-handed Santa Margarita with a 35-20 Serra League
victory at Cal State Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan said Ashton White, the team's
leading rusher, did not attend the game because he was nursing an
injured knee and was ill. It forced the Eagles to the air early and
often.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita (5-2, 0-2 in league play), ranked No. 14 by The
Times and No. 7 in the Southern Section Division I poll, moved the
ball against a Servite defense that had prepared to stop White, but
the Friars (7-0, 2-0) tightened when it mattered and allowed Santa
Margarita into the end zone only once in four trips inside the
Servite 20.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Margarita's two other scores came on an 87-yard kickoff
return and a 58-yard pass reception by Bobby Whithorne.</TE>
<TE>   "That surprised us that [White] wasn't playing," Servite Coach
Larry Toner said. "But we adjusted and made some good plays in the
second half."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita quarterback Case Colaw completed 23 of 40 passes
for 278 yards and two touchdowns, and Whithorne had 13 catches for
197 yards, but Colaw threw three interceptions in the second half.
Servite, ranked No. 8 by The Times and No. 4 in Division I, turned
those turnovers into 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rubalcaba led Servite with 186 yards and two touchdowns in 28
carries. Dillon Bedard had two interceptions and rushed for three
touchdowns. Servite, 7-0 for the first time since 1985, plays Mater
Dei next week.</TE>

<TE>   Irvine 28, Newport Harbor 20 -- Terrell Vinson carried 29 times

Sea View League victory at Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson scored on runs of 65 and 94 yards, caught a pass for a
32-yard touchdown and had a two-point conversion reception to help
Irvine (5-2, 1-1) rally from a 14-6 halftime deficit and leave Santa
Ana Foothill (5-1, 1-0), ranked No. 2 in the Division VI poll, as the
only unbeaten team in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor (5-2, 1-1), ranked No. 4 in the division, was led
by Dartangan Johnson, who finished with 187 yards in 22 carries and
had first-half scoring runs of 24 and 14 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Covina Northview 38, Pomona Ganesha 13 -- Harold Frazier had a
56-yard touchdown reception and returned a punt 69 yards for another
score and the Giants (6-1, 2-0) amassed 364 yards rushing in a Valle
Vista League victory at Ganesha (5-2, 1-1).</TE>

<LD>After saddling a pair of 2-year-old colts in the Pinjara on Thursday
at Santa Anita, trainer Bobby Frankel is back with two 2-year-old
fillies in the $50,000 Hidden Light at one mile on the grass.</LD>
<LD>   Uncoupled in the betting because they have different owners, Chope
Mockery and Gotdream both will be making their first start in this
country.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Ed Gann, Chope Mockery is the 5-2 second choice on the
morning line in the field of six. She won two of four overseas and
will break from the rail under Laffit Pincay Jr. Gotdream, owned by
Amerman Racing and also a French-bred, was one for two in her native
land. She will be ridden by Corey Nakatani.</LD>
<TE>   The favorite is Major Idea, who beat maidens in her turf debut at
Del Mar on Sept. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The other main contender is Mac Melody. Owned by a partnership and
trained by Bob Hess Jr., she is back on the turf after being
overmatched in the Del Mar Debutante. She won two of three on the
lawn in Italy and England.</TE>
<TE>   Races of the day: There are three stakes at Arlington Park the day
before the Breeders' Cup: the $100,000 Gilded Time Stakes for
2-year-olds at seven furlongs, the $100,000 John Henry Stakes at 1
3/16 miles on the turf for 3-year-olds &amp; up, and the $100,000
Estrapade Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf for older fillies and
mares.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Wayne Catalano. Approaching the end of the Arlington
meet, the trainer is batting around .360 with more than 170 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Burk Kessinger. The trainer is 0 for 49 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Obispo Kid, The Candi

<LD>The Lakers don't get the rings the Sacramento Kings were so sure were
theirs for another four days, and the large black curtain on the west
wall hid the banner torn away from the Kings in a Game 7 overtime
last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the Kings have ranted about 70 wins and how the
referees maybe should get those rings, seeing as they were the ones
who dictated the critical moments with their terrible calls.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, quite confident themselves and also proud they've
eliminated the Kings in each of their last three championship
postseasons, have renamed the Sacramento franchise the "Queens," in
part because one of the Sacramentans admitted to being "scared to
death" during those Western Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacific Division rivals share a floor tonight at Staples
Center, in an exhibition game that would seem to hold little drama
for anyone not named Jannero Pargo, Soumaila Samake and Guy Rucker,
three Laker campers hoping to make it to the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's going to be meaningful," Kobe Bryant said.
"Last year, when we played Sacramento in the preseason they kind of
took that as a big ol' challenge, to send us a message, and they beat
us. They celebrated. Then we beat them in the seventh game of the
playoffs. I don't think they can take too much from the preseason
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed, though, and conceded, "It's going to be interesting,
even in an exhibition game."</TE>
<TE>   Of the primary instigators -- Shaquille O'Neal, Mike Bibby, Chris
Webber  -- only Webber (groin strain) might play, and he's doubtful.
Bibby broke a bone in his right foot and isn't expected to play until
about Dec. 1, and O'Neal is two or three weeks from returning from
his toe surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said O'Neal, who's getting a lot of mileage from dubbing
the Kings Queens, "It's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting.
They talk. We talk. That's what this league is all about. We're
selling tickets, creating TV revenue. It's not personal. Nothing But
Actors. NBA stands for Nothing But Actors."</TE>
<TE>   Who's not taking it personally? O'Neal grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably will," he said. "We'll probably take it personal
too."</TE>
<TE>   Asked at Thursday's shoot-around if bad blood still existed, Rick
Fox smiled and said, "It's spilled all over the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson said he'd keep them all in check.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want them to get into that kind of a state right
now," he said. "I'll keep the roar level down a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 98-93, in an exhibition
game Thursday night at Staples Center. Tracy Murray had 21 points,
including five-for-six three-point shooting.... Robert Horry awoke
with a sore back, was questionable against the Bucks and played
anyway.... Devean George (back), Brian Shaw (groin) and Mark Madsen
(hamstring) did not suit up.... O'Neal has yet to be examined by Dr.
Robert Mohr, and so he has not been cleared to run.... The Lakers
waived guard A.J. Guyton. The roster stands at 15.</TE>

<HD>Dykstra's Father to Pursue Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father of Rollie Dykstra, saying, "I want to get to the truth,"
announced Thursday that he plans to hire an investigator to find out
what University of La Verne athletic officials knew about the
headaches his son experienced before his serious head injury in
Saturday's game.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Dykstra Sr., the La Verne quarterback's father, said his
decision to pursue outside involvement came after he learned "someone
at La Verne is saying Rollie discouraged medical treatment."</LD>
<LD>   "You know what's happening?" Dykstra Sr. said. "They're putting up
a wall."</LD>
<TE>   Rollie Dykstra, 24, collapsed on La Verne's sideline Saturday and
endured violent convulsions minutes after being tackled by a
University of Redlands defender. Dykstra has remained in critical
condition -- comatose and in intensive care -- since.</TE>
<TE>   La Verne trainer Jim May and university spokeswoman Deborah
Mandabach have refused to comment about Dykstra's situation. La Verne
football Coach Don Morel said earlier this week he was aware Dykstra
reported a "minor" headache to a trainer Oct. 7, two days after the
Leopards' 30-6 loss to Cal Lutheran.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Ross, Rollie Dykstra's girlfriend, said Dykstra told her
he made repeated complaints about his headaches to May, but never
received medical attention before Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asking him every day, 'Babe, did you go get your head
checked?' He told me they'd take him to get it checked," Ross said.
"In the week before the game, he told me, 'They said I'm fine.' "</TE>
<TE>   Most bothersome, said Ross, was a conversation with Dykstra in
which he said the delay in treatment was "some issue with medical
expenses, that it would cost the school such and such."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said she responded, "That's just not right, Roll.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ross, who has dated Dykstra for two years and lived with him near
the La Verne campus, said he first experienced painful headaches
after being sacked eight times in the Leopards' Sept. 28 loss to
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. Following the Cal Lutheran loss, Ross said
Dykstra told her, "My head's throbbing."</TE>
<TE>   "It was daily after that, and it wasn't just a slight headache,"
Ross said. "If he jostled his head at all, or turned his head, it
hurt him bad. Something wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Dykstra was frustrated that the pain was lingering, and
that she was irritated by the delay in treatment. Ross said La Verne
previously paid for Dykstra to visit an area medical center after he
injured an ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra did not have personal medical coverage, Ross said. An
athletic director at an NCAA Division III university in Southern
California said schools such as La Verne provide medical coverage for
athletes for injuries suffered in training or competition, with
supplemental "catastrophic" coverage provided by the NCAA. The
athletic director said the price of medical insurance policies has
skyrocketed since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,; that his
school's costs have doubled.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to limit claims, but the way you do that is by ensuring
your kids are fit going into the season, and by removing them from as
many unsafe situations as possible," the athletic director said.
"There must be wide-open communication between the athlete, the
player, the coach and the doctor. In this case, you wonder, was the
injury articulated well enough to the trainer? Was he raised in a
culture where you don't complain, where you should be tough? Football
kids are the toughest to deal with, and maybe something was broken in
the translation."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center have not
confirmed Rollie Dykstra suffered Second Impact Syndrome, which is
believed to have caused the death of Costa Mesa High linebacker Matt
Colby last year. Like Dykstra, Colby complained of headaches after
two previous games before suffering his fatal injury.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Dykstra would not reveal if the investigator he intended to
hire would be a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Solomon, a Playa del Rey attorney whose firm won $4
million from the Manhattan Beach Unified School District and a
physician for allowing a Mira Costa High football player to
participate in a 1995 game two days after he suffered bleeding near
the brain, said, "This would merit seriously looking into, to see if
the educational facility took appropriate steps to protect the
well-being of the football player."</TE>

<LD>Those who prefer races around a turn at this track will be happy this
evening.</LD>
<LD>   Five of the 10 events on the program are 870 yards or longer,
beginning with the first.</LD>
<LD>   Fair King, a 3-year-old appaloosa trained by Kelly Lewis for owner
Cathy Monji, is the one to beat in the 870-yard opener.</LD>
<TE>   In the second, Arabian fillies and mares will get together at six
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran marathon specialists will get together in the fourth and
the sixth. The fourth is an 870-yard race for $8,000 claimers and the
sixth is the lone thoroughbred race of the card. Ten $5,000 claimers
are scheduled to go 4 1/2 furlongs in the sixth. Finally, Arabian
fillies and mares will go six furlongs in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Fair King. 2. Sparky Scales. 3. Contreras. 4.
Timothy Pilot. 5. Jolinos Dasher. 6. Never Ready. 7. Lucky Colours.
8. Rodania Arbi. 9. Bac To Amaze You. 10. Sunday Blush.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Fair King in the first, use the Paitan-One Off entry,
Sparky Scales and Tiki Arbi in the second, Contreras, The Joy Of Jazz
and Firm Investment in the third and Timothy Pilot, Sir Elton and
Raisin Slew in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the fifth, Hes Worth A Million should
improve after a long layoff. Rainbows Primetime had a rough trip in
his latest race and could rebound in the seventh.</TE>

<KH>MOTOR RACING MARTIN HENDERSON</KH>
<HD>Franchitti Will Try Again at Fontana</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He idolized Ayrton Senna, he learned from Jackie Stewart, and he
married actress Ashley Judd. There's nothing second-rate about Dario
Franchitti, who is leaving Championship Auto Racing Teams for the
rival Indy Racing League after this season.</LD>
<LD>   Bittersweet? Nostalgic?</LD>
<LD>   "You can't live your life looking over your shoulder and wondering
what's gone on in the past," said Franchitti, who has spent the last
five years driving for team owner Barry Green. "I've got to focus on
the future. At the same time, it's difficult to leave CART. One of
the guys in the pit lane said the other day, 'You know, you've got
family here.' There are some great people here."</LD>
<TE>   Franchitti and family will be at California Speedway on Nov. 3 for
the 500 presented by Toyota, CART's only superspeedway appearance
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Franchitti has had terrible luck in four races at Fontana. Despite
having qualified in the top 10 three times, his best finish was 10th
in 1999, at the season-ending race in which he lost the championship
to Juan Montoya on a tiebreaker -- seven wins to three. Franchitti
finished 23rd the last two seasons, and 22nd in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Franchitti said that racing became much more a business to him
after his closest friend, Greg Moore, died in the 1999 race at
Fontana, and that it was a business decision for him to join team
owner Michael Andretti -- who purchased Team Green, effective at the
end of the season -- and Tony Kanaan in the all-oval IRL. Honda and
Toyota are also leaving CART for the IRL, leaving Ford Cosworth as
CART's only engine supplier.</TE>
<TE>   "I went with the one thing I know and trust, which is the team and
Honda," Franchitti said of his decision. "I thought about it for a
couple of weeks, for sure. It was not a decision to be made
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CART team owner Chip Ganassi announced that he would have Tomas
Scheckter and Scott Dixon in Toyota G Forces next season in the IRL.
Ganassi probably will field at least one car in CART as well.</TE>
<TE>   NHRA</TE>
<TE>   A simple parts failure -- a broken valve-retainer spring --
resulted in Ron Capps' spectacular funny car explosion two weeks ago
in Dallas. Capps and the rest of the NHRA crowd are in Las Vegas this
weekend for the second AC Delco Nationals, the last event before the
season-ending meet at Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some headaches, my ears weren't working like normal, and my
knees were pretty sore, but after about a week, I was fine," said
Capps, who drives for owner Don "the Snake" Prudhomme.</TE>
<TE>   Capps said "a beefier" spring is in place after the scary crash,
during which the explosion blew the firewall back on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was panicking for a little while," Capps said. "Nothing has
ever come back and prevented a driver from reaching any of the
controls, parachute, brake or steering wheels. The fire was on me as
well. The fact I couldn't pull my brake or turn the steering wheel
sent some more panic into me."</TE>
<TE>   However, he's sure the incident will yield a safer car.</TE>
<TE>   "Snake said we're going to make changes next year that's going to
make it bulletproof," Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Force has a 13-point lead over teammate Tony Pedregon in his
drive for a 10th consecutive funny car championship.</TE>
<TE>   Force would need to win, be No. 1 qualifier, and set a national
elapsed-time record -- and have Pedregon fail to qualify -- to leave
with an insurmountable 139-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon needs to earn only 31 points to clinch the top fuel
title, same as Jeg Coughlin in pro stock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The second Mazda NHRA Sport Compact World Finals will be run
Saturday and Sunday at Pomona Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   In championships still to be decided, Grant Downing of Fullerton
leads the pro division by 71 points, Stephan Papadakis of Redondo
Beach leads modified by 79 points, and Bruce Mortensen of Fontana
leads hot rod by 70 points.</TE>
<TE>   Formula One</TE>
<TE>   The effort by Dan Gurney to put together a Formula One team for
2003 has run out of time.</TE>
<TE>   "The deadline we set for ourselves, which was dictated by the
amount of time required by Ford Cosworth to put together their engine
build and trackside support package, has not been met," Gurney
announced in a statement. "We were not prepared to commit to a
situation which was not properly funded for at least three years."</TE>
<TE>   Gurney's plan came to light at the United States Grand Prix in
September.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Formula One will race in Shanghai, China, from 2004 to 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Thursday, Perris Auto Speedway hosts the three-day,
$100,000, 100-lap Budweiser Oval Nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the entrants are the last five champions, Bud Kaeding, Tony
Jones, Rickie Gaunt, Rodney Argo and Rip Williams, as well as
four-time SCRA champion Richard Griffin, national dwarf car champion
Seth Wilson, and USAC national sprint car champion Tracy Hines.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway, in its last Saturday event of the season, will
have a 200-lap open event for super late models on Saturday, with a
$12,000 purse and $3,000 going to the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Follmer of Fountain Valley finished third in the BP
Motorsports Team Endurance 300, a six-hour race on Lake Perris, to
win the All-Around Offshore Endurance Series championship for
personal watercraft.... The Petersen Automotive Museum honors 50
years of drag racing by the NHRA on Nov. 2 with a special exhibit and
a dinner honoring founder Wally Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services for land speed racer Nolan White, who died Sunday
after crashing last week on the Bonneville Salt Flats, will be held
Saturday, 2 p.m., at Pacific Beach Presbyterian Church, 1675 Garnet
Ave., San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Sprewell Appeals Suspension, Previously Undisclosed Fine</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latrell Sprewell filed two appeals against the Knicks on Thursday in
New York, including one for a $50,000 fine that was not previously
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell's appeals were filed by the players' union one day after
his unofficial banishment from the team was lifted and he was allowed
to return to practice.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals were the second and third filed by Sprewell this
month. He earlier appealed a $250,000 fine against him by the Knicks
for failing to inform the team of a broken hand in early September.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's appeals concerned a one-game suspension the team handed
down Monday after Sprewell failed to follow the team's rehabilitation
instructions, along with a $50,000 fine for missing a private workout
Thursday at the team's practice facility.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals will be heard by arbitrator Roger Kaplan, probably
within the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell will argue that the fines and the suspension were
unwarranted and excessive, union spokesman Dan Wasserman said.</TE>

<HD>State Goes on a Big Red Alert</HD>
<DH>They haven't had a non-bowl season in 34 years at Nebraska,
but that streak is in jeopardy, along with the job of Coach Frank
Solich.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>The marquee at the movie theater under renovation on O Street almost
seems to plead, in big red letters: PATIENCE.</LD>
<LD>   They're looking for a little a few blocks away at Memorial
Stadium, home of Cornhusker football, the only show in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Nebraska is 5-3, which in most outposts of the game is considered
fair-to-middling. Here, it feels like the death knell of a dynasty.</LD>
<TE>   Already, the streak of 348 consecutive weeks in the top 25 is
over.</TE>
<TE>   Other streaks seem poised to fall, with Nebraska an underdog this
week at Texas A&amp;M and No. 7 Texas, No. 20 Kansas State and No. 21
Colorado still ahead. Only Kansas seems like a sure victory.</TE>
<TE>   At stake, the streak of 33 consecutive nine-win seasons, all but
dried up now like a corn field in drought. The 33 consecutive bowl
bids, also at risk. The astounding 40 consecutive winning seasons
too.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't how Nebraska football is," said Scott Shanle, a senior
linebacker from St. Edward, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   In hard times, there are no distractions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a whole lot here," Shanle said. "People wait from
January through August for Nebraska football. There are no pro teams
here, no other Division I [football] schools."</TE>
<TE>   To understand the grip Nebraska football has on the populace,
consider that you can eat your meals at the Cornhusker All-American
Buffet, grab a Husker Cab on your way to the Cornhusker Bank, then
get your back adjusted at Cornhusker Chiropractic on the way to get a
tooth pulled at Cornhusker Dental.</TE>
<TE>   All told, some 60 businesses are named after the Huskers.</TE>
<TE>   Even the rare caller to a radio sports-talk show who isn't a
Nebraska fan admits she's glad when they win.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's in a better mood."</TE>
<TE>   Other powerhouses have stumbled in college football's new era --
USC, Penn State, Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one of the most stunning aspects of this spiraling season
is how quickly the Cornhuskers have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   In January, they played Miami in the Rose Bowl game for the
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   They lost, 37-14. They had lost their previous game to Colorado,
62-36.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, they had won 11 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say people should have seen this coming, with six
starters from that team gone on offense, another five on defense.</TE>
<TE>   The scrutiny, as always, falls quickly on the coach.</TE>
<TE>   After Saturday's loss to Oklahoma State, the first since 1961, the
Associated Press reported the cost to buy out Frank Solich's contract
at more than $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Solich -- the longtime assistant who was Tom Osborne's
hand-picked successor when he retired after winning his third
national championship in 1997 -- won more games in his first four
seasons (42) than either Osborne or Bob Devaney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's idiotic to consider replacing Coach Solich," said secondary
coach George Darlington, in his 30th season as a Cornhusker
assistant. (Another assistant, offensive line coach Milt Tenopir, has
been at Nebraska 29 years.)</TE>
<TE>   "When Coach Osborne took over in 1973, we were [9-2-1] but lost in
a shutout to Oklahoma down there and didn't cross the 50," Darlington
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of rumbling then because Bob Devaney had led them
to two national championships."</TE>
<TE>   Osborne -- who would become such an icon he parlayed his
popularity into a seat in Congress -- stopped by the football offices
this week.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't offer advice on Xs and O's, just on hanging in there.</TE>
<TE>   "To get a pat on the back from someone who understands was great
for us as a staff," Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, a pragmatic Osborne told supporters at a stop in Grand
Island, Neb., that Nebraska football has been "defying gravity for 40
years."</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is forever. Nothing is permanent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of college football already learned that.</TE>
<TE>   But how could Nebraska plunge so rapidly?</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lemming, a highly regarded Chicago-based recruiting expert,
doesn't detect a huge drop-off in talent. After all, Nebraska is
known for feeding and nurturing its own talent, not storing up
harvest after harvest of top-10 recruiting classes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a big difference," Lemming said. "The
difference is, Nebraska always had a great quarterback or running
back -- or both."</TE>
<TE>   This year, neither.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Eric Crouch won the Heisman Trophy last year. His
replacement, Jammal Lord, is another option quarterback who leads a
68th-ranked offense and has completed more than eight passes in a
game only once. (In the pipeline: freshman Curt Dukes, a skilled
option quarterback from North Carolina.)</TE>
<TE>   The running game -- best in the nation the last two seasons -- has
slipped to sixth, though freshman David Horne, once slated to
redshirt, is averaging 98 yards and is sharing time with Dahrran
Diedrick.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the offensive line, that cornerstone of so many
Nebraska teams. The line is having a sub-par year too -- possibly an
indication the rest of the country has caught up to Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   For all the hankering among some fans to modernize the offense,
plenty of the focus is on the defense -- the once-famous Blackshirts
-- now ranked 50th in the nation against the run.</TE>
<TE>   "Our No. 1 thing we need to do is stop the run," said defensive
coordinator Craig Bohl, himself the focus of much criticism. "In
years past, we've had a great rushing defense."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the defense has been playing without its best player, end
Chris Kelsay, sidelined by a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, little-known Tatum Bell of Oklahoma State ran for
182 yards against the Cornhuskers.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a silent consensus among influential boosters, it is
that Bohl's job is more at stake than Solich's -- and many would like
to see Solich take off the headset and name an offensive coordinator
to call the plays as well.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one thing I've learned in sports, it's patience," said
Dale Jensen, a Nebraskan who made his fortune in software development
and now lives in Phoenix, where he is part-owner of the Arizona
Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] I think Frank certainly needs to get some additional help
and new assistants.... The proof in the pudding will be what changes
he makes after the season."</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Bill Byrne, the focus of some alumni ire for
emphasizing other sports in addition to football, is considered a
hands-off administrator who has said only that he is "disappointed"
in the football team's record.</TE>
<TE>   Most key alumni tend to think Solich is safe, but some are
inclined to wait to see if the unthinkable happens and Nebraska ends
up 6-7 to say he'll be back.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to say that yet," said Lee Sapp, an Omaha
businessman and prominent booster. "It depends on how the season
goes."</TE>
<TE>   Talk of shaking up the staff doesn't sit well with Darlington,
like Solich a coach who is testimony to the loyalty and continuity
that are a hallmark of the Nebraska program. (Four members of the
staff have been there more than 20 years.)</TE>
<TE>   "Any assistant knows that you work at the bidding of the head
coach," Darlington said. "Hopefully, [Solich] will not get into that
situation. It's up to him if he feels changes need to be made, then
he needs to make them. But normally what happens is that head coaches
that fire assistants, it's in very short order that they get fired
too."</TE>
<TE>   On the radio airwaves this week, one of the more common topics was
whether the players care as much as the fans do.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has ever seen the crowd at Memorial Stadium applaud the
visiting players as they leave the field after every game, win or
lose, knows they are a little different breed.</TE>
<TE>   So are the players. So many of them are from Nebraska, like
Shanle, Kelsay and Troy Hassebroek, a hometown walk-on who starts at
wingback.</TE>
<TE>   "From my house, you could see the balloons when they scored a
touchdown. You could hear the crowd," Hassebroek said. "We think
about what the players of the past think, how they'd react."</TE>
<TE>   Even offensive tackle Dan Vili-Waldrop, from Wilmington Banning
High, understands.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be that team that breaks the streaks. We've
already broken one," he said. "To lose three games here, it's a
crisis. To me, it feels like the world's ended."</TE>
<TE>   The season, however, has not.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough state," receiver coach Ron Brown said. "There's
been a drought the last couple of years that knocked people to their
knees. This is not an easy way to live. Some of the poorest counties
in America are here. These are people who battle through harsh
weather, of both extremes. This is a state of great determination,
great work ethic, great resiliency. People understand that hard times
come.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked my players yesterday, 'Do you love comebacks? Ever see
the way people love a comeback?' If we win every game, we can go
11-3. What a story that would be."</TE>

<HD>Harrison Is Suspended for His Hit on Rice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego Charger strong safety Rodney Harrison is used to dealing
out punishing hits. On Thursday, the NFL hit back.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison was suspended without pay for one game by NFL
disciplinarian Gene Washington for his third serious rules violation
in two seasons, a helmet-to-helmet hit on Oakland's Jerry Rice last
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Chargers plan to appeal. If the appeal is denied, the all-pro
stands to lose $111,764 -- 1/17th of his base pay, which is listed as
$1.9 million on the NFL Players Assn's Web site.</LD>
<TE>   San Diego, leading the AFC at 6-1, is idle this weekend and plays
host to the New York Jets on Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, who has been fined about $100,000 for various hits
during his nine-year career, refused comment as he left the Charger
complex after practice. Asked whether he feels he's a marked man, he
smiled, rolled up his car window and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he issued this statement through the team: "I'm
disappointed, but once we go through the appeal process, I'm
confident it will be overturned."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bears turned to quarterback Chris Chandler for the
second consecutive week, naming him the starter after trainers ruled
out Jim Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has tendinitis in his throwing shoulder and elbow. He
practiced with the first team Wednesday, but the injury flared up.
Miller probably will serve as backup quarterback Sunday against
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler, who completed 16 of 25 passes for 163 yards with a
touchdown and interception in a loss to Detroit last week, took all
the first-team snaps in practice Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receivers Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes practiced with the San
Francisco 49ers, but tight end Eric Johnson missed workouts with a
back injury that could sideline him this weekend.... New York Giant
rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey aggravated a foot injury late in
practice and sat out the last part of the workout. Shockey, who has
missed most of the last two games because of a toe injury, is
expected to play Monday night at Philadelphia.... Former NFL
defensive lineman Esera Tuaolo told HBO's "Real Sports" that he's gay
and kept his homosexuality a secret out of fear other players would
try to injure him and end his career. Tuaolo played nine seasons in
the NFL and reached the Super Bowl with the Atlanta Falcons in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith has agreed to give the Pro Football Hall of Fame
either the jersey or helmet he wears when he becomes the NFL's career
rushing leader. Smith needs 93 yards to break Walter Payton's career

<KH>PACIFIC 10 CHRIS DUFRESNE</KH>
<HD>Walter Has Found His Place in Sun</HD>

<LD>Everything is reportedly fine at Arizona State, now that the coach
and the quarterback have bypassed the "Dr. Phil" option and privately
settled their differences.</LD>
<LD>   There was a major breakthrough last Saturday, when sophomore
quarterback Andrew Walter passed for a Pacific 10-record 536 yards in
Arizona State's 45-42 victory at sixth-ranked Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Think about that. In a conference that has produced John Elway,
Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe, Rodney Peete, Warren Moon, Steve
Bartkowski, Jake Plummer, Dan Fouts, Danny White and Joey Harrington,
some guy named Andrew Walter has now passed for more yards in one
game than any of those other guys.</LD>
<TE>   "That's pretty elite company," Walter said by phone from Tempe
this week. "I figured [the record] would be more than 536. It's
obviously a huge number, but I figured it would be more."</TE>
<TE>   That Walter was able to stand tall in the pocket and slice and
dice the Oregon secondary was no small achievement, especially when
you consider that only months ago, during spring football practice,
there was a meeting involving Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter,
Walter and Walter's parents about Andrew's possible transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a touchy-feely meeting," Koetter said this week. "We
laid it down, 'Here's what he's not doing; here's what he has to do
to get better.' Because we thought there was a good chance that he
may leave the program."</TE>
<TE>   Walter, a hotshot prospect recruited by former coach Bruce
Snyder's staff, played sparingly as a freshman in Koetter's first
season and lost the starting job last spring to redshirt freshman
Chad Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   Koetter didn't like the way Walter was handling his offense and
Walter didn't like that he wasn't Koetter's guy.</TE>
<TE>   It was Snyder, fired after the 2000 season and replaced by
Koetter, who'd tracked Walter out of Colorado's Grand Junction High,
Snyder's staff that had broken down Walter's high school tape and
guided him through the recruiting process.</TE>
<TE>   And then this new guy comes in?</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big part of it actually," Walter said of the
adjustment to Koetter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's part of the business, where a new coach comes in and
you have to start over. That was kind of hard, I suppose, to go
through that. But where we're sitting now, it's been worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (6-2) now shares the conference lead with Washington
State, not bad for a team picked to finish ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The victory at Oregon earned No. 23 Arizona State its first top-25
ranking since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Add this to the fact that Plummer, the former Sun Devil standout
quarterback, has led the Arizona Cardinals to a share of first place
in the NFC West, and it's almost enough to make Phoenix-area fans
forget they live in an inferno.</TE>
<TE>   Walter's part of this saga could have gone terribly awry. He
opened fall camp as a backup to Christensen and wasn't happy about
it.</TE>
<TE>   His relationship with Koetter was ... ?</TE>
<TE>   "A little touchy, I guess is the word," Walter said.</TE>
<TE>   Koetter is young, bright, innovative on offense and basically from
the my-way-or-the-highway school of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   "If guys aren't getting it done, I'm pretty good about telling
them what they need to do to get better," Koetter said. "Most guys,
especially quarterbacks, have been told their whole lives that
they're the greatest player on Earth. I don't know, I think my
relationship with Andrew is fine. But I don't really know."</TE>
<TE>   Koetter gives Walter credit for not dragging the team down with
his woes and Walter gives his coach credit for giving him the chance
to earn the job back.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen started the first four games, with Walter playing
parts of all four. Koetter noticed, though, that whenever Walter went
in, the offense seemed to "spark up."</TE>
<TE>   With Arizona State trailing San Diego State by 22 points on Sept.
14, Walter "sparked" the offense with four scoring passes en route to
a comeback victory.</TE>
<TE>   He started his first game against Stanford and threw for 414
yards, then passed for 474 yards in a loss to North Carolina. In less
than a month, Walter has become the first player in school history
with three, 400-yard passing games.</TE>
<TE>   Walter thinks the whole program has turned the corner.</TE>
<TE>   He says, frankly, that last year's team, with many holdovers from
the Snyder era, "didn't believe in what Coach Koetter was teaching us
and telling us, and I think that really hurt chemistry and
coach-player relationships with all of us as players."</TE>
<TE>   You surmise, perhaps, Walter was even one of those guys.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   Oregon fans are combing over the eerie similarities of the
school's last two costly defeats.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Ducks' national title hopes were dashed on Oct. 20,
when they lost at home to Stanford. This year, the Ducks' national
title hopes were dashed on Oct. 19, when they lost at home to Arizona
State. In both games, the victors were led by sophomore quarterbacks.
Last year it was Chris Lewis, Saturday it was Walter. In both games,
Oregon blew 14-point second-half leads. In both games, the Ducks
scored 42 points in defeat. Last year, Oregon's loss to Stanford
ultimately sent the Ducks to the Fiesta Bowl. Here's where the
similarities end, because Oregon isn't going to the Fiesta Bowl this
year.</TE>
<TE>   More on Walter: He kept the Pac-10's single-game passing record at
home. Walter eclipsed the mark previously held by Arizona State
quarterback Paul Justin, who in 1989 threw for 534 yards against
Washington State. Jeff Van Raaphorst, another former Sun Devil, is
third on the list at 532 yards. The NCAA single-game record is held
by former Houston quarterback David Klingler, who in 1990 threw for
716 yards in a game against ... Arizona State.</TE>

<HD>Vision Quest</HD>
<DH>A near-death experience changed Rulon Gardner physically,
emotionally, but his spirit is unbroken</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Sometime during the cold, snowy night between Feb. 14 and 15, Rulon
Gardner had a vision.</LD>
<LD>   He and two friends, Trent Simkins and Danny Schwab, had gone
snowmobiling in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, near their home in
Afton, Wyo. Schwab turned back about 3:30 p.m. to attend his
daughter's basketball game, and he and Gardner got separated. Schwab
found his way home but Gardner, unfamiliar with the terrain, drove
his snowmobile into a gully and couldn't escape.</LD>
<LD>   Fixated on following the Salt River because he knew it led home to
the Star Valley, he plunged into the freezing water, slipped and fell
onto his back during a futile attempt to free the snowmobile.
Shivering and wet, wearing several light layers on his upper body,
gloves and boots but carrying no matches or survival gear, he trudged
to the riverbank and propped himself against a tree to wait for help.</LD>
<TE>   Rescuers came within about 200 yards of him, he thinks, about 2
a.m. He slipped in and out of consciousness, too weak to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my [long-deceased] brother Ronald sitting there with Jesus,
and God was there," Gardner said. "I didn't want to be there, so I
didn't go there. I just said, 'Uh-uh.' I pulled myself back and
withdrew from it. It was like going backward, withdrawing mentally.
Your mentality is the key, and I think it was the key that night."</TE>
<TE>   The indomitable will that had enabled him to subdue the supposedly
unbeatable Russian Alexander Karelin and win the Greco-Roman
wrestling heavyweight gold medal at the Sydney Olympics kept him
alive through his 17-hour ordeal. It also sustained him through the
amputation of the middle toe on his right foot and four other
surgeries, among them skin grafts to repair damage done when the
temperature plunged to 25 degrees below zero and halted the blood
flow to his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "After the accident, I didn't want to take painkillers," he said.
"I didn't need to take painkillers because my feet were hurt from my
stupidity, and I deserved to feel the pain that they felt."</TE>
<TE>   He is counting on the same resolve to help him meet his next
challenge: competing Saturday in Los Angeles for the first time since
his accident, knowing he's not the man or the wrestler he once was.</TE>
<TE>   "Quickness, speed, balance, agility, change of direction, lateral
movement -- all of them have been affected adversely and hold me back
from being the wrestler I used to be," he said. "But they're getting
back and improving and becoming the way they used to be. I call it
'used to could.' I used to could do this and that, and I will again."</TE>
<TE>   The physical changes are evident in his ungainly walk and the
yellowish skin on his feet. He weighed 290 pounds at Sydney and was
at 282 last week on the way to 265, but that's to meet new weight
limits. His shoulders are no less broad and his thighs no less
powerful than during his marvelous overtime victory at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   And his grin is the same, the aw-shucks smile of a kid who took up
sports to escape milking cows and doing chores on his family's
160-acre dairy farm and discovered an unexpected talent.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he has been transformed in ways he's not completely sure of.
He will begin to gauge those changes Saturday, when he steps onto the
mat at Los Angeles Center Studios to wrestle Billy Pierce in one of
14 matches that will be taped and shopped to TV networks as the pilot
of a real wrestling show.</TE>
<TE>   The event is the brainchild of RealPro Wrestling, whose
co-founders, former Northwestern University wrestlers Matt Case and
Toby Willis, hope to some day start a "real" wrestling league. Who
better to launch their effort than Gardner?</TE>
<TE>   "The whole David-and-Goliath story in Sydney was awesome," said
Case, a two-time wrestling All-American. "He's a great guy, down to
earth, a farm-bred country boy who happens to be a great athlete."</TE>
<TE>   One whose body is no longer whole but whose spirit is unbroken.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it's a little scary," Gardner said over lunch at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center, plowing through a plate heaped with chicken,
ribs, pasta, potatoes and vegetables before attacking a small garden
of lettuce on another plate.</TE>
<TE>   "As an athlete at a world-class level, you kind of expect yourself
to be competing at the top. I won the Olympic Games and the [2001]
world championship. Those are two huge successes. Now to come back
and say, 'OK, I went through the accident and now I'm going to be
world champion again,' there's got to be a first step, and sometimes,
the first step is the scariest step.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do practice matches and everything else, and those have
been going absolutely great in the last few weeks, but there's a
difference between practice and competition. It's scary, but I have
to follow my heart."</TE>
<TE>   His heart tells him to compete. Not necessarily to win another
Olympic gold medal, although that's among his objectives. It would be
a formidable task, however, because to get there he probably would
have to beat out U.S. rival Dremiel Byers, the reigning world
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Gardner simply wants to wrestle again, to test himself
and the mental focus that saved him that February night.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not 100% but he's doing excellent," said Momir Petkovic, a
U.S. Greco-Roman coach and 1976 Olympic middleweight gold medalist
for Yugoslavia. "His mind and will and tremendous champion spirit are
there. He proved that out in the wildness, and not everybody could
survive it. Once more, he proved he is a great, strong, special human
being, and he definitely deserves to be the best."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner's father, Reed, is glad the baby of his nine children --
who range from 31 to 44 -- can walk on his own two feet. That's how
grim the prognosis was after Rulon was rescued and airlifted to
Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, about two hours
from Afton.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. [Timothy] Thurman, at that time, gave us little or no hope to
save the feet," said Reed, 72. "By Monday night [three days later],
he discovered [Gardner] had feeling in all 10 toes, and blood
circulation, so the doctor said it looked a little better....</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, it was hard on [Gardner]. The insurance didn't pay for
his hospital room, so after a while he had to go to a hotel and go in
for visits with the doctor. And for 30 days, he was in and out of a
hyperbaric chamber. But seeing what I saw on that first day, it's
almost a miracle that he has recovered the way he has."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner's core body temperature was about 80 degrees when he was
rescued. Doctors had to cut his left boot down the middle to remove
it. The right boot was trickier because he had taken off his left
sock after he got out of the water but was too cold to take off his
right sock, which froze in the boot. It took a cast saw and five
people to remove that boot -- which he has kept, sock and all, with
its mate.</TE>
<TE>   He also kept his amputated toe, preserving it in a jar of
formaldehyde in his refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you start losing body parts, you never know when it's going
to end," he said, smiling. "You might as well try to keep all the
body parts you have. It's nice and everything, but it just doesn't
want to be on there anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have to tell me. I knew it was dead. I saw it die.
Growing up on a farm, you know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   His feet, then, must have wanted to stay attached. Told the first
night he might lose them, he refused to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Thanks, Doc, I'll see you tomorrow. I don't need to hear
that. I'd rather not. Have a good day and see ya,' " Gardner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Survival was what I thought about first, but it did transition
to, 'OK, you have your feet. You don't know how much you'll keep, but
you're going to wrestle again. That means you need 10 toes. You need
to have everything in order. You need to have everything the way it
was, and the only way to do that is to have feet and be in the best
physical shape as possible.' "</TE>
<TE>   He had several skin grafts, some of the skin harvested from his
body and some of it pigskin.</TE>
<TE>   "I could call him 'pig face' now and get by with it," Reed Gardner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rulon also pokes fun at himself, never more than during a speech
he made at the National Pork Producers' convention.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting up there in a wheelchair and said, 'When you walk
up to shake my hand, don't grab my toes and go, "This little piggy
went to market," ' " he said. "And then I pointed to my toes and
said, 'Pork -- the other white meat.' They were not sure how to
react, like, 'This is funny?'</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if I'm stupid, I'm stupid. I'm the one that made all the
mistakes and I'm not going to make anyone else pay for my stupidity."</TE>
<TE>   His recovery was complicated by his willfulness. Because doctors
had inserted three-inch pins in his big toes to straighten them, he
couldn't wear anything but sandals. That left his feet vulnerable
when he was riding an ATV four-wheeler on the family farm and his
foot slipped, nearly undoing the surgeons' careful work.</TE>
<TE>   He called Thurman, who told Gardner's brother Russell to check if
the pins were straight. Russell found a pair Vise-Grip pliers, pulled
out a pin and reported it was unbent. Thurman told him to push it
back in.</TE>
<TE>   Without painkillers.</TE>
<TE>   "After the four-wheel incident," Reed said, "Russell went and
picked up the keys for the four-wheeler, snowmobile and wave runner
to keep him from doing something more. Russell is bigger and tougher
than Karelin, so he can boss Rulon around."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner returned to the mat in July to conduct some clinics, but
he wore socks and couldn't demonstrate moves. He returned to the
Olympic training center to work out in late August.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that was real hard for him was, the world
championships were in Moscow this year and he couldn't be there,"
Reed Gardner said. "Byers won the gold, and that hurt Rulon's ego."</TE>
<TE>   It was more an injury to his pride, perhaps, because he doesn't
want anyone to think he became complacent after his improbable
victory at Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   The kid from Wyoming, who never had $20 in his pocket, got rich,
his $70,000 in debts wiped out by endorsement deals and speaking
fees. He was a fixture on the talk-show circuit, hobnobbing with Jay
Leno and called a "cutie patootie" by Rosie O'Donnell. Letters
arrived at the farm by the basketful -- "Not the bills and three or
four catalogs we used to get," Reed Gardner said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rulon remained true to himself and his sport. He got a kick
out of the adulation but rejected a lucrative offer to join the WWE
"because the youth of America need good role models, and some of the
things on the WWE aren't things that I agree with.... Some of the
things they do to women [are] degrading."</TE>
<TE>   He continued to compete and won the 2001 world title, rallying
from a 3-0 deficit in the quarterfinal to pin rising Russian star
Yuri Patrikeev.</TE>
<TE>   That went virtually unnoticed outside the wrestling world, but not
among his peers.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed his real character and his real heart in the world
championship, when he won it and he was wrestling all the best
wrestlers all tournament," Petkovic said.</TE>
<TE>   He was planning to defend that title until the snowmobile
accident. Now, he intends to win it back.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to challenge myself," he said. "I had a learning
disability growing up. I was a slow learner. Some of my teachers told
me I was the worst student they've ever had, that I had no
discipline, no devotion. A lot of those things come with time....</TE>
<TE>   "You can give me all the money in the world. I have no problem
taking it. But I don't want to be famous. I just want to be me and to
be able to follow my dreams and have a family and be a wrestler for
the rest of my days, as long as I can. After the accident, I got an
opportunity to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Family, however, will wait. Divorced last year, Gardner is dating
Tausha Simkins, the sister of his friend Trent. She's the current
Miss Rodeo Wyoming and aspiring Miss Rodeo America. They've seen each
other twice in the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I could have a relationship and maybe lose wrestling," he
said. "Things have to be sacrificed."</TE>
<TE>   Although he asked opponents to be considerate of his feet when he
resumed training, he no longer seeks favors. Last week at the
training center, he and Petkovic went at it relentlessly. Gardner
repeatedly pushed off his right foot and lifted Petkovic off his
feet, depositing him outside the circle painted on the mat.</TE>
<TE>   "Put in the story he is abusing the coach," Petkovic said. "Every
time he got to the point of being frustrated, he just wants to go
after you, 'Let's do it again.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Gardner: "I have 2% control over what this body does. The
rest is what the Lord has blessed me with.... It's not the most
physically attractive body in the world, but it does what I need it
to."</TE>
<TE>   And now he needs it to get him through the first match of the rest
of his wrestling life.</TE>
<TE>   "He's under a microscope right now," Reed Gardner said. "Everyone
out there will be watching. Anyone would have fears, but the fellow
he's wrestling, Billy Pierce, is a good fellow, a good family man,
and I'm sure he won't tromp on Rulon's toes."</TE>
<TE>   If he does, Gardner will endure, knowing he has survived worse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming back to do the best that I can," he said, "and if I'm
fifth in the U.S., that's fine. So be it, if that's the best I can
do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at a point in my career where I know what I can and can't do.
I put myself in a situation where, hopefully, I can win the gold
medal and be the best. If not, I did everything, and it's nobody
else's fault but mine."</TE>

<LD>SEATTLE AT DALLAS</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Dallas by 2 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Run, don't walk, Emmitt.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Cowboy fans haven't had much to cheer for since the 1996
Super Bowl, so let them have their day. Assuming Emmitt Smith holds
up his end and gains the 93 yards he needs to break Walter Payton's
career rushing record at Texas Stadium. It's anything but a sure
thing -- Smith is averaging only 63.8 yards in his last 23 games.
However, Smith had a season-high 82 yards last week, Seattle is
giving up a league-high 190 yards rushing a game and the Cowboys are
starting a new quarterback, rookie Chad Hutchinson.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Buffalo by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Can Lions win another for the Ripper?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Before last week, the word on Lion General Manager Matt
Millen was that he couldn't win for losing. Then he got all riled up
on Mike Ditka's radio show (imagine that) and slandered one of his
fine young men in the powder blue and silver, calling him "a devout
coward." Millen didn't name any names -- maybe there are two devout
cowards in the Lion organization -- but from the players' perspective
he didn't need to. Assuming Millen could have meant any one of them,
the Lions bonded and banded together and beat the Bears, 23-20. Next
up, Drew Bledsoe. Looks like Detroit could use a few more devout DBs.</TE>

<TE>   The line: New York by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Psst. Jets also have a devout Cowart.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Speaking of devout Cowarts, the Jets have one playing
weakside linebacker. Name is Sam Cowart, supposedly a major
off-season free-agent acquisition from Buffalo, but marked down
because of damaged goods: He missed 15 games in 2001 because of a
torn Achilles' tendon. Since returning, Cowart has looked out of
sorts, which makes him no stranger in the Jet defense, ranked 31st in
the NFL in yards rushing allowed. The Browns would like to take
advantage, but they rank 31st in yards rushing gained. What to do,
what to do? Tim Couch, Chad Pennington: Throw deep, young men.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: Third place versus last place. Big deal.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Oakland and Kansas City rank 1-2 in total offense, Rich
Gannon is on pace to break Dan Marino's record for single-season
yards passing (5,084) and Priest Holmes is on pace to break Marshall
Faulk's record for single-season touchdowns (26). And the Raiders
(4-2) and the Chiefs (3-4) are holding down the bottom of the AFC
West. The Raiders also are last in the Teams That Abandoned L.A.
standings, going 0-2 the last two weeks against the Rams and
Chargers. Can they right the ship? Stat: Chiefs yield 38.3 points a

<TE>   Plot: Rodney Peete is out with a knee injury, Chris Weinke is
questionable because of a concussion and Brad Johnson is doubtful
because of a fractured rib. Is there an able-bodied quarterback in
the house? Having thought it over, the Panthers and Buccaneers would
like to make the following announcement: Randy Fasani and Rob Johnson
are the best we can do. Fasani, a rookie from Stanford, went six for
18 subbing for Weinke in Carolina's 30-0 loss to Atlanta last week.

<TE>   Plot: Second cousins and first-string NFL quarterbacks, New
Orleans' Aaron Brooks and Atlanta's Michael Vick meet on the football
field for the first time Sunday -- the first round in what should be
a long and lively in-family rivalry. In an interview with ESPN
magazine, Brooks said Vick "is the better athlete. But as far as
being the pure quarterback, I'm better." Vick: "We're going to be
dealing with this and having fun for a long time. And then, when
we're retired and hopefully both in the Hall of Fame and living near

Sunday. The Bengals also didn't play last Sunday -- right now, "Bye
Week" is the front-runner to kick off the team's 2002 highlight
video. At least the Bengals didn't lose any players high-tailing it
for the border during the off week, although it was close. What
precisely was running back Corey Dillon getting at when he said,
ominously, that the Bengals "better get it right or at the end of the
season I've got a surprise for them"? Is he threatening to pull a

<TE>   Plot: Chicago is 0-4 after starting the season 2-0. Minnesota
started 0-4, is 1-1 since. If timing's everything, the Bears are in
trouble, regardless of who plays quarterback -- Jim Miller,
reportedly recovering from arm tendinitis, or Chris Chandler, who
still might be shellshocked from last week's loss to Detroit. Bear
defensive coordinator Greg Blanche concedes that his players have
"been quite confused the last three weeks. We've been getting calls

<TE>   Plot: After last season's second-round AFC playoff game, the
Steelers and Ravens looked like two franchises speeding in different
directions. The Steelers, 27-10 winners, seemed destined for the
Super Bowl, if not immediately, then the following season. The
Ravens, about to go splat against the salary cap, appeared headed for
a long stint in NFL purgatory. Now, Pittsburgh has switched
quarterbacks and Jerome Bettis is hurt. Baltimore is getting by with
Chris Redman at quarterback and Ray Lewis in street clothes. Both are
3-3, happier news in Baltimore than in Pittsburgh.</TE>

anybody watch?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The records, 4-2 across the board, suggest this is a
must-win game for both teams. But must-see? Did you see last week's
9-6 Arizona victory over Dallas in overtime? Have you seen a worse
NFL game in the last 25 years? Can anyone stomach another four
quarters of Cardinal football? What about San Francisco Giant fans
who might consider watching football before a possible Game 7 of the

<TE>   Plot: Tom Brady and Brian Griese have traveled a long way since
their days in Ann Arbor, and they have the white knuckles to prove
it. Brady was the wonder kid who took the Patriots to the promised
land, and then three more victories to open the season. Since then,
the Patriots are 0-3 and fans have begun to loudly wonder if the
Patriots got rid of the wrong quarterback. Griese barely avoided a
couple of September benchings to reel off four consecutive 300-yard
games. The wild ride continues Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   Plot: Houston played well enough on offense and defense last week
in Cleveland to double its all-time NFL victory total, but the
Texans' not-so-special teams yielded a 95-yard kickoff return and had
a punt blocked inside the Houston 15. Houston lost, 34-17. Coach Dom
Capers is so desperate, he's thinking of restocking his special teams
with starters. "We can't play special teams like we did and win
football games," Capers said. "We're going to address it -- if we
have to put all starters out there, we're going to put the people out
there who give us the best chance."</TE>

<TE>   Plot: Manning never could beat Spurrier when Manning played at
Tennessee and Spurrier coached at Florida, a fact that might have
cost Manning the Heisman, if not a national championship. Manning is
winning again with the Colts and Spurrier is still juggling
quarterbacks with the Redskins -- except Spurrier is 2-4 and
replacing Patrick Ramsey with Shane Matthews is no way to turn it
around. "Our quarterbacks are not bad," Spurrier insists. "They're
pretty good. In two of our six games, our guys have played well."</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Are you ready for a shutout?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In three of their last four games, the Giants have scored 10
points or less. They managed only nine points at home against
Seattle, which takes some doing, and 10 in their next home game
against Atlanta. In between, they lost, 21-7, at Arizona. The Giants
are still in the NFC East race at 3-3, one game behind the Eagles,
who put a serious clampdown on Tampa Bay's offense last Sunday. The
Eagles swept the Giants in 2001 and are still miffed about their 0-9
run against their New Jersey rivals from 1997-2000. It could add up
to long night of nothing for the Giants.</TE>

<HD>Judges Can Find Relief Under Veil of Secrecy</HD>
<DH>Skating officials have given the scoring process an interim
makeover designed to take the pressure off and avoid further
scandals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Hersh</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered by allegations of corrupt judging at the 2002 Winter
Olympics and FBI charges against a reputed Russian organized crime
figure for trying to fix those Olympic results, figure skating
officials have given the sport's judging process a makeover that
could be called the invisibility look.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe the emperor's new clothes.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not a cover-up," insisted Ottavio Cinquanta, president of
the International Skating Union.</LD>
<TE>   But its basic principles can be boiled down to:</TE>
<TE>   What you don't see is what you will get.</TE>
<TE>   What you don't know will help you.</TE>
<TE>   And if you don't like this judging system, wait a few months and
it will change.</TE>
<TE>   Skating's leaders know they must weather the bewilderment that
will occur in a season when two scoring systems are being used and a
third, the system of the future, is being tested at several events.</TE>
<TE>   At Skate America, which opened the Grand Prix skating series
Thursday in Spokane, Wash., results will be determined by an interim
system that keeps the old idea of deducting from a perfect 6.0 but
does not identify which judges gave which scores.</TE>
<TE>   That system also will be used at the other senior Grand Prix
events, the world championships, European championships, Junior Grand
Prix Final and Four Continents Championship.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Championships, nearly all other national championships
and the Junior Grand Prix series events will keep for at least this
season the 6.0 system used for 67 years in which every judge's mark
counts, and the judges are identified.</TE>
<TE>   The interim system, like the revolutionary one Cinquanta said
should be ready for next year's Grand Prix season, relies on secrecy
designed to remove pressure from judges.</TE>
<TE>   French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, at the center of the Winter
Olympic controversy that spurred the changes in judging, claimed she
had experienced such pressure from her national federation, although
she later recanted.</TE>
<TE>   The specter of organized crime added urgency to the calls for
reform.</TE>
<TE>   But the lack of transparency is an issue among U.S. skating judges
and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not comfortable with such secrecy here, but it does help
remove pressure on judges from some national federations," said
Phyllis Howard, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. president and an ISU
council member.</TE>
<TE>   The innovations in the interim system:</TE>
<TE>   From a pool of 10 to 14 judges, seven will be randomly chosen by
computer to have their marks count in all phases of an event. Only
the computer will know which judges were selected.</TE>
<TE>   All the marks, including those that do not count, will be
displayed in ascending order, with no reference to the judge who gave
them.</TE>
<TE>   The scores that count will, as in the past, place skaters relative
to one another -- for example, a skater placed first by four of the
seven will win. The individual placements will not be revealed.</TE>
<TE>   At the judges' event review meeting -- one of the occasions when
Le Gougne said she had felt pressure -- the judges no longer will
discuss or defend particular marks, only the general level of
skating.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Inman of the United States judged under the interim system at
an international event last month and felt the anonymity led to a
"sense of disconnection. I still concentrated very hard, but I didn't
have that edge-of-the-seat feeling I used to get from seeing how my
marks compared to my peers."</TE>
<TE>   The Cinquanta system, approved as a project last June by the ISU
Congress but already included in the 2002-04 general regulations,
completely changes the way skaters are evaluated.</TE>
<TE>   It gives every jump, spin or other technical element a value and a
grade of execution. Another grade will be given for presentation
qualities. Those grades will make up a cumulative score.</TE>
<TE>   Computer analysis of judges' marks over the season will look for
anomalies that call for further investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 1 letter to ISU officials, Cinquanta issued a retort to
criticisms of the efforts toward a new judging system.</TE>
<TE>   He cited remarks by Alexei Yagudin of Russia, reigning men's
Olympic and world champion.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta wrote, "Consideration should be given to the concerns
expressed, even if, I repeat, it is impossible to accept such
criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, competing at Skate America, did not back away from his
earlier stance about the future judging system.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [Cinquanta] wasn't that happy, but I am not going to
change my opinion," Yagudin said. "They should leave the old system.
If judges make mistakes, give them a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "We always wanted to get a 6.0. With the new system, there is the
possibility of an unlimited score, but not the fun of a 6.0."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the charges filed July 31 against alleged
fixer Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov, Cinquanta also responded strongly to
those who suggested the ISU was overlooking evidence of a "fix deal."</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta's Aug. 9 letter to ISU members, office holders and
advisors threatened public castigation of critics "if they fail to
produce the evidence they claim exists."</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta said his reactions were not threats.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one thing to say, 'I don't agree with something,' and
another to try to attack and provoke or try to create weakness in the
ISU," Cinquanta said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to put yourself in my position. Since last summer, we
have been constantly subjected to criticism. This makes it more
difficult to work for a solution."</TE>

<LD>Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, who this year was elected to a second term as
FIFA president despite allegations of financial mismanagement and
corruption, said he will step down in 2006 as head of soccer's
international ruling body.</LD>
<LD>   "I have said I am in the second half of the football game,"
Blatter said in an interview with Sports Business magazine. "From the
very beginning, I said my presidency will not be more than two
mandates.</LD>
<LD>   "I am now in my second mandate and at the end of it I will be 70
years old. I think it will be the correct time then to leave the
organization."</LD>
<TE>   Blatter said he is unconcerned by the worldwide negative publicity
he has received in the wake of several alleged scandals within FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind how I am seen," he said. "I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt Chosen</TE>
<TE>   The Confederation of African Football (CAF) Thursday selected
Egypt as the host nation for the African Nations Cup in 2006, when
the tournament also will serve as qualifying for the World Cup in
Germany later that year.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt received the votes of seven of the 11 CAF executive
committee members present in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   The top five finishers at the 16-nation tournament will advance to

<TE>   Brazil Brutality</TE>
<TE>   Former Brazil national team coach Emerson Leao lashed out at
Brazilian police Wednesday after one of his Santos players was
knocked unconscious by a baton blow and Leao himself was sprayed in
the face with a mace-like substance by police officers trying to
quell a protest.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble started when Santos players protested a late goal
scored by Paysandu that gave it a 2-1 victory at Belem. When several
players confronted an assistant referee, police moved in and Santos
defender Preto was clubbed unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   That sparked a flurry of insults and an assault on police by
Preto's teammates and Leao.</TE>
<TE>   The game was completed after a half-hour delay, and a ranking
police official later said, "Maybe there were some excesses. It will
be investigated."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira Banned</TE>
<TE>   French international Patrick Vieira, the captain of English
Premier League champion Arsenal, was banned for two matches and fined
$38,680 by England's Football Assn. on Thursday for using "insulting
language" toward referee Andy D'Urso after being sent off during a
1-1 tie with Chelsea in September.</TE>

if he belongs to a gang.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't. Instead, Abril is a shining example of what can be
achieved when a teenager is devoted to school and sports.</TE>
<TE>   He's captain for the Wilson High football team, a three-year
starter at linebacker, an honors student, vice president of the
senior class -- and already winner of a $16,000 college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the heart and soul of our team," Coach Eddie
Martinez said. "He's a tough kid but one of the hardest working kids
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Life hasn't been always fair to Abril, whose parents divorced when
he was in sixth grade. He had to take on a leadership role for three
younger brothers.</TE>
<TE>   In junior high, he hung out with a group that didn't appreciate
good grades.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, it wasn't OK to be called a bookworm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Something changed in high school. He started playing football, and
to play he needed good grades. By his sophomore year, he was thinking
of college.</TE>
<TE>   He was awarded a Warren Christopher Scholarship, named for the
former secretary of state and chairman of the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law
firm. Abril, the second recipient from his school, is one of 61
Christopher Scholars. None has dropped out of high school or college.
All come from economically disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Abril wrote an essay explaining how he wanted to become the first
member of his family to attend college.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote how the scholarship was going to open so many doors for
me and set an example for my younger brothers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   College advisor Elsa Gutierrez-Avilas remembers the day Abril
learned of his selection. She pulled him out of class.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me, took a big breath, sat down, his eyes got watery
and he called his mom," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been more influential than his mother, Brenda. She was
married at 15 and gave up her educational options to raise a family.
She has since gained her real estate license and lives in Ontario
with her youngest son, Andrew, 9.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seen me as a single parent struggle," she said. "I have two
jobs trying to support four boys. I've always tried to emphasize if
you get an education, you won't have to work as hard as I have. He's
done a lot to overcome obstacles. I have a lot of faith he's going to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   With $16,000 promised to him if he graduates from high school and
attends college, Abril's motivation to succeed is strong.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured there are so many opportunities out there and I should
take advantage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He saw how another Wilson student and Christopher Scholarship
winner, Emanuel Pleitez, had been accepted to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "He was that bookworm, getting good grades, high test scores, an
all-around athlete," Abril said. "He was an inspiration for me. I saw
everything he did, all the AP classes he took. I figured if he could
do it, why can't I?"</TE>
<TE>   Abril is a friendly, open-minded communicator. Everyone on the
Wilson football team, from the tough guys to the shy reserves, feels
comfortable seeking advice from him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just cool," said younger brother Anthony, 14, a freshman
football player at Wilson. "People can relate to him. He understands
people."</TE>
<TE>   If only Abril could get through to his other teenage brother, who
has been hanging out with the wrong crowd and flirting with trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down with my brother, 'Why did you choose this route?' "
Abril said. "He says, 'It was meant to be. You knew me all my life.'
I look at him, 'What's my excuse for not getting into gangs?' We hung
out with the same friends. Our father was in a gang himself. 'Oh,
we're different people.' Obviously, he wanted to go into gangs. I'm
sorry I couldn't stop him. Every day I hear a siren or helicopter, I
get nervous. I'm scared something might happen to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a smart kid. He's just confused. At one point in his life,
he wasn't able to see the right path, but I think he can achieve
something in life."</TE>
<TE>   Abril has made the right choices because he listens to people
around him.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone and everyone influences me," he said. "My father sat me
down and said, 'Take me as an example. I got into gangs. Look at me
now.' My mother talked to me. She didn't finish high school. She
tells me she wants me to accomplish so much more.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather works every day of the week. He comes home and
he's tired and sits down and talks to me. 'Do me a favor, stay in
school and go to college.' He's worked all his life for our family to
give us opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Abril's father, Jesus, is finishing up a 16-month prison sentence
at the Calipatria State Prison near Palm Springs for possession of a
controlled substance for sale.</TE>
<TE>   He's adamant about not wanting his sons to join him.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a gang," he said. "You know that drugs, gangs, are
only going to take you to places behind bars."</TE>
<TE>   Abril's grandfather, Manuel, works seven days a week fixing
anything and everything. One time he went three consecutive weeks
working 20-hour days. When he's home and sitting in front of the
television set exhausted, he still finds the strength to keep
reminding Jesse about options in life.</TE>
<TE>   "I've told him many times about the difference between good kids
and bad kids," Manuel said. "I tell him, 'You can go to the cemetery,
jail or be a good person.' "</TE>
<TE>   Abril is 5 feet 11, 200 pounds. Every time he steps onto the
football field, he experiences an adrenaline rush. "Football is my
love," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped Wilson to a 4-2 record going into tonight's Northern
League game against perennial champion Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Through football, Abril has learned about responsibility and
respect. He admires Martinez, a Wilson graduate who came back to the
community to coach and serve as a dean.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Martinez is big on being respectful and having good manners,"
he said. "He taught us to play by the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Abril wants to become an architect. There are others in his
neighborhood choosing college as an alternative to gangs. And he
intends to keep encouraging them to fulfill their dreams, just like
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this area," he said. "It's my home. I plan on getting out
but also coming back. I see people working hard to bring us up. I
can't walk away from that. I feel I owe something back."</TE>
<TE>   Abril made a promise to his grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandpa," he said, "when I become an architect, I want you
working for me."</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa had tears of joy.</TE>

<HD>TV's Good Ol' Days, Sort of</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We yearn for the good ol' days. We yearn for the days television gave
us uncluttered postseason baseball coverage.</LD>
<LD>   There was a time of no virtual signage, no sponsored virtual
manager questions, no sponsored in-game summaries, no sponsored
in-game box scores, no sponsored fan-cam, no Fox whoosh sound
effects, no Fox promos and a reasonable number of replays.</LD>
<LD>   Those were the days of Vin Scully's prose and Al Michaels'
understated, appealing style.</LD>
<TE>   Well, on Wednesday night we got a reminder of the way it was.
During Game 4 of the World Series, there was a special media showing
at the ESPN Zone at Downtown Disney in Anaheim of Game 4 of the 1986
American League championship series between the Angels and Boston Red
Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Game 5 is the one everyone remembers, the one in which Dave
Henderson homered off Donnie Moore when the Angels were one out away
from their first World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But Game 4 was also a classic. The Angels tied after trailing,
3-0, going into the bottom of the ninth. Then they won, 4-3, on Bobby
Grich's single off reliever Calvin Schiraldi in the 11th. The victory
gave the Angels a 3-1 lead in the series.</TE>
<TE>   ABC televised the game, and Michaels and Jim Palmer were the
announcers.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, the coverage was much less cluttered. But we missed the
continual graphic at the top of the screen that supplies the score,
the inning, the ball-and-strike count and the speed of the pitch. We
missed some of the sounds of the game that are now picked up by Fox's
strategically placed microphones.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's live telecast of the Game 4 in San Francisco was on at the
same time. The picture was sharper, the images of the players bigger
and the graphics simpler, smaller and less obtrusive than the large
periodic graphics put up during the 1986 telecast.</TE>
<TE>   The replay packages on the live telecast were more sophisticated.
There were sometimes five or six angles. ABC, in 1986, could never
have shown the close-up of Kenny Lofton's fifth-inning bunt rolling
foul and then catching a piece of the line before Troy Glaus could
pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, these days, may overdo shots of stars in the stands, but ABC
overdid shots of Boston starter Roger Clemens' wife in the stands,
particularly when he began to struggle in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we yearn for the good ol' days of baseball on television. But
when you see what it was really like and compare it to today's
high-tech telecasts, it makes one realize that maybe the good ol'
days were not quite as good as we remember.</TE>
<TE>   Critics' Target</TE>
<TE>   It's fashionable this time of year to bash Fox's Tim McCarver.
This is his 18th season as a network baseball commentator and his
13th World Series, but he continues to draw criticism from around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe only Howard Cosell has been on the receiving end of so many
barbs.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, McCarver isn't perfect. He can make a point, then beat it to
death. But does he really deserve the bashing he receives? He comes
into games well prepared, has an abundance of knowledge, isn't afraid
to express an opinion and makes good points.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when Jeff Kent flied out to Tim Salmon in shallow
right field Wednesday night and Lofton scored easily from third,
McCarver pointed out that Salmon was too far under the ball when he
caught it to make a good throw. And Salmon's throw was awful.</TE>
<TE>   But still there will be those who will turn down the volume on
their TV and listen on radio.</TE>
<TE>   Those people will find the television coverage a few seconds
behind the radio coverage. That's because the TV signal has to travel
32,000 miles to a communication satellite and then back again before
reaching your home.</TE>
<TE>   Sidelined</TE>
<TE>   NBC's versatile Tom Hammond, who is recovering from recent heart
surgery, will miss Saturday's Breeders' Cup but still will be a part
of the five-hour telecast, via taped pieces from his home in
Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Producer David Michaels said, "He's in great shape for somebody
who's been through so much."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bob Costas, working his first Breeders' Cup, will be
sitting in Hammond's co-host chair next to Charlsie Cantey, Costas
will not be assuming the duties that Hammond usually has. Costas is
not the horseracing expert that Hammond is.</TE>
<TE>   Others on the telecast will have expanded roles.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cantey, "People keep asking me the same question, 'Who will
replace Tom Hammond?' I've only had one answer. Nobody. It's not
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Huge Turnout</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pells may not have been recognizable to the general public,
but his stature in the sports-television business was evident at his
funeral at Elden Memorial Park in Northridge earlier this week. There
was an overflow turnout of around 400 that included some of the
biggest names in L.A. sports.</TE>
<TE>   Pells, 50, a producer for Fox Sports Net and a statistician for a
number of local announcing teams, had heart surgery on Oct. 15, the
same day Hammond had heart surgery in Lexington. Pells died of
complications following the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   His pall bearers included Tom Lasorda and Reggie Smith. Speakers
at the funeral included Smith, Larry Kahn and Bob Miller. Ron Cey,
Tommy Hawkins, Al Downing, Dodger executive Derrick Hall, Paul
Sunderland, Stu Lantz, Bill Macdonald and Chris Marlowe were just a
few of the others who attended the service.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has set up a scholarship fund for Pells' young
sons, Drew and J.T., at the Bank of America on Rinaldi Street in
Northridge. Details: Jessie Candon (818) 379-6401.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's Laker exhibition game against Sacramento at Staples
Center will be televised by ESPN and Fox Sports Net. ESPN will be
trying out some of the new bells and whistles it will use during the
regular season.... The Lakers' season opener Tuesday night against
San Antonio, which will include the championship ring ceremony, will
be televised only on TNT. The opening night exclusivity was part of
TNT's new television contract with the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Marge Hearn will be on hand to accept her late husband's ring
Tuesday night.... The Lakers announced Thursday that Chick Hearn
would be honored in a ceremony Nov. 24, before a game against
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' opener will be the second game of a TNT doubleheader.
During halftime of the first game, Philadelphia-Orlando, TNT will
show a live performance by Santana and pop singer Michelle Branch
singing their hit single, "The Game of Love," at Staples Center....
The TNT coverage that night will include a number of "Love It Live"
spots, including one featuring the Rolling Stones.</TE>
<TE>   The process of selecting the Laker Girls is the topic of a
one-hour show, "Showtime Dreams," on Fox Sports Net Sunday at 5 p.m.
It will also be on Fox Sports Net 2 Monday at 8 p.m.... Jim Rome's
final edition of "The Last Word" for Fox Sports Net will be Nov. 1.
He is leaving television for the time being to devote his time to his
national radio show.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN got a 4.1 cable rating for Notre Dame-Air Force on Saturday,
the network's highest rating for a regular-season college football
game since 1999. ESPN is averaging a 2.0 for college football this
season, a 6% increase over last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' season opener, Wednesday night against Cleveland at
Staples Center, will not be televised. The Clippers, seeking a
Laker-type deal, are not making headway with Fox Sports Net. The
problem is, the Clippers aren't selling championships, they're
selling expectations.</TE>

<KH>UCLA NOTES</KH>
<HD>Stanford Has Plans for Moore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Moore, meet Matt Leonard.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA quarterback was a skinny eighth-grader living in Newhall
when Leonard was a star senior defensive lineman at nearby Palmdale
High in 1998. Their paths never crossed.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, however, Leonard, now a star senior defensive lineman
for Stanford, and his teammates will do their best to make Moore's
UCLA debut miserable.</LD>
<TE>   Moore, 18, is expected to start ahead of two other freshmen, and
Stanford is certain to try to confuse him with stunts and blitzes.
But most of the time, the quarterback will get a call from the
sideline, walk up to the ball and run the play regardless of the
defensive alignment.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have fewer formations and motion, a lot of the things
that could confuse him," Coach Bob Toledo said. "We've narrowed down
the checks and audible opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson has recovered enough from a slightly separated shoulder
to back up Moore. Olson has not practiced much this week, though he
ran plays with the goal-line offense Thursday. John Sciarra will play
only if Moore and Olson are unable to.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surgery on the right leg of senior quarterback Cory Paus on
Thursday was more complicated than expected and his recovery is
expected to take eight to 10 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, injured last Saturday against California, had expressed hope
that he could return in time for the last regular-season game against
Washington State on Dec. 7, but that will not be possible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toledo told the players after practice not to allow themselves to
be distracted by unsubstantiated rumors and accusations on Internet
message boards.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors, especially, have done a good job of focusing on
practice and not letting people who are trying to distract us do so,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   An example was an anonymous post on a message board accusing
Toledo of having knowledge of players' use of handicapped parking
placards before the issue became public in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo did not consider the accusation worthy of a response, but
athletic department officials discussed the charge and determined it
was old news.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a heads-up from university police that they were doing
checks on [the use of handicapped placards] and Bob told the team
that if anyone was using one to cease and desist," Associate Athletic
Director Marc Dellins said. "But were we aware of the number of
players using them or the specifics? No."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's homecoming parade, featuring floats and marching bands,
will begin tonight at 8 at Gayley and Weyburn avenues in Westwood
Village.... Walk-on defensive lineman Matt Kocher has left the team.</TE>

<HD>Gauchos Serve Up School's Best Start</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Santa Barbara's arena, nicknamed the Thunderdome for its raucous
fans, figures to be at a fever pitch tonight when the Gauchos play
Long Beach State in a matchup of top 10 women's volleyball teams.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara is 19-0 overall and leads the Big West Conference by
1 1/2 games, thanks to a five-game win at Long Beach on Sept. 27 that
ended the 49ers' 30-match home winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-ranked Gauchos are off to their best start in school
history. That apparently is news to Coach Kathy Gregory, who is
690-291 in 28 seasons but has not been to a volleyball Final Four.</LD>
<TE>   "I never really care about predictions or rankings," Gregory said.
"Did I know we'd be 19-0? No. Is it the most important thing? No.
We're just sort of enjoying each thing as it comes along."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach has been saddled with injuries, the temporary
ineligibility of star outside hitter Lindsay Phillips and a lineup
full of new faces. Yet the seventh-ranked 49ers are 18-1 and now have
Phillips back in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just started to look like Long Beach State again," said
Coach Brian Gimmillaro, who got the 500th victory of his career last
week. "We're not us yet, but we're showing glimpses of being us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With victories over Stanford and California last weekend, the UCLA
men's soccer team returned to the top five in the National Soccer
Coaches Assn. of America rankings heading into Pacific 10 Conference
matches today at Oregon State and Sunday at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-ranked Bruins (8-1-2, 3-0-0) lead the Pac-10 after the
two home wins. Jimmy Frazelle scored 1 minute 47 seconds into
overtime to defeat the then-No. 1-ranked Cardinal, 1-0. Matt Taylor
scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory over the 13th-ranked Golden
Bears. UCLA is 4-1-1 against top-ranked teams since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA has declared USC freshman middle blocker Bibiana Candelas
eligible for competition. The NCAA had looked into her eligibility
once she arrived in September after playing for Mexico in the world
championships. She joined the top-ranked Trojans on their trip to
Washington and Washington State this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six teams remain in contention for the Big West Conference women's
soccer title, including surprising Long Beach State. The 49ers
(5-7-4, 3-0-2) have rallied from an 0-5-1 start and defeated
defending conference champion Cal State Fullerton last week on Abie
Curry's goal in the final minute of regulation.... The Pepperdine
women's soccer team went to Portland last Sunday and upset the
second-ranked Pilots, 2-0. The Waves (12-1-2, 2-1-0 in West Coast
Conference) host defending national champion Santa Clara today.</TE>

<HD>It's Oregon or Bust for MacKenzie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only one current USC player knows the joy that comes from defeating
Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Fullback Malaefou MacKenzie, a sixth-year senior, was a true
freshman playing for Coach John Robinson in 1997 when he started at
tailback in the Trojans' 24-22 victory at the Coliseum. USC has since
lost four consecutive games against the Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   "I just remember it was great feeling to win -- and I can't
believe I'm the only one," said MacKenzie, who was granted an extra
season of eligibility by the NCAA because of injuries and the death
of his father. "I guess we'll have to change that on Saturday."</LD>
<TE>   Though he is the longest tenured player in USC's program,
MacKenzie will play at Autzen Stadium for the first time on Saturday
when the 15th-ranked Trojans play No. 14 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie missed the 1998 and 1999 games at Oregon because of
injuries. He played against the Ducks in 2000 at the Coliseum, but
missed last season's game at Oregon while attending his father's
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone tells me it's pure pandemonium, like Kansas State, but
10 times louder. That's awesome. When you make a play you can silence
their crowd," he said.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie began the season in a rotation at tailback with Sultan
McCullough and Justin Fargas. With McCullough emerging as the primary
ballcarrier, MacKenzie started at fullback last week against
Washington. He has rushed for 102 yards, caught 21 passes for 250
yards and scored three touchdowns this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever they need me is fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver D. Hale said he is ready to play despite practicing only
two days since breaking a bone in his left ankle during training
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Hale took repetitions with the offense and spent extra time
catching and returning punts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little out of shape, but I'm not out there huffing and
puffing," Hale said. "My speed is coming back. I feel real fluid and
mobile."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua did not practice and, as was
expected when he had knee surgery earlier this month, will probably
redshirt.... Kicker David Davis, who was bothered Wednesday by pain
in his right non-kicking foot, was not scheduled to travel to Oregon.
That, however, could change today depending on the condition of
receiver Sandy Fletcher, who re-injured his sprained left ankle in
practice.... Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers (bruised knee) practiced
and will probably start against Oregon.... Wide receiver Kareem Kelly
did not practice but will play Saturday. Kelly and Oregon receiver
Keenan Howry have caught passes in 42 games in a row. Each needs one
catch Saturday for a Pacific 10 Conference reception record....
Sophomore defensive tackle Shaun Cody had knee surgery.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES</KH>
<HD>Rodriguez Might Not Get Much Rest This Winter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For the most precious of young arms among the Angels, the season will
not end this weekend. Francisco Rodriguez plans to pitch winter ball
in his homeland, and his Venezuelan team already is touting his
upcoming arrival.</LD>
<LD>   To the world, Rodriguez is baseball's newest pitching sensation.
The Angels, however, do not forget the two years that preceded this
one, years in which his career was stalled by recurrent bouts of
tendinitis in his pitching elbow and shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, 20, has pitched 104 innings this season. In his three
previous professional seasons, he never threw more than 114 innings.
While the Angels appreciate his desire to pitch at home, pitching
coach Bud Black is wary of the additional strain on such a young and
valuable arm.</LD>
<TE>   "I would advise him to be very concerned about how much he throws
in winter ball," Black said. "I don't want him to be overworked."</TE>
<TE>   Although Rodriguez said he would skip winter ball if the Angels
asked -- "I have a boss like anybody else," he said -- General
Manager Bill Stoneman said he is not uneasy about it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels cannot prevent Rodriguez from playing, Stoneman said.
He also said he trusts Bobby Cuellar, the pitching coach of
Rodriguez's winter team and a pitching coach for the Montreal Expos
when Stoneman worked there, to look out for the best interests of the
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez threw more sliders than fastballs in Game 4 of the World
Series, when he was the losing pitcher. He said the pitch selection
did not reflect fatigue in his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt fine," he said. "I can't throw fastballs every time. Last
time, I threw them a lot of fastballs, and I thought they would be
waiting for a fastball. I try to mix it up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels win Game 6 and force a decisive Game 7, Manager Mike
Scioscia said Thursday the pitcher in Game 7 would be listed as
"staff." Translation: The entire staff will be available.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have not decided whether Ramon Ortiz or John Lackey
would start Game 7. They might not decide until after Game 6, because
they might need to use Lackey in relief of Kevin Appier that day.
Ortiz, bothered by tendinitis in his right wrist during his Game 3
start, is expected to be available. He played catch Thursday and
might throw in the bullpen today. Jarrod Washburn is expected to be
available in relief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he is confident Appier can bounce back and keep the
Angels' season alive when he starts Game 6. The Angels have no other
option besides Appier, who got six outs in his Game 2 start while
giving up five runs.</TE>
<TE>   "He just made bad pitches," Scioscia said. "He could have gone out
there with no scouting report or the best scouting report in the
world. If you're not executing pitches, it doesn't make a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he offered a few words of reassurance to catcher
Bengie Molina, who blamed himself for the Angels' 4-3 defeat in Game
4. Molina's passed ball allowed J.T. Snow to advance to second base,
from where he scored the winning run on a single by David Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a news conference Thursday whether he was thinking about
winning the Gold Glove award, Molina said, "Not right now, after I
let that fastball get away yesterday."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With this ongoing SoCal lovefest with the Angels and Mike Scioscia, I
can see why you have refused to print any of my previous letters
critical of his handling of the pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   Well, I hope his good luck horseshoe is still working after his
decision to pitch John Lackey on short rest. The kid was obviously
out of gas early. If Scioscia insists on starting his top double-A
pitcher Kevin Appier, it should have been in Game 4, up two games to
one. Now they come back to Anaheim, down 3-2, with Appier scheduled
in Game 6.</LD>
<LD>   Hopefully Scioscia will come to his senses and Saturday go with
Francisco Rodriguez for three or four, Lackey for two or three, and
then the bullpen</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's picture of Dusty Baker's kid retrieving a bat was cute,
but what's the point of ripping David Eckstein? I had to make sure I
didn't buy the San Francisco Chronicle by mistake. Or maybe T.J.
Simers wrote the caption. No class, guys!</TE>

<TE>   You members of the media are so gullible. It's obvious Nolan Ryan
couldn't care less about the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you discount the lame excuses as to why Ryan can't throw
out a first pitch (he has to baby-sit his grandchildren with his
wife, or, he has a vacation planned) it's what, a 2 1/2-hour flight
from Texas to Orange County? He could throw out the first pitch and
probably make it home by the end of the game.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not buying the "previous commitments" line and you shouldn't
either.</TE>

<TE>   To typical Dodger fan Beverly Chance of Glendale who thinks
"Southern California is Los Angeles," even though by land area, L.A.
is less than 1% of Southern California: I'm sure you also think
baseball is the Dodgers, even though 24 of the 29 other major league
teams have won more postseason games since 1988 than the 0-6 Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   To answer Brian Hittelman of Playa del Rey who asks how many Angel
fans "are Laker (or Clipper) fans": We Angel fans hate the Lakers,
because our radio station cut short an Angel postgame show after a
postseason win against the Yankees to broadcast a Laker preseason
game. (But we're tickled pink that the Clippers have also won more
postseason games since 1988 than the Dodgers.)</TE>
<TE>   Deal with that!</TE>

<TE>   I have always enjoyed T. J. Simers (yes, I'm the one) and found
his column amusing. I can forgive his negativity seeing as he comes
to us from San Diego. Houston Mitchell is another thing entirely; not
wholly positive in attitude (hates Tim McCarver) but absolutely
hilarious in the humorous asides he includes in "Play by Play."</TE>

<LD>Some memorable moments in World Series Game 5 history:</LD>
<LD>   1905 -- Christy Mathewson shut out the Philadelphia Athletics,
2-0, to give the New York Giants the Series in five games. All were
shutouts, with Mathewson getting three, Joe McGinnity one, and Chief
Bender of Philadelphia one.</LD>
<LD>   1956 -- Don Larsen of the New York Yankees pitched the only
perfect game in Series history, striking out pinch-hitter Dale
Mitchell to end the game and give New York a 3-2 lead over the
Brooklyn Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   1969 -- The New York Mets won their fourth consecutive game from
the Baltimore Orioles, 5-3, behind Jerry Koosman and took the Series
in five games.</TE>
<TE>   1973 -- The Mets' Jerry Koosman and Tug McGraw combined to pitch a
three-hitter against the Oakland A's and take a 3-2 lead in the
Series.</TE>
<TE>   1981 -- Steve Yeager and Pedro Guerrero hit back-to-back homers in
the seventh inning to lead the Dodgers to a 2-1 victory over the
Yankees and a 3-2 lead in the Series. Ron Cey was beaned by Goose
Gossage.</TE>
<TE>   1984 -- Kirk Gibson hit two home runs to give Detroit an 8-4
victory and the Series in five games over the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   1987 -- The St. Louis Cardinals won their third consecutive home
game to take a 3-2 lead in the Series with a 4-2 victory against the
Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   1988 -- Orel Hershiser pitched a four-hitter and Mickey Hatcher
and Mike Davis hit two-run homers to give the Dodgers a 5-2 victory
over the Oakland A's and the Series title. Hershiser became only the
third player to win the MVP in the playoffs and the World Series.</TE>

<HD>Game 5 Turned Into a Virtual Prison for Audience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The symbolism hung in the air, like a Ben Weber breaking ball, as
Fox's easily distracted cameras took a break from the World Series
action Thursday evening and focused for a few moments on Alcatraz
Island.</LD>
<LD>   The Rock. Hard time. Breaking rocks in the hot sun.</LD>
<LD>   The old federal prison, which once housed some of America's most
dangerous criminals, most closely resembles:</LD>
<TE>   How most of the country east of Las Vegas views this
all-California World Series between the San Francisco Giants (a.k.a.,
Barry Bonds and the guys who don't like him) and the Anaheim Angels
(a.k.a. Snow White and David Eckstein and Some Other Dwarfs).</TE>
<TE>   b) The Giants' clubhouse in the best of times.</TE>
<TE>   c) Where the Angels find themselves in this Series after their
16-4 flogging in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   According to our "Virtual Manager" online poll, 99% of those still
watching after the sixth inning vote for all of the above.</TE>
<TE>   What if they held a World Series and nobody cared? The Angels,
making their first World Series appearance in their 42-year history,
and the Giants, still chasing their first world championship since
moving to San Francisco, figured they were stepping into uncharted
territory, but they never suspected it would look quite this way.</TE>
<TE>   National television ratings are down. Neutral fans are turning off
and tuning out. Sports Illustrated and the Sporting News, the
nation's two most venerable sports weeklies, decided to go with
something else on the covers of their latest editions. With America's
Game deep in the middle of its Fall Classic, SI went with an Asian
import, Yao Ming. The Sporting News, once regarded as the baseball
bible, opted for Terrell Owens, although the editors did take time to
note, in small type above the masthead, "The World Series: What a
start!"</TE>
<TE>   Given the heads-up, curious readers could flip inside to chew on
TSN's exhaustive 5 1/2-page World Series coverage. Hey, the Angels
and Giants ought to be happy.</TE>
<TE>   That's a half a page more than This Week in NASCAR got.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad, because before Thursday, the Angels and Giants had more
than upheld their end. Three one-run games through Game 4. Mammoth
home runs by Bonds. Resilient rallies by the Angels. It was one long,
taut contest of tug-of-war -- Fox doing whatever it could to drive
the audience away, the players and managers doing whatever they could
to bring the audience back.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Game 5, when the Angel pitching staff hit the rocks. It
was a blowout by the sixth inning, with the Giants scoring so many
runs that J.T. Snow had to snatch Dusty Baker's son Darren and pull
him away from home plate, out of harm's way, to avoid being trampled
by an onrushing David Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Fox showed several fine replays of Snow riding to the rescue to
grab young Darren and clinch the seventh Gold Glove of his career.</TE>
<TE>   But Fox is fascinated with children. Its' cartoon sound effects,
big colorful graphics and hyperactive camera cuts are tailor-made for
the Darren Baker demographic. It even devoted part of its pregame
show to this news bulletin: Major league players and managers have
kids! Sometimes they even bring them to games!</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, Dad gets too engrossed in the game to watch every
step the little tyke takes, which is why the first baseman
occasionally has to baby-sit.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of kids misbehaving, hey, how about that Giants'
clubhouse? As the game got out of hand, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver
began detailing the unrest among the Giants. They talked of how the
team's two biggest stars, Bonds and Jeff Kent, hate each other --
complete with footage from their June dugout spat. They talked about
Baker's unhappiness with his unsettled contract negotiations and what
might be next for him after the World Series, win or lose.</TE>
<TE>   McCarver: "Do I think Dusty Baker will be back? No. I think Dusty
Baker will become the next manager of the Seattle Mariners."</TE>
<TE>   Buck: "I agree."</TE>
<TE>   Kent is also a free agent after this season. Bonds is no walk in
the park, but after Thursday night, you can understand why the No. 3
and 4 hitters in the Giants' lineup might not get along. After
hitting a pair of two-run home runs, after breaking out of his
miserable World Series slump, after producing the most significant
performance of his career, Kent refused Fox's request for a postgame
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Break up the Giants?</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels fail this weekend, count on the Giants to take care
of matters themselves very soon.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>I ran into a sportswriter here who doesn't think the word "I" should
appear anywhere in a column. Obviously we were never going to see eye
to eye on this because the pipsqueak is two feet shorter than I am.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm the sensitive sort, as you know, so when evidence mounted,
and I began to hear from e-mailers who felt the same way, saying they
didn't want to read what "I" think about the Giants' perky P.A.
announcer, or how "I" feel about Barry Bonds, "I" listened.</LD>
<LD>   So enough about me today.</LD>
<TE>   Instead this column is going to be all about "The SIMERS Show,"
which makes its national debut on ESPN on Monday, and what impact it
might have on the Angels and their fans.</TE>
<TE>   You would think, of course, the way Thursday's World Series game
was going, an ESPN show of any sort could not be any more boring or
depressing.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the problem. The Angels are still going to win the
World Series, which means there is going to be a parade, and if it's
Monday afternoon how are the Angels going to feel if everyone stays
home to watch, "The SIMERS Show?"</TE>
<TE>   They'll have another parade for the Angels next year when they
repeat as champions, but folks who have seen the TV show in rehearsal
believe there's a good chance it won't make it to Tuesday before
being canceled, which makes Monday the only chance to catch this ESPN
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FACT the Angels made it to the World Series, of course, is the
primary reason why this show is doomed to fail -- that, and ESPN's
insistence to call it something forgettable like, "Around the Horn,"
rather than "The SIMERS Show."</TE>
<TE>   Right from the start Monday everyone on the show is going to want
to talk nice about the Angels and say wonderful things about the
team's dream season, which is going to leave Simers out of the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Then the more knowledgeable and long-winded sports columnists on
the show, such as the Boston Globe's Bob Ryan, the Chicago Sun-Times'
Jay Mariotti and the Dallas Morning News' Tim Cowlishaw are going to
break down the reasons for the Angels' success and the Angels' place
in baseball history, which is going to leave Simers out of the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when Ryan's microphone is open, Simers and everyone
else is going to be left out, because Ryan will work the Celtics into
every conversation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TV executives at ESPN, noting the success of "Pardon the
Interruption," which features an aging sports columnist with an
irritating voice, figured they'd have a hit on their hands if they
hired four aging columnists, one of whom is considered very
irritating.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's no need for a host, ESPN has employed Max
Kellerman, a know-it-all boxing expert who has never left New York,
who looks at best two or three years older than Dusty Baker's child,
but who has the joy-stick experience to score the columnists as they
prattle on.</TE>
<TE>   Kellerman believes this show will propel him to stardom; there's
no question someone is going to replace Bob Barker one day.</TE>
<TE>   If "Around the Horn," which will appear just before PTI, lasts
more than a day, some critic is going to refer to Mariotti sooner or
later as a "blow hard," but probably just because he represents the
Windy City.</TE>
<TE>   Cowlishaw's role, meanwhile, will be limited because he likes to
talk about hockey and auto racing. There will also be appearances by
backups, which is the only way to keep Ryan from talking about the
Celtics every day.</TE>
<TE>   So far there has been no reasonable explanation why Simers is
being included on a show, which features so many sports experts. The
folks at ESPN apparently have never read his column.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a good bet ESPN owner Michael Eisner wasn't consulted.</TE>
<TE>   Simers' earlier abbreviated run on Fox's Southern California
Report has been likened by some in the industry to what Fox has been
giving us every time it goes to the "Pepsi Fan Cam." That leaves only
one explanation for this TV appointment: Everyone else in the Los
Angeles market turned ESPN down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU CAN imagine just how thrilled the Dodgers, Trojans and Sparks
are going to be to learn Simers has been given a national platform.
(I know I feel sorry for them).</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn has to be nervous now that he's compiled a 9.31
earned-run average in two World Series games. Garret Anderson is one
more punchless night in key situations away from the Eric Karros
treatment. Ben Weber is about to know what it feels like to be called
"Paul Shuey."</TE>
<TE>   The truth be told, there's probably only one thing that can keep
this PTI/Sports Reporters' afloat, and that's another Angel
performance akin to Thursday night's debacle.</TE>
<TE>   In fact if there is anything to motivate the Angels at this point
and drive them to greatness, it should be the desire now to give
Simers nothing to ridicule, mock or trash come Monday on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Two more wins and a World Series celebration shuts him up.</TE>
<TE>   One more Angel loss, and you can just hear the garbage he's going
to spew while hooked up to a microphone and what it might do for his
TV career.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't want to see that.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Frank Aguilar:</TE>

<HD>Best Umps Making the Best Calls</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The hustle and correct call by home plate umpire Mike Winters on
Kenny Lofton's fifth-inning bunt single Wednesday night confirmed
what many had already been thinking.</LD>
<LD>   This is one of best-officiated World Series in recent memory.</LD>
<LD>   After four games, there had been no controversial calls, no
screaming managers, scant player griping.</LD>
<TE>   This is not a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   For the third consecutive year, Major League Baseball, after
severely weakening the umpires' union, has been allowed to choose
only the best umpires for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the merit system working at its best," said Ralph Nelson,
umpiring vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old labor agreement, the World Series umpires were
chosen by a rotation based on seniority and other factors. The best
players were there, but the best umpires weren't, resulting in
several renowned bad calls, from now-infamous names such as Don
Denkinger.</TE>
<TE>   But several years ago, after many umpires quit during a failed
union power play, baseball officials merged umpires from both leagues
and set up new rules.</TE>
<TE>   One of those rules was that the umpires would be rated during the
season and given spots in the World Series based only on ability.</TE>
<TE>   "This raised the level of umpiring not just in the series, but
overall, because now everyone had motivation to take their game to
the next level," said Steve Palermo, umpiring supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   The only restrictive rule under the new agreement is that umpires
cannot work consecutive World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we don't have 12 good umpires, then we're in trouble
anyway," Nelson said.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The costume was bought a year ago. It was going to be for Halloween.
But you know how 7-year-olds are. Liam Parsekian never dressed in the
monkey suit. It hung in his closet at home in Laguna Niguel until the
baseball playoffs started.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, that monkey costume looks just like the rally monkey,"
Liam Parsekian told his dad, Thomas, a Laguna Niguel attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Liam would know. His family has season tickets right behind home
plate. Liam loves the rally monkey and he asked Thomas if he could
bring the suit to the playoffs. Liam followed the rally monkey rules,
didn't put the suit on until after the sixth inning, only if the
Angels were behind.</LD>
<TE>   And now Liam is a star. He and Thomas were flown to New York this
week so Liam could be on "The Caroline Rhea Show." He has been on CBS
and NBC morning shows locally.</TE>
<TE>   But more meaningful than anything was the call the Parsekians got
Thursday. Officials at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana asked if
Liam could come to the hospital Saturday morning. Dressed as the
rally monkey, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the greatest thing," Thomas Parsekian said. "This
whole thing has been amazing, how it's taken off. It really was just
a boy who wanted to be the rally monkey. The people at the hospital
thought that if Liam came and passed out rally monkeys to the sick
kids, it would really make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Liam also has been asked to shoot a remote in front of Edison
Field Saturday for a San Francisco station. And he was such hit on
"The Caroline Rhea Show" that Liam and Thomas are being flown back to
New York for a Monday appearance. Either the Angels will be World
Series champions or looking forward to trying again next year.</TE>
<TE>   ALL CLEAR: Bobby Grich was a member of the Angels' 1979, 1982 and
1986 American League West-champion teams that tasted bitter
disappointment in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost to Baltimore in the 1979 AL championship series,
blew a two-games-to-none lead and lost to Milwaukee in the 1982 AL
championship series and were one strike away from the World Series in
1986 before Dave Henderson's homer off Donnie Moore in Game 5 of the
AL championship series sparked Boston's comeback from a
three-games-to-one deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Grich returned to the Angels in February, working as a part-time
on-field instructor in spring training and for the marketing and
public relations departments during the season, and he has been
traveling with the Angels throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose against the Giants in the World Series, Grich, who
started the Angels' alumni association this season, believes these
Angels have eased the frustration of those who stumbled before them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone associated with Angel baseball felt the weight off their
shoulders as far as the fortunes of this franchise," Grich said. "It
cleared the air, the blanket has been lifted, the curse is gone. They
got to the World Series. They've exorcised all the ghosts. There's
nothing but a green light ahead."</TE>

<KH>GAME 5 AT PACIFIC BELL PARK SAN FRANCISCO 16, ANGELS 4</KH>
<HD>Crunched Time</HD>
<DH>Giants pound Washburn and take a 3-2 advantage back to
Anaheim</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For the first time this season, and perhaps for the first time in his
life, there was no confidence in his voice. He coughed, still
fighting off a bout with flu. He spoke quietly. He wore defeat on his
face, uneasily.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the Angels will play a must-win game. If they win,
they will play another must-win game Sunday. If they lose either
game, the San Francisco Giants will be World Series champions, and
the Wisconsin winter will be a long and lonely one for Jarrod
Washburn.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants pounded Washburn and crushed the Angels, 16-4, in Game
5 on Thursday. San Francisco leads the best-of-seven series, three
games to two, with two of those victories over the Angels' ace. In
the most critical game of his season, the Giants routed him for three
runs in the first inning and three more in the second.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if I can put into words how disappointing it is,"
Washburn said. "Every guy in this room is counting on me. I'm
expected to do the job, being the ace and all that.</TE>
<TE>   "For me to lose two games in the World Series and let these guys
down, I can't put into words how bad I feel."</TE>
<TE>   He won 18 games this season, including 12 in a row. The Angels
might well use him in relief in Game 7, but he did not embrace that
possibility Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if they'll want to put me out there Sunday," he
said. "If I'm called upon, I will."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent hit two home runs, Rich Aurilia one, Barry Bonds none.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels never appeared more helpless than in the seventh
inning, when they stacked three infielders between first base and
second and Bonds still grounded a single into right field.</TE>
<TE>   Who's going to stop them? Washburn, the ace, has tried twice,
failed twice. Kevin Appier, who starts Game 6, failed to survive the
third inning in Game 2. Francisco Rodriguez, the formerly untouchable
reliever, was the losing pitcher in Game 4. If he appears in Game 6,
closer Troy Percival will be working for the first time in six days
and the second time in 13 days.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels win Game 6, they could start Ramon Ortiz, bothered
by tendinitis, or John Lackey, on three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was so ineffective in the first two innings that Manager
Mike Scioscia would have been justified in yanking him for a
pinch-hitter in the third, thus preserving the option of starting him
on two days' rest in a possible Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   But Scioscia refused to throw in the towel on Game 5 so soon.
Washburn silenced the Giants in the third and fourth innings, facing
the minimum six batters. The Angels roared back, bringing the tying
run to the plate in the fifth inning and again in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels found themselves in an unenviable -- and thoroughly
unfamiliar -- position. In the World Series, they never had trailed
by more than three runs. In the league championship series, they
never had trailed by more than two.</TE>
<TE>   Never in a brutal September schedule did they find themselves so
far behind. The last time they trailed by six runs was Aug. 17, in a
9-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians, a game also started by Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   This has not been a World Series dominated by starting pitching.
In five games, the Angel starters have posted a 9.14 earned-run
average, the Giant starters an 8.72 ERA. No starter has pitched past
the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco starter Jason Schmidt appeared headed in that
direction Thursday, with a 6-0 lead and seven strikeouts through four
innings, on a fastball clocked as high as 98 mph. But Schmidt failed
even to survive the minimum five innings required to earn the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels chased Schmidt by scoring three runs in the fifth
inning. Orlando Palmeiro started the inning with a pinch-hit double.
The Angels scored on a wild pitch by Schmidt, a sacrifice fly by
Darin Erstad and a double by Troy Glaus, and the Giant lead was
halved to 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   After Scott Spiezio walked, bringing the tying run to the plate,
the Giants replaced Schmidt with left-hander Chad Zerbe. Adam
Kennedy, who does not start against left-handers, flied out for the
final out.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rallied again in the sixth inning. Bengie Molina led
off with a single, and pinch-hitter Benji Gil doubled Molina to
third. Each of the next three batters represented the tying run; each
made out.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein grounded out, scoring Molina to cut the San
Francisco lead to 6-4. Erstad grounded out weakly. Felix Rodriguez
replaced Zerbe and got Tim Salmon to ground out.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' hopes had risen quickly; the Giants would snuff out
those hopes just as quickly. The Giants pounded ex-teammate Ben Weber
for five runs in 1 1/3 innings, and the 11-4 lead persuaded Scioscia
to let long reliever Scot Shields make his first appearance of the
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, the problem for the Angels was not that Shields was
pitching in the seventh inning. The problem was that Shields was
warming up in the second, behind the ace of the staff.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants batted around in the first inning, standing around for
most of the inning while Washburn struggled to find home plate. He
tied two World Series records, with four walks in an inning and with
three consecutive walks.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, none of those walks went to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton singled to start the inning, and Erstad robbed Aurilia of
an extra-base hit with a splendid running catch. Kent fell behind
0-2, then Washburn walked him. Bonds doubled home the first run, and
Benito Santiago drove home another with a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn then walked the next three batters. The last walk, to
David Bell, forced home a run, and the Giants led 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning, the Giants loaded the bases, and again
Erstad robbed Aurilia of an extra-base hit with a magnificent catch.
But Santiago singled home two runs, on a pitch clocked at 100 mph.
That would be a generous measure for Washburn, but the reading
offered an indication that his fastball lacked movement, overtaken by
adrenaline. Reggie Sanders drove home another run with a sacrifice
fly, for a 6-0 lead.</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Future crooners, take note of LeAnn
Rimes. That is how you sing the "Star Spangled Banner." David
Eckstein singled to center. Darin Erstad grounded into a 4-6 force
play. Tim Salmon struck out swinging. Joe Buck and Tim McCarver are
comparing Garret Anderson to a "young Barry Bonds". Yeah, right. We
all envision Anderson hitting 73 homers one day. Anderson singled to
center, Erstad to second. Troy Glaus struck out swinging. No runs,
two hits, two left.</LD>
<LD>   GIANTS: Giants 3, Angels 0 -- Kenny Lofton hit a foul into the
first row of seats down the first-base line. This guy had it go in
and out of his glove. Here's the question: How did Billy Ashley get
such good seats? Lofton singled to right. Rich Aurilia flied to
right-center. Jeff Kent walked. Barry Bonds doubled down the
right-field line, Lofton scoring, Kent to third. Benito Santiago
flied to left, Kent scoring. Reggie Sanders was intentionally walked.
J.T. Snow walked, loading the bases. David Bell walked on four
pitches, Bonds scoring. Jason Schmidt struck out swinging. Three
runs, two hits, three left.</LD>

<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 3, Angels 0 -- Scott Spiezio struck out swinging,
Adam Kennedy grounded to first and Bengie Molina struck out swinging.
No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 6, Angels 0 -- Lofton hit a foul popup that
Eckstein should have caught, but didn't. Lofton then singled to
center. Aurilia hit a liner to right-center, Erstad made a nice
diving catch. Kent doubled off the right-field wall. The ball hit
Salmon on the rebound, otherwise it would have been a triple and
Lofton would have scored. Instead, he had to hold at third. Bonds was
walked intentionally. Fox Instapoll: "Should Mike Scioscia warm up
his bullpen now?" Actually, it would probably be best if the bullpen
catchers warmed up the bullpen and Scioscia stayed in the dugout.
Santiago singled to center, Lofton and Kent scored, Santiago took
second on Erstad's poor throw home. Sanders flied to center, Bonds
scoring, Santiago to third. Snow popped to shallow center. Three
runs, three hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 6, Angels 0 -- Jarrod Washburn grounded to short.
Why is Washburn hitting? Scot Shields hasn't pitched in weeks, he
probably would be more effective than Washburn right now. It's 6-0!
Eckstein walked. Eckstein stole second. Erstad hit a pop fly that
landed between third, short and left field, Eckstein to third. Salmon
struck out swinging. Anderson flied to right. If you hit for the
pitcher leading off the inning, maybe you score a couple of runs. No
runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 6, Angels 0 -- Bell singled into the shortstop
hole. Washburn has given up six hits and five walks. Schmidt
sacrificed. Lofton grounded to second, Bell to third. Aurilia flied
to center. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 6, Angels 0 -- Glaus struck out swinging. Spiezio
walked. San Francisco 49er receiver Terrell Owens is at the game. He
was on a cell phone, probably lining up a deal with the fine folks at
Bic. There were about eight people in the shot with Owens, and four
of them were on cell phones. If you want to talk on the phone, STAY
HOME! Kennedy struck out swinging. Molina popped to second. No runs,
no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 6, Angels 0 -- Kent flied to right. Bonds hit a
check-swing fly ball to left. The Taco Bell target is back! Where are
the Del Taco people? Why aren't they getting in on this? Santiago
grounded to third. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 6, Angels 3 -- Orlando Palmeiro, batting for
Washburn, doubled to right. Eckstein singled off the glove of Bell,
Palmeiro to third. Erstad flied to deep right, Palmeiro scoring.
Salmon singled to center, Eckstein beat Lofton's throw to third.
Eckstein scored on a wild pitch. Salmon took second. Time for another
Fox "Virtual Manager." Instead of that, can't Fox replace Tim
McCarver with a "Virtual Analyst"? Anderson struck out swinging.
Glaus doubled off the painting of a car that is on the left-field
fence, Salmon scored. Does this mean everyone in America gets a free
car? C'mon, BMW, you can afford it. Free cars for everyone! Spiezio
walked. Chad Zerbe pitching. Kennedy flied to center. Three runs,
four hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 6, Angels 3 -- Brendan Donnelly pitching. Or, as
McCarver called him, Brian Donnelly. Sanders struck out. On the Fox
"Fan Cam," they showed Dusty Baker. Huh? Did he pay to get in? Snow
struck out. Bell fouled to first. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 6, Angels 4 -- Molina singled to center. Benji Gil,
batting for Donnelly, doubled to center on a ball Lofton should have
caught. Molina to third. Eckstein grounded to short, Molina scored,
Gil to third. Erstad hit a slow roller to the pitcher, who tagged
Erstad going by. Gil held at third. Nice play by Zerbe. Felix
Rodriguez pitching. Tsuyoshi Shinjo to right field. Salmon swung at a
3-and-0 pitch and grounded to third. Rodriguez just came in, and
Salmon swings at a 3-and-0 pitch. Not a smart at-bat. One run, two
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 8, Angels 4 -- They just showed a nice, uplifting
John Hancock commercial, in which the mother has Alzheimer's and
doesn't recognize her daughter. Who wants to watch baseball after
that? Ben Weber pitching. Shinjo struck out looking. Lofton grounded
to second. Aurilia singled to left. Kent homered to left center.
Bonds doubled to left-center. The wheels are coming off now. Shawon
Dunston, batting for Rodriguez, struck out. Two runs, three hits, one
left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 8, Angels 4 -- Tim Worrell pitching. Anderson
popped to third. Glaus struck out swinging. Spiezio grounded to
first. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 12, Angels 4 -- The Taco Bell target is sinking! To
be fair, they should give a free taco to everyone now. After all,
maybe someone would have hit the target if it stayed afloat. You know
that someone is planning a class-action suit on that right now. Snow
singled to center. Bell was hit by a pitch. On the Fox "Sounds of the
Game," they showed Gene Clines sniffing a broken bat. Kids, this is
your brain, this is your brain after sniffing a bat. Any questions?
Shinjo sacrificed. Lofton tripled off the right-field fence. Snow and
Bell scored. Dusty Baker's little kid ran to home plate to get the
bat while the play was in progress. Snow, while scoring, scooped the
kid up, saving him from being run over by Bell. One thing you can say
for the kid: He blocks the plate better than Molina. Shields
pitching. Shawn Wooten at first. Aurilia struck out. Kent homered to
left. Bonds singled to center. Santiago grounded to short. Four runs,
four hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 12, Angels 4 -- Kennedy grounded to first. Molina
flied to right. Wooten singled to center. Eckstein struck out
swinging. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 16, Angels 4 -- Alex Ochoa to right. Jose Molina
catching. Pedro Feliz, batting for Worrell, flied to right. Snow
singled to right. Bell singled sharply to center. Shinjo hit a
bad-hop grounder that Glaus couldn't field for an error, Snow scoring
on a close play at the plate. Dusty's son would have stopped him from
scoring. Lofton grounded to second, both runners advanced. Aurilia
homered to left. This is embarrassing. Kent flied to left. Four runs,
four hits.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 16, Angels 4 -- Scott Eyre pitching. Erstad struck
out. Ochoa flied to right. Anderson grounded to second. No runs, no
hits.</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   Trailing, 6-0, after two, the Angels had crept back into the game
and were down by only two when Jeff Kent hit a two-out, two-run homer
in the sixth to give the Giants an 8-4 lead. They never looked back
from that point, as Kent added another two-run home run in the
Giants' four-run seventh inning.</LD>

THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   With Kevin Appier and Ramon Ortiz scheduled for Games 6 and 7, the
Angels needed a big game from their ace, Jarrod Washburn. They didn't
get it. Washburn gave up six runs, six hits and five walks in four
innings and didn't fool any of the Giant hitters. His poor outing
also taxed the Angel bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>*--*
DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   After the first three games of the World Series, the Angels were
hitting .353 and averaging eight runs a game. Many were comparing
them to the greatest offenses in World Series history. In the last
two games, the Angels are hitting .286 and have scored a combined
seven runs. Fans of the '27 Yankees can rest easy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

NOT IN BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   J.T Snow made the play of the Series in the seventh inning. He
saved Dusty Baker's son from serious injury when he scooped him up
while scoring. Baker's son, only 3 years old, had run out to get the
bat and ran right into the middle of the play. Baker didn't seem too
concerned by the incident, but it was a scary moment.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco Getting a Giant Lift From Lofton</HD>
<DH>After going one for 12 in the first three games, he is six
for 10 with four runs scored in last two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- It appears the Angels suddenly have forgotten how to
pitch to Kenny Lofton, and that's great news for the San Francisco
Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Angels just figured Lofton was finished after his shaky
performance early in the World Series, but things have clearly
changed.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels might consider refocusing on the rejuvenated leadoff
batter, who turned back the clock again Thursday night in the Giants'
16-4 rout in Game 5 at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Lofton ignited the Giant offense and a black-and-orange-clad crowd
of 42,713, going three for six with three runs and two runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   He singled and scored in the first and second innings as the
Giants raced to 6-0 lead against Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn,
applying pressure and setting a positive tone for the pitching staff.
It didn't matter that right-hander Jason Schmidt was chased after
only 4 2/3 innings, because the Giants were rolling with Lofton in
high gear for the second game in a row. Not bad for a 35-year-old
leadoff batter who appeared even older in the first three games.</TE>
<TE>   "Just trying to put the ball in play," said Lofton, batting .318
in the World Series. "Once you put the ball in play, a lot of things
can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Good things are happening for the Giants, who hold a 3-2 lead in
the best-of-seven series as they return to Edison Field for Game 6 on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny definitely is the sparkplug of this team," right fielder
Reggie Sanders said. "He goes out and does the necessary things to
get on base and create a lot of havoc. What we've seen the last
couple of games are the results of him doing that.</TE>
<TE>   "He's swinging the bat extremely well and that's definitely a good
thing to see him do. Tonight, he was great. Kenny was just great all
game, and that's what we've seen the last couple of nights. We needed
this right now."</TE>
<TE>   After going one for 12 in the first three games, Lofton is six for
10 with four runs scored and the two RBI in the last two. The Giants
have pounded 28 hits and scored 20 runs in that span.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Kenny was in that little [slump] to start, but he's a
strong individual," Sanders said. "I didn't expect him to stay in it
long."</TE>
<TE>   Neither did hitting instructor Gene Clines, who worked closely
with Lofton while he was struggling. A couple of mechanical
adjustments produced big results, Clines said.</TE>
<TE>   "He really didn't make many adjustments, just a few mechanical
things that he needed to," Clines said. "Kenny is a veteran
ballplayer who has been in this situation before in his career. This
is nothing new to him; you just have to get it corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we just worked on Kenny staying within himself. We
worked on him trying not to do too much, and for him that means
keeping the ball out of the air. He's a much better hitter when he
hits line drives. That's what he's doing now."</TE>
<TE>   And the Giants are definitely appreciative.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great leadoff guy and everyone knows that," Schmidt said
of the six-time All-Star. "When you come out and did what he did, the
way he got us going, it takes pressure off of the whole team.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it easier for guys to go out there and just focus on
throwing strikes. I struggled a little bit, but the offense really
picked us up and he got it started."</TE>
<TE>   That's why General Manager Brian Sabean acquired Lofton from the
Chicago White Sox on July 28.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to improve at the top of the order, and he's definitely
helped this club," Sabean said.</TE>

<KH>COMMENTARY / ROGER KAHN</KH>
<HD>Bonds Not Necessarily Chip Off His Godfather</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER KAHN</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If I had to use a single word to describe Barry Bonds, that word
would be forbidding. He marches toward home plate expressionless and
menacing, armed with his magic maple bat and a tiny cross dangling
from one ear. Is he inwardly singing "Onward Christian Soldiers?" I
don't know. Possibly nobody knows.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds looks as if he means to mash the pitcher and the baseball;
chances are splendid that he will. Bonds hits homers more frequently
than he smiles in public. He essentially ignores the media. His motto
might come from a war cry, also forbidding, from American
Revolutionary days: Don't tread on me.</LD>
<LD>   Why, some wonder, can't Bonds buy a round for the boys (and girls)
in the press box, in the manner of his great predecessor, Babe Ruth?
Why won't he throw them good quotes in the style of another great
predecessor, Reggie Jackson, the human quote machine? Bonds is as
cold and remote, some say, as is his godfather, Willie Mays.</LD>
<TE>   At this point, to use a phrase I learned from Joe DiMaggio, the
Doge of San Francisco, I have to say, "Stop right there!" Mays may be
remote to strangers, dunces and bigots -- his life has not been easy
-- but if you earn Willie's trust and friendship, you will have won a
jewel of extraordinary worth.</TE>
<TE>   Willie and I go back 48 years, to spring training, 1954, when the
New York Giants, coming off a fifth-place finish, looked dreary. Mays
was far away, finishing an Army stint, but he would be discharged
early in March. Meanwhile, the Giants' establishment was assaulting
me with such extravagant descriptions of Mays' talents that I finally
composed a skeptical feature for the late and sainted New York Herald
Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "Willie is 10 feet nine inches tall," I wrote. "He leaps 15 feet
straight up. Nobody can hit a baseball over his head. Willie throws
sidearm from the Polo Grounds to Pittsburgh. Willie's speed is
deceptive. The best evidence indicates he is one step faster than
electricity...." Creative folk at the Trib illustrated the piece with
a cleverly distorted photo that made Mays appear gigantic.</TE>
<TE>   I had my laugh, and then, after a long flight -- prop planes in
those days -- Willie walked into the Giants' camp in Phoenix. The one
word for what happened next is sunburst. The Giants weren't gray
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Leo Durocher, with his sure sense of drama, kept Mays out
of that day's intersquad game until the fifth inning. Willie squirmed
and paced in the dugout. When Durocher sent him in to pinch-hit,
Willie hit a 420-foot home run. He stayed on to play center field and
an inning later ran an Arizona mile toward right, speared a line
drive, whirled and doubled the runner at first.</TE>
<TE>   The inning after that a big country boy named Joe Cephus "Cash"
Taylor blasted a tremendous wallop to dead center. Mays galloped
perhaps 75 feet straight back and caught the ball over his shoulder,
a simply amazing catch. "May I point out," said the late Chub Feeney,
the Giants' general manager, "that Willie doesn't like airplanes
much. He's playing at this level on zero hours sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Sal Maglie, the great pressure pitcher said, "Hey, with the kid
back, all I gotta do is keep the ball in the ballpark." As he spoke,
Sal smiled. Like Bonds, Maglie did not smile in public every day. So
it finally turned out that in my skepticism I had been correct.
Willie really was 10 feet 9 inches tall.</TE>
<TE>   After a bit the Giants and the Cleveland Indians flew to Las Vegas
for an exhibition and then the Giant group was invited to a big hotel
for free food and entertainment. Willie and I sat in a small theater
where Robert Merrill burst into "Vesti la giubba," the gorgeous aria
from Pagliacci, where the clown sings of having to make people laugh
although his own heart is breaking. Merrill gave it full voice and
all his passion. When Merrill was done, Willie turned to me amid the
cheering. "You know," he said, quite moved, "That's a very nice
song."</TE>
<TE>   Horror awaited us. We drifted into the casino, where Monte Irvin
and Whitey Lockman were fighting a one-armed bandit and Maglie,
glowering like a movie mafioso, was losing at blackjack, 50 cents a
game. Mays moved toward a dice table and after a while I said, "How
you doing, Will?"</TE>
<TE>   His eyes sparkled, as they would when he joked, and he said, "I'm
just learning the game." Abruptly a short, thick-shouldered thug of a
man said, "Get your friend away from the dice tables."</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "You heard me. Get him away from the nice tables. We don't want
him mixing with the white guests."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know who is?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. I know who he is. He's a ..... Get that ... away from the
white guests."</TE>
<TE>   Soon we were shouting. The man using the racial epithet was armed.
At length I said slowly, "I am now going to reach for my wallet."</TE>
<TE>   I did and pulled out my press card.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank you," I said, very agitated and still speaking
very loudly, "for giving me a great story for the Sunday New York
Herald Tribune."</TE>
<TE>   The thug vanished and hotel executives emerged from the woodwork
begging to make me forget what happened and to spend the night. I
tramped out to the Giant bus. Mays sat near the front, seeming to
sleep. Monte Irvin motioned for me to sit with him in the back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my place to tell you what to do," Irvin said, "but I
want to ask you not to write this story. Willie isn't Jackie
Robinson. He's a 23-year-old kid without much formal education. If
you write what just happened, there could be an explosion and, you
know, Willie isn't up to handling that."</TE>
<TE>   I said, "What just happened, Monte? I'm not aware of anything just
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Monte punched me in the shoulder and we were men together. I
didn't write the Willie story for many years. Mays, of course, went
on to become the prince of ballplayers and we kept in loose touch.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the Catch and the Throw against Vic Wertz when the
no-longer-dreary 1954 Giants swept the World Series from the
Cleveland Indians. I met Willie's Dad, "Kitty-Kat Mays," formally
known as William Howard Mays Sr. During the days when many black
people routinely voted Republican, in homage to Abraham Lincoln, Mr.
Mays was named for William Howard Taft, the fattest president in
history. Willie's true full name is William Howard Mays Jr. His dad
was working as a checkout clerk in a Harlem supermarket and he told
me he was just as good a ballplayer as his son, except he didn't have
the hands. Willie's huge hands, Kitty-Kat said, came from his mother.</TE>
<TE>   This is subjective, but the Willie I remember ran down fly balls
better than anyone else, hit for average or power depending on what
was needed, and threw and ran superbly, all combining into the best
baseball player who ever lived. Gil Hodges Jr., son of the noble old
Dodger, told me recently, "My dad used to tell me he couldn't believe
how great Willie was." Willie doesn't like to say that, but he knows
it. I was at some function with him and Willie relaxed and said to
me, "You know, nobody knew how great you could play this game
baseball till I showed them." To some that may be arrogance. To me it
is something else. Fact.</TE>
<TE>   I visited Mays -- I wanted help on a book I was writing -- not so
many years ago. He lives in Atherton, a Northern California village
of large homes, tall redwoods and stout eucalyptus trees with peeling
bark. The month I visited, the San Jose Mercury News was reporting
that the recent sale price average of Atherton homes was $1,669,833.</TE>
<TE>   "Come in," Willie said, at the door. "It's been a while."</TE>
<TE>   He led me down a corridor lined with autographed photos of
presidents and a miscellany of celebrities. The first President Bush
had written, "To Willie Mays, from his longtime and steadfast fan."
Old George had played some varsity first base at Yale. If you knew
the game, and Old George did, watching Willie play it made you
humble.</TE>
<TE>   We talked a bit about beginnings, growing up poor in racist
Alabama. Willie asked if I had ever had, as my main meal of the day,
a sugar sandwich. He said his best sport was football, not baseball,
and that when he was 16 he could throw a jump pass 60 yards. He had
wanted to ride a football scholarship to a good college, but none was
offered. There was no place in all the terrain of white academia for
a great young quarterback who happened to be black.</TE>
<TE>   So it was baseball. Word of Mays' talent spread and, more or less
to appease liberal ticket buyers, both the Yankees and the Red Sox
scouted him. They each turned him down. That's like the New York
Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony turning down Heifetz because he
was Jewish. A parallel rap worked against Mays. He was not as white
as Williams or DiMaggio.</TE>
<TE>   After the Giants signed Willie he played at Trenton and then
Minneapolis in the American Assn. Here is a bit of scout Hank
DeBerry's scouting report, filed on May 10, 1951: "Sensational.... He
has made the most spectacular catches.... Runs ands throws with the
very best.... This player is the best prospect in America. It was a
banner day for the Giants when this kid Mays was signed."</TE>
<TE>   In Atherton we moved to the Catch. Willie remembers that first
game of the 1954 Series: "It's the eighth inning, Cleveland has Larry
Doby on second and I'm playing shallow because I don't want Doby
scoring on a single. One run could be the ballgame. The ballgame
could be the Series.</TE>
<TE>   "Wertz hits it. Solid sound. I learned a lot from the sound of the
ball on the bat. I'm going back, a long way back, but there is never
any doubt in my mind. I am going to catch this ball."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think you would," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't matter what you think," Willie said, quite pleasantly.
Lest he offend, he poured me a bit of vintage scotch. "Catching it
wasn't the problem. The problem was Doby on second. On a deep fly to
center at the Polo Grounds, a runner could score all the way from
second. I've done that myself more than once. So if I make the catch
-- which I will -- and Larry scored from second, they still get the
run that puts them ahead. All the time I'm running back, I'm
thinking, 'Willie, you've got to get this ball back to the infield.'</TE>
<TE>   "I run 50, 75 yards, right to the warning track, and I take the
ball a little toward my left shoulder. Because I want all my momentum
to go into the throw."</TE>
<TE>   Mays looked at me intently. "Are you following this? To keep my
momentum working for me, I have to turn very hard and throw the ball
from exactly the point that I caught it. That's what I did. All the
while I was running back I was planning my throw [which would travel
330 feet.] Then the sportswriters wrote, I made the throw by
instinct."</TE>
<TE>   Do I have to explain a bit? Perhaps. What Willie is saying, if you
know how to listen, is that Michael Jordan did not come out of a rain
forest shooting jumpers, Jim Brown didn't learn to run in the Belgian
Congo and, instinct hell, Willie Mays knows how to think. How much
American history, I wondered, has been etched by bigotry. So now we
have Bonds. He can't run with his godfather or throw with him, but he
can hit like a tornado. And the mostly white reporters who dismissed
his godfather as a simpleton are still there.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Christmas, Willie sent me an autographed picture of
the catch, saying, at last, that he knew what I had done in Las Vegas
five decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "How did you know, Will?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you told Monte. Maybe Monte told Leo. Maybe Leo told me."</TE>
<TE>   The picture hangs in my small Hall of Fame, where the Catskill
Mountains and the Shawangunks intersect. Willie's picture gleams
there along with books signed to me by Jack Dempsey, Jackie Robinson
and Robert Frost. Mays inscribed it, "To my friend, Roger. Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   So that is the sullen Willie Mays. My own Hall of Fame is smaller
than the one at Cooperstown, but more exclusive. No, Pete Rose will
never enter, nor will A. Bartlett Giammati. What about the
godfather's kid, Barry Bonds, the forbidding slugger? Take a breath
and let me answer you in, oh say, 48 years.</TE>

<TE>   The "Say Hey" Saga</TE>
<TE>   Some of the highlights of Willie Mays' major league career:</TE>
<TE>   1951 -- Broke in with the New York Giants and was named the
National League rookie of the year after batting .274 with 20 home
runs and 68 runs batted in for the league champions.</TE>
<TE>   1954 -- After missing one season and most of another due to
military service, returned to lead the Giants to another pennant and
win MVP honors with 41 home runs, 110 RBIs and a .345 batting
average. His catch on Vic Wertz's long drive to center field in the
Polo Grounds is arguably the most famous defensive play in World
Series history, as he led the Giants to a four-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   1955 -- Became seventh player to hit 50 home runs in a season. His
51 home runs and 127 RBIs would each wind up as the second-best of
his career.</TE>

finishes season with 40 home runs, 123 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   1962 -- Leads Giants to the World Series for the third time, with
a league-leading 49 home runs and 141 RBIs. His game-winning home run
in the season finale got the Giants into a tie for first with the
Dodgers, whom they defeated in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   1965 -- Won second MVP award, leading the league with a
career-high 52 home runs and a .645 slugging average. Hit the 500th
home run of his career on Sept. 13 at the Astrodome in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   1968 -- Named MVP of the All-Star game and wins the last of his 12
consecutive Gold Glove awards.</TE>
<TE>   1969 -- Hit the 600th home run of his career as a pinch-hitter
against San Diego on Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   1972 -- In the twilight of his career, returns to New York in a
trade to the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   1973 -- Plays in the World Series for Mets against Oakland in his
final season.</TE>
<TE>   1979 -- Elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of
eligibility.</TE>

<HD>Baker's Status With Giants Is as Clear as Dust</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It would hit Dusty Baker when he woke up Thursday morning, then not
again. Fleeting, he would say. Sort of like the starting stint by the
Angels' Jarrod Washburn in Game 5 of the World Series Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants built a 6-0 lead against Washburn after
two innings and went on to a 16-4 embarrassment.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants now need one more victory to provide Baker with the
champagne for a possible farewell party.</LD>
<TE>   Is Baker leaving? Is his 10-year tenure at the Giants' helm about
to end. Is the crazy managerial merry-go-round soon to stop at his
door?</TE>
<TE>   For now, there might be more clarity to a San Francisco fog bank.</TE>
<TE>   For now ... well, the thought was there when he got up Thursday
morning that Game 5 might be his last as the Giants' manager in
Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I just forgot about it," he said. "This is no time to
get melancholy right now. This is a time for us to push to the finish
line."</TE>
<TE>   As the Giants draw closer, as one managerial option after another
closes for Baker (would he really have found that fractious New York
Mets' situation appealing?), as vacancies with the Chicago Cubs and
Seattle Mariners (who may be unwilling to meet his price) seem the
only possible alternatives to returning to the Giants and a
potentially strained relationship with managing general partner Peter
Magowan, it has become harder for Baker and club officials to avoid
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Before Game 5, General Manager Brian Sabean, expressing annoyance
at times, said that what "nobody has been able to comprehend" is that
the only reason Baker's status hasn't been resolved is because his
own hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's ever said that we didn't want Dusty Baker to manage this
ballclub, including Peter Magowan," Sabean said. "It's just that in
sports, especially baseball, why would you sign a manager long term
if you didn't know who he's going to be working with? It's just not
done. So until I'm resolved, either being here or going off in the
sunset, the manager's situation" won't be.</TE>
<TE>   Having sustained a contending team amid comparatively restrictive
budget parameters, the respected Sabean will receive a new contract
as soon as the Giants are done playing, after which, Magowan
reiterated Thursday, Baker's situation will be resolved within seven
to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   If it isn't clear how, it seems certain he will be offered a
chance to return, providing he does not ask for the house, a person
familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   Does he want to return? Does he think 10 years may be enough, as
he suggested in a pre-Series interview? Does he think that his
relationship with Magowan, exacerbated in the spring when Baker felt
the owner created "undue pressure" by saying this was a World
Series-caliber team, a team without holes, is beyond repair? Would he
really consider sacrificing his Bay Area popularity, friendships and
fishing holes for the Cubs?</TE>
<TE>   Said Sabean, referring to the Magowan and Baker portrayal: "It
aggravates me that it's made so personal. Most of it is tabloid bull
because I deal with both people.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Magowan doesn't rail on Dusty Baker when I'm talking to
Peter Magowan and Dusty Baker doesn't rail on Peter Magowan when I
talk to Dusty Baker."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but there are people who believe Baker will not return
unless issues with Magowan are talked out, and that Sabean is putting
a good face on it when he suggests it all stems from a "classic
example of bad timing."</TE>
<TE>   "Peter was absolutely, positively right ... to say what he said in
spring training," Sabean said. "He's the owner of the team and he was
excited about spending the money. As it turned out, the timing wasn't
right because of what Dusty was going through" in his recovery from
prostate cancer surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the only reason that Dusty took it personally,"
Sabean said. "But Dusty knows if you're the second-highest paid
manager and you spend $75 million [on payroll] and we've been close
other times, expectation isn't bad. It [was] just poor timing."</TE>
<TE>   So be it, but isn't timing everything?</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't Baker know that with eight players in his starting lineup
over 30, with the possibility that Jeff Kent, who homered twice in
Game 5 and is the only second baseman to drive in 100 or more runs
for six consecutive seasons, eligible for free agency, that this
could be, as Sabean acknowledged, a "last chance" for this nucleus
and that there may be a younger and more promising core in Chicago or
elsewhere? Isn't it possible that he may be ready for that new
challenge?</TE>
<TE>   For now, there are far more questions than answers. Baker is still
employed by the Giants, still seeking that one more win, after which
Sabean seemed to suggest he will do some arm twisting, reminding
Baker of the "quality of life and culture" he may find hard to
duplicate and which he has helped create with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "Has this been Dusty's best year?" Sabean said rhetorically. "He
does a great job every year with a changing roster. He never
complains, never makes my job harder. His teams play hard and are
almost always in a position to win. I don't know what more you can
ask."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Fregosi, a Bay Area native who was a former assistant to
Sabean, is the speculated successor if Baker leaves, but from Barry
Bonds to the 25th player, virtually every Giant has spoken up during
the postseason, citing Baker's popularity, his importance to the
fabric of the team, the hope he will be back.</TE>
<TE>   There was more of that in the clubhouse after the Game 5
annihilation of the Angels, but Baker reiterated that he would not
lapse into melancholy, that the victory and the Series lead
accompanying it simply represented a great way to end the Pac Bell
phase of their 2002 schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Where he will be in 2003 can wait. He has one more stop in
Anaheim, where the champagne will be on ice.</TE>

<LD>Whether it's because of the Angels' unwillingness to pitch to Barry
Bonds or the regional aspect of this World Series, it remains on a
record-low pace in the ratings game.</LD>
<LD>   Game 4 Wednesday night got an 11.8 Nielsen rating with a 19 share,
which translates into 18.1 million viewers.</LD>
<LD>   That's a 9% increase over Game 3 but a 25% decrease from the
15.8/27 for the New York Yankees' 4-3, extra-inning victory over
Arizona in Game 4 last year.</LD>
<TE>   The last time there was a regional Series, Fox got a 12.5 rating
for Game 4 in 2000 between the Yankees and New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   That Series ended up with a 12.4 average, the lowest for a
prime-time World Series.</TE>
<TE>   This year's four-game average is an 11.0/19, which is 24% below
the four-game average of 14.4/24 last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' 4-3 victory over the Angels in Game 4 at Pacific Bell
Park got a 34.6 rating in San Francisco and a 30.7 in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Appier Is on the Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>After a shaky Game 2 stint only made better by Ortiz's even
rougher outing, he'll start the biggest game of year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>On the right arm of pitcher Kevin Appier, the Angels' World Series
hopes now rest.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about a wing and a prayer.</LD>
<LD>   If that right wing of Appier's doesn't flap any better than it did
in Game 2 against the San Francisco Giants, the Angels won't have a
prayer. Unless, of course, the Angel offense takes flight like it did
last Sunday in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   The Giants beat the Angels, 16-4, in Game 5 before a Pacific Bell
Park crowd of 42,713 Thursday night to take a 3-2 advantage in the
best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   The series shifts to Edison Field for Game 6 on Saturday, and
unless Appier can stem the flow of hits and runs that poured off
Giant bats in Game 5, San Francisco will likely win its first World
Series title since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "We're backed into a corner now," Appier said. "Obviously, we were
hoping to avoid something like this, but we still have two wins under
our belt. Granted, our chances are not as good as they were a couple
of days ago. That's an extremely tough team we're playing. But we've
won two in a row before. We're not defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Neither was Appier in Game 2. He was whipped, but he didn't take a
loss, because the Angels battered Russ Ortiz, who will start Game 6
for the Giants, for seven runs on nine hits in 1 2/3 innings and came
back to win the slugfest, 11-10.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels staked Appier to a 5-0 lead with a five-run outburst in
the first inning, but Appier gave up four runs in the top of the
second, three on Reggie Sanders' home run, which came on an 0-and-2
pitch, and one on David Bell's solo home run.</TE>
<TE>   Appier then gave up a solo home run to Jeff Kent in the third
inning and was pulled after walking Barry Bonds. His final line for
the 48-pitch outing: five runs on five hits, two walks and two
strikeouts in two innings.</TE>
<TE>   "My problem the other day was execution," Appier said. "It wasn't
that many pitches I didn't execute on, they just jumped all over my
mistakes. I've got to go over the game plan, and hope my stuff and
execution are better."</TE>
<TE>   If the first World Series appearance in their 42-year history ends
in disappointment, the Angels may blame their rotation.</TE>
<TE>   In five games, Angel starters have given up 24 earned runs on 33
hits, including eight home runs, in 24 innings for a 9.00 earned-run
average. Left-hander Jarrod Washburn, the Angel ace who seems to
thrive on big-game pressure, was rocked for six runs in four innings
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Give those guys credit," Appier said of the Giants. "They came in
hot, and they've put up some ridiculous power numbers in the
postseason. We haven't found a way to put together a really solid
start against them. Hopefully, that will change."</TE>
<TE>   Appier, acquired from the New York Mets for first baseman Mo
Vaughn last winter, has some experience pitching in do-or-die
situations. In Game 5 of the American League division series against
the New York Yankees, Appier, then an Oakland Athletics pitcher,
allowed one run in four innings of relief in a 7-5 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw real well in that game, so hopefully that experience will
help Saturday night," Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Thursday night's game got out of hand when the Giants
scored 10 runs in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings, things may
have turned out differently had the Angels capitalized on a key
scoring opportunity in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trimmed a 6-0 deficit to 6-3 with three runs in the
fifth, and Bengie Molina's single and Benji Gil's double put runners
on second and third with no outs in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein grounded to short, Molina scoring to make it 6-4,
but Darin Erstad was tagged out after tapping a weak roller toward
first, and Tim Salmon, given the green light on a 3-and-0 pitch from
Felix Rodriguez, grounded out to third.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants came out tonight ... wow, what can you say?" Erstad
said. "They had it going on. But whether you lose by one or 12, it's
a loss. We've got to keep battling, turn the page and get ready for
Saturday ... It would make a good story if we won two games, wouldn't
it?"</TE>

<HD>He Makes Sure All's Safe at Home</HD>
<DH>Snow pulls batboy -- Baker's 3-year-old son -- out of
harm's way on play at plate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.T. Snow should be credited with a save in the Giants' 16-4 victory.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't pitch, but he did catch the Giants' 3-year-old batboy,
Darren Baker, near home plate and carry him out of harm's way in the
seventh inning.</LD>
<LD>   After a Kenny Lofton triple, Baker -- son of Giant Manager Dusty
-- ran out of the dugout to retrieve the bat while Snow was crossing
the plate and David Bell was running home from third. If Snow hadn't
acted quickly, Darren might have found himself in Bell's path.</LD>
<TE>   "When I looked down [after scoring], I saw just a little kind of
flash behind me," Snow said. "Darren does such a great job of going
out, getting the bats, he's so eager all the time. I realized it was
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a 4 1/2-year-old son of my own at home. I know how to get
hold of them when they're running away. I reached down. Luckily, I
grabbed him by the collar of the jacket as he was crossing home
plate. I just didn't want him to get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "His eyes were huge. I don't think he knew what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Angel catcher Bengie Molina was concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to get the kid too," he said. "I knew he would get hurt
if the play continued. But J.T. got to him before me."</TE>
<TE>   The moment Dusty Baker reached his office after the game, the
phone rang. Congratulations? No, it was his mother, calling to scold
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the play unfold, and I was thinking about what my mom told
me about," he said. "She said, 'He shouldn't be out there; he's gonna
get hurt.' I said, 'Mom, I know what I'm doing.'</TE>
<TE>   "First call I got when I got back to the clubhouse was my mom to
tell me, 'I know you listen to me sometimes; just listen to me this
time.' "</TE>
<TE>   The only games the Giants have lost in this World Series were the
ones in which Darren wasn't in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "Darren's going to Anaheim," Baker said. "A couple of guys said
that if he doesn't go, they don't go. So he's going to Anaheim."</TE>

<HD>Puerto Rico Might Be Next 'Home' for Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As many as 20 Montreal Expo home games could be moved to Puerto Rico
next year under a plan baseball officials discussed Thursday before
Game 5 of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, management and union officials discussed the
possibility of moving the season-opening series between the Seattle
Mariners and Athletics from Oakland to Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioner's office operates the Expos on behalf of the
other 29 teams, which bought the franchise earlier this year from
Jeffrey Loria, who purchased the Florida Marlins. Baseball officials
want to move the team from Montreal, where the Expos drew only
812,000 fans this season, but have pretty much ruled out a relocation
for 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Charlotte, N.C., Portland, Ore., and Washington, have also been
considered for Expo home games, but the focus is on Hiram Bithorn
Stadium in San Juan, one lawyer familiar with the discussions said
Thursday on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The shift of games was discussed Thursday during a meeting that
included Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer; Rob Manfred,
the owners' top labor lawyer; and three officials of the players'
association.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez won the Hank Aaron award for the
second consecutive year, with broadcasters voting them the best
hitters in their leagues this season.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit a major league-best .370 with 46 homers and 110 runs
batted in for the San Francisco Giants. He also set records with 198
walks and 68 intentional passes.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, the Texas Ranger shortstop, led the majors with 57
homers and 142 RBIs and batted .300.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal closer Jason Isringhausen had surgery on his
right shoulder that could limit his availability early next season.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctor George Paletta said the operation was a "cleanup" of
the shoulder. During the procedure, a small tear was discovered in
the labrum, which lines the shoulder socket, but Paletta said the
rotator cuff was sound.</TE>
<TE>   Isringhausen had 32 saves and a 2.48 earned-run average for the
National League Central champions.</TE>
<TE>   But down the stretch, he was unable to pitch on consecutive days,
it took him longer to get loosened up in the bullpen and he couldn't
warm up multiple times during a game.</TE>
<TE>   Isringhausen also was sidelined twice during the second half of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   He will wear a sling for two to four weeks and probably will need
to catch up when spring training begins.</TE>

<HD>Lacking Real Rivalry, It's Not Fine Whine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With apologies to the late, great Herb Caen, newspaper columnist and
Bay Area icon, Thomas Bonk reports on the scene in San Francisco with
the World Series in town.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   SAN FRANCISCO -- It is an indisputable fact that the fine citizens
of this city are voracious readers ... usually of menus and wine
lists in fine restaurants. Sadly, this is not the case with our
neighbors to the south, according to one local expert, who spent a
year in Anaheim last week.</LD>
<TE>   "Did you know," says political satirist and stand-up comic Will
Durst, "that in Southern California, tanning booths outnumber
bookstores, 2-1?"</TE>
<TE>   One possible solution: the combination tanning booth-bookstore.
Why hasn't someone thought of this before? All it would require is
hauling in a few tanning beds and City Lights becomes Ultraviolet
Lights.</TE>
<TE>   But we digress.... Durst takes his Giants seriously, so seriously
in fact that he has sold his jokes and used a portion of the proceeds
to buy season tickets each year since 1985. Without fail, he
schedules only Bay Area appearances in October, just in case the
Giants are in the World Series. So far, non-World Series years
outnumber Durst's dream years, 16-2.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-core fan that Durst is, though, the Giants' World Series
opponent, the Angels, has not caused his blood pressure to boil,
percolate or even simmer. He says he simply cannot hate the Angels
very much because, sadly, he feels no real animosity in return.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of a feud is, they have to hate us back," Durst says.
"Maybe they hate us now. We would be glad to have them back in a
feud. You can't beat a vacuum. You can't throttle a shadow."</TE>
<TE>   Passing parade: Orange and black pennants congratulating the
Giants hang from the light poles on Market Street as cable cars
scuttle past, scraping out a rhythm on the tracks, bells ringing....
The signs read "Go Giants" in the windows of each city bus ($1 to
ride, which makes the run home a lot cheaper than a World Series
ticket to see a home run).... The WaterBarge in Vallejo and a special
World Series menu featuring Giant shrimp and Angel hair pasta.</TE>
<TE>   In another assault on the pocketbook, the toll to cross the Golden
Gate Bridge was recently raised from $3 to $5. Drivers pay the fee as
they enter the city, not on their way out, and San Franciscans
consider the charge something like the price of admission. Of course,
the prevailing local opinion is that there is nothing lovelier than
the sweeping skyline of the City. Some say the only thing good about
Oakland is that the citizens across the bay have a better view of the
City than they do. To remedy this slight, a giant mirror strung
across the top deck of the Bay Bridge to reflect the city back those
who love it best has been suggested. We think they were only kidding.</TE>
<TE>   The people at the California Division of Tourism keep themselves
busy by studying where visitors go when they want to spend their
hard-earned money. That is, after they pay the $5 admission fee at
the Golden Gate toll booth.</TE>
<TE>   Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 are always near the top of the list,
possibly because of the presence of the Silver Guy, who paints
himself silver from the top of his hat to the soles of his shoes and
stands motionless on top of a plastic crate, waiting for tips.</TE>
<TE>   He has competition from the Gold Guy, whose act is similar to the
Silver Guy's, as you might expect, although Gold Guy clearly outranks
Silver Guy in the precious-metals market.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the Bush Man, who provides a distinctly unsettling
experience for those caught unaware of his act, which consists
entirely of crouching behind a clutch of leafy branches and leaping
out with a yell. Broadway will surely sweep him away any day now to
star in a one-man revue. Many a bread bowl full of steaming clam
chowder has been launched skyward because of the Bush Man.</TE>
<TE>   The Wax Museum, called the Wax Museum because there are 235
figures made of wax and presented museum style, is a bargain at
$12.95. You would have to cross the Golden Gate Bridge three times
for equal value. No smoking is allowed, naturally.</TE>
<TE>   Among the wax museum's attractions are a presidents' section, a
chamber of horrors and a King Tut exhibit. Sports stars represented
include Joe Montana and Willie Mays. Negotiations are under way for a
wax figure of Barry Bonds. Museum officials apparently are waiting
only for Bonds to stop long enough to allow experts to measure him
for a wax form. If Bonds moved any slower around the bases after his
home runs, there would be plenty of time.</TE>
<TE>   Giant fan Bob Sarlatte shows up for each World Series game at
Pacific Bell Park wearing the same clean Giants' tie. Clearly, he is
a more accomplished hot dog eater than most because he has been able
to avoid the dreaded mustard plop. Sarlatte, who wrote jokes for
David Letterman, is the public address announcer for the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   A fan of long standing, Sarlatte preferred Candlestick Park as the
home of the Giants, despite its inadequacies.</TE>
<TE>   "It got so cold one night, the guy sitting next to me had a
corncob pipe, a button nose and two eyes made out of coal," he says.
"When the wind kicked up and the fog rolled in, you would see the
center fielder cutting open a caribou to stay warm."</TE>
<TE>   There is a different class of fans at Pac Bell Park, he says,
"talking about stock options, a wine-and-cheese crowd, not knowing
anything about baseball."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, they can probably read menus just fine. And,
waiter, make mine a double.</TE>

<KH>BETWEEN THE LINES DEAN CHANCE</KH>
<HD>Forget About It Is Best Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN CHANCE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at the age of 23, he won
the Cy Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11
shutouts and 15 complete games. He was also a 20-game winner with
Minnesota in 1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a
boxing promoter, is guest analyst for The Times for this World
Series.</LD>
<LD>   If I was still with the Angels, the first thing I would tell them
is to just forget about Thursday's game. Absolutely forget about it.</LD>
<LD>   The Angel pitchers are facing a great offense and they are just
not making the pitches, especially [Ben] Weber. He has got to keep
the ball down and hit the corners.</LD>
<TE>   Now I know [Manager Mike] Scioscia is going to get some criticism
for keeping Jarrod Washburn in there for four innings, but, I gotta
say, I would have stuck with him too. It was just too early to take
him out. Does Scioscia have anybody better in the bullpen? No. This
guy proved himself all year.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to hear all this talk about the ball being juiced,
either. That always seems to come up when a team scores a lot of
runs. Look, let's give the Giants some credit. They have some very
good hitters who were making some very good guesses on which pitches
were coming Thursday night. And that's the key to good hitting.</TE>
<TE>   I recall one night when Joe Adcock was playing for us with the
Angels and he comes up with the bases loaded against Stu Miller, who
was then pitching for the Baltimore Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Now if you remember Miller, you remember he didn't throw very
hard.</TE>
<TE>   Adcock is standing at the plate and here comes strike one right
down the middle and he doesn't flinch a muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Here comes strike two and he doesn't take the bat off his
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Here comes strike three. And he still doesn't move.</TE>
<TE>   Adcock comes back to the dugout and he tells us, "Boys, I guessed
wrong every time."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the Giants didn't guess wrong much Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   So now Scioscia has to hand the ball to Kevin Appier. It would be
nice if he could hand it to Sandy Koufax, somebody who could totally
shut the other team down, but the Angels don't have anybody like
that. So Appier has to give them five, six good innings. And then you
give the ball to [Francisco] Rodriguez and then you give the ball to
[Troy] Percival. And if you get beat with those guys, you get beat.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, there are 28 other teams that would like to be where the
Angels are. All they have to do is win two games at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels know the Giants. The Giants know the Angels. There are
no secrets at this stage in a World Series. You are what you are.</TE>

<KH>GIANT NOTES</KH>
<HD>General Manager Sounds Like He's Staying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From Staff Reports</LD>
<LD>   In strong comments Thursday about his future with the San
Francisco Giants, General Manager Brian Sabean said he probably
couldn't find a "greener pasture."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm aware of what's going on in the world," said Sabean, whose
contract expires after the World Series. "The pot of gold or whatever
might be in the outside world, but I know anywhere I go I'm not going
to have more autonomy, authority or latitude than I have here. And
that says a lot."</LD>
<TE>   Owner Peter Magowan last Saturday said a decision on Sabean,
considered one of baseball's top executives, could come "a day or
two" after the Giants' final game. Many clubs are expected to pursue
Sabean, who was promoted to general manager in 1997 and is credited
with much of the Giants' success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gratifying," Sabean said. "It makes you understand that if
you do work hard and you're not worried about your next job, because
of the effort it takes to worry about the job you have, in the end it
pays off.</TE>
<TE>   "But don't be naive enough to think that a general manager can or
should be in the same [light] as somebody that's in uniform. If you
take yourself too seriously you're going to end up flat on your [rear
end]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Goodwin needed a boost after the Dodgers released him out of
spring training this season.</TE>
<TE>   "You get low," he said. "You begin to doubt yourself and whether
you can still play this game."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants believed in Goodwin, who was on the Dodger payroll for
$3.5 million this season, signing the eight-year veteran for the
minimum salary of $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a wise investment.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin played in 78 games, batting .260 with 16 stolen bases in
18 attempts. He had two game-winning hits against the Dodgers, whom
the Giants held off for the NL wild-card berth.</TE>
<TE>   "</TE>
<TE>   It is a question that must be asked, even though the reporter
thinks he knows the answer he'll get.</TE>
<TE>   As a free agent after this season, Giant second baseman Jeff Kent
figures to be in great demand by many clubs, perhaps the Dodgers
among them. San Francisco was not thought to be high on Kent's list
of favorites.</TE>
<TE>   So you ask Kent where he thinks he's going.You figure he'll either
politely decline to answer or bark at you for asking.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Kent was not only receptive, but candid.</TE>
<TE>   "This throws a new wrinkle into it," he said of reaching the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   It has, he says, made him start thinking seriously about staying
with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "This creates an environment," he said, "that I've never tasted
before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kent isn't the only one who has been perceived as ready to leave
the Giants when this World Series ends. Manager Dusty Baker, whose
contract is up, is headed to the Seattle Mariners without a second
thought, several sources have said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker admitted that, when he realized Thursday he could be
managing his last game at Pacific Bell Park in a Giant uniform, he
felt a tinge of sadness.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about it this morning when I woke up," he said. "After
that, I just forgot about it. This is no time to get melancholy. This
is the time for us to push to the finish line."</TE>

<LD>One was their ace. The other was their MVP.</LD>
<LD>   Jarrod Washburn and Garret Anderson entered October at the front
of the giddy, high-stepping Angel parade.</LD>
<LD>   They left Pacific Bell Park Thursday on their backs, the marchers
dazed, the music a dirge.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels' 16-4 loss to the San Francisco Giants in Game 5 was
about a baseball bromide as old as the look in Mike Scioscia's eyes.</TE>

<TE>   You can fight your way to the top with rally monkeys, but you
cannot own it without lions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the talk about the Angels' whole being greater than the
sum of their parts, there were two parts that needed to be
occasionally stronger than the others.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between the Minnesota Twins and Thursday, those parts
were lost in shipment.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, the staff ace, has been trumped for an 0-2 record and
9.31 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the staff slugger, has come to bat with 22 runners on
base yet driven in just three runs with no extra base hits.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn has unintentionally walked five runners in 9 2/3 innings,
with three of those walks Thursday leading to runs.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson virtually walked to a foul ball in the second inning
that, if he had caught, could have changed the game.</TE>
<TE>   One need not witness the carnage, but simply read that accident
report, to understand why the Angels trail the Giants three games to
two.</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "I just didn't do the job. I have no excuses."</TE>
<TE>   Said Anderson: "I'm just trying not to do too much, because that's
how you get in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Angel fans is that the series returns to Edison
Field for the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that only 33% of the teams in baseball history
have recovered from a similar deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that last year, the Arizona Diamondbacks used
Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling to sweep their two weekend games
against the New York Yankees to win the championship.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is, the Angels must rely on Kevin Appier and Ramon
Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   Maddening and Madder.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, we need something to change the momentum," said
David Eckstein. "We need somebody to make something happen."</TE>
<TE>   That somebody can no longer be Washburn, unless he is able to
throw a heroic Big Unit-type inning or two in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching more innings than he has pitched in his life, it appears
he has hit a wall that cannot be leaped this late.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired, sure, but ask anybody around here and they'll say they
are tired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn came into the playoffs with the most Angel wins (18) and
the lowest ERA (3.15).</TE>
<TE>   He leaves it with a worse portfolio than Chad Zerbe.</TE>
<TE>   But at least there is no doubt that, whatever Washburn had left,
he left it on the field.</TE>
<TE>   With Anderson, unfortunately, there is always that doubt, even in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when he didn't run hard on the bobbled grounder against
the Yankees, an out that could have cost the Angels the game?</TE>
<TE>   It seemed to happen again Thursday, on the first pitch of the
second inning, when Kenny Lofton lifted a foul ball into left-field
foul territory.</TE>
<TE>   Running back from his position at shortstop, Eckstein lunged and
put his glove on the ball. It then fell to the ground before he
somersaulted across the tarp.</TE>
<TE>   All while Anderson was jogging in from left field.</TE>
<TE>   "I just ran as hard as I could," Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Could Anderson have made the play easier?</TE>
<TE>   "I just ran as hard as I could," Eckstein repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who claimed he was not bothered by a reported tender
hamstring, said he could not have caught the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It just fell straight from the sky," he said. "It fell straight
to the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Two pitches later, Lofton singled and started a three-run outburst
that could have been prevented if Anderson made the catch.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson later struck out with two runners on base, adding to the
woes of a player who led the team during the regular season with 123
runs batted in and 344 total bases while finishing second with 29
homers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little out of sync," said batting coach Mickey Hatcher.
"But he's working on it. And he'll get there, you watch. When we need
a big hit, I know he will be there."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can only hope.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said it's going to be tough.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making sure I don't hurt them," he said of Giant pitchers
who apparently aren't giving him much to hit. "But that's the way
it's supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it is.</TE>
<TE>   And it's also supposed to be that great players in big games deal
with it.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' cleanup hitter is dealing with it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' cleanup hitter is not.</TE>
<TE>   Guess which team is on the verge of cleaning up, and guess which
team is not.</TE>

<HD>Kent Leaves Giants Some Parting Gifts</HD>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- If this was his last night at Pac Bell Park, his
last night as a Giant, his last night as an uncomfortable,
confrontational, uneasy but well-matched teammate with Barry Bonds,
then Jeff Kent can walk away proud of his performance.</LD>
<LD>   It might be nice if he walked the Dodgers way. Kent hints that he
wouldn't mind playing in Southern California. The Dodgers could use a
second baseman. Whether they want one who is going to command
substantially more than the $6 million he made this year, one who has
been involved in his share of controversial incidents, who is
considered by some teammates as prickly, is a question for another
day.</LD>
<LD>   On this day Kent, who grew up in Orange County and went to high
school at Huntington Beach Edison and who will file for free agency
as soon as the season is over, hit two home runs, he drove in four
runs, he scored four runs. He was the catalyst in the Giants' 16-4
hammering of the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   His first home run took the fight out of the Angels, who had
gained some momentum and hope after knocking a 6-0 deficit down to
6-4. Kent's blast in the bottom of the sixth, with two outs and Rich
Aurilia on base, caused Ben Weber, the pitcher he clobbered, to drop
his head and the shoulders of all the Angels standing at the dugout
railing to sag, a choreographer's dance line of dejected
high-steppers.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's second blast was just piling on, part of a late-inning
walloping of the Angels' sadly exhausted relief pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   And after leaving Fox announcers at a loss when he refused to be
their postgame guest, Kent sat on the back of a chair in front of his
locker getting a little teary and a bit nostalgic.</TE>
<TE>   While he hasn't said he definitely won't be a Giant next year,
Kent kept saying, "If this was my last game ... " with certainty that
it was instead of hoping that it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was the end," Kent said, "I didn't want to disrespect the
other team, but I wanted to look around and try to let the fans who
have supported me know how much they meant.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was my last game, yeah, there is some nostalgia and,
yeah, I felt that a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Until Wednesday night at Pac Bell, Kent hadn't been having a good
series. He was batting .231 with three hits, one a home run for his
only RBI, against Angel pitching. He was making it easier for the
Angels to intentionally walk Barry Bonds. He was a quiet man in the
corner of the clubhouse, not saying much and not wanting to.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, the off day before the Series started here, Kent had
told the media that he was already reflecting on how he might not be
playing here much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been thinking about that for three weeks now," Kent said,
"ever since we started the playoffs. You think about all the
possibilities but none of them have come true yet."</TE>
<TE>   Kent, 34, is the only second baseman in history to have gathered
100 RBIs or more in six straight seasons. No. 6 was this year. He is
a three-time All-Star. He is one of only four Giants in history to
have six straight 100-RBI seasons. The other three -- Willie Mays,
Mel Ott and Bill Terry -- are in the Hall of Fame and are beloved in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of love has not come to Kent in San Francisco. He has
been Bond's nemesis. There has been animosity -- a fight in the
dugout during a game against San Diego in June was only the most
recent ugliness between the two. There has been jealousy -- both
fought for the 2000 MVP award that Kent won and Kent has felt that
Giant management and some fans have chosen to favor the moody home
run hitter over himself.</TE>
<TE>   And Kent didn't help himself when he may have fudged the reason he
broke a bone in his wrist during spring training and tried to sell
the story that he broke it while washing his truck. Another version
of the story was that he broke it doing tricks on his motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "All that stuff doesn't need to be rehashed," Kent said. "It's
hard to think about all that now. It's hard to think about what comes
next. It's an emotional time right now because we're doing something
special, we're one more win from something special and you forge some
different bonds during a run like this."</TE>
<TE>   While Giant owner Peter Magowan has said that he wants to keep the
nucleus of this Giants team together -- and Kent is part of the
nucleus -- Magowan was also vocally unhappy with Kent after the
broken wrist incident and has expressed reluctance in paying Kent
what he will probably be offered by some other team, say, the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   As Kent continued to talk, the more he said, "If this is my last
game here," his nose and eyes became red. He sniffed a bit, he put
his head down. He put his hands over his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think, if this is my last game," he said, "that I
gave a good effort and did things right, just came out and played the
game and made things happen. That's how I'd want fans here to
remember me, that I was just a guy who came out every day and did
things right and played the game."</TE>

<HD>MTA to Roll Out Mobile Theater</HD>
<DH>The transit agency plans to use a $400,000 portable
multimedia facility to hold free 3-D screenings of light-rail safety
films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After serving the entertainment capital of the world for so long, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority now wants to get into show
business, too.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA's board of directors agreed Thursday to buy a $400,000
portable multimedia theater, once used to showcase television's Power
Rangers, to hold free 3-D film screenings across Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than candy-colored teenage superheroes, the stars of
this road show will be the MTA's Blue and Gold line trains.</LD>
<TE>   Agency staff members are planning to launch a new public education
campaign on light-rail safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Just sending out brochures and fliers isn't what makes an
impression on the community," said Lynda Bybee, deputy officer of
community relations for the transit agency, which hopes to begin the
3-D shows next year. "We want to get folks' attention."</TE>
<TE>   The glitz and cost of the theater, equipped to blast wind and emit
scents for dramatic effect, are raising some eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   It's a high-tech "Punch and Judy" puppet show, said transit
advocate John Walsh of Hollywood. "It's an absolute waste of money."</TE>
<TE>   But others believe it can be a smart investment in public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds so L.A. to have such a show-bizzy thing. It makes me
chuckle," said Roger Christensen, a board member of Train Riders
Assn. of California. "But if it takes bells and whistles and smoke
bombs to make kids aware of the dangers of rail tracks, it's all
worth it."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Line, identified a couple of years ago by the California
Public Utilities Commission as the deadliest rail line in the state,
has had more than 620 accidents and 60 fatalities since it opened in
1990, according to the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Though some deaths are believed to be suicides, most of the
accidents involve vehicles crossing the street-level tracks.</TE>
<TE>   There has been one fatality this year on the Blue Line.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials believe that's due to their stepped up public safety
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Line, which is scheduled to open next summer, will also
intersect streets, prompting concerns that its trains could pose
hazards to pedestrians and cars.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staff members believe the 16-seat theater, which is inside a
double-wide trailer, will take the agency's rail safety message to
the next level by hooking audiences with hold-on-to-your-seat special
effects.</TE>
<TE>   They envision an extravaganza similar to Disneyland's now-defunct
Captain EO ride, in which viewers wearing 3-D glasses, buckled into
computerized armchairs, will move up and down and side to side in
synchronous motion with images projected on a giant screen.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of bopping with Michael Jackson through outer space,
the MTA audience will feel the bumps of a train ride.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed story line for the yet-to-be-written script: the
suspense of a train coming to an emergency stop when a pedestrian or
car suddenly crosses the tracks. There's no word yet on what
train-related odor the MTA plans to reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staff members believe the shows will attract children and
young adults who might tune out conventional safety programs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at what we need to compete against nowadays to get
the attention of a young person, we're competing with Play-Station 2,
with Xbox," said Yoon Ham, a senior community relations officer for
the MTA. "[The theater] will be an effective tool to get the message
across to young people that if you treat a train or rail crossing
with disrespect, there's a chance you'll be killed."</TE>
<TE>   Once staff members obtain board approval, they plan to develop a
storyboard with scenes, Ham said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will likely hire a filmmaker to shoot footage from the
inside and outside of moving trains, with camera angles that capture
the sensory experience of being on the train and crossing the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The virtual reality den, custom-built 18 months ago by
Chatsworth-based Provision Interactive Technologies, toured the
country last year to promote the Power Rangers series and action
figures.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the theater was a featured attraction at an air
show, where riders took simulated fighter-jet flights.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids went nuts when they saw it," said Jeff Vrachen, vice
president of Provision.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has also done promotions for the Cartoon
Network, estimates the cost of a new trailer like this one, now in
storage in Lake View Terrace, exceeds $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA already has funds from a safety grant to buy the
multimedia theater.</TE>
<TE>   "MTA's taken a lot of hits in the past for not being responsive to
the community," said Kymberleigh Richards, spokeswoman for Southern
California Transit Advocates. "This could be good for their image."</TE>
